For people interested in business and the corporate world, this show is simply the best of the best. As one of the former participants of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show: people in business have finally got an audience. The whole idea is perfect; with a group of businessmen competing with each other in business-related tasks in the best place in the world, New York. Donald Trump is great as a boss, although his ego is bigger than the infinity of the whole universe. He also makes a lot of dubious decisions about who to dismiss, which is one of the minuses of the show. <br /> <br /> Season 1: A great season in general, the best season of the "normal". This season was most interested in business skills. Later, the series almost drowned in marketing-related tasks with too many product placements. Great and interesting members in general, with the most enjoyable character in the series: Troy. I know that I'm not the only person who suspects that the episode of Trump's World Tower, where he was fired, was falsified, so that Amy and Nick won this particular task. <br /> <br /> Season 2: Also a great season. The assignments were still in order, and they had many interesting participants. Jen M was terrible and never should have made it to the final, IMO. In addition, this season was the worst shooting in the whole history (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Awful. In fact, I liked the concept of book minds against street minds, but the actors were so terrible (it turned out that Trump also hated actors) that the whole season was a complete disaster. The best moments were the second episode (motel renovation), when Prime Minister Brian was fired, the guy who added nothing but a huge amount of comedic value. <br /> <br /> Season 4: A great season, thanks in large part to the interesting and interesting participants in this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and the total disaster called Toral). The episode “Take me to the meeting room” is one of the absolute classical productions of this show, ending with a well-remembered four-time shooting. Unfortunately, I think that we were robbed in the final “Randall vs. Alla”. I think Trump was afraid that she might win, and prevented it. <br /> <br /> Season 5: A dull season in which there is nothing special. Brent was just embarrassed and obviously only to create drama. The tasks were terrible in general (how to create a connection with the business in general?). I think the best man won, but personally I didn’t care. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I understand why they wanted to try out Los Angeles as a new venue for the show, but looking back it was a mistake. New York will always be the place for this. So many new things have appeared this season, most of which are terrible (for example, the loss of a team forced to sleep outside in tents, for example, the victory over PM continues to be for PM). The tasks were terrible, and Trump also chose the wrong winner. James deserved it without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Season 7 Release Celebrity. Best season ever. Absolutely different rules (for example, the use of rodex), but all the fun and entertainment. The biggest problem was that many of the participants were not real celebrities at all, especially women, where everyone was unknown to me, with the exception of Omaroza, which is a shame for everything she takes part in. It was Gene Simmon's season, but after he had completely fooled himself during Kodak's assignment, another man came out of the shadows: Pierce Morgan. No one has ever dominated the season like him. He suppressed his opponents and also looked like a guy with a great sense of humor (although some anxious Americans (not all Americans, of course, will not misunderstand me), unfortunately, did not have the social skills to understand this). WAY TO GO PIERS !! <br /> <br /> For fans, I highly recommend the British version with the main character Sir Alan Sugar. In fact, the British version is much better, and that says something, because the American (and the original) is really a great show. One of the features of the British version is that the participants usually behave like decent people in the conference room, in contrast to the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the American version.
