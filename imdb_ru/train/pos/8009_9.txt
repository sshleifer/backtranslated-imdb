Ah, real memories. At that time I lived in Holland and looked forward to it every Sunday evening, and then Tuesdays. I saw it at the age of 14-16. Very good for my (while school) English, as Dutch television provides subtitles for other languages, with the exception of children's shows. This way you will hear the original voices and language. - The best three episodes were the first three, and then after the third series the great character, the Nazi von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (I don’t think they ever really caught him, he always ran away leaving a place to reappeared in the next story), because obviously the series was also spread in Germany, and the Nazi enemy would not have passed very well! It’s a pity, because Jeffrey Stone did such a wonderful and convincing job, portraying a clever Nazi aristocrat who had this constant obsession to get revenge on England. It was very nice to see this kind of high-quality performances on the youth series, but Ronald Lee-Hunt was a good partner, and the youth was so normal. At that time, they were very plausible to me, and as a child, I could imagine that I was part of these young people, who at that time were about four years older than me. For me it was a very exciting series that I remembered at the time as a special show with “The Prisoner”. I hope that they will release a good quality DVD from the series, that would be great. Even bad copies around are still a pleasure to watch. Later episodes were not as good, diluted and just not as fun as the first three. We hope that they will also find other series with background Gelbom for recording on DVD. Hello from Canada.
