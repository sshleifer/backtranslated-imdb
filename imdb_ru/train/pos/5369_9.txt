Soft Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold is cast as Ben Richards, the wrongly convicted person who is forced to play The Running Man, a deadly television game show where people must keep moving to try to avoid cruel deaths cases at the hands of "stalkers". Of course, ultimately people are expected to die from people, and Arnold will have to prove that the system is wrong. <br /> <br /> I did not read Stephen King’s book, but despite this, this is a great film, one of the best for Arnold. He does what he can best, in the role of an action movie, delivering death with unforgettable lines. The classic is probably “He had a real pain in the neck” after he strangled the guy with barbed wire and “He should have split!”, Referring to the fact that he just saw a chain saw someone vertically. Dawson is completely annoyed as a TV presenter, and all the “Stalkers” are in a suitable camp. The action is cruel, but it's an action movie. That's the thing. The film is developing rapidly, and in the 90th minute it does not go beyond its reception. <br /> <br /> Led by Starks and Hutch Paul Michael Glazer and made after the success of “The Terminator”, this film was probably seen as another thoughtless action movie for Arnold and was very far-fetched. But today anyone who watches TV, can see how the film approaches reality. I would not be surprised if I turn on the TV in the “near future” and see the series not so far away. <br /> <br /> On this depressing note, however, I should recommend “The Running Man”. for those who love the 80s, Arnold, funny actions or violence, or just a good fighter. 9. 5/10
