Not at the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but, nevertheless, a good Japanese horror film. I would like North American horror producers to take a page out of the Japanese horror template and add “eerie” and less cheap shocks to their films. A lot of good examples in this film: scenes where the shaded face is the scene behind the young actress, photos on the wall suddenly flash with a smile, just for a second, and more. It is worth checking whether you like the genre.
