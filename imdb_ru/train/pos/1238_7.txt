Although this film has many flaws, it is actually a funny 80s film. Eddie Murphy's Peaks during his 80s films are here. While his character is indistinguishable from earlier films, his time is almost flawless with perfect partners and foil. <br /> <br /> Combine this with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, it makes for a fun art comedy film on a rainy day. <br /> <br />
