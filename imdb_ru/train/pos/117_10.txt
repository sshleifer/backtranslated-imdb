Lars von Trier's Europe is a worthy echo of the Third Man, about an American arriving in Europe after World War II, and he finds himself confused in a dangerous secret. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war ends, to work with his uncle as a guide for a sleeping car on Zentrop railway. What he doesnâ€™t know is that the war is still secretly continuing with an underground terrorist group called Werewolves, which is aimed at the American allies. Leopold is categorically against accepting any party, but attracted and seduced by Katarina Hartmann (Barbara Sukova), the fatal daughter of the railway company owner. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but was pardoned by the American colonel Harris (Eddie Considine), because he can help restore and launch the German transport system. The colonel will soon recruit or force Leopold to become a spy (without giving him a choice or the opportunity to think about it) to find out if werewolves can attack the train. <br /> <br /> Soon Leopold was stuck in an adventure, being involved in a conflict with both parties in a mysterious and cinematic way, where everything and everyone is not what it seems. It is amazing to see how naive Leopold deals with everything (his lover, terrorists, colonel, annoying passengers, his displeased uncle, even railway company officials who come to test his work ethic) before he finally boils with humor and violence takes control. The film is infinitely unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The film is stylishly shot, it always happens at night in the winter time with a lot of falling snow. His picture is in black and white with random color shots. In addition, the background screens that display images that contradict the images in front. Add the hypnotic narrative of Max von Sydow, and Europe will become a fabulous place outside this world. <br /> <br /> This is now my favorite movie.
