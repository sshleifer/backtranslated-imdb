This film is very interesting to watch if you like organized crime films. Those who are starring a crime film with a charismatic role and dreams of bad conquest may be a little disappointed with how this film develops. <br /> <br /> However, this is a fun game in the criminal underworld, and if you are not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this. I was somewhat disappointed with some decisions made on the plot, but generally a good crime movie. Some things didn't make sense, but this seems to be the norm with the films of the East. <br /> <br /> People just randomly do things, regardless of how their personalities were previously set. This is a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film.
