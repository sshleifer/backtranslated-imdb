Have no illusions, this is a moral story. Granger is a restless hunter of former bison, once again seduced on the plains by insane Taylor. Granger can see that the end is near, and he deeply feels the price of hunting herds, Indians, and the land itself. Taylor, on the other hand, admittedly equates killing a buffalo, or Indians, to "staying with a woman." While the role of Granger as a tortured hunter is excellent, it is Taylor who steals the show, as a mad, immoral "philistine" for the sake of a quick male and good times. There are not so many explosions here, but the story is rapidly evolving, and Nolan views us as a good character. The theme of this story today is just as relevant as the attitude of the people of the 1800s to the land and what is on it, and racism. Considering when this was done, the Censors must have twisted their handkerchiefs during scenes in the “obscene house,” Taylor's relationship with Squaw, and most of the dialogue. Although it is sad, it is really a great western picture.
