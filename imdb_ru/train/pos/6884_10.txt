This movie miracle is one of those films that has a lasting and lasting impact on you. I read one or two reviews from evil people who, I believe, are either Republicans or beaten by children, and their extremist statements speak of the power of films that allow people to confront their darkest secrets. No such work of art has ever combined laughter and tears, and this is a miracle of the film. The realism of the film and its performance by Bret Carr should not be missed. The very nature of this almost interactive effect will force people to leave the theater, either to free themselves or to question their originality. Bravo to the next level of cinema.
