This is a great movie for any fan of Hong Kong action movies. In addition to a small plot, a weak drama and pieces of comedy antics, the film is filled with fighting and martial arts. Entertained me from start to finish. I thought Shannon Lee was great in this movie. <br /> <br /> An acting director such as Corey Yuen is something that supports action in Hong Kong. This modern action movie is highly recommended!
