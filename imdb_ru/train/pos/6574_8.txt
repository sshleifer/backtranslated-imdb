It can be difficult for some people to get used to Hollywood production styles. The direction does not inspire, apparently, it simply removes the scene, and the sound quality here and there is poor (the rustle of clothes of people sometimes competes with their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> My friends and I began to look, not knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost pushed us away. She seemed very unnatural and cheesy. Then we caught the tone of the content and really began to enjoy. <br /> <br /> This is very funny, despite some dullness. Definitely give him a chance if you appreciate a great dialogue. In addition, Helena Bonham Carter is charming, of course.
