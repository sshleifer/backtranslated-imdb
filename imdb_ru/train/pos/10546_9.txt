I accidentally stumbled upon this film because I had a free, not new release from Blockbuster, and I needed to quickly capture something, as the store was getting ready to close for the evening. The plain white cover and title intrigued me. I (relatively speaking) are an “old” lady, and my son is a young man of 30 years. I adore films that are real entertainment, such as The Sixth Sense, Interview with the Vampire, Harry Potter, and The Beatlejus. My son, on the other hand, is a graduate of cinema, and he likes very specialized foreign films, such as the films of Bergman or Herzog. As a rule, we hate the choice of films of each other, HOWEVER, we both watched and loved the film ANYTHING! It was unlike any movie we have ever seen. We are both cynical / critical individuals, and we usually watch movies while we watch them, but in this case we just laugh and enjoy the movie from beginning to end. We believe that if this film were advertised and shown in mainstream cinemas in the United States, it would indeed be very successful.
