Reading various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this film, although I only have a video duplicated to the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> Obviously, many critics perceive it as a minus that the premise of the story has been used before, especially in the very great “This is a wonderful life.” For me, a great premise is a great premise, no matter how many times it has been used, and I would be happy to see more films using this particular premise - a disgruntled person who gets a chance to get a fresh look at his own life through a bit of “divine magic ". <br /> <br /> I suppose that people and critics with a more intellectual bias are not so passionate about history, but I don’t go to the cinema to criticize them with a notebook in my hand - I go to the cinema to rush into them and allow they take me wherever they want. <br /> <br /> If you are as sentimental as I am, you will be well rewarded for seeing this picture. The performances are excellent in everything, and the film was very well shot. Fine selection of music too. Michael Caine is great as a responsive bartender. Jim Belushi works great as “ordinary Joe,” a guy who wonders if his life has not gone as it should. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, again as a target here, as a loving wife. John Lovitz is entertained as usual, and even has some surprisingly touching moments in Mr. Destiny. <br /> <br /> No, “Mr. Destiny” is not “This is a wonderful life,” but who says it should be? Mr. Destiny is a nice, well-made, fun and touching movie. I have seen this video in Japanese many times, and I’m sure I’ll see it a few more times. If it somehow makes me "low-grade", so be it! I'm just glad that I didn’t read a single review of “Mr. Destiny” before I saw him. <br /> <br /> I think I need to be courageous in my convictions and give the film nine or ten stars, but I could not help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews!
