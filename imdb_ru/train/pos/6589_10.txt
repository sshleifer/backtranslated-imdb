I liked this show from its first broadcast, and I always looked forward to watching each episode every week. The plot, characters, letters, special effects were outstanding! Then the sci-fi channel screwed up again and canceled a very interesting, well-written show. I say, return it, I know that all the actors will return. I would suggest buying a DVD, me. I hope that the leaders of science fiction channels will learn about these comments and realize that they need to communicate more with their viewers. Now I’m watching only one show on this channel, (Ghostbusters), but I’m sure that they will also cancel it soon.
