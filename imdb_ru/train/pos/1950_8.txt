Diane Keaton has played several “heavy” games on the big screen over the years, but mostly she is known for her “light and fluffy” things with Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for the best female role in the drama for this effort, and it does not matter what the competition was in that year when it was first shown. Try to find a scene in which it does not appear. And it was all heavy drama, exhausting at its pace and exciting, action, all at full speed. Makeup made her as young as possible, and she suited the age category of the 30s, even close-ups, but she played at half her age and at a very fast pace. The film, on the whole, was pretty well made, staged and well shot with a strong supporting actor, but Keaton took over the entire burden.
