This is Christmas Eve, and Frank Morgan’s character (the store’s owner, Mr. Matushek) is recovering from a broken marriage and attempted suicide. When each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each of them politely refuses him. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this stage there is a deep sadness for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives an idea of ​​his career, and this scene easily leads me to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy ending for this special scene. A new employee, an errand boy, the latter leaves the store on a beautiful snowy street scene. Mr. Matushek desperately goes to this boy and asks him how he would like to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful Christmas food that this surety boy has never seen before! Lonely, like Mr. Matushek, and together they can eat well at Christmas. Every time I see this scene, she worries me.
