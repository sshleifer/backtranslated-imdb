French film Esther Williams will love. But synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in the Paris suburb who found themselves. There is no doubt about what Scammas likes, since all the boys are depicted as “animaks”, but in fact only 3 girls are in focus, and during the whole time when few adults and other teenagers are mostly in the background . Marie is a girl’s stick, unattractive but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and imposes herself on Floriana (beauty of the quality of the Renaissance for one reviewer), and she is also a friend for Anna: not unattractive, but for her the time to perfect her body was short, and now she is a teenager in a female body. This is followed by the path to self-realization without the Road Map, but there is gloom in three unnatural moments: where is the fun and the senseless chatter of the youth? While the scenery was breathtaking, with a beautiful image of Floriana, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anna, it all seemed abstract, Scamma's puppets.
