This is quite an exciting, exciting, tragic story. Pretty good, and for the most part fairly accurate, considering that this is a TV movie, not a documentary. They created some fictional characters and combined several real people into one character, but otherwise itâ€™s a good story about a very tragic and dark story. <br /> <br /> The last moments of the film, depicting a mass suicide / murder, are almost directly taken from the audio recording made by Jim Jones. This recording was made during the last 44 minutes of the existence of the Temple of Nations. It is available in several places on the Internet. In this regard, this part of the film almost does not matter. <br /> <br /> To summarize, a documentary is not. However, it covers most of the basic elements of the history of the Folk Temple.
