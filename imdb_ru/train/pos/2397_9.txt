Having watched and fell in love with Greg Lombardo’s latest film “Nodes” (he also wrote and removed this function), I decided to check out his earlier work, and this film was worth the effort and hire. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in the cheek, an excellent look at Shakespeare's favorite, updated and translated to New York. I was impressed with the wit and wit of the script and was amazed at how the storyline of the production in the film reflects the storyline of the play itself - and very cleverly at that. The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan are parallel to many of Shakespeare's plays, and Central Park is rarely used better than the woods around the Macbeth castle. Mr. Lombardo clearly likes in his heart the New York and New York stories (“Knots” is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty-year-old New Yorkers, taking place mainly in the charming district of Brooklyn, with offices in Manhattan and an attic in the center cities). for good measure) and spent considerable time around Shakespeare's plays. The film unfolds well and the story reflects a deep understanding of the underlying drama at the heart of Macbeth. It reminded me of the movie Al Pacino "In Search of Richard" - another great Shakespeare play "in the movies." I highly recommend checking out Macbeth in Manhattan.
