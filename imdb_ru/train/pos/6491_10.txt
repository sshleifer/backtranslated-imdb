Peace in war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time. Historical research is almost flawless. Even a quarter of a century later, this is the most accurate and definitive documentary about the Second World War. An invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and interesting figures from the war. I highly recommend this as a learning experience.
