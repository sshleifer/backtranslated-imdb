Immediately after World War II, sane minds in Hollywood tried to distance themselves from mindlessly waving flags, which is a natural component of hostilities. “The best years of our life” and even the “Gentleman's Agreement” explored how the Americans looked at themselves after the war, but Delmer Dave’s “Pride of the Marines” surpassed them. <br /> <br /> A film about Philadelphia's clever Alex John Garfield, who goes to war as a marine and after a horrible evening in a trench, when Japanese soldiers shout terribly at him and his buddies “Mariins, today you die!” He is blinded by a hand grenade and throws his girlfriend home, and does not depend on her after returning home. <br /> <br /> Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his description of these courageous men, almost accidentally. They are there in the trenches, and when they are shot, they react. So much for heroism, but they do their work. And then comes self-pity, a dark, dark sense of humor. Garfield is angry about his blindness and there is no excuse for the film: “In this world there is no free candy for anyone,” as his friend tells him. One guy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him: “In war, someone gets it, and you get it. Everyone has problems! When I come back, some guys won't take me to work, because my name is Diamond. "<br /> <br /> Great movies are shot with such courage, and if for the first half hour," Marines' Pride "cannot fully correspond to this occasion, since then it turns into a true work of art. You cry, you think, you feel ill and hope for hope. Well, it's simple: art. <br /> <br />
