This is an excellent film, suitable for all but the youngest, although accessibility for young people was overshadowed (at least in the seal I saw) because of the unfortunate choice of English subtitles! For most of the film, it’s almost impossible to guess at what period of time it is installed - modern technologies are not shown here, even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, just a gloomy, almost monochrome, everyday life, which is opposed by the dazzling display of the opera Sesuana and festive fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers talks about their imminent departure to the theater of military operations, this can happen at any time over the past 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we briefly see the car - the end of the 30s, early In the style of the 40s - and we understand that we are watching China on the verge of tremendous upheavals, and most of the world that we see , will soon be swept away as a result of the cataclysm of the Second World War and the communist revolution. <br /> <br /> What makes the main character’s aspiration to adhere to old customs and traditions is even sharper. <br /> <br /> But the film also raises issues that are vital even today, both in China and in other countries. parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; trade for various purposes by small children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> I may be reading too much in this film; but I do not think so! I also think that this is a scandal that films of this caliber are often not shown in the United Kingdom, while scale is given for quality material. <br /> <br /> But don't make me start with this ..,
