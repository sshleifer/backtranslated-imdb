I can only agree with the taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be watched by a wide audience. The imagination presented, the visual interpretation of the script, the humor is constantly surprising. The two leads are great and really carry the film. My advice is to not even watch the trailer, just rent a movie and watch it without expectations. I rented from a blockbuster, so it is easily available in Brisbane, not everyone will like it, but I think that most people will have their own opinion, and this is always good, if only it is not “stupid”. I liked this movie, you just can’t see such jewels every day. This should be a cult favorite. Try it, you can feel the same thing as me.
