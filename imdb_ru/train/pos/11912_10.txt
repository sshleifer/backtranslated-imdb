I liked Albert Pune's Nemesis for its daring action and semi-complex script. Many people complain about the “tangled” plot of the first film, so, probably, “Nemesis 2: Nebula” has a stupid plot, similar to rocks, with the same over-action to do it. > This one gives the name of the hero of the first film, Alex, a swollen super-woman sent back in time to save the future. She was raised by a tribe in Africa. The good part of the film has only dialogue in African language without subtitles, which I liked, because it seemed to me somewhat authentic (how often do films in this genre really try to do this?). Angry cyborgs cannot travel for a long time in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, this is a piece of shit (not that the first one was anything great). There are scenes related to political unrest in Africa, treasure hunts and tribal battles. The picture has very few brains, so none of these things get very good treatment. The picture is basically a protracted fight with several pursuits, which are reduced to a muscular kid against a cyborg. It has its own entertainment value, just don't expect quality or anything from the first movie.
