Although I agree that it is a good, but not very good film, for many reasons mentioned by other authors, I still like it. One of the reasons is music: I would pay attention to the very cool looks of the Candolie brothers, Conte and Pete, in a well-organized nightclub scene. These guys were the two best jazz trumpeters of their time, and they manage to convincingly surprise Jimmy Stewart, playing a hysterical pipe duet, one tube in each of Stewart's ears. Candolis was really good at playing too, although I suspect that the real music for this scene was dubbed later on by both. I donâ€™t know much about George Dunning, who gets recognition for music (except that he seems to have worked with Three Stooges more than once), but casting the Candolie brothers as jazz sorcerers was a very pleasant touch
