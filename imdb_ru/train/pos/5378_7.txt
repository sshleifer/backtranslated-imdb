This is an interesting little film made in 1967, with cool jazz, cool music from the soundtrack and plot that makes you laugh ... Well, it's not very silly, but it's fun. I saw a lot in common between this and the Creature with the Blue Hand (AKA The Bloody Dead), and they have the same director! Best of Scotland Yard investigates the murder of girls in college. It appears that the criminals are released from the local prison in order to carry out the order of the evil person, and then return when their work is completed. The Bible hides a graceful device that injects prussic acid, and there is another device that is neither elegant nor clandestine, it looks like a big syringe pistol, and the victim must be almost absorbed before the expiration date. Joachim Fuchsberger plays the inspector, he basically chews the cud and looks into the distance. There is a “monk” there, and how someone identifies this thing as a “monk” is beyond my power: he carries a whip and puts on a red outfit with a red hood, rather a member of a Clan of a different color than a monk. There are all sorts of elegant devices, such as a fireplace mantel that rises and falls to let a monk in, and he steps right above the fire without setting fire to his mantle, a deft stunt right there. This is a strange combination of criminal drama with confused overtones, and although sometimes it is rather stupid, it is funny to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
