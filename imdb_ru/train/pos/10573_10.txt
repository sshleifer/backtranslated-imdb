An excellent example of Busby Berkeley's spectacular musicals, released in the early 1930s. The viewers must have been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of car. Very contrast with his "Public Enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagney really adds sparks and interest to the rather ordinary tired articulated plotline and plot. But the highlight of the film - 3 carefully thought out production numbers, coming close. First with the conservative "Honeymoon Hotel" number, and then with the very spectacular "By A Waterfall" sequence, followed by the closing sequence "Shanghai Lil", Cagney only participates in the last issue, raising it at the top of the bar. counter with ruby ​​keeler. Cagney’s "Shanghai Lil" is superb, but a little crazy and anti-climatic after a more exciting and incredibly stunning choreography "By A Waterfall". If I were a director, I would put the number of "Shanghai Lil" in the middle and next to the "Waterfall", which throws out two other numbers from the water, so to speak, and, in my opinion, the best of the three numbers. The 3 production numbers are the icing on the cake, and the performance of James Cagney is the decoration of the cake. Outstanding musical achievement, 4-star film, an unsurpassed musical, worth seeing, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
