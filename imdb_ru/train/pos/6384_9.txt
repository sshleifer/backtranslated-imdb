The stone says that Disney animations just have to be musicals. Right? Where? Show me. Because I found that this attempt was much more enjoyable, because it did not contain the hockey "fifty-year" standard Disney music. <br /> <br /> Although the story was not as exciting as it could have been, it was still quite good, pleasant and adventurous. I was hoping for a little more, yes, considering the subject, but this film is not a bitter disappointment or a complete failure, as was announced. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogs are pretty convincing, as is the storyline, the plot, the plot and the amazing creativity that I found in this production. I will refrain from plotting the story, as it was done, but this film is worth seeing if you are a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the BEST Disney Long animated film. <br /> <br /> He estimates 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
