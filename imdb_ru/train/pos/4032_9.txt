Pinjar is one of the few films that really leaves a mark and makes you wonder. This film, shown in The Sharing of India, shows the true reality of the “India” section. Urmila receives a full assessment for her beautiful and deeply emotional image of a suffering woman who has no way. Her freedom, personality, and family respect were suddenly overwhelmed by the tragic land dispute. Manoj Baypay is just as gorgeous as her repentant kidnapper. There are several moments in the film, where one is brought to tears. The film in the points is deeply traumatic. Some of the partitioning scenes cool the spine, but Urmila’s stamina and survival are wonderful. From the woman who deprived her of her freedom to the woman who gave freedom to women in such situations. Wonderful film, which should be given credit for smart characters and storytelling.
