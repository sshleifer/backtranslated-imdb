I first saw this movie on some channel (HBO?) Some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early raps and saw CB4 in cinemas. In any case, the promo for this caught my eye, and I wanted to see what was going on. Well, right away I knew it would be good (ATTENTION!), And I was right. Only parody songs make this film worth watching (My Peanuts), but the general flow and delivery of the film was great. You have to love rap satire (obviously, NWA), some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of three NWH members. Who can forget that Ton Deaf is scratching his ass? It is a pity that this film did not receive due respect, since it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but, in my opinion, the film is much better. If you know and love the gangster rap of the 90s, you will watch and laugh at this movie for a long time. If you do not like or dislike "rap", you will enjoy jokes through the genre.
