If you remove the first twenty minutes of this movie, you will have a fantastic comedy. In fact, I nevertheless found that it was a pretty good film, and this is a considerable feat, given the coma I got into the opening scenes. To put it mildly, this film has a dark beginning, which was not even remotely funny, or even optimistic. However, as soon as everything becomes more stupid, you will be left with a comedy that is still well held after more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger admirer of Lemmon and Mattau, who wants to see their early work.
