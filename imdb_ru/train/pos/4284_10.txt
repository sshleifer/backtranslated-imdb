This film is one of the most amusing, sad and accurate images of the mentality that seems to have embraced the Balkans again, 45 years after it is depicted. All ordinary characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing will be a more appropriate response. The accuracy of drawing and the infinity of types, however, make it an excellent movie to watch, if someone wants to understand a little what led the former Yugoslavia to its insanity. In fact, no diplomat dealing with a region should try to do anything until they see this film and its twin * Maratonci trce pocasni krug. * Did I mention that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen?
