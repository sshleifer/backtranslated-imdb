Director Edward Sedgwick, an experienced visual comedy specialist, successfully directs this Hal Roach road show, which features a fast-paced and clever script and an excellent cast that employs a large number of reliable Roach performers. Although the film was originally planned as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, sunny Jack Haley plays the role of Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his car repair business and travels to Hollywood, where he tries to capture the role on the screen for his girlfriend, star Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence ). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the entire MGM studio as his set, does it here, since Cecilia, always ready to audition, is considered a potential lover, the movie star Rinaldo López (Misha Auer), behind the scenes. About, of course, a musical comedy featuring Lida Roberti’s Broadway Headliner. Laurel and Hardy provide some pleasant interludes, including their well-known scene with a tiny harmonica, and we watch such beautiful twists as Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. In the end, you need to give compartments to Micha Auer, who clearly stole the film as an emotional movie star, a role that he largely creates, and the director for his skillful close respect for Busby Berkeley’s cinematographic performances.
