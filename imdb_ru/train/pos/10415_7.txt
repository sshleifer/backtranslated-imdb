Three memories represent the main characters (Abu, Jafar and Princess), who will interact with Ahmad; three songs, each of which is associated with the same characters. Three times, Ahmad utters the absolute word “Time” in his declaration of love for the princess, answering her three questions at the first of three meetings. He has such a strong impression that the princess will resist three attempts by Jaffar to conquer her - with three successive tricks: deception, hypnosis, and erasure of memory. However, Jaffar owns what he describes as the three inevitable tools of domination over a woman: a whip, force, and a sword. Three are the number of flying creatures: a horse mechanic, gin, gin and magic carpet. Jin proposes Abu's three wishes at the first of three meetings; three times Jean laughs loudly in the mountain gorges, and three his thoughts on human weakness before he leaves. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of the Dawn (armed guards, a giant spider and a giant octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magic eye that shows Abu the future, the magic carpet that carries him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess, and the bow and arrows to execute Jaffar. There is magic in number three, and there is magic in this movie.
