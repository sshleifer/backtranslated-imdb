Sabrina the teenage witch was one of my favorite TV shows T.V: D I used to watch back-to-back episodes every day when I was returning home from school. Until now, I think I watched each episode at least once, and the entire series - 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect girl / witch with the usual teen problems that we can all relate to. She is funny, intelligent, sociable, witty and much more. Caroline Ray and Beth Broderick are great at aunt Sabrina. Zelda, a smart scientist, and Hilda, a crazy, foolish person, create the perfect balance in Sabrinaâ€™s life. Although I have to agree that student years are not as good as in high school, but this does not mean that they still were not good. I think the finale was amazing, although it wasn't what I was hoping for, it made sense, and I still liked it. :)
