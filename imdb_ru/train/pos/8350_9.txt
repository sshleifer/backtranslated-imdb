As in this film, we follow the implausible, if always fascinating adventures of the two main characters. But while C + J abstains from sex for a girlish journey to childhood, this couple enjoys its own flesh, even to the extent of studying homoerotism. Most of the sex they get from reluctant or unwanted partners, and yet, despite their deeply non-PC behavior, everyone has a smile. Like C + G, through it all they remain innocent at heart, rebel against the particular, bourgeois, restrictive. As someone else commented, I would not like to know these two, and itâ€™s a small miracle that their journey brings scenes mainly of comedy and a very small tragedy (and what is, what cannot be put at their door) therefore, for this reason, it left me deceived, but with a sweet taste in my mouth. I dare say that only French films can get away with. And this is part of their genius.
