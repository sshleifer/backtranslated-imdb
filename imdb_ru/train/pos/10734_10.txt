BLIMEY! <br /> <br /> This film, I think, is the best living testimony to what happened 9-11-01 in New York, compared to what the mainstream media showed. <br /> <br /> outlets can only show you what happened on the street. This movie shows you what happened on the inside. <br /> <br /> It all starts with the fact that the focus is on a new York New York fireman who for weeks has been waiting for the first big fire for which he will be called upon to fight. The topic abruptly turns from the ONLY EXISTING FIRST AIRPLANE'S LEAD TO DESTROY THE TOWER. Then you are given a place in the first row when firefighters rush to the scene in the lobby of the first tower. <br /> <br /> In the minutes preceding the crash of the second plane and the subsequent fall of Tower Two, you see how firefighters react to the disturbing sound of people landing above the vestibule. This is a sight that you will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> Heartbreaking, jerking and very convincing from the first minute to the last, “9/11” deserves to go down in history as a whole. of the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
