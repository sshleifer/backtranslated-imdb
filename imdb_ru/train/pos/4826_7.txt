This film tells about the life of Queen Victoria in her youth and the early years of the British monarch. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria is an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated for impeccable detail. Extravagant costumes, gorgeous locations and beautifully landscaped gardens make “The Young Victoria” very impressive. Most of all I was struck by thoughtful cinematography. How each person is positioned relative to the background or foreground is well thought out, each scene is well composed. What impressed me most was the scene when Victoria was talking to Melbourne. Melbourne was located in the middle of the door frame from the corner of Victoria, while from the corner of Melbourne, Victoria was located between the space where Melbourne held his hand on his hips. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, he is too concise to follow and understand a man without historical knowledge about Queen Victoria. Many events are rushing or not even explained. I expected a grand coronation scene, and, unfortunately, it lasted only a few seconds. <br /> <br /> In general, “Young Victoria” is a good film, and it would be even better if it was longer. so that events can be correctly explained without haste.
