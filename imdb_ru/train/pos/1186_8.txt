Much has been said about “psychological westerns,” but this is one of the few that really belongs to this genre. He has celebrities who play very well, but it’s the director who makes this film so good. Stuart Granger loses his stereotype of a British safari hunter to play a haggard retired bison hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays an upstart (as opposed to the usual young upstart, Taylor's character is also middle-aged) who wants to kill the buffalo and lures Granger to business with him. They hire two other famous actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, to become their skins. Granger pursues the buffaloes he killed, knowing that he could be to blame if they died out, knowing if they died out, the way Native Americans would suffer a lot. Soon, Taylor discovers the sadistic side, but this is realistic Saidism, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of the modern film, created by nerds and assholes. He is insecure and needs human intercourse. However, he will not stop at killing. The end puts two against each other, with a startling conclusion. The psychological consequences of what they do are well described.
