This is a family movie, which for some people is an automatic shutdown. It seems that too many people do not want to watch movies that are not loaded with broken arms and legs, unreasonable violence and enough curses to fill the New York telephone book. This film is not one of those. It's a cliche, it's a formula, but it's also fun. He does not ask you to think, he does not demand that you take the film as reality. He just does what a good film should do, which is to voluntarily suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. The cast is good, but not great. As another commentator noted, the John Williams sound score, as usual, was excellent. And the fact that most of the movie was shot at Huntsville in a real space camp made it even more believable. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the initial release of the film was delayed for several months due to the Challenger crash, which may have played a big role in its original theatrical discovery, but the film ultimately helped the dreams of many young people are back to the cosmos and the possibilities that lie in it. SO to sit with children and prepare for pleasure.
