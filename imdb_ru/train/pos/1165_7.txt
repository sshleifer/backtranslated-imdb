As another IMDB reviewer noted, this film starts a little slow, but it gets much better over time. Yes, it is released by Roger Corman, and yes, it goes beyond the same thematic framework as predecessors with a higher budget, such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, comparing his wife’s career as a rising blues singer with her husband’s growing loneliness and his almost Freudian need to fill in emotional and physical “emptiness” or “hole” while she’s absent, along with clever use of minimal effects and settings, is beautifully made a very small number of locations and characters, as well as using water in almost every scene as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout, this film, although obviously suffering from a small budget, in many relationship reminds me of a more complete and more recent scenario, namely the French film “POOL”, which, I think, at least possibly borrowed some useful ideas from UP AGAINST AMANDA. With a smaller set of tools, UP AGAINST AMANDA maintains its expectation with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of succumbing to occasional lascivious temptations, but achieves this as well or better than other films in this genre. The twist of his stepfather's ill-treatment with Amanda in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers regarding Amanda’s unexpected and sympathetic reaction to the plight that this aspect of the story causes. The cast is great, I think. <br /> <br />
