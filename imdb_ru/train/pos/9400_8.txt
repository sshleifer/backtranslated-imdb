If “The Man in the White Suit” was made in America, can't you see how Danny Kay or Jerry Lewis try on Sydney Stratton Alec Guinness? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Alekov. Guinness films and, of course, one of the best ever released Ealing Studios in the UK. It fits so well into the timeframe of the new Labor government and society it was trying to build. It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can converge. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness, this meek little man, is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that never need cleaning, which actually repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute they touch clothes . <br /> <br /> He is an insistent abusive, and he succeeds. Of course, in fact, it was not thought out what impact clothing will have on society. In the end, everyone pursues him as a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> The distinctive comedy film is that a potentially serious situation, similar to the chase, as described in some of the serious films I mentioned, can be played with laughter. Poor Guinness Costume is not only white and repulsive, but glows like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> In addition to Guinness, the best performances are Cecil Parker, another pompous moron, Joan Greenwood, his daughter sirens and Ernest Tesiger, the largest clothing manufacturer in the UK borrowed this costume from Ealing and handed it to John Travolta on Saturday night of a fever?
