Red Eye, a film that I have long wanted to see ... Killian Murphy plays Jack Ripner (Jack the Ripper) in the management position for the Assassins, and his literally murderous plan to bring down the highly professional man and his family. /> <br /> An ordinary woman "Liza" (I think) is a normal woman who goes to work, goes home ... worries ... hates to fly. <br /> <br /> The death of a grandmother sends her on a flight that is delayed several times. <br /> <br /> with a flight where she meets Jack ... an ordinary guy, until he reveals his profession and plans, which by coincidence include her in them, she is the key to Kif's death (sp?). <br /> <br /> She manages to save them ... but almost the cost of her life is taken, Jack is beaten ... Cephas are saved ... oh, what a story * laughs * jokes, the film is really good, the best from last year. .. there are small things that you should pay attention to earlier in the film, which play a lot of importance to the film later. .. (Frankenstein's pen) picked it up several times before catching all the little jokes and quirks ... <br /> <br /> Thriller fans need to look sexy, but there is a small hint (the scene in the bathroom) (Jack ) “Thank you for quicky” and (accompanying woman) “Oooh ... it will be ONE of those flights” (second accompanying woman) “Hey! This is not a motel” you understand ...
