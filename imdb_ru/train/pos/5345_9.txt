Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain again goes in the direction of political confrontation. That is why this masterpiece must be shown in all Spanish high schools. This is a huge lesson of the hidden crime of fascism. An American pilot involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses a democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe has ever done. The colors are gorgeous. The cruelty of war (can anyone tell me the difference between any war and civil war?) Used as a hopeful scenario when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. Cowards who are beginning to abuse power even towards innocent children are now active again. A film like El viaje de Carol / Carol's Journey tells one of many sad stories of the 20th century. This is a better history lesson than any book. Again, great work from the Iberitz Peninsula!
