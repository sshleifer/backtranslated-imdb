Listen, if I was interested in the book by Nancy Drew, I would take the book and read it. I do not. Since I remember myself, I’m reading people breaking movies because it’s not like a book. I'm sorry - in the digital era, we can no longer watch movies on flipcharts, but I'm sure you can still find some short silent films in the form of books. When the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third won the Oscar - "The book was better." When I watched “Kill a Mockingbird,” “the book was better.” Now a bunch of people are upset, again, because Nancy Drew didn't look like a book. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew is going to win any Oscars - in any case, this will be one of these Nickelodeon Blimps awards or Kids Choice. I say, give the film a break. This is a film, not paper. As a film, I found Nancy Drew quite enjoyable - featuring the cameos of Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg ("The Jewish Hammer") and supporting roles involving Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper from OS) and Rachel Lee Cook ("She's All") This the first time I saw Emma Roberts in a movie, and, frankly, I like her work more than most of Julia and Eric; her character remains unchanged throughout the film and responds well to conflicts. The frivolous film in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is good now and again. <br /> <br /> I give him ten stars, because I really liked the film, I would like to see it again and probably buy it on DVD release.
