In the hands of less actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this film could have become stupid and banal. But when these two experienced talkers walked ahead, I discovered that “Silent Fury” is the most exciting and enjoyable little mystery. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he was the best man at this wedding, you can feel that there is some kind of conspiracy against her at work. When Colbert, Ryan, and her lawyer intended to refute the strangers' claim of a previous marriage, they meet at every turn with a lot of evidence that seems to confirm the claim that she is already married. Although it is not very difficult to understand who the main "villain" is, it is still very fun when the intensity and pace of the story increase. In general, a good, solid film is a mystery with beautiful performances of two leading actors and an excellent cast, which includes the often underrated Paul Kelly.
