I never saw silent movies until July 24, 2005. I have never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I have seen thousands of films. Very few hypnotize me. I found that “The Last of the Mohicans and the Unforgettable” (Ray Liotta) is hypnotic, so consider the source when you read this. I started watching Tess of the Storm Country at TCM just to find out who this Mary Pickford is, which many consider to be the launch of Hollywood. I had no idea what I was for. Two hours later, I came out of it and realized that I had watched one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen, playing a role that was perfect for her. Imagine a movie fan in 1922 who has never seen anyone so gorgeous and expressive before. You will have to see her again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl who is expressive. She was poor, did not speak English, but you should have admired her. What film ... time to start my Mary Pickford film collection!
