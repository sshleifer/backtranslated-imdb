I just watched this movie on HBO and it was really good ... a tragic love story! I really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story involving a person with physical disabilities. The love that arose between this character and the woman who entered his life depicted how I would like to think that love can heal someone’s heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27, when she starred in this film ... was gorgeous as a woman so full of life that she is able to revive this guy's heart. Unfortunately, since his family is rich and not, “problems” develop. <br /> <br /> He plays HBO a few more times this month.
