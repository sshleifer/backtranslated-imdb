this movie is awesome, sort of, sort of. it really says a lot or does a lot, but it's a great movie to watch, because it's stupid. High School is captured by an evil Missist who hates what all students love, rock and roll. riff randle, to get all the tickets for the ramones show, and this film reached peak moments with school grabbing, led my riff randle and ramones. This film has everything, bad script, dubious direction, bad actors (like Clint Howard and Pee Soils), a terrific soundtrack, extreme courtesy, these elements and much more come together to make it what it is, a classic. > <br /> note - during the live demonstrations, note that the rumble of microbes is right in front of the crowd. neat-oh
