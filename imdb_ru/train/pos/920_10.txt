This cute animated short film contains two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is a bald, slightly curvaceous comic boy who never speaks. <br /> <br /> Well, so he says! <br /> <br /> He wants to get a puppy at the pet store Betty Boop, and when he is left in stock, he is followed by funny jokes. <br /> <br /> Betty sings a song about pets. Henry enters the battle with the birds and the monkey, but in the end everything turns out.
