The SG-1 Stargate follows an intergalactic research team called SG-1 using a device called the Stargate and all the surprises waiting on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> Seeing this series from time to time for this first few seasons, when it just came out, I didnâ€™t know how good this series was, 10 years after I last saw the episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. Stargate SG-1 is more than just a sci-fi series; it is one of the most well-made, interesting, long-lasting and exciting sci-fi works ever created. And why? Because he works in an amazing premise. <br /> <br /> This series far exceeds the value of the film on which it was founded, and I think that this is a very good example of the fact that television, as a mass media, has a suitable premise, can provide something that doesn't work on movie time limit. The sense of familiarity created as a result of a long series, watching characters and their circumstances progressing over time is overwhelming and just adds the ability to suspend disbelief, and all this is the result of amazing writing and great dedication to the entire show team. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 continued to offer great adventures for 10 years, but never feared the difficulties associated with moving the plot, and gave way to very different periods of the show. : <br /> <br /> - The first few seasons, perhaps up to the fourth / fifth, paid more attention to the exploration of the planets and various situations, keeping the episodes rather unconnected with each other, if not the impending threat of Goul. <br /> <br /> - From the 5th to the 7th the number of episodes devoted to the fight against the Goauld and the prevention of attacks on Earth, became more and more. After this season, the study of the planets was almost the only reason for placing sg-1 at the conflict site Goauld / Replicator / Ori. <br /> <br /> - The 8th season is probably the most mixed. It has a stream of episodes that include secondary terrestrial substances in which the stargate is not even mentioned, but recent episodes show some great moments of the replicator. <br /> <br /> - 9th and 10th travel together, because they have the same new enemy and not Jack O'Neill. Both of them are good sequels, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a bit weak, because they seem to be slightly more than SG-1 and the man / Jaffa who lost the battle after the battle with Ori. <br /> <br /> Basically, after season 7, the studies were relegated to the background, which in many respects was a shame because of the potential and secrets of each planet (episode); on the other hand, it gave rise to so many wonderful episodes of ongoing conflicts that the change of character of the series did work, and shows how great and bold the writers were. <br /> <br /> Even difficult, I think, the series has a high-quality final, which is pleasant to rest, I have a feeling that it can continue; all the people involved were great professionals, and the narrative of the series had something to offer. Last season, returning to the beginning of the character of the series, was very doable and would be very useful, but in the end everything is as it is. <br /> <br /> In the end, due to the fact that I liked everything, it is a little difficult to understand that it ends. However, the overall picture painted by hundreds of people over 10 years is a spectacle of beauty and a true testimony of the loyalty of the film crew, these outstanding actors and characters, which we will always remember as a team named SG-1.
