I saw this film when, in 1993, the Mysterious Theater of Science showed it. This is the worst thing I've ever seen. So bad, in fact, because of sheer quirkiness, this film should get a rating of ten, because you have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Those who wrote this scenario with children's interests in mind should be beaten. I mean, really, Devil versus Santa? Visions of hell? Creepy laughter of a clockwork reindeer? Forced child labor with racial stereotypes? This is not Sesame Street, that's for sure. As Crow exclaims during the MST3K show: "This is a good old-fashioned fuel for nightmares!" Merlin (presumably Arturian Merlin) hangs out with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (that is, in heaven). Santa talks about baby Jesus and sends letters to Mr. Stork for children who ask for brothers and sisters. There are characters around the castle that look like pentagrams or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have been seeing him every year since 1993, and we invite someone we can hold for 2 hours to watch it with us.
