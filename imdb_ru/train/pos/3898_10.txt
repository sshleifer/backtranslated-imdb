Merry hardly begins to describe this one-of-a-kind genuine tour-star army (Luke: how strong is he? Vader: the power of a little pony), in which, as a master, he did not even break the sweat, genius sparing himself from the carcass leak .. - and it's almost 2 hours of crashing his way through history, her birthplace, Europe, and more. <br /> <br /> From the middle of the night of Heimlich "I invented a maneuver!" in the British Empire ".. do you have a flag ..?" and the ancient gods of the dead, "Jeff! God of cookies!" and much more, it's funny "fisherman on half-jump-start-your lungs." <br /> <br /> And I confess that for many years I shot this video, because the British transvestite counter fighting in a chair is, after all, one of the long-term rentals, especially those returning 10 years ago. And yet, the material is not only timeless, but also almost an oracle, turning today into nothing more than a heightened, ridiculous / sad version of where we were ten years ago, although, if you think this may just be a coincidence.
