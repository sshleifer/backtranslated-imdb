First of all, no adaptation is as good as in the book, especially when you are dealing with a famous writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION miraculously synthesizes Tolkien’s universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics and liberal culture. Yes, the animation and drawing of the background is sometimes a bit “rough” in technical performance, but, nevertheless, they are beautiful and very memorable in terms of giving a unique “sense of place” to each scene. In addition to the absolute uniqueness in the images - this is an absolutely outstanding voice acting - an acting game that is far superior to the action in new live action movies. And although cellular animation may not be the most “technically clever” animation, it perfectly conveys the expressive physical and facial gestures of the actor, while not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. Background images range from traditional “fantasy” motifs to outright abstractions, but the transition to abstract settings is always motivated by narration and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you are a person who needs extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you, then I understand that you may not like this film, but if you like excellent acting, transcendental images and JRR Tolkien, then this film is see.
