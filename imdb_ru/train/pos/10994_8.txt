This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! Once I watched TV by luck. At first 5 minutes I thought it was a movie B, but then I realized that it was an amazing product. <br /> <br /> I suggested to my friends to watch a movie, only to say that it is bad. B movie. How wrong. Surface criticism. <br /> <br /> I think the film is almost an ingenious product! The famous director did a great job, and it's a shame to say that he was always out of the game.
