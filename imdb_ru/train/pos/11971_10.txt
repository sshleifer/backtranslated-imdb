I think the comments on the cheesy show are a bit exaggerated. When a man comes to watch a television show, what is he watching? It's nice that he watches the show, unless he or she is a critic or a person who analyzes the story. But most of us are wrong and watch the show to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is the perfect show to watch after a hard day at the office / school. It makes you laugh, and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is an ideal family, a completely hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, this would be an example for us to follow. But this is a TV show, not a real family, and there is nothing wrong with portraying a hypothetical family on television. The fact that the show can last for so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it, whatever the comments later. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about the show is that any person of any age will not only enjoy watching, but take the message, no matter how childish it is. This talk of Jesse and Michelle is extremely touching, if not considered childish. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that after watching every Full House show, there is a satisfaction in your heart that is rarely found. present after many other shows.
