I was looking forward to see it, since I first saw it in her work. I finally found it yesterday, February 13, 2002, on the Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson’s comments that this “cute funny story about two people crossing paths” are already dead. Script writers probably should not receive an award, all other SROs for making the film. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie MUST SEE THIS. <br /> <br /> On the screen, Natasha is so warm and her smile is so electric, not to mention her beauty, that everything she does is on my favorite list. Her television and print interviews, which I have seen, are just as refreshing and worthy of looking for them. <br /> <br /> God bless her, her family and future initiatives. <br /> <br /> This film does not seem to be available on DVD or video, but I would first have bought it, and I think the others also.
