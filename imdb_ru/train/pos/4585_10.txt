This movie is the best Jackie. I still can't get enough of watching some of his best tricks. I also like the bad guys in this film (the old man looks like the Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike some other works by Jackie, this film also received an excellent storyline, and I recommend it to all Jackie fans.
