Lucino Visconti ahead of his contemporaries on light years. The great directors of Italy in the 40s and 50s were people who understood the environment, but it was Luchino Visconti, a man of vision who dared to bring a film similar to what he is capable of. He clearly shows his genius at the beginning of his outstanding career in the film "Osssession", based on the James Cain film "The Postman, Always Calling twice", which was later made by Hollywood, but this version fades compared to what Visconti has achieved in the film. , On the screen of Luchino Visconti and his associates was depicted the uncredited Alberto Moravia, a man who was aware of the influence of passion on people. <br /> <br /> The film is well preserved in the DVD format that we recently watched. The film is a must for all serious movie fans, because we can see how the vision of Visconti translated the text into a film that rings true, which the American version lacks. <br /> <br /> What happens when watching a movie? the film is the intensity that the director received from his key players. Gorgeous Clara Kalamai does an amazing job in the role of Giovanna, a woman who married an older man, but when Gino appears in her life, all she wants to do is get rid of the kind man who gave her the opportunity to live. Giovanna is one of the best creations of Miss Kalamai in Italian cinema. In the last episode of the film, Miss Kalamai at her best demonstrates an ironic twist that serves as a moral ransom for the monstrous crime committed. <br /> <br /> No less magnificent Massimo Girotti, one of the best actors. his generation, who appears as Gino, is a fat man who evokes obsessive passion in Giovanna. Gino is the perfect person for Giovanna, something that Mr. Girotti projects with such ease and sophistication that he never had before on the screen. Mr. Girotti makes a man come to life in a play that seems so easy, but with another actor this may not be so obvious. Juan Delanda is considered to be Giuseppe, an elderly man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact, his character sounds believable than his counterpart in the American film, where he is more perceived as a jester. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic look, which was so much preferred by Italian directors of that era. Original music by Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes the arias of Bizet and Verdi, which fit well into the context of the film. <br /> <br /> “Ossessione” is a film that we cherish because we see the great Lucino Visconti at the top of its form.
