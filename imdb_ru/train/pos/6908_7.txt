Richard Dreyfuss stars in Paul Mazursky’s movie Moon Over Parador 1988, also starring Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays New York actor Jonathan Nolan in the Caribbean country Parador to make a film. When the dictator suddenly dies, the head of the secret police (Julia), who actually controls the dictator and the country, draws Jonathan to the role of dictator, noting the similarities between them. Soon Jonathan finds himself in the palace as Alphonse Simms, and the prostitute Simms, Madonna (Braga), who understands this change, promises to help him in all possible ways. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears in a drama like Simms “Mom, gives us a look at how the CIA works in third world countries. The character Winters, presumably the seller, is actually a CIA employee. The film, however, is flirting, but in reality it does not go on very serious grounds, and this is rather funny and funny. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss copes with the role of Jonathan actor and dictator Alphonse, creating two separate characters and nailing both. Gorgeous Sonya Braga is as gorgeous as Madonna, and Raul Julia performs an ominously funny performance like Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. This is one of those performances where you never know what a character is thinking about - he can be pleasant or freak out at any moment. Charo is at hand, like a maid, and she manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, not a big blockbuster, but very interesting.
