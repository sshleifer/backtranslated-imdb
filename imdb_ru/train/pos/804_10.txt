No, there is one more! <br /> <br /> Because every Star Wars fan should have an opinion about I, II, and III, and because this opinion was biased, because we missed the atmosphere and characters of the original trilogy so much. I will outline the good moments of the Return of the Jedi and a few of the corresponding bad moments of the prequel. Of course, I loved music, special effects, two droids, but it was too much discussed elsewhere. What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular film: -. Strong environmental concerns - Anti-militarist attitudes - Breathtaking insight into the Jedi Order and the Force - Lovely creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - Murder scene: Right at the end, when Vader looks at his son and the Emperor alternately. Lightning deadly bolts reflected on his black helmet. And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke, thereby risking his own life! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the INMHO prequel: - the entire element of the “human factor” that the original cast could move forward, is missing for some reason - The force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults, not about wisdom - too many Jedi at the same time and too many light sabers on the screen - lack of experience of several actors too often threatens plot coherence <br /> <br /> By the way, if you enjoy the theory of Force explained by Obi Web (I mean Obi Vienna ) and Yoda, then you should read a few books about Buddhism and forms that he took in ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars, IMHO, consists mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from the master to his student, from father to son, albeit with difficulties. “De mon âme à ton âme” (from my soul to yours), as Bejard would write to the late master Zen T. Deshimaru.
