On the opening scene on an eye patch in desperation called Hawkeye, there is a smooth forehead, but when he follows Johnny in Pueblo, he is shown with a scar on the patched eye. This is just one of the many flaws in the continuity of this sharp "spaghetti" Western, but instead of diverting attention from the picture, it adds a special flavor to the process. <br /> <br /> Another case arises when Sanchez turns into his three dead. bodies, they should be checked for their identity - "You just can not imagine how many false corpses in our city." Immediately after this, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) appears to pick up his reward, holding no more than a wanted poster. <br /> <br /> As for the film's director, Johnny Hume (Mark Damon), he is alternately shown with a holster. on the right and left thighs throughout the film after the exchange of weapon belts with Carradine after a bar fight. Johnny goes to San Margo at the request of his uncle, but he will have to avenge the death at the hands of the deceitful wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and her cunning brother Pedro (Louis Vanner). It will take some time, but it's a fun trip with one of the best musical scores on the record. As for this battle in the saloon, I enjoyed the sound effects of kung-fu every time I tied the blow. <br /> <br /> Would you like to exaggerate the story? After the first fight with Pedro, Johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lips, which he manages to lubricate Pedro's entire face. Similarly, when Pedro slaps little Pepe later in the film, he did not cut him, but by the time Johnny arrives, Pepe’s face is covered in blood. <br /> <br /> “Johnny Hume” is probably one of the best of the genres in which Clint Eastwood is not. Like Johnny, Mark Damon is a fairly suitable stand, but without a seething appearance. It seemed that Carradine was a replacement for the obligatory character Lee Van Cleef, but not a bad guy. At first, the exchange of personalities between Carradine and Johnny did not seem to make sense, but all of this was due to the end of the film. You knew that every minion would get his due; time mark for everyone was part of the wait. <br /> <br /> If you are interested, the main character has nothing to do with the character of Nick Adams from the classic western series “Rebel”. In this film, Johnny got his name from a shootout that he once conducted in Yuma. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most unique element of the story was related to the way he connected things with the evil Samantha, who dragged her backstage everywhere. After firing at Carradine, she makes a hasty retreat before Johnny can avenge. Still alive, it seems that Carradine is trying to shoot her and misses, but Johnny and Sanchez do not need much time to track her to the dessert, where she died without water - Carradine was aiming at her dining room.
