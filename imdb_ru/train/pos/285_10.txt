I just wanted to say that no matter how low-budget a film is, it needs to be shown to the whole world what these films are. We don't read like that anymore, instead people want to watch movies. The release of this series on DVD made me want to read the entire series and want more. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 FILMS. Please do not change characters, it destroys the effect. Because I loved the actors who played the characters. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 FILMS. I want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now the films are here to portray. This is not enough for us. GOOD JOB!!!
