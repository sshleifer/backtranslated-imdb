I was dragged into this film about four years ago by my French girlfriend, the actress. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour I sat in my awkward place in the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hating this film to hate myself and even hate the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I don’t know what happened, but I was dragged into the movie like I hadn’t appeared for years. And this despite the fact that one of the projectors broke down, and they had to do each replacement manually. I was in the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe that great movies draw you into the world, make you a part of it, and then send you to talk with friends over a cup of coffee or a drink. This movie made it. It was one of my best movie experiences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
