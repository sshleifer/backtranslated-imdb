The name has many meanings - a boxing ring where disagreements and controversies, as well as a wedding ring where Mabel feels trapped, and Jack feels that his problems will end, and the cause of the problem, a ring bracelet that Bill gives Mabel as a sign of love. <br /> <br /> Former professional boxer, Dane Karl Brisson, got his start in the films of Alfred Hitchcock in The Ring. Very young Ian Hunter, who had such a long career in the cinema, plays Bob Corby, who catches the eye of pretty girl Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis) at a fun fair. She is engaged to Jack Thunder with "One Round" (Carl Brisson), but that does not stop her flirting with Bob. Bob is persuaded to go "one round" with Jack. He goes through several rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer, and he and his manager came to the exhibition to find out how much Jack is as much a fighter as they heard. He offers to take Jack, and Jack leaves with his boorish coach (the great Gordon Harker) to get rich on plans to marry Mabel when he succeeds. Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day, but the deep attraction that she and Bob feel for each other is still there. Jack is suspicious of training to fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Finally, a film about boxing, where the hero doesn’t go off the rails - Bob behaves himself and does everything that could be a champion - if only Mable acted the same way !!! She left him for Bob's sake - and the battle is mighty in the end. This is very realistic - it takes the last 20 minutes of the film. Due to the dampness and enthusiasm, Jack is almost knocked out - then between rounds, reuniting with Mabel, gives him the courage to win. The question is, why would he want her to come back — from the very beginning she didn’t think of starting an affair with Bob — why wouldn’t she do it again? <br /> <br /> The film is filled with symbolism. Jack, shaking hands with the promoter, passes into the hands of Mabel, taking the bracelet from Bob. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, the bobs bracelet slides over her hand. In the end, Jack sees Mabel's reflection in a bucket of water near the ring, and this gives him the confidence to continue. This is a great movie that will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
