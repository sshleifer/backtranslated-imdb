I went to see Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge !! .. A fan of Tom Cruise, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say ... I was just amazed by the film and especially the performance of the TS, I thought it was a very touching film, and it was not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews and decided not to watch it, I am so glad that I was â€œforced to see it. The strange thing is that I can not say why, all I can say is that I found it completely involved and could not stop thinking about it the next day. As for what I felt about the film, all I can say is that this is not a plot line (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) is about the people and events that shape their lives, and how small events, like getting into a car, can change everything ...... <br /> <br /> As for what the critics wrote, yes, the original may have been a stunning second film for Alejandro Amenabar, but it was a completely different interpretation of the subject, and by no means a narcissistic remake in favor of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can't even write a couple of banal, banal sentences to describe a movie, just go and see it !!!! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that this is not a weighted thoughtful review, but so what. This is not such a movie.
