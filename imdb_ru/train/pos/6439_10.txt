I visited this film twice during the week and can summarize with just one word (which I usually do not use lightly): “Great! In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Who deserves the Oscars and other awards, if not this Swedish team that created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film, when everything that has been said (and left unsaid) throughout history is combined? Just as the character of Daniel Dareus causes so many feelings and long-repressed feelings in the people around him, so the film does the same with the audience: you go out with a buzzing head and full heart. Quality goods! The next time you ask yourself “what is the meaning of life,” perhaps think about what you feel after such a luxurious experience as “Like in Heaven”: happy, contented, filled. Saying this with Mrs. Dalloway Virginia Woolf: "There are enough moments like that."
