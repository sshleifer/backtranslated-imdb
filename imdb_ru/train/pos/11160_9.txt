This is truly the greatest Swedish film of all time. He is not only revolutionary in his narrative, but is also one of the first films to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindstrom are the two most intelligent and ingenious filmmakers in Sweden today, and this film truly demonstrates this. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna m√§nniskor" (Adults) is a hearty and fun story about adulthood and the question of whether we would not be better off without it.
