Before I saw this, I was removed from the topic, but this is no ordinary triumph over the history of disasters. Although technically it concerns blind Tibetan children climbing a mountain. Everest, that's not all. This film shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two prominent blind adults, leading children, Eric and Sabriou. Eric is an American blind climber / athlete, and Sabriye is a blind German academic who opened a school in Lhasa, Tibet. Both of them are exceptional in their own way, but they do not agree with what will really help children to gain confidence. Eric wants them to reach the top, while Sabrie wants them to enjoy Eric as a role model and have fun at the moment. The nuances are complex, and everyone leaves, not knowing exactly who was right, or if the whole recovery was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they faced before getting into school. The most touching story for me was about Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. I could see a whole film about his life and was happy to know that thanks to the school, he now leads a successful small business with some of his fellow students. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you'll like it.
