This film was recommended to me by a friend. I have never seen an advertisement or trailer, so I didn’t know that Clooney was in it, and he wasn’t disturbed by the fact that his role was so small. I thought the whole cast was appropriate, and found the film quite enjoyable in general. The opening scene with a small gangster gang, standing on the side of the road and looking exhausted and exhausted, immediately caught my attention. He had a way to tell you: “Don't go, it won't be boring,” and it really wasn't. It turned out to be an interesting, carefree comedy with enough turns to keep you in place until the very end, but when the final did come, I felt a little deceived ... just a bit. Events continued to accumulate, so you expect them to continue to accumulate, but at a moment that I cannot determine, it seems to level off, making the ending a slight disappointment. I suppose I was expecting a bigger climax explosion, but it turned out to be rather restrained. If you are watching a film with this in mind and can live without George Clooney's high dosages, you should find this film very interesting and worth seeing. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but this is probably a rare find in the United States.
