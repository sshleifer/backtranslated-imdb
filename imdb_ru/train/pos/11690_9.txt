This film I could not wait to see. Well, it took so far to decide to actually rent it. It was worth it. This movie made me laugh from start to finish. Chris Rock is fun, no matter what movie he is in. However, it must be very close to being its greatest. If you are looking for a family film, that is, to adolescence and above, then this is one that you cannot miss.
