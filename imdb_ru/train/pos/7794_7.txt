Victor Núñez fills this unsentimental story about the emotional journey of a young woman with a sense of poetry, rarely seen in movies. By poetry, I mean the sense in which the literary and cinematic come into play. There is something very literary about the film, almost as if the novel had been adapted page by page. In this sense, the film reaches a depth that many cannot; but it is also rather slow on other occasions, undercutting the depths that it once reached in favor of ennui. The movie star Ashley Judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here. She fits in as Ruby's lead as a glove, almost as if she doesn't have to act. She has a real movie star in the film, and she was not able to convey the same charm in her later films, although she was impressive in ordinary life.
