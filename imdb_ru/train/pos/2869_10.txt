First of all, I want to say: “Thank you, Disney, for finally releasing the movie“ Cinderella ”on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animation movies on DVD (including 1999 limited editions)! What are you going to do next? You go to Disney World !!!!! Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> In any case, Disney remains magical in his 1950th animated classic movie “Cinderella”, which puts fabulous on the map films. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her half-sisters, her date, a glass slipper, a pumpkin that turns into a carriage just to say “Bippity-boppity-boo!” And, of course, try to go home by midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: this is a great old fairy tale that children like, now in the form of a movie (and also on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> “Cinderella” - thanks, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
