and anyone who watches this movie will agree. This film was made in those days when the plot, the credibility of the character and the theme really did matter. <br /> <br /> Gene Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter attract attention. Ritter is in great shape as an "Mo" informant; she survives in the Bowery district of New York, acting as a stool pigeon for the New York police. <br /> <br /> The only other film I've ever seen in Peters is “Niagara” and it certainly proves her acting ability here, complete with a Brooklyn accent. Widmark is respectively formidable, like an antihero who must understand what is right, despite his need for money. <br /> <br /> The photo is gorgeous. Neon, the subway station (although it looks cleaner than the real one!), Is the Shack Harbor, where Widmark lives as transitory. Excellent use made from the city, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; many flavors and appetites of the city are turned here; The political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10
