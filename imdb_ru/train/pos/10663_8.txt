Here is a great double bill Barbara Stenvik on one disc. The first film - and believe me, the smaller of the two - is the MGM film "To Please A Lady" (1950), in which she is paired with Clark Gable. In fact, this is a star car in which Gable, as usual, dominates the film due to its presence on the screen. Here he plays a macho rider who gets a bad press from feminist reporter Stanwyk and the battle of the sexes begins. Of course, after long ceremonies, they end up in each other’s arms, and all this comes to a predictable and pleasant conclusion. A little frivolous, but Gable and Stanwick - two icons of the Golden Age - make it watchable! <br /> <br /> But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature - an amazing and completely unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953, this is a wonderful little gem of a film that is not dated one iota! Here, Stanwick plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and the mother of their little son, Lee Aaker, on vacation on a deserted and distant Mexican beach, when tragedy suddenly happens. A dilapidated wooden pier crumbles, grabbing Sullivan under a heavy pylon, and guess what? Yes, there is a wave. Not a soul has yet been seen, and she is unable to free him. Stanvik is sent by car for help. After traveling some distance, the only help she can get comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict (Ralph Meeker), who - in exchange for his help - wants more from her than money or a change of clothes ("I will do everything to save my husband "). "). Is she or not? <br /> <br /> Miker runs away with a picture! It turns into a rather brilliant performance! As soon as he enters the film, you just can not take his eyes off him! Actor in the glowing style of Brando, he surprisingly never made the most of his film career. Despite the fact that he gave magnificent performances as a disgusting, disgraced cavalry officer in Mann / Stuart’s outstanding western “Naked Spur” (1953) and as one of the doomed sacrificial French soldiers in WW1’s powerful drama “Ways of Glory” (1957) The real contender for fame was Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillane's Kiss Me Deadly in 1955. His performance in The Hazard was supposed to work wonders for him, but he had only so-so career in films. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Thanks to this release, Jeopardy can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir. Memorable, tight and exciting thriller thanks to the excellent performances, the hard direction of John Sturges, the clear monochrome cinematography of Victor Milner and the atmospheric score of Dmitry Temkin. Separately, however, is nothing special, with the exception of the radio version of Danger and the trailers for both films. <br /> <br /> This CD is also part of the Barbara Stenwick box set dedicated to her centenary. It is hard to believe that a lady would be more than 100 years old if she were still there! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - MGM winner!
