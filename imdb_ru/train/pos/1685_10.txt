I first saw this film around 1990, and completely died of laughter. He became a cult favorite in the circle of my friends, and we quoted him by a drop of a hat (“I'm going home in my bag!”). Needless to say, humor is still there, 15 years later. During Halloween, it has become a tradition to put many of my new friends into this film (well, you can still buy it on Ebay!) I found that Halloween candy is much tastier when your tongue is firmly set on your cheek ... and In this film has it all: pathos, anxiety, unrequited love, nobility, and the list goes on. Royal Dano provides an awesome soul game as the Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who met a bad ending. Here you really feel with the old guy from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will miss some levels of humor in this movie. The creators received a very subtle in many ways due to rash comments, small thin costumes in other sci-fi films and even a scene torn from the pages of Wile E. Coyote! <br /> <br /> Don't spend too many thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people are fun fare without the need for cavil and should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they are not they will know that they are being ridiculed ...). <br /> <br /> -Now, excuse me, I will go behind the bar "Zag-nut" .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / artist
