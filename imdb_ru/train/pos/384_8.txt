The film's version of the extremely emotional and influential novel of Alice Walker in 1983 (written mostly in the form of letters from the central character, Got to God) was a huge success for Oscar, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> In the role of being offended and Waking up Seli, Whoopi Goldberg showed her best results on the screen for several miles. Not far from her was Oprah Winfrey in the role of Sophia, a fiery woman, tamed by fate. Others in the cast have depicted characters that Walker so clearly presented on the page: Danny Glover as Albert, the Offensive Husband of Seli; Margaret Avery in the role of Sugar, the power of change for good; Willard Pugh and Ray Don Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Bobian as Corrin, wife of a preacher; and the very bored Karl Anderson (otherwise known as Jude in the movie “Superstar Jesus Christ” of 1973) as Samuel's preacher. <br /> <br /> Beautifully picked up and sensitively written “Colored Purple” rightly refers to its source revealing history in order to attract viewers of the full-length drama.
