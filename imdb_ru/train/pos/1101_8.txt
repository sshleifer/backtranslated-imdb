While prices have risen dramatically, and some details are outdated, any homeowner who is struggling with the problems of home ownership should get a lot of laughter from this film. I know what I did. <br /> <br /> Mr Blandings, a New York advertising manager, decides to move his family to a Connecticut suburb and build a beautiful home there. He gets into one jolt after another, from mortgages to lawsuits and construction difficulties, as the costs and construction schedule continue to spiral out of control. I thought the funniest scenes were when the Blandings hired a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig hundreds of feet, but never find water. And yet only at a short distance, in a few days, in the basement of his future home! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Mirna Loy give plausible ideas, because a couple of exhausted frosts are overloaded with problems that they couldn’t even imagine and Melvin Douglas is even better than Blanding’s lawyer and a family friend. <br /> <br /> The only caveat is that social relations have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is depicted as a naive chock, who has no idea how much additional trouble she causes, and there is a black maid (horror!). So do not watch this film through the lens of the social lens of 2003, and you will like it even more. <br /> <br />
