I first saw a track from this DVD on a hifi show in November 2006 in London (I was still not thrilled with the cream !!). This was done through the high-end Arcam system, it sounded great with dts. I needed to get this DVD and I will tell you that this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever watched. The performance of Cream at their age was simply stunning, and the sound quality was the best I've heard on a music DVD. The type of music that you like, this will certainly grow on you. It is the brilliance of their performance that will make you look again and again. Even new musicians these days do not cut mustard, as old rockers do.
