“BLOB” is a great horror film, not only because of the brightly horrifying images of its almost unstoppable, flesh-dissolving title character, but also because it contains the real message of the society. In many ways, it's a “good horror movie.” Smart storyline immeasurably help solid actions of the entire composition. Two romantic leaders, Steve McQueen and Aneta Corso, bring amazing depth and sentiment to the process. They are misunderstood, but very well-intentioned young people, and it is very easy for them to root for them. <br /> <br /> This is a pro-social film, and its juvenile delinquents cause problems mainly because of boredom, and not because of some evil character flaw. Steve McQueen's rival seems to be the enemy in the early stages of the process, but quickly joins McQueen's campaign to save the city from the attacking invader as soon as he sees McQueen's seriousness. Thus, the situation of the character, which at first glance seems like a caricature, suddenly develops depth and human realism. <br /> <br /> The authorities' initial skepticism regarding the wild claims of children turned out to be wrong - and once the threat Everyone admits that all conflicts within society disappear. This combination of goals and the verification of “troubling” adolescents becomes official when Aneta Corso’s father breaks into the school to find the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the balloon. On any other day, the entry into the school will be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile offender - on this particular day it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. At this crucial stage, it becomes clear that there are no lines of separation between the young and the old. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film, which recognizes the “generation gap”, but it is assumed that it is more imaginary than real, and, given the real crisis, people will naturally unite to restore order. “Blob” is the perfect tonic for depression that usually accompanies the “Night of the Living Dead” (1968). <br /> <br /> Much has been made of a cheap but innovative film (and spectacularly!) visual effects. They are certainly smart. Many of the anti-gravity stunts we see in Blob’s performance have been achieved using miniature sets designed to rotate. The camera was usually attached to televisions in a very strong “locked” position (the light sources had to be connected in the same way so that the lighting remained constant when the room was turning in one way or another). These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time, when the room turned slowly - the silicone ball was very slowly oozing, and its action needed to be speeded up. In a sense, it was like stopping a moving photograph, but using a drop of silicone, rather than a hinged puppet. Even today, the effects are striking and bizarre. <br /> <br /> A very good movie with the mysterious name "BLOB", which you definitely need to watch.
