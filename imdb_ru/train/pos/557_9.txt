A couple of years ago, when I was driving from Skagway, Alaska, to Dawson City, Yukon, and was impressed by the scenery, I can't help but wish that this film, despite its beautiful color and scenic views, would be shot in a real place. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a great place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. When the story goes to Dawson, I feel that Anthony Mann, who used the outdoor space so well, could get the most out of it if he appeared in that place. James Stewart is here again a man fighting inside himself, one of his side does not want to interfere and help people who prevent him from earning money, while the other simply cannot take his eyes off the dead people. Ruth Roman is an ambitious woman who doesn't care whom she steps on, Corinne Kalvet is a sweet girl. Mann manages skirmishes very well, but the main thing in the film is how well he copes with outdoor scenes. He uses outdoors as much as he can, and he is helped by winter landscapes, the predominant whites, as was the case with the greens in the Naked Spur and the brown ones in The Man of Laramie. Like all Mann Stewarts, this is a traditional Western, with a difference in the development of Stewart's character, which is more complex.
