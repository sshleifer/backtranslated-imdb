Wang Bianlian is an old street artist known as the “King of Masks” for his mastery of Sichuan’s art of change. Liang is a famous opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as an individual. Liang is concerned that precious art should not die with Wang, and therefore he sows the seed of the heir into Wang's consciousness. The film is about prejudice, male dominance, state of the art, values ​​and, most importantly, warmth. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie in loops. Everything matters. This is a long story that has been edited so well that the length of the film is only 91 minutes. Full satisfaction. Five minutes is a feature film, the next five minutes is a sad film, the next five minutes is a thriller. He just changes his mood, as his main character changes his face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. The story and the script are impeccable. The actors are great. Both main characters are artists, you can tell how they came out. Very impressive. He was not even nominated for an Oscar. In the same year, “The English Patient” received the best Oscar film, and in the category of foreign films “Nick” won. “Nick” was fine, but the less “English patient” said the better. Watch 9/10.
