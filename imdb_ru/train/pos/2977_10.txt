I want to use so many words to describe this film, but can't I do it? This film is a film that is worth seeing if you just want to sit, laugh, cry, and then pee. I'm serious. Do not watch this film if you are easily offended by profanity, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything else related to nature. Being a woman, and it may not even be a factor, I can watch this movie again and again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely gorgeous. Along with all their other debuts, I think Baseketball is a winner. I laugh now, just thinking about some of the nonsense that they do in the film. Watch movie!! That's all I'm going to say. It's hard for me to leave this comment, because I'm one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who almost all lines swear a word that falls from their lips when they speak. So I keep it at a professional level. Best movie. Hell yes !!
