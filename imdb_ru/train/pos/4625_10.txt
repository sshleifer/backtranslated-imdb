"Shakespeare Behind the Bars" was the most amazing and delightful film that I have seen all year. This is about the prison program, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where the prisoners rehearsed and every year for the past 14 years they performed various plays of Shakespeare. The film tells about how they shot “The Tempest”, from casting to performance, and in the process we will learn some amazing things about these people who are preparing for the most serious crimes. The truth is indeed stranger than fiction - if someone tried to adapt this story to a science fiction film, viewers would never have bought it, but knowing that this is real, it is literally breathtaking to watch; I gasped loudly when I learned of the crime of one particularly gifted criminal. It looks like some funny episode with Oz, and all the more interesting because the characters and their strange stories are real.
