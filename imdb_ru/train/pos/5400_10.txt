This film is a brilliant lesson in Japanese history, begun at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the Shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalists who wanted the emperor to return to the throne to rule Japan. In fact, I had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) gives an excellent insight into From Okada, one of the four Hitokiri (= Killer Man) from Bakumatsu. He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. In order to have a good life, he becomes a servant of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Rionosuke of the Sword of Rock). Hanpay is an ultranationalist politician who allows his Hitokiri group to kill many high-ranking pro-Western politicians in order to achieve their political goals. From Okada, she follows her leader, not thinking about what they are doing. As long as he has the money to go and drink and spend on his whore. Okadaâ€™s murders are becoming more and more violent during the film, and he prides himself on a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful portrait of the life of a simple samurai who is stuck in political affairs and truly naive to understand what is happening. First, after he was betrayed and tortured, and he always spoke to Sakamoto (a samurai who rejects violence), he changes his ideas and attitudes. But it's too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Okada ... <br /> <br /> Sintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff are great. Each actor achieves his role. Sword fights are very unique and fast ... probably faster than a few movies at the moment ... <br /> <br /> Check if you have a chance !!!
