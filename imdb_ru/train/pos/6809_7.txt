It was a pretty good movie. I'm not sure that this is considered a spoiler, but I did not want to risk it. In any case, near the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a verse from the Holy Scriptures, and then quotes another from memory. I cannot remember the first passage that he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a regular passage that many use to protect the death penalty . It is a pity that prosecutors dare not quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first judge of the Supreme Court in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. It is a pity that we have lost this point of view in America.
