Another very good movie Mann due to the combination of father and son Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comedy conscience of Stuart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see a young man pick up a fork or bend. "You are mistaken, Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stuart) gives the impression that he cares only about himself, but it is clear that he cannot leave Brennan. John McIntyre is great as Skagway's law, with due respect for the attributes of justice over its reality. Another key theme is helping people and, in turn, helping people. The Solitary fellow cannot do either one or the other, and suffers for it. <br /> <br /> The inscription above plays on Tatumâ€™s claim that he cannot live without coffee. This nicotine addiction is fatal. Probably the first and last time on screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, and now I have a DVD.
