The film will go to the cinema in Indonesia only this year (2007), two years after its official release, and after many illegal DVDs hit the public. Obviously, the popularity of the illegal DVD has led to cinemas, and the public is still watching it. <br /> <br /> The film is a magnificent epic that captures the Japanese culture in your home. Sometimes it is a humorous form that tells about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, since ordinary Kabuki theater plays are what he considers boring. <br /> <br /> At first, the audience may be a little confused about what history we are following, but when the story unfolds, we see that love between a man and a female demon leads to a great story for a new theatrical play Kabuki. <br /> <br /> The viewers remain in ignorance if this is a story that is supposed to have really happened in Japanese traditions and mythology, but that does not matter. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told with love for the theater Expression, bright colors, humor and tragedy make this ride on a roller coaster in Japanese cinema and in the theater magnificent. <br /> <br /> Let yourself go completely when you watch this movie, try to watch it in a movie, and not on TV at home. <br /> <br /> Although there is one critical point: the soundtrack is sometimes a little annoying. Although this is basically great music, there are a few moments in the film that I think they should have chosen more dramatic music. But perhaps the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose lighter moments in music.
