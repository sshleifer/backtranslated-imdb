Despite the fact that the film is recognized as the best film about the difficulties associated with building (or buying) a house in the country according to your requirements, it is not the first and not the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were featured in the film by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. And about fifteen years ago, Shelley Long and Tom Hanks led the Pit of Money. The first was about moving to a 18th century country house, which ... well, needs work. The latter was about building your dream home - in the late 1980s. Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as BLANDINGS, based on the autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) noticing the tight corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharin Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising manager (in 1948, he earns $ 15,000 a year, which is tantamount to making $ 90,000 today), and lives in a luxurious apartment - which he rents in New York that day! - he feels that they should look for something better. He and Muriel go to the country (Connecticut) and soon find the old ruins, which both can imagine as the dream house they want. <br /> <br /> And they both fall into a financial wormhole, buying land and building can lead to. On the one hand, they are so reckless about the idea of ​​building such a house that they do not pay attention to the warning after warning them wise if cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a pleasant sardonic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe quietly sucks his chops), with a check before double checking the correct land value in this part of Connecticut. Bill notes that he paid five to six thousand dollars more for the land than it cost. There are problems with the water supply, which both Blandings simply do not think about, such as hard and soft water, which leads to a softening of the water Zis - Zis. They discover that the projects they have in mind and developed together with their architect (Reginaldom Denny) cannot be cheap if Muriel decides to build a small rookery that no one had planned. <br /> <br /> Rising project costs are a matter that baffles Jim. He was put in charge of the Wham account (Spam was a popular result of the Second World War, when the public began using it as a meat substitute in light of its success in the military). Jim can't handle it (he's not alone - one or two other managers have been messing with him before). He came up with the following piece of “poetry” (?): <br /> <br /> “This little piglet entered the market, <br /> <br /> It was pink and beautiful, like a ham. <Br /> <br /> He smiled in his tracks, <br /> <br /> When they gave him an ax - <br /> <br /> He knew that in the end he would be "Wham"! "<br /> <br /> His secretary looks at him as if he needs a straight jacket when he reads this! <br /> <br /> Jim also increasingly suspects Bill’s attention to Muriel, although (in this case) Bill is perfect. But he is always there (Jim always forgets that Bill is thoroughbred and that he doesn’t let Jim and Muriel make so many mistakes.) All three have setbacks. Best of all, they are locked in a semi-designed room just like men are leaving for the day, they can't open the door, and Jim (in a panic) tries to break the door. with the help of rams. It breaks the window and the door opens itself. <br /> <br /> The film works quite satisfactorily, all the actors seem to enjoy. This is one film that (despite the change in price and salary levels) really After all, most Americans dream of having their own home and always have. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, the painting company used a delightful scene with Peaceful Loy and Emory Parnell regarding the paint work that Parnell has to do on different rooms. She carefully shows the different shades of red, blue, etc., which she wants, even giving polite Parnell the only thread for the correct shade of blue. The commercials hinted that the painting company has a wide selection of colors for your work. They proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings" in the introduction of commercials. However, you can imagine how Parnell no-nonsense copes with the situation when Loy leaves him with his painting team.
