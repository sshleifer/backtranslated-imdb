I would like the "70s show" back on television. It was the greatest show ever! They should do episodes between other episodes, but, of course, this will be confusing. But I would like him to come back and do more episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely fun. You can not laugh without seeing the episode. There is a really funny part in every episode, and besides, the show was much better when Hyde and Jackie met. These were the best episodes. "This is the show of the 70s - the best." It will be and always will be the best show. It was very sad when the show ended. They have to do new episodes.
