*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Equipped with memorable moments (for example, the above quote, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four guys who go into the wild forest to go rafting. and leave the big city for a while and find that their fun will soon go wrong. This is not a Hollywood movie. Virtually no special effects at all, the settings are very realistic, and nothing is coated with sugar or beautifully done. The city boys look like city boys, and even the tough guy Louis, whom Bert Reynolds portrayed with great precision, is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip. This is a great example of a what-if movie. What if a few friends went down river rafting in a forest area that none of them knew, and eventually desperately tried to avoid being tried and convicted for the killings they had to commit to save their lives? <Br /> <br /> The film clearly has a very strong element concerning the social and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. When the four guys arrive at the forest at the beginning of the film, they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live there, and they talk to them as if they are not sure whether they will understand or be able to communicate. This communication unit is most memorably illustrated on the duel banjo scene, in which they try to fill up a car and a truck and force someone to drive vehicles for them. While Drew is clearly an inbred and probably mentally disabled boy on the porch of a duel with his guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis has some difficulties with buying gas, and Bobby comments on the genetic flaws and how sorry it all is. . When the boy turns away from Drew, who offered to shake his hand after their colossal jam session, Bobby tells him to give a couple of bucks, knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react. <br /> <br /> This is the thing we see in the Liberation that creates so much tension that must follow. This wonderful scene, in which there was a lot of fun (including the funniest scene “The Dance of the Cattle” to “Brother, where are you?”), Ended up being awkwardly unaware of what to do with each other. These people are apples and oranges, and they live according to completely different rules of life. People whom Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed meet on the hills, grew up separated from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which do not include the fact that you will not kill. Embarrassed by their awkward behavior, the four friends set off for the river, hoping that the oddity would end and the adventure would begin. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When they are briefly separated from each other, Ed and Bobby run to the hills by the river, which quickly become unpleasant. Uncertainty about how these people live - what was set above the scene - comes into play to create the most stress during the scene. I think that a good sign of a quality thriller such as this one is that the tragic element of the film, namely attacks and real killings, takes a very small amount of screen time, but remains one of the most memorable parts of the film. There is no causeless violence, all this is done with an obvious goal, and it gives a strikingly powerful effect. <br /> <br /> This step involves the violent confrontation of two completely different people, and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other. Traveling the rest of the river after the assault, which takes up most of the film, creates impressively effective stress and keeps you on the edge of the seat without bombarding you with so many events that you become numb. This is surprisingly effective when we learn that Ed could well have killed the wrong person on the rock, and the tension in the film does not even decrease when the three surviving crew members reach the bottom of the river. because they give a dubious explanation to the police about what happened there on the river, and why the deputy’s son-in-law disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing film that testifies to its success, because it is absolutely obvious that such a film is meant to shake people up a bit. Hillbillies is a human (that is, more realistic) version of the subhuman-goon, which can be seen in children's films, but rather similar films, such as Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, none of which can be compared with a perpetual film like Liberation. When we follow these four men during their fateful weekend in the forest, the natural element is so real, and we recognize men so well and so subtly that we, as individuals of the audience, are truly the fifth member of the team. It is not often the film can face this way.
