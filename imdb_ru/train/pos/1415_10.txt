I saw the German version of the film on German television, and I was really amazed. I usually like to watch documentaries, but I can't remember seeing one that is better than Earth. I knew some scenes from a Youtube video that I found randomly watching. I also remember how I saw fragments of the film in multimedia stores running on high-definition televisions shown. After watching the film, it becomes obvious to me why the footage is so popular among Youtube users and multimedia store managers: it’s just amazing and exciting that you can’t look at the screen, regardless of whether you are interested in nature. Documentary films or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitation, 10 out of 10. Of course, there are more exciting films, but with regard to documentaries, The Land is definitely one of the best in its genre.
