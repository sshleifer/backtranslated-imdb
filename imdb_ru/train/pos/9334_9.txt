“Sensual Nurse” (1975) was an Italian sex comedy starring Bond's ex-girlfriend Ursula Andress. Dude, she was hot in this movie ... She was folded and built like a brick house * @ #%. Ursula smoked hotly in this film. I have never seen a nurse's clothing that would have filled up before. <br /> <br /> Ms. Zvezda Andressa is a nurse who is hired to care for a rich older person. Even the one in the house seems to be banging his boots. One night, the nurse decides to measure her grandson's temperature and give some necessary T.L.C. her ancient client. The old man takes to his nurse, and it angers the rest of the family. What kind of work did her family hire? Will an eccentric fall in love with his car? How can she deal with an eighty-year-old crown and the rest of the family? To find out, you need to find a copy of a SENSITIVE Nurse! Italian, but poorly dubbed into English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
