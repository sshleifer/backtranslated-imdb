The more I watch Nicolas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Watching this film now (in 2005), I see that it does not quite fit into the genre of films released in the early 90s. I do not think that this can be considered a film of noir, but at times it is rather dark, mainly because of the lighting and the strange personalities of the characters. <br /> <br /> Typical performances of each of the three main actors who coped well with their roles. However, I thought that the characters of Hopper and Boyle remained undeveloped, because sometimes it was difficult to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper loves him or hates him. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to give it to the director (that is, when he first saw the sheriff). In general, this film is definitely worth seeing. *** 1/2
