If you have not seen this excellent film about life in the 90s (in Los Angeles), then you missed a special treat. This is one of the most amazing and strongest films ever made about the life of Americans in the 90s, and it is even transferred to the modern world in which we live. It covers everything from raising a child to prejudice (in more than one way), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, egoism, etc., and the list goes on. This story reaches its climax, and then, when nothing else matters, it always returns to love with friends, family and love of life. This helps us to delve into ourselves and makes us look for what we want from life. Makes us ask questions about ourselves. Have we done enough for others, do we like it, etc.? ??? Sit back and enjoy the superbly made and emotional film that I am sure others will like for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the wonderful performance of Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover in this film. These actors are amazing and really show the true radiance and meaning of the message being sent to all of us. These are 3 of my favorite actor for life after watching this movie more than 10 years ago. I still enjoy it all over again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with him and do not forget to count how many times you see a helicopter fly by and try to figure out its symbolism for the film ... mmm ... I almost forgot that this is probably the very first serious Steve Martin in any film he ever made. He also works great in this movie. This may come as a surprise to most of you. Relax, relax and enjoy really good filmmaking .....
