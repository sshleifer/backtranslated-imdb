A very nice movie in which you know how to watch old musicals / riddles. It may not come close to the riddle of Agatha Christie or even to “Thin Man” as for the film “Noir”, but it is much more interesting than your typical musical “boy meets girl” or “let's make a show” behind the scenes. Like a musical, it’s not Busby Berkeley or Fried, but it can enhance the classic “Cocktails for Two” and the weird “Sweet Marijuana”. The film works in real time during the stage show, the premiere of the film “Vanity”, where murder is discovered behind the scenes, and soon more. Is the killer detected before the curtain falls? Of course, but the search is interesting, although somewhat predictable and overshadowed by flashes of comic relief (fortunately, in the shape of the slim goddess of girls from the choir Toby Wing). A stupid policeman is just too stupid, the lead character is too cute, the lead lady is too merciful, the bitchy prima donna is too nasty, and the voice in love with her is too selfless, but as stereotypes go, they are pretty stylish. There are a lot of really gorgeous girls from the choir, who are even better chosen than the girls for the Busby Berkeley musical of the same period, who sometimes tend to be a little plump. Yes, this film could be much better than it is, and the number of Duke Ellington is embarrassing, but if you like to immerse yourself in old films, it will be an extremely painful journey.
