Bizarre, stupid, budget fiction about the Williams family living in the California desert. They witness a series of events that increase in their level of strangeness; apparently, they fell into a space-time deformation, where the past, present and future collide. <br /> <br /> This is a reason for a parade of very funny special effects - a constant light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have each other, a friendly and tiny alien who enchants her granddaughter and so on. This photo has a little imagination, if not more. <br /> <br /> Richard Bend's very pleasant music, which includes work on special effects from artists such as David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Curan, and, importantly, Pretty Family are key assets. This causes a sense of childish amazement; It may well be that this is more of a hype for children (or children within many of us) who are able to disguise any flaws in the narrative or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to resist; this is a short and pleasant (80 minutes) entertainment, and the meritorious contribution of director John "Bud" Cardos (from the "Kingdom of Spiders") and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
