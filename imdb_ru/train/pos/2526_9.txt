That's cool! In Story Mode, you go from punk to professional. You must complete goals that include ice skating, driving and walking. You create your own skater and give him a name, and you can make him look stupid or realistic. You will be with your friend Eric throughout the game, until he betrays you and removes you from the skateboard team (you can choose a team to participate in) and then you will create your own team! There are many levels in Pro Skater 2 by Tony Hawk, such as New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (although not in story mode). You can unlock secret skaters such as Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals such as letters SKATE, letters COMBO, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can create a pedestrian goal and write what they say. If you get tired of doing this, you can make ready-made goals in ready-made parks. The only thing I didnâ€™t like about this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive. 9/10.
