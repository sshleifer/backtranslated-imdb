The beautiful new edition of Zabriski Point is playing in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full evaluation of the film. Hopefully, the new listing means that a DVD will be released in the near future with some insightful additions. <br /> <br /> I remember watching ZP when it came out, and thought it was a crash. This time I was absolutely delighted and would classify it as a masterpiece, close to a slip. The first part of the film is the Los Angeles temporary capsule of the late 60s, I then lived there, and Antonioni masterfully worked on getting the essence of this place. Kudos to production designer Din Tavularis, who found incredible places and did outstanding work. <br /> <br /> The reprint I saw lasts 1 hour and 50 minutes. This is prohibited to persons under the age of 16 (or 18, I do not remember). I suspect that there are quite a lot of recovered materials in this print. SPOILER - I wonder how many scenes of sex in the desert were originally cut. What looks today, by today's standards, looks pretty boring. <br /> <br /> In the film there is no music for the soundtrack, while in the film for almost 1 hour. Before we heard extraneous noises, such as radio broadcasts, etc., D. Antonioni dared to do that very much. I remember how much was done at the time because of the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Fr√©chette and Darya Halprin. This time, Frechette didn't bother me. Halprine is weaker, but gradually improves as the film continues. <br /> <br /> For me, most of the material on student unrest looks like a stock. One shot has a different aspect ratio and is distorted on a wide screen. Of course, there are actual staged shots, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni took a few pictures of Frechet flying on an airplane. It looks like he really flew - in some frames there is no blue screen or dual screen. <br /> <br /> I hope to return to watching the movie a second time. Recommended to all fans of Antonioni.
