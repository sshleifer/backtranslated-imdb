I had the opportunity to see this film at the Appalachian Film Festival, where he received an award for the best film. This film is superbly made, with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble. My favorite performances were from Yusef Kirkur, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. In addition, there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, which I was surprised to find that this film was made with a small budget. Writer-director Adam Jones, who, I think, also received an award for his work, copes with the management. The audience liked this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laugh throughout the whole movie. Definitely a must see.
