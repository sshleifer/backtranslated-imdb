worth looking at, especially with a good turn of a journalist with honesty, you expect a great storyline, because “Gray Owl” is not exposed as a fraud, but it is not, and this adds a generally optimistic and inspiring theme and drama about this story and the movie. <br /> <br /> This should be the best performance of Brosnan to date; he is perfectly convinced, like an English boy playing Indians. The outstanding scene is the return of it? Aunts? where Brosnan and two mature actresses make a wonderful scene full of nostalgia and life lost with such a small dialogue, just expressions and good leadership. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known, and the idea is so universal and important that it is a pity that this film did not receive the best recognition, perhaps in time it will become a bit classic and a sleeper. I hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done, Dickie Attenborough and the cast.
