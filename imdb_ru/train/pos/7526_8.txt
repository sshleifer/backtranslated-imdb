Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural con artist whose previous films exposed the artistic surplus of the sixties and the total stingy eighties. With “The Infamous Betty Page,” she directs her unwavering perspective on America’s fifties, an era shrouded in moral righteousness by Joe McCarthy, while at the same time experiencing the beginning of a sexual awakening that will lead to the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-author Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic on the sexual symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of the epoch and how its pure, unscrupulous sexuality revealed both predatory instincts and unclean thoughts about culture, untouched by the beauty of the naked body. If all the details of the film concerned the life of Betty, then why finish it before the most tragic period begins. Obviously, Harron is more interested in America’s attitude to sexual images then and now. Together with the fearless lead performance of Gretchen Maul and V. Mott Hupfel III’s stunningly atmospheric cinematography, she perfectly copes with this task, taking the mirror into the past and forcing the audience to explore 21st century’s own “enlightened” attitude to pornography. As America is choking on new conservatism, this film is needed more than ever.
