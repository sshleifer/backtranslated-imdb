My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Cinema and alternative cinema (a small room with uncomfortable seats; the public had to wait until the movie changed) were perfect pairs. <br /> <br /> The movie had a lot of clich√©s, but Fassbinder presented them so cleverly that I found them really funny. The sound was also great (sometimes it sounded louder than the dialogue). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to be in its place. And I liked the way post-war time was presented. A real pleasure! <br /> <br />
