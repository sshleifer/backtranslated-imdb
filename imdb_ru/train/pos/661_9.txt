Ho ho, killer maniac! This energetic screen version of the great horror story from EC Comics is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of cable television series ever created. Directed by Robert (“Back to the Future”) Zemeckis makes the most of Fred's witty script (“Night of Creeps”, “Monster Party”) of Dekker, in the center of which is a ruthless ambiguous housewife (well played by Mary Ellen Traynor, who was married to Zemeckis when she was starred in this episode), who kills her abandoned husband (a beautiful cameo of Marshall Bell) on Christmas Eve, hitting his head with a fire. Complications arise when an insane, crazy killer dressed like cheerful Chris Kringle escapes from a nearby shelter and decides to pay Treynor a decidedly unfriendly visit. Alan Silvestri’s eerie, exhilarating score and the typically polished cinematography of Dean Candy further enhance eerie fun. And Larry Drake (gentle gentle giant Benny from "LA Low"!) With his terrible hiccups, freak, mad shine in bright green eyes and mocking, really evil grin turns into sensational bloody Saint Nick.
