So, the first few seasons took some time to start working with special effects, but from the very beginning Hidden Frontier provided consistently good storylines and presentations and was always ready for the mistakes they made. They advise people to watch the new episodes first so that they can see how good the series is and how much it has changed since the first episodes. The actors have a fantastic camaraderie, and this can be seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of guest actors who leave their mark on the show and with the fans also testifies to the show, as the storylines are getting stronger and stronger. The show put forward barriers with its various plot lines — depression, addiction and mass homosexuality — and they may have lost a few people in the wrong direction, but this is what Star Trek was. He portrays these storylines in a smart and emotional way, finely and smoothly coping with them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they used some of the characters from the story “Trek”, but they made them fair - such characters as Shelby, Lefler and Necheev, greatly underestimated in the series, were revived in the books “New Frontier”, but after a while they lost the hiss when Peter David, when leaning more toward wild fantasy than serious science fiction, and HF show these characters in a completely different light that serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and get to know the people involved. They produce shooters for each episode, so fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people doing it in their spare time, with dedication that will make many professional actors open their eyes wide! <br /> <br /> What this series has now reached, now ending in 7 years, on such a limited number of resources, cannot but surprise - to unite people, to inspire others to do the same. HF will live long after it ends, while people still enjoy the reason it started from the very beginning.
