... and I mean it. If not literally (after all, I have not seen every movie ever made!) At least, obviously, among those I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The rule of thumb with IMDb is this: sometimes movies rated very high (for example, a Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap fragment called “Oldboy”) can be really bad. But rarely is a film worth watching actually below 6. This film is very worth seeing. A shame. <br /> <br /> True, I protest 10 points. The film is not perfect. His true rating should be 8 or 9. He has some flaws in the game (especially Belafte), the script sometimes wanders. However, we have one of the greatest directors of all time, Cheshan Jan Kadar, directing the two greatest actors of all time: the beloved, great Zero Mostel and the magnificent Ida Kaminska in the acting / Poetic / moral tour of strength. A pair is made in heaven! It is true that this film, with minor flaws, does not condone the average audience, but is interested in watching an excellent (though not without criticism) film from an incomparable director who gave us The Store on Main Street. (the best film about the Holocaust in the entire history) should not be missed due to the fact that some stupid IMDb rating system decides that American Beauty is better than Angel Levin. <br /> <br /> This is not the case.
