This is one of the few “what if” situations that made me think. It was amazing to hear them talking to each other, and remember all the wonderful (and not so) things that happened between them. I really think there is a very good chance that this happened, as the film suggests, and they actually made peace with each other. These are good memories for every fan, and asking what really happened between them would be selfish. What an AWESOME movie it was. The comedic aspects of the film were wonderful. To think that they were together to settle the relationship between them in this way is a comforting thought for people who want them to have a chance to clear the air with someone who they have not reached. Seeing John in such a caring, easy-going character was refreshing because he heard all the garbage that was being said about him ...
