After Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan set fire to the world of sitcoms, the next creation of Graham Linehan became a forgotten gem for the BBC called “Hippie”. Although they were created by a couple, all six scenarios were written by one Arthur Matthews. br /> Filmed in London in 1969 - Ray Purbbs, hippie, is the editor of the anarchist magazine. His friends are his flatmate, very calm and marijuana smoking Alex, his “girlfriend” is feminist Jill and not too smart Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was great like Ray, but he is excellent in everything he is. The Citizen Smith was felt in this sitcom. Ray was very similar to the will of Smith, tried to defeat society, but failed. Finally this comedy will be released on DVD in March, I can't wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and so far repeated on terrestrial television - my memories are not very good in the comedy series, but I clearly remember two episodes, the first of which is the opening Hippie Protesters, which I thought were great the beginning. - where Ray is protesting against the sandpaper, and another episode was “Hippie Hippie Hippie”, which I think was episode 4, again a pretty clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, the comedy received a negative reaction from the audience (I can not understand why). The BBC ordered another series, but Arthur Mathews decided against this because of a negative reaction. Well, I can't wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Hippie Dippy Hippie - Series 1, Series 4.
