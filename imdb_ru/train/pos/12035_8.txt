I recently stumbled upon this film on TNT five minutes later while on vacation in Florida ... (hey, the hotel must have been idle for a while, right?) At first I was surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart -or role film on trotyl. I mean, “Bring me crazy” is no longer SUCH an old thing, is it? <br /> <br /> But I was stuck with this, and was completely surprised and entertained. Melissa plays her part psychotic Jennifer. Auxiliary cast (Nick, a fraudster's former friend; Karen, her best friend; and her life-controlling parents) added a greater degree of believability. The turn at the end was a good conclusion to this story about a girl who, it seemed, was always one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
