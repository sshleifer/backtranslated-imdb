TEMPLE OF Sherley A short item. <br /> <br /> In the Pakhta-Pit cafe, a strong roughness may arise when local children dressed in diapers arrive for a lunch break at noon. <br /> <br /> A primitive little movie - a parody of war movies - gives a few chuckles, but a little bit different: tiny babies, speaking hard, can begin to turn pale in a short time. Shirley Temple, who plays the two-faced French Miss, is not particularly popular in this celebrity show. The main point: real signs of hot temper, when several babies suddenly recover and are really soaked with milk. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or ignored, short and one-component plots were useful for Studios. as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short story was completely different from the dynamics of a full-length film, something like writing a first-class story, not a novel. Cost-effective for production in terms of budget and graphics and capable of depicting a wide range of materials, short scenes have become an ideal complement to the film films of art studios.
