After reading tons of good reviews about this film, I decided to take it into circulation (I bought it on DVD, hence the “spin” pun ... I’m a moron). The beginning was all I hoped for, the perfect installation (along with some quotes that I heard on various Wu-Tang albums) that was supposed to be a good movie. But the plot I heard was so wonderful, so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except Lizard), I guessed how poison it was. Plus, the only cool character dies in the middle of the movie. So the plot was not very good, but at least it was good kung fu, right? Wrong. The fights were very short and few and far between. Of course, the different styles were pretty cool, but I wish the fights were longer. I kept hoping to see the Lizard run and make some crazy joke on the walls, but this did not happen. I was hoping to see the Centipede linger a little, but this did not happen. I was hoping to see Scorpio in the film for more than 7 minutes, but this did not happen. In short, little is happening. Fighting is all pretty routine. Do not be fooled, because this film has a plot, it does not mean that it is good.
