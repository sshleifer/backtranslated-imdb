I saw this film as a child, and it broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished ending ... I grew up on many great anime films, and it was one of my favorite films because it was so unusual - the story of injustice, cruelty, loneliness, life and choice, can not be undone and the need for others. Chirin is created alone when the Wolf kills his mother, but the Wolf is also alone when Chirin follows him up the hill. The wolf does not kill the lamb, although every night he says: "Maybe I will eat you tomorrow." The tape of this is broken and degraded in my age and use. I will repair it and see the movie once and pay as much as in childhood. Such stories, with such depth and feeling, with this complexity of meaning, are very rare. This is a sad story, but I have never met a catharsis made more beautifully. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it in childhood.
