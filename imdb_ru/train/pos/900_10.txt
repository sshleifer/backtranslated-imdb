This is one of the best movies in Bollywood, which I have seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way about this. This film is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more films or similar films to support the culture of South Asia. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao played well in this, and their couple also attracted many people to the movies. This is a must-see film, this is a family and romantic film. This film is also from the creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This film is the best at the moment ... the situation of the film was beautiful, which also attracts attention. This film is a must see ... I recommend it to everyone !!
