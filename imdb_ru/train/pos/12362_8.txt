I will quickly talk about the issues of the film here: it was a very fascinating story about the destructive qualities of all-consuming passions; The young Italian, who cannot emotionally connect with her imprisoned politically radical fiancée (partly because of her apolitical attitude and free approach to life), finds solace and passion in a new young lover with whom she has explicitly sexual relations. Anxiety, rage, tenderness and passion, which revolve in the atmosphere of this story, is equivalent to impassive silence, which seems to embrace two sides. This gives the film an anxious mood that pervades the entire political struggle, which otherwise would be lost to the viewer (unless you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics in the 1980s). I found the film to be convincing ... that it was somewhat destroyed by the useless oral sex scene that the actress performs on male roles ... it is not modeled and leaves little to the imagination. There are other sex scenes in the film that I think were necessary because they emphasize the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the oral sex scene, I feel, diverts attention from the real story. Until this point, it was smooth to sail, and when the infamous sex scene (which at one time caused a lot of hype) appears, it’s like getting to a checkpoint. This is terrible and unnecessary, and I am in a camp who believes that the film would not have been harmed if the scene had been removed from it. And what is regrettable is that this particular scene can keep people from watching this intriguing film, which I think is worth seeing, because under the surface so much is happening, emotions and more confusion are layered in the subtext. <br /> <br /> Overall: A wonderful movie interferes with a very unnecessary sex scene.
