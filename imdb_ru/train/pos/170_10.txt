Do not listen to grumpy critics this time, it is a pearl! Young rich Joan and her brother are penniless after the death of their father - and now they have to earn a living! She naturally becomes a reporter, and he, just as naturally, is a crowd driver! Thanks to the wild coincidences of their careers meet ahead thanks to gangster Clark Gable. At the same time, there is a chance to swim in moonlight under the pile of cute young things, and Joan to play a couple of risky dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam shovel). <br /> <br /> But nothing should be taken seriously - all this is good fun from those wonderful days to the code when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks great and demonstrates most of the emotional range that will give her career such longevity (thank God, she stopped dancing!). Gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he was not yet a star and therefore should not have been a hero. Nice to see him play something else. And William Bakewell is excellent as a poor bewildered brother. And there are some great montages and shots, courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who promotes the play with amazing speed - and sometimes winks at the audience! Great pleasure!
