This film is a great example of a film that divides people into 2 groups. Those who get the joke, and those who do not. People usually attack things they do not understand. This film has a comic style and charm that has not been unique since. This is a BIG comedy ... and a BIG novel. This is a perfect date. The perfect movie for those who want good carefree laughter. And if your perspective is too tense, perhaps this film is not for you, and you may need to consult. It is unfair that Paramount has been keeping this film on the shelf since the early 80s, never seeing daylight on a DVD. However, they believe that the urban version of “Honeymooners” is a good idea. I find it strange that my two favorite romantic comedies have never been released on DVD. The other is Gene Wilder's “Greatest Lover in the World”, in which Fox has been sitting since the early 80s ... And yet “From Justin Kelly” is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who took the time to try this will enjoy “From Justin Kelly,” I'm sure that one is enough to “get”. Sometimes with age, people lose their sense of humor ... Or sometimes it just becomes obsolete, and they find comic satisfaction in repeating "Full House".
