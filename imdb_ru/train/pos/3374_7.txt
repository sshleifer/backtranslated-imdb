Soilent Green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction films of the 70s, and is still very convincing even by today's standards. Although the apocalyptic touch and environmental premise (typical of that time) still seem to be flawed and a bit outdated, they still cause concern and make you think. The quality level of this film surpasses most of modern SF films due to its strong cast and some intense episodes that I personally consider classic. New York in 2022 is a depressing place to live, with overcrowding, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and a complete shortage of every vital food item. The only available form of food is synthetic and is distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (in great shape) plays a policeman investigating the murder of one of the most prominent leaders of Soilent, and he stumbles upon scandals and grim secrets ... The script is sometimes a little supersentimental, and the climax really doesn't come as a big surprise, yet the atmosphere very tense and supernatural. The sequence of riots is really exhausting and easy is one of the most terrible moments in the movies of the 70s. Edward J. Robinson is ultimately impressive with his latest role, and Joseph Cotton (“The Blood of the Baron”, “The Disgusting Doctor Fibes”) plays an excellent (but too modest) supporting role. This is science fiction in my book: horrible and inevitable extinction for humanity! No fancy spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
