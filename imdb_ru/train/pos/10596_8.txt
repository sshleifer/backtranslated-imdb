Every time this film is released on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times says that this is a satire against the post-war world of rationing and the welfare state. I don't think that's the point of the film. The film parodies the spivs (petty criminals who ruled the black market) and the housewives league who fought against government restrictions, but were indeed the organization of the Tory front. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, the film raises the political / social situation, but in the end, people understand that they need all the controls to ensure a just society, they want to be British and confused, not foreigners . <br /> <br /> But I donâ€™t think they return to being exactly like they were before.
