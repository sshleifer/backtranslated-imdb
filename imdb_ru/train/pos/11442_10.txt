<br /> <br /> So, not being a poet myself, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. The light movement of Goldsworthy, when he brings the beauty of nature into his work, is captivating. Watch as he sticks his tongues on a web hanging on a tree for a few minutes while he talks about his work, and then get rewarded when the camera cuts a wide frame. Be amazed at the ease with which it works, and then become aware of the futility when a light breeze knocks the whole network. <br /> <br /> The genius of Goldsworthy, apparently, knows no boundaries, since his inspiration is nature itself. It is in a significant change in the nature of his work, although completed in its own sphere, that it becomes integral.
