Illudere (to be misleading) comes from the Latin verb ludere (to play), so you are warned about the "spy game" as fierce, but at the same time complex and smart (!) Activity associated with the complex and an absurd and vain personal story, whatever it may seem; and yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of betrayal and devotion, the raw material of any relationship, from personal to social; after, many years ago, I was able to finish the book, it was a revelation! At first, I was so bored if it were not for the amazing writing style (I really started to love Le Carre after this novel). The protagonist does not hesitate at all: he decided to atone for his weakness, following the path of faith in friendship and love, or not? After this novel, you can clearly understand the darker version of Greene’s “Our Man in Havana”, written by Le Carr with Panama’s Tailor; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comic way, or in both. There is no emoticon that would support decent human qualities in the “ministry”, or at least there is no point in presenting it in this case. The BBC did an excellent job with these episodes from LeCarr's novels: the actors are great, as are the places and the scenery; Of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. However, be careful, even if it seems funny to someone, the aftertaste is bitter.
