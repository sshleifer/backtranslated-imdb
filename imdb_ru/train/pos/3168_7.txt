This is a sweet and sad little history of cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who fled to California to avoid unsuccessful relationships in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American working in manual labor with the aspirations of rock and roll glory, but little concrete to offer to a potential partner. Kyoko “marries” Ken to be able to stay in the United States on a permanent basis, realizing that, although they will live together until she receives a “green card,” the marriage will be only in words. It soon turns out that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or, perhaps, in the same “time zone”, hence the name of the film. As an immigration attorney, I saw how such “arrangements” take on a life of their own, so I was pleased to see how well the director developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
