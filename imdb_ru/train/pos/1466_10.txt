FIRST MOVIE GUIDE (2007) **** <br /> <br /> If a loving movie makes me a pervert, so be it! <br /> <br /> If you are a real tramp, then I’m sure that you can’t get enough films about filmmaking, and I don’t mean necessarily a dry documentary, and then. I mean the total discourse about the experience of watching a movie. Well, if so, if I had a little experiment for you. <br /> <br /> Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph and Joseph, if you are interested) noticed that the philosopher and movie lover Slava иižek give their analysis Cinema with some impressive (and often outrageous) things takes on everything from a silent era Chaplin and up to the modern era of the Wachowski brothers, analyzing, exploring and pontifying the psychosexual foundations, socio-economic, political and, of course, defiant definition of the magic of the film with its unremitting, resolute and almost insane dissertations. To explain how Bates’s PSYHO house is actually the mirror mentality of conflicting Bates of Normandy with every level, such as his Ego, Superego, and Eid, is one thing, but then offering the same thing to every Brother Marx in a single rhythm is a wonderful test of faith that defeats the skeptic layman. <br /> <br /> Although I had no idea who Жižek was ?? does it resemble a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalm, European actor Rade Serbedzia and the hyperkinetic energy of cinematographers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese ?? with his hissing tongue and passion, the master looks like a mad prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes deftly inserts Zizek into several backgrounds of film fragments spiced up, creating a humorous tone, but still allows ranting and delirium to continue full throttle, pausing for a dispute in three acts covering a range of films such as Kubrick , Lynch, Hitchcock, and films as diverse as The Wizard of Oz, Red Shoes, and Fighting Club. <br /> <br /> There is something for everyone, and if one person can provoke a dispute or at least a reason to discuss the themes of the film ?? even if they are Freudian / Jungian fault ?? then I say that this collection of movie theory is worth seeing. Look for it now, if you can, before you begin your home video; this is the only way to evaluate it.
