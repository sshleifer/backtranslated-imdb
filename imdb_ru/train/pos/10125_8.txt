This film is the first of the trilogy of the Miieks Triad Society, and the trilogy begins a good start. The films in the trilogy are related only thematically, and these themes are in fact evident in all of his films, if you look closely enough. The Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman trying to keep his younger brother from getting too carried away by a rather extreme gang of outsiders trying to reach the top of the yakuza Tokios. The younger brother is a lawyer, and the triad team needs it more and more as the film progresses. The action of the film takes place in very harsh conditions, and therefore it is quite cruel and tough. Miike did worse, but since this is a serious film, he hit you very hard. As usual, there is also a lot of perverse sex, mostly homosexual. The film is in many ways a typical gangster film, but with a great drive and true grittyness. If youâ€™ve only seen distant Miikes films (Ichi the killer, Fudoh, etc.), then this is worth checking out, since this is a kind of compromise between his aggressive excessive style shown in these films and his more serious side, as you can see from other films of the trilogy. As in the case of Miike, there are at least two scenes that you will NEVER forget (see for yourself and determine which ones are for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
