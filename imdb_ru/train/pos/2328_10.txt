Ideal films are rare. Even in my favorite films, there are usually flaws: the back window sometimes looks a bit scenic, the character of Chris Elliot does not work on “Groundhog Day”, the musical score in “The Best Years of Our Life” is too foolish, the beginning of “The Night of Cabiria” - but this film is perfectly executed from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The script is great, the acting is great in everything (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are awesome, the whole cast shines), the direction and photography are inspiring, and the music is touching without being intrusive (like some Miramax points, which too manipulative). Every sad moment really moves, every light moment makes me smile. This is truly one of the best films I have ever seen, and I would like to see more of these films. <br /> <br /> I am glad that Reese Witherspoon became a celebrity after this film, but I’m sorry to see that her latest films are much more escapist and stupid than this serious film about real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! Must see.
