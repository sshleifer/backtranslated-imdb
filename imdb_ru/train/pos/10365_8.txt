This is a true story of an Australian couple accused of murder when their baby disappears. Meryl Streep, as always, is excellent, and she manages to hold our interest, although she plays a character who is not particularly likeable. <br /> <br /> The media madness that surrounded this case in Australia reminds Sam Sheppard of the Ohio murder case during the 50s. These real-life situations show that the media can actually influence how a criminal case is handled. I remember well the Cleveland Plain Dealer with a huge headline that said: "Why is Sam Sheppard in prison?" The prosecutor eventually gave in to this unrelenting pressure, and Sheppard was convicted and convicted. Only after several years in prison was he acquitted. <br /> <br /> I love films that tell a true story, do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good films telling the story of innocent people accused of crimes include Hurricane, Thin Blue Line and Moment of Destruction. In particular, the latter is another Australian film that is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
