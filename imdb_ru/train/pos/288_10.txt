This movie was very good! I’m a teenager, and my friends and I all like the series, so this shows that these films attract the attention of all age groups. I recommend this to everyone. My favorite phrase in this film is when Logan Bartholomew says “rosy cheeks” when he talks about his little daughter. He is such a great actor, as is Erin Cottrell. They go so well together and have such a wonderful chemistry! I really hope that they can work together again. They are such attractive people and very good actors. I finally found films that are nice to watch. Recently it has been difficult for me to find good films that demonstrate good morality and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not stupid.
