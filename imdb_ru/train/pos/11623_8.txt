(You will understand what I mean when you saw Red Eye ...) <br /> <br /> Overall, Red Eye was better than expected. It starts with a slow start, and builds slowly. But by the time it ended, it is a blow! <br /> <br /> It’s hard to pinpoint what makes this thriller so ... exciting as I found it. Except that in simple terms, the director did a decent job of getting you involved in what would have been an ordinary conspiracy otherwise. I rather tend to forget that I watch a movie. It says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors, I think, are the “intimacy” of the victim and the bad guy ... and with time you begin to truly relate to the victim. Few 8 out of 10, more like 7.5 ... but this is very good!
