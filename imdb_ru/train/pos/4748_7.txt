History will never receive a reward, but this is not the point ... the script was just entertaining and intense enough to make room for incredibly choreographic battle scenes. Who needs a story with such fights? In fact, it is worth looking only for this reason. If you can handle blood, from which there is a lot ... none of this has been made realistic enough to make it hard to look at. I gave him 7.
