Dr. Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely hidden from the radar, but it's worth it. It really reminds me of old TV shows of the 30s and 40s. That's why I would love to watch subsequent films ... but, judging by the rest of the output materials of Full Moon, there simply wasn’t enough boobs to satisfy a typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely unnecessary scene of sacrifices, there were too many for a family audience - and this is regrettable, because without them it could be a magical feast in the style of Harry Potter that the children would eat. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasn’t sure that Miss Nipar didn’t leave the film “A” on this film, it was very believable. No seriously! In any case, it is a shame that they did not have the money to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could be a complete childhood phenomenon.
