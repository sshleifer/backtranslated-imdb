I am 14 years old, so you probably think that I have never heard of George Burns, Walter Mattaw or something like that. I heard that George Burns was in this film and that he won an Oscar for it. I have been a fan of George Burns since I was ten. I recently watched the movie “Oh God,” and I really liked it. This one was also very cool. George Burns did a great job. Like Walter Mattaw (this is the first time I've seen him speak). And although they did have really small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a great job. The special thing they were shooting would be great if it really was done. Let me say this, if you're a fan of George Burns or Walter Mattaw, you should see this movie right now!
