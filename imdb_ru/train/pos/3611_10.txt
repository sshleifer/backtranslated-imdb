I watched this film after seeing Blue Soul and other Michelle films, I thought she had a dark future in this business. I was extremely wrong after seeing her performance in “Girlfight”, I was amazed at how she captures the emotions of one of them. fighter, but also a warrior. In this film, she tells her father about how she treats her and her brother, how she expresses anger when she hits her target. Her heroes, who study the curve in the film, cannot always build a wall and hide from love, or simply because she has the power that she does not win. I believe that this role was ideally suited to Michelle, although she did not have previous experience, the director saw talent, I criticize myself for not seeing talent in her.
