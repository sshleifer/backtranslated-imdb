“Citizen X” is a superbly told true story of hunting for one of the worst serial killers in history. What makes this story even more convincing is where and when it happened; Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Soft Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Victor Burakov (superbly played by Stephen Ria) is a newly appointed judicial investigator of the militia of the Rostov region. He discovers past and present unsolved murders, apparently by the same person. The killings are not disclosed because no one has ever tried to properly investigate the evidence. He is forced to find and stop the killer. His only tools are his dedication, skill and honesty. Its obstacles are corruption and the political ideology of the Soviet system, which impedes the search for truth. His naivety would have led to failure, if not for his boss, Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov’s desire to bring the killer to justice, even if the official party says: “There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!” <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. Places and sets are wonderful recreations of the Soviet life of the last days. Randy Edelman's score is especially good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with intensity and sharpness. It was a film for HBO Films, created for cable television, and they became an excellent resource for films that otherwise would never have been made.
