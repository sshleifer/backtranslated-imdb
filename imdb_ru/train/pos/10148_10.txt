I would give this movie a few stars, simply because it was a “Lifetime” presentation, actually filmed in the scene presented in the storyline - here in New York. Most on this channel, no matter where they are - in rural areas of Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, Los Angeles, etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or in any other Canadian region. <br /> <br /> But if there ever was one that deserves the highest rating - 10 * on this site, this is the film. Of course, not for originality, because this story has been made many times, in many variations, and several very similar to this particular one. This was also done quite often on the big screen, with megastars of the past and present from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, etc. And Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan and many others. I can remember at least another 10-12, equally outstanding, from the past to the present, from the top of my head, which can be added now, and perhaps there are many others that can be remembered. <br /> <Not to be booked, but I want to say that, in my opinion, this is one of the best genres I have ever seen. I caught it by chance at noon Friday, at a time when I had a TV just because I spent a couple of hours after a particularly hectic week. I have never come across this film for 8 years since its creation. And although the two leads did enough for most of them to know, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors that I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother), whom I saw in some things from her youth, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend), who was outstanding as Gram, a formidable juice loan, tough street guy from "Shuler". <br /> <br /> A chance meeting and communication between the best friends of both leaders, like plot romance, with the correlation of their essence with Anna and Charlie, revealed to everyone later, is often done. in fact, it enhances it). <br /> <br /> While checking out some other comments, I fully agree with those that are most positive. The main word describing this film is “ENTERTAINMENT”, in capital letters. This adjective describes performers; characters; Chemistry between all characters and between them, in any combination presented, and all minor and even minor roles. <br /> <br /> I like movies with a “tougher edge”: “Rounders”; escapist Schwarzenegger / Stallone fare; "Goodfellows;" even such classics as "Casablanca", "Gone With the Wind", "Citizen Kane". But for pure, uncomplicated pleasure, this one was outstanding. With a small share of their budgets, this was equal to the results achieved by You Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle. And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not do better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan; Colleagues and support staff here were equivalent to those in these mega films.
