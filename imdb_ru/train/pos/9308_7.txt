If you are used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles such as Tom in the Millers Crossing film or Keaton in the Ordinary Suspects movie, I recommend you watch this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all the actors in this film give really great performances. If you have about eleven bucks (it's close to nine pounds), I say, order it online or rent it in your favorite movie rental location. It is guaranteed that you will laugh if you usually like gangster-type movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy - this is one of those films that you will never forget, and will watch again and again. You will talk about it as much as your friends will ask to borrow.
