At War Inc, we find a logical continuation of the ongoing outsourcing of all war related activities that we are currently doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you're familiar with the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root, and Blackwater abroad, you're already halfway to a full assessment of the satire of Cusack's latest work. Cusack plays a corporate contract killer named Brand Hauser, who finds himself in Turikistan and organizes a trade show in the newly liberated country as a cover while waiting to gain access to his latest target. While there, he finds himself intrigued by an anti-institution reporter, played by Marisa Tomei and chased by an overly sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. We get to know Hauserâ€™s past, which includes the tragedy that has haunted him since then, and a corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon, who actually performs the whole operation for him (and Joan Cusack plays it merrily). Although some moments are played properly, they are not always the moments you expect, and small touches often take you by surprise. All managers turn into solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but otherwise she does a very good job and does her best to dispel her image of Disney. Tomei is funny but discreet, while Cusack owns almost every scene they are in. To be fair, they are given good material. The authors write a good script with enough turns and visual jokes so that you do not laugh all the way to a predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from evaluating it higher, because the story is distorted and turns its way to the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your comedy, full and physical, this is probably not enough to interest the entire movie. On the other hand, if you like sly comedy and wide satire, this is for you.
