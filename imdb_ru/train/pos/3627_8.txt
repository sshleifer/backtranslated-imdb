What an interesting movie experience! I expected a juicy children's movie and found that I like it more than teens. Take a napkin, it's not sad, just "moving" in parts. Finally, it feels good to click for the whole family. Note: This is 2+ hours, so think about leaving a home for the smallest “squirer”. AP
