I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the three best films I've ever watched. He has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows what life can be like at university. There are 3 main storylines: skinheads, blacks and homosexuals. I was intrigued by all the stories, but most of all I liked the storyline about Kristen, who struggled with her feelings towards another girl. The end was great. After watching the movie plus 25 times I'm still crying. I would give this movie 11, but I have to agree on 10/10.
