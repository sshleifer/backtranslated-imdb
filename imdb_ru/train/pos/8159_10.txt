Good. This film is pure pleasure. It always has such a fierce horror, mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy. The dentist is really starting to lose his mind, and it's nice to see how he does it. This film is for some people, though. Either you love him completely, or you hate him completely. A good movie that you can rent and see when you no longer have cases. Also recommended: Psycho III
