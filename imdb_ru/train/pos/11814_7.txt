Usually, when we use the word “escapist”, we mean it negatively; The big version of Dick Tracy by Warren Beatty proves that the escapist can be good. This is really one interesting movie. As self-titled, dressed in a yellow, fearless title character, Beatty creates a detective story to which we can all relate: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses. <br /> <br /> From there the rest of the characters are almost a world for themselves. Tess Trueheart (Glenn Headley) is charming, as one would expect from a husband of any crime fighter; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), perhaps the most confusing person; Big Caprice Boy (Al Pacino) is a middle villain: ruthless, but cool. Other characters include Mumbles Challenging Speech (Dustin Hoffman), 88 Keys Super Musical (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Katie Bates also play a major role. <br /> <br /> Oh wait a minute. I did not even explain the plot! The plot includes Tracy, trying - and still failing - to find a way to grab the Big Boy. At the same time, some very strange events take place in the city, the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main thing in this film is to watch, If Warren Beatty had problems with his age, then he used it well here. “Dick Tracy” is one cool movie.
