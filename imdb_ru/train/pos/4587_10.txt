Although boiled John Woo is my favorite movie number 1. But I must say that the police story is my favorite movie number 2. I say this because tricks, fights and actions my favorite part of the movie is when Jackie Chan jumps off the railing an escalator, and the mall grabs a pole surrounded by Chrismas lights, and slides down the pole through a skylight and finally lands on a hard marble floor. OH! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something at $ 14.) VHS is a new line of home video. Any questions or comments, please feel free to respond. (I am only 14, but I know where you can find any film ever made.) If you are looking for a film everywhere and cannot find it, please answer me. Thanks and good night!
