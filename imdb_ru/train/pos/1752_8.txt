Spoilers Sex huh? This is one of the most basic parts of human life. However, do we ever take it too seriously? People always want more, even those who receive it daily, and if you are unlucky, there are potential consequences that change (create) consequences. Ironically, people claim that we all begin to have sex at a younger and younger age (despite the fact that Victorians marry and have children in early adolescence), so those who go to virginity become harder. In the first big screen of Steve Carell, he plays a man who reached 40 without controlling it. Addressing us with countless incidents related to hooliganism and extreme sex, not to mention profanity than the episode with “EuroRash”, the general plot of the film and its principle does not sound funny. It is therefore pleasant to surprise that among all the inappropriate, unsuccessful jokes, there are an incredibly large number that hit the target and leave the audience in hysterics. <br /> <br /> Andy Stiizer (Carell) is a good guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament. At the same time, he clearly takes life too seriously, and after he was invited to poker as a necessary fifth member, Andy's friends reveal his secret. At the age of 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for many reasons, but mainly because of pity, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romani Malco) offer Andy's advice with one goal. To rid him of suffering and lay him down. <br /> <br /> One of the few good things about “The Lead” is just a matter of time when Steve Carell takes the lead. own. Impressively, in the "40-year-old virgin" he does not disappoint. Showing a hopeless, shy virgin to perfection, Carell is a revelation as he gradually becomes more confident as the advice begins to help. <br /> <br /> Carell is not alone in his actions. Rudd, Rogen, Malko, and Catherine Keener, as a love interest, are all excellent. Rudd is a personal favorite, like David's sick love, who falls apart several times and shares the best scene with Rogen when they argue about homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise in this movie is not how many jokes hit the mark, but in fact this is a smart way to flip the message on your head. Obviously, the film was created for conservative America, and the whole tone of the film turns from a simple story about sexual conquest into a story about safe sex and abstinence. A virgin does not need sex to complete his life, he just needs confidence and true love. A worthy message to preach and a significant improvement in what you expect to see at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It is strange to see a rough comedy, which is always funny and well played, but low, and so, “40-year-old virgin” is exactly that. Add also a promising message, and you're on your way to a top-class comedy. Amazing joy
