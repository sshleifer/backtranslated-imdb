The bartender just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Just so easy, and he succeeded. Not only in its goal, but also in the creation of a wonderful film, especially visually. He is able to beautifully and smoothly use pans, slow sequences, tracking shots, shots of cranes, etc. This gives the film a very relaxing look. <br /> <br /> The story of the life of 8 completely different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: the party they all attend, which is also a turning point of this film. The beauty of this picture is not how the characters influence each other (in comparison with a similar, of course, best film, such as Magnolia). I just don’t think it was Bartender’s idea. Beauty lies in the various details of the experience that people go through, which creates or destroys their lives. The bartender very successfully tells those small stories that describe a little experience. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for the film is also excellent, but not surprising, since we know that the Barman is also a very successful composer and musician in his dEUS group. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing, which contributes to the sunny, smooth feeling of the film. In other cases, we hear funk pop / rock tunes that give some scenes the power they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one drawback, and this is the last half hour. Was it a runtime environment that upset me? Or not the last scenes that were fresh and accurate than the scenes before that time? I can not understand ... <br /> <br /> In general, a beautiful sunny film, which raises the Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> (This is the wind that flows through the girl's hair on a sunny day, makes her even more beautiful; this is the fresh wind that makes you relax when he passes by you at a crowded party when someone opens the door; it’s the wind that carries the perfume from this beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park that you just met a week ago; it’s a breeze .....) <br /> <br />
