A talented detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) cancels his overseas trip to investigate an obvious case of suicide, which he suspects that he has good reason to suspect that this is something much more, a rather complicated murder! <br /> <br /> As for the mysterious murder films, it's better than this one, no. Populated with suspicious characters, they are all associated with a dog show and everyone has very good reasons to kill Archer Coe’s obvious victim of suicide, it’s really hard to figure it out or to wrap your head around it, but boy, doesn’t it turn out to be exciting to watch it unfold. Even the police, the coroner and the district attorney turn out to be colorful, sophisticated characters, adding a level of unexpected harsh realism to the process of it and enhancing its overall “funny” factor. I especially liked the comic scenes with the participation of the coroner (performed by Etienne Girardot), who, as he always thinks, was rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured people while running. Also Detective Sergeant Eugene Palitra. Heath welcomes, often later delightfully funny at his expense, a critical comment during the Vance investigation. I can’t think of any real criticism to give this film really, except maybe it’s not very well dated. However, the film does not interfere just fun to watch. Look and see if you can wrap your head around this mystery. Highly recommended to try!
