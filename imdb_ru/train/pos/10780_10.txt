By and large, my second favorite cartoon Spielberg did after Animaniacs. Even if the ratings were low, so what, I still enjoyed it and loved it, it was so funny, and I loved the cast, wow, Jess Harnell and Tress McNeill were there and were fantastic, the whole cast was great, especially the legendary frank welker. <br /> <br /> I would love to watch this cartoon again, it was so awesome, and the jokes were great. I can also remember a funny moment when brain cameos were played in it, you hear his voice and he plays the instrumental PATB theme, it was fantastic, I love it in those cartoons when cameos appear. I want this cartoon and Animaniacs back, I loved them
