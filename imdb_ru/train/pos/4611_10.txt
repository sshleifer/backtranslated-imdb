Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Cantonese / English subtitles <br /> <br /> One day, five years ago, the world was obsessed with “The Matrix”, and I was probably one of the few remaining fifteen-year-olds who still believed that “Terminator” was better than "Matrix". I was just a simple teenager, I was looking for a good fighter, and then on a television station, which I never watched, there was a bright light, a small station known as SBS. One evening I noticed in the television guide that the film with Jackie Chan in “Police Story” would be made later. When I was fifteen years old, and I only saw “Rumble in the Bronx” and “Rush Hour”, I said ... “WOW AWESOME”, sat down to watch it, and constantly shouted “WOW AWESOME” during the film. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the Police Story trilogy, I learned that I had found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie is played by Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong policeman who is looking for a major drug lord, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Bridget Lin), is being held by the police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is assigned to protect her. Things are going bad — too bad — when the Chu case is closed, and he decides he wants to kill Fong and Chan. <br /> <br /> “Police Story” is one of the greatest action films, and, of course, one of my favorite Jacks. Chen movies. It starts strong and ends with one of the most incredible sequences of actions ever taken. Everything is fine between them. However, some funny pieces may seem a little tasteless to many people ... <br /> <br /> Like the story, this is still one of Jackie’s best works. For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is much better at this than the actor in the intense and plot films of New Police Story. This is not "Miracles", but perhaps this is good. <br /> <br /> Police Story is one of Jackie’s best works. This helped me catch on Jackie Chan's films and should be a good start for any potential Jackie fans. The bad news for those who see it in the first place is that Jackie Chan's films are not much better - 10/10
