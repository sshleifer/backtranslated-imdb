This is a pretty decent example of a film noir. In the early 50s, the Communists are trying to steal weapons secrets from the US government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a suave pickpocket. He gives a pretty decent performance, but nothing about him. The interesting thing is that he was not only an anti-hero, but most of the film was an incredible anti-hero. This is not very normal. Jean Peters appeared so-so, like a prostitute with a heart of gold. This great actress, character, Thelma Ritter, shines like a dove-stool. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of twists, tricks and tough conversations in the plot. At the end of the film (at the subway station) there is a fight scene, which was quite sandy and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think noir fans (like me) will love this movie. For non-nora viewers, this may seem a bit dated, and the whole Commi story is a little overdone.
