Most Stoogephiles believe that this is the best stack with a short beat, and they are right. Curly scream, dressed in a dredge as "Senorita Cucaracha", and Mo and Larry in excellent form as "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto", respectively. Christina McIntyre's beautiful operatic voice is fully involved - she really was a trained opera singer - and that’s great. The great Gino Corrado is hilarious, like a pompous Italian singer, terrorized by puppets at a society party. Some really fun jokes, good guidance and very tight editing make this ascent to the top of the productive Stooges products. Even more surprising is that at that time, Curly had serious health problems, and in a few of the shorts he made during this period, you can see that he is clearly ill; his time is delayed, he speaks very slowly and indecisively, and it is difficult for him to move. Fortunately, his health improved when he shot this film, and it shows. The classic comedy of Stooge, and she wasn’t even liked by the Stooge fans (I had a girlfriend who couldn’t stand Stooges, but even she was laughing at it). Must see.
