I have never loved IMAX movies. They are cool, but as soon as you overcome this first rush, “Wow, this is like flying!” The films themselves are usually quite banal and ordinary. <br /> <br /> Exceptions were the powerful “Everest”, exciting “Wild California”, and now the “Human Body” BBC, a huge look at the insides of our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of complex complexity that are simply unthinkable. This 50-minute film can last 10 hours, and still it will not reach all the systems working in tandem, just as I type this review and listen to our radio, and most of us take everything for granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of a pulsating heart (similar to an alien spacecraft), the inside of the lungs, tiny hairs in the eardrum that reproduce sound, the development of the child inside the womb and, surprisingly, some of .. less attractive features that I thought she would avoid (pimples, acid churning in the stomach ...) <br /> <br /> This film also has a rather cool style that distinguishes it from other IMAX documentaries . For example, we all saw how sperm gets into the egg cell, but have you ever seen her tune into Marvin Gay’s “Let's Get It On” melody? Such creative moments make the “Human body” not only a lesson of health, but also fun.
