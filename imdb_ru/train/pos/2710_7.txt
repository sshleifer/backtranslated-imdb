This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous films in this genre. This was done by Roger Corman, who at the moment has already released several WIP. Obviously, the film is trying to play by the established formula. The film takes place in a US prison, not in the "banana republic", like most WIP films. I'm not sure that this was a wise move, but it is an acceptable change in pace. Writer-director Demme really falls on his work, constantly looking for new ways to present a familiar script. In fact, he is too ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates several surrealistic dream episodes that look extremely pretentious, but it's funny to see how much he is trying to put this movie above the average click of the chicks in the chains. But don't worry, Demme is still working within the parameters of the subgenre. There is a lot of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy the fans. The film is a bit slow, but very interesting. The cast is good. Robert Collins is a WIP veteran, so she needs no introduction, and Barbara Steele is a scream like a crazy guard in a wheelchair. Pam Greer is really missing, though.
