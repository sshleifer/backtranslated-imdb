Jet Li once again demonstrates his charismatic presence on the screen of the film in the movie "Black Mask". In this film, Lee plays Tsui, who escaped from the super-soldier program, who seeks to return humanity, which the program has taken away from him. To do this, Cui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate requires that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to search for peace. Other super-soldier program participants escaped simultaneously with Cui, but they want to come to terms with the world, and not to gain inner peace. Thus, Cui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former teammates from releasing information that could cost the lives of many innocent people. This film screams madly on the screen and never lets its viewers go. Martial arts are amazing, but because they use wires, they may not be appreciated as much as they deserve an American audience. If you like action movies with an interesting story and demanding good acting, because they deal with both psychological and physical conflicts, then Black Mask is for you. I’m glad to see that some of Jet Li’s films will finally hit the mainstream in the United States, and I’m looking forward to see how the changes this release will require (such as rewriting and soundtrack) will affect the film. This is one of Lee's best films, watch it on May 14 when it comes out in America.
