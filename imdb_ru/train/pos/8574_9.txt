This film works on many levels: for children and adults. This is everything, from car accidents and cakes on the face, to very good (but subtle) jokes for adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close in her greatest evil best of all, as Cruella (“call me Ella”) De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years in the clinic of refining Dr. Pavlov, did she recover from the desire for fur ?? even the puppy's fur she so much desired. She even has all the fur coats placed in the dungeon of an unusual castle in which she lives. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a Dalmatian film without Cruella’s tricks and fraud, and you know that something will change its behavior modification. And now she needs another puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her vile scheme this time. <br /> <br /> Ioan Griffith immediately became the hero of the film, who runs the shelter for dogs “Second Chance”. Although he was in "Titanic" and in last year's television version (like Pip) of "Great Expectations", I did not recognize him; well, he was “the fifth officer of Law” in the “Titanic”, and I didn’t see the “Great Expectations”, so I’m not very surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a delightful turn, like the pawn of Kruelle's furrier. He jumps and poses in the most outlandish and outrageous fur clothes you've ever seen ?? and does it well. His homage “The Wicked Witch of the West” is very funny. <br /> <br /> Tim Mcinnerney is gorgeous, not evil minion Cruella ?? he was also Alonzo, Cruella’s butler in 101 Dalmatians, and you can also recognize him from all British Black Adder commands. He plays his usual clumsy, kind-hearted, slightly silly character with great effect. <br /> <br /> Oscars for costume are usually given for the entire costume in a film. This is regrettable because the clothes that Glenn Close wears are amazing ?? she is incredibly detailed (pay attention to her handcuffs when she is released from the Behavioral Modification Clinic) and is worthy of such an incredible character. One of her clothes deserves at least an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation has a special place in my heart ?? but comparing this film with an original animated film is the same as comparing apples with orangutans: it is impossible. Suffice it to say that “102 Dalmatians” is even better than the film forecast “101 Dalmatians”, which was released in 1996. There is something to like here: from jokes, dialogue and costumes to casting - This is a good film for the whole family.
