I saw this movie in the first couple of weeks when it came out, (I don’t remember exactly when.) I thought everything was fine for the Ben Stiller movie. This film is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about them. Or, as I said, you have a good sense of humor. From a couple of people on this site, I saw that people didn’t have anything good to say about it, and he didn’t get a very good rating, but I would give him more good, and he should have received a better rating. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I just give you the opinion of another person.
