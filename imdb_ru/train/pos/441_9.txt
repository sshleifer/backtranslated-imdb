This is an exquisite film about finding some kind of bliss in everyday life. The pace, the camera work, the emotions, the obsessive musical score and the sheer charm of this picture make it a must-see. It is not easily appreciated immature or emotionally retarded. The only flaw I see in this film is that it was not recorded in a more technically advanced movie format. He deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the best sound format available. (An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeters.) The effect of the magnificent Italian villas on its inhabitants could be made even more magnificent, and the small beautiful moments can be clearly seen and heard. Like this, it still needs attention like a cute moving little film. I can't stop watching him every time he walks on the satellite. Transformations of characters from restrained, tense and incredulous are always a joy to watch, and I really should recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> Casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, acting is above reproach. This is a film about middle age and choice that people make. He is deep and thoughtful, not beating the viewer with heavy hands. Look at it in one go and let it affect you. If you do not understand this, perhaps you have not lived enough, or something else is wrong with you.
