This documentary tells about Pilger’s next book, Freedom Next Time, published in 2006. It tells about the shocking exile of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the islands of Chagos in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> The Islanders are technically British citizens, since Diego Garcia is a British colony, very similar to Mauritius, the neighboring island where the natives were sent to. But the British government ignored their calls to return home, since the island is now the military base for the United States Army, which used it as the basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger’s coverage is shocking, especially when he documents the treatment and current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews are excellent in all respects, and his speech to parliament as a representative of parliament, where he uses his own government information to determine it, is considered one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction to analyze the series. recently released documents that fully cover the British conspiracy to evict the natives. The interweaving of these videos with interviews and music of the islanders really enhances the effect of the film. <br /> <br /> Watching him is not easy, but “Theft of a Nation” is John Pilger at his best. Featured.
