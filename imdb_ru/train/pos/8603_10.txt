The film is fantastic. The storyline is thin, but serves as a structure on which beautiful songs are sung and beautifully sung. (I still can not believe that such beautiful and attractive people could sing it well.) Some dialogues are amazingly clever. The costumes made me feel like I was watching a 1942 high fashion show. <br /> <br /> Films are designed for different purposes. This one is intended for entertainment, and it certainly does. If I had one negative comment, Nelson Eddie was too old to be a handsome, dashing graph. Some of the close-ups made me feel awkward. But he could still sing and sing great. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as dazzling as ever. She makes a terrific angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is long before my time, and I'm new to the films of Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and their conversations. The music in this film is beautiful. No matter how much I love classical rock music, which fills most modern films, I have no doubt that this music is simple and obviously more memorable, more delightful, better built. The stars in this film are more talented than the stars that I see in cinemas today. And Janette MacDonald, without the help of Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I donâ€™t understand why so many other posters apologize for their sympathy for this film and, more generally, for this group of films. They say that they are outdated and try to explain why this is so. And those who do not like it, they say that it is not very good, but compared to what? I think that this film will undoubtedly still entertain people when many other films have long been forgotten. There are too many qualities in this film to remember and enjoy. I recommend this film unconditionally to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and great music.
