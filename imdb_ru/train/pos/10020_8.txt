The legendary Boris Karloff completed his outstanding career by making four cheap blades in Mexico. This is an iconic sullen period of gothic horror at the entrance to the pile. Karloff performs a typically quick and dignified performance as Matias Morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites a few of his petty, greedy and arrogant relatives to his eerie, worn-out castle to read his will. Pretty soon the hated guests were pushed by life-size, deadly toy people who inhabit this place. Former Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia from the shame of "Tintorera" depicts a dashing policeman hero, and Julissa looks absolutely delightful as the only pretty female heroine. Awkward, stupid (un) director, a script of vulgar numbers, ugly, blurry cinematography, ridiculous scenes with murders (a coarse bold blow is crushed directly into the face by a miniature gun!) Karloff), cheesy soft blood, poor duplication and invigorating fiery conclusion - all this gives this pleasant horrible lemon some amazingly rude and, therefore, oddly funny battered charm. A real hiking shout.
