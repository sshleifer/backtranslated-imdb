Another one of them does not make them so. This story of a family with a few real skeletons in the closet is still considered good clean and sometimes excessive entertainment. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone reached their peak as the problem Hadley brothers and sisters, and they really took the role and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar, and Stack was nominated in auxiliary categories, both awards were highly deserved. They balance several soft conclusions. Neither Bacall nor Hudson can ever be called bad actors, but they both played a better role and played them much more convincingly than here. It's hard for me to take Rock Hudson, who plays such a redheaded heterosexual like him, here, but this is more a personal bias than anything else. But this does not detract from the overall entertainment value of the film, which is significant, and this film is very watchable. If you are awake at night, and this film is on, I would say, watch it. It's worth it.
