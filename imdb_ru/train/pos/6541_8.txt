Being an adult in my 40 years, I am not even intimately familiar with the key demographics of Nancy Drew, but the film was pleasantly surprised this afternoon; so, I can say, a couple of sixty year old gray-haired ladies downstairs from me. An elderly man who left the cinema right in front of me especially praised the film to a 20-year-old female worshiper (who said that she had watched the movie last night and she really liked it). <br /> <br /> Another point, however: there were nine in the row right in front of me â€” count them, nine-ten-year-old girls lined up next to each other, skipping popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the preview. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film began, they immediately sat down to watch ... <br /> <br /> .... and did not complain until the final credits. started rolling. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; he does not quite pay for his subjects in high school, he is not quite sure about his own tone, and his cutthroats are just hair too far away from critically inept times. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot holds together quite well, and it cleverly steps between the sins of excessive gaiety and excessive modernization. And last but not least, Emma Roberts wears a film with amazing grace - despite Josh Flitter's excellent time, this is Roberts' film, and she perfectly shoots it. Her Nancy Drew is to a large extent the direct ancestor of Christina Bell Veronica Mars, and the film is also a direct descendant of Jodie Foster, the early and underrated Candle. <br /> <br /> In today's marketplace it is a rarity: a family film that respects the intelligence of its viewers. As such, it will not be to everyone's taste - but, nevertheless, it is the best film of its kind in recent decades.
