I first saw this film in the early 90s, when it was first released. A room with a view was also recently exited. Enchanted April could offer much more! I found it a lot more real and mundane, the characters more believable to be “normal.” By the end of the film, I felt the same thing as when I first saw the BBC's Pride and Prejudice, I really wanted the characters to find what they were looking for, be it isolation, peace, freedom or love. You feel everywhere that Italy is so far from everything that they have ever known, that they are so persistent in taking risks and leaving behind everything that is ridiculous and narrow. But in the midst of the April heat, every person’s life shatters and disintegrates (according to Victorian corsets) and gradually recovers to everyone’s satisfaction. What a little gem of a movie! Why is it not so well known?
