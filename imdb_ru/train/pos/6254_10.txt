I just saw this film in 2001 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The working title was Dog Days. The reaction of the audience was ambiguous. Some people believe that graphic sex and realistic violence are too important for them. Others seem to genuinely appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> This film is not for the faint of heart. It's like “Happiness” with obvious sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There is a poisoning of animals, a striptease from the elderly, an orgy bath in a shopping center, penetration into anal candles and defilement of the mentally incompetent. <br /> <br /> If any of this sounds like too much to handle, then this film is not for you. This film shows humanity in the most desperate and pathetic state. The banality of our existence pierces our face with utter delight. <br /> <br /> Zaydl is not interested in redeeming humanity here. Why should he? This film shows excellent performances from all the participants, is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement that can be made in the film lately.
