I am sad to say that I do not agree with other people in this episode of Colombo. Death extends a hand - frankly boring Colombo for me. A few times I get bored and change the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland for their roles, but in this episode the story was weaker than in others. First, Robert Culp plays the investigator for the character of Ray Milland. He hires him to investigate his pretty young wife, played by Patricia Crowley, to find out if she has an affair. Instead, Kalpa's character is blackmailing a betraying wife who plans to reveal his plan to her husband, who is destroying his career. With anger, Culp kills her, striking her face and setting her body elsewhere. I dont know. Maybe I just didn't care about it at all. Of course, Colombo gets it in the end. It is just a question of how.
