Let's start this review with a positive note - I am very glad that they did not decide to fail with Tony, who was shot, and to make a retrospective season, as some people said. In fact, the creator and author of this episode, David Chase did quite the opposite. We don't really know if Tony will live or die. He is in a coma, and his chances of recovery are very small. This episode seemed to be moving very slowly, and Tony’s dream, caused by a coma, was that he involved an erroneous person, and the Asian monks in the robes that beat him were just strange. After 45 minutes, I was a little tired of grief, but this should not be a reason for slamming this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. In this episode, Edie Falco produced a striking career-defining performance in which the conflicted wife faced the possible death of her husband. I also found it interesting that AJ dropped out of school and vowed a vendetta against Junior, whom AJ most likely lack the strength to cope with. Silvio is now acting boss, who opens numerous doors for problems in subsequent episodes. There were also a lot of great jokes in this episode, and I think Vito “Pole-Smoker” Spadafore can meet his demise if he continues to be greedy SOB <br /> <br /> This was not a good episode and was disappointed only because even though Tony kills people, we, as an audience, adore him and feel that he is our hero of the show. It was a necessary episode for the series, although it was a bit snoring, prompting a conclusion. Kudos to Eddie Falco, as well as David Chase and the authors for creating this completely original and unpredictable plot. This is the only Clan Soprano season where I have no idea where he will go. I can't wait for the episode next week. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The best line of the episode: (Poly in AJ): “Let's go, Van Helsing!”
