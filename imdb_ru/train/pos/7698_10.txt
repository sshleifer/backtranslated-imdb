But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang occupies an unrivaled place as a fighting choreographer, only Sammo Hung compares at his best. This immediately becomes clear from his proud exhibition of technology - more than the bright glare of the camera, etc., during the battles. The direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer with speed and movement, but also to scare her with the exact skill displayed. This film also benefits from Liu in front of the camera. Liu's performance at the banquet scene, which opens the film, is one of the highlights of the Kung Fu movie history. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hoon (the fame of my young aunt) and Xiao Hou, whose acrobatics are breathtaking, and preferably any number of wires. As for the plot, this film often follows the theme of revenge, but with character and moral development along the way and the most appropriate solution. The humor in this is also the best. If you watch only one kung fu movie, it would be a good choice - it has it all.
