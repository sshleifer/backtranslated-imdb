A stupid young man becomes an obsessed woman — so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense. An evil magician approaches him and tells him that he can give him tremendous wealth, which he can use to win the heart of a lady, IF he agrees to give him everything he wants, within their room. The stupid guy agrees, and the wizard steals the reflection of the man in the mirror - and as a result, of course, bad things happen. <br /> <br /> If this film were shot just ten years later, I’m sure I couldn’t have been so charitable in reviewing and evaluating this film. In the end, the plot of the film is a bit vague, and the acting is sometimes a bit unnatural. However, if we consider that in 1913, "full-length" films were rare - and often lasting only from 20 to 30 minutes! In addition, the very idea of ​​a complex story, similar to the one you get in this film, is very unusual - because the stories were very short and widespread. So, given the time constraints, this film is pretty good and is one of the earliest known horror films.
