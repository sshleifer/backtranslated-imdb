I and two sisters watched all 3 of the Tenko series and agree that this is definitely one of the best BBC series. The entire cast was very convincing in the roles they portrayed, and although the 3rd episode was somewhat slower, it was a convincing show, and my evenings will not be without it. Without a doubt, we will watch it again, because this is a series that I will never get tired of watching. Excellent viewing and full BBC rating for such a brilliant series and casting. The first indicator in all departments would recommend this series to anyone, although some age limits should be considered due to some adult material. So thankful to the BBC for the release of this series on DVD and Video.
