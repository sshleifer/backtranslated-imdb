If you are in the mood for fun ... and you just want to relax and enjoy ... Miyan Chot Miyan is one of the movies worth seeing. Amitabh began quite well ... but it was Govinda who steals the show from his hands ... a great time for and a good supply of dialogue ... he was inspired by the bad guys ... but he has Indian Masala. ... people think that it can be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is in charge and Govinda is working ... shouldnâ€™t raise any questions ... other recommended films in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) ... this is Shola Aur Shabnam, Aanchen, Raja Babu, Saadjan Chalet Sasural, Devan Mastan, Colli no. 1, Jody is not. 1, Hero 1, Hasina Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyar.
