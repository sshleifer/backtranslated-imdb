This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sequence of actions is contrived. <br /> <br /> But on the condition that you can light up enough to laugh, it was an incredibly addictive game that combines the keystone cops and the Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> Villains were more stupid than bad. The good guys were not too good. Black actors played ordinary characters, not black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of the child has added pleasant features. Empathy might be a little difficult otherwise. <br /> <br /> I disagree with acting. Overall it was very good. I really wanted to hit Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And after all, isn't this the hallmark of a good movie about wanting to hit Judge Reinhold?
