With various Bogdanovichs and Gazzars scattered throughout the cast and crew, “They all laughed” is a very family affair. If you add the fact that B.Gazzar and Miss A. Hepburn had a short but passionate history in the earlier picture, she has the appearance of an almost private film made for the pleasure of the participants and that entertainment for a wide audience is just an auxiliary consideration . If all this smacks of complacent "jokingly" with self-satisfaction, you will be pleased to hear that Mr. Bogdanovich speaks clearly to this particular danger and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "I love New York" Paean, which is also an altar on which we can worship ethereal the beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake, this is her picture. Mr. Gazzara recognizes her most modestly in all their scenes together. The plot - the detective agency intervenes too personally in the affairs of its clients - is of minimal importance, it is the role of the two main roles that dominates the film. Mr. Bogdanovich’s triumph lies in the fact that his camera seems to love its actors, starting with “Targets” and beyond. In each of his films there is a glow that only extraordinary artists can persuade an inanimate piece of optical equipment. Miss Hepburn especially benefits from this love. Additional information about his work can be obtained by reading the published collections of his essays about stars and directors, mainly “Who the hell is in it?” Recently stored in British bookstores. The soundtrack for the film “They All Laughing” varies from a Louis Armstrong concert in New York in 1947 to Sinatra, Country and Latin, as eclectic as the city he portrays. The image of B. “Golden Boy” is surely blurred, because this is the nature of the movie business, but he is equally sure that one day he will be restored, and when this day comes, “They all laughed” will be recognized for the excellent work that is.
