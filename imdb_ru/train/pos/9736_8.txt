Over the past few years, Pegg has had several hits, starting with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, the movie "Hot Fuzz 2007", in early 2008 he came out with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now it goes like this. " How to lose friends and alienate people ", which in many ways is one of my favorite comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> The film is about Sydney Yound, a man who writes a failed magazine that makes fun mostly of a celebrity because he is not alone of them. In any case, one of the most successful owners of magazines (Played By Jeff Bridges) invites him (out of nostalgia) to work on his magazine. Sydney, of course, is excited and moves to America, where he meets a girl who is currently writing book, and fun comes. <br /> <br /> This fi LM is great, and I hope that there will be other. Pegg again gave people another good film everywhere, and I can not wait to see the third part of the trilogy Blood and Ice Cream "Paul." I appreciate this film 81% in the near future.
