Hello from the dark again. What a relief ... thriller that is really exciting! New “IT” girl Rachel McAdams (“Wedding Crashers” and “The Notebook”) dominates the screen in this cute classic thriller with an unknown from the famous horror director Wes Craven (films “Scream” and “A Nightmare on Elm Street”). Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes it work is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes, as we see that McAdams interacts with 4 or 5 people per person or by phone. It is natural. When she meets Killian Murphy (“The Scarecrow” in “Batman Begins”) in what seems random, the film really flies away. Watching the flirtation of two types of yuppies, while the audience knows that evil is brewing, fascinates the film industry! The sequence of boarding the aircraft is fascinating, and more than 30 minutes on board are painfully claustrophobic. Craven makes us guess about the participation of others, and if someone comes to her aid. <br /> <br /> As in many thrillers, the only disappointment occurs during the climax, when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plot trick makes us believe that little Rachel feels dissatisfaction in order to survive this, but we cannot help but rest. The most overworked scenes include angry hotel guests, annoying airline passengers, injury to Killian and FX at the hotel. The strength of the film in the development of character and psychological games between the characters. Unfortunately, the veteran fine film Brian Cox is underutilized, but in general it is above-average fighter, which is worth seeing for everyone except the final.
