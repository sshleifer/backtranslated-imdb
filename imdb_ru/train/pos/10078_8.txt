This is a story that could happen anywhere, given the right circumstances. Street artist, attracting the attention of the famous opera star, and the ensuing friendship. An aging artist finds / buys a boy to convey his art. From there we follow them through the severity of their difficult, but free life along the river. Traveling from city to city, he stands and has some fame. Despite the times and influence, the man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> In general, the performances are first-class, especially Xu Zhu, who portrays a street performer. The child (Rening Zhou) is beautiful, quite strong, and well opposed to open prejudice. The two main characters, along with support from the kind opera singer, Master Liang (interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some mentioned the distant resemblance of this film with BA WANG BIE JI (FORGIVE TO MY BOARD); and yet this film alone does not stand up, any similarity is remote at best. <br /> <br /> My only problem with the “King of the Masks” is the final. He was weak, cliché and as thin as a sledgehammer. The audience was already immersed in history, for which there were unnecessary manipulations? What a disgrace. To raise a beautiful motion picture so far away, only to surrender to emotional (and commonplace) pathos like this. This frankly made this film a good, not a classic one, it should have been. In addition, the KING MASK is still worth your time. I was happy to see that the Shaw Brothers still produce good films. Highly recommended.
