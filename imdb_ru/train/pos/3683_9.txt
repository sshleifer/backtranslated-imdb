18 directors had the same task: telling love stories in Paris. Naturally, some of them turned out to be better than others, but the whole mosaic is quite charming - besides, would not it be boring if all of them had the same vision of love? Here's how I rate segments (which may change when re-viewing): <br /> <br /> 1. “Quartier Latin”, Gerard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the greatest French actors ever put on my favorite episode, with the participation of always amazing Jena Rowlands and Ben Gazzar. Witty and delicious. <br /> <br /> 2. The Eiffel Tower, Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> A nice, visually stunning (thanks to the director of Troika Belleville) story about a little boy whose parents mimes; <br /> <br /> 3. “The Tuileries”, Ethan and Joel Cohen <br /> <br /> The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Jolly <br /> <br /> 4. “Parc Monceau” by Alfonso Cuaron ( “Y Tu Mamá También”, “Children of Men”), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. “Place des Fêtes”, Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aisa Maiga (touchingly); <br /> <br /> 6. "The 14th arrondissement", Alexander Payne's wonderful view ("Elections", "About Schmidt") on the pitiful side of life is present here, a feat. the underrated actress Margo Martindale (mother of Hilary Swank in the film “Million Dollars”) as a lonely middle-aged American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. “Faubourg Saint-Denis”, Tom Tikver’s crazy style (“Run Lola Run”) works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind guy (Melchior Beslon) who falls in love; <br /> <br /> 8. Per-Lachaise, Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus the curious cameo of Alexander Payne in the role of ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. “Loin du 16ème”, Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but touching story from talented Brazilian directors, feat. Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. “Quartier des Enfants Rouges”, Olivier Assayas (“Clean”), a feat of sad history. always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais", Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. Quarter de Madeleine, Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine", by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires" by Nobuhiro Suva, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Defoe; <br /> <br /> 15. “Bastille”, Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the undervalued “My life without me”), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Camara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle", Richard Lagravenes, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. Montmartre, with Bruno Podalides; <br /> <br /> 18. Porte de Choisy, Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (mostly known as the director of Barlitz, U-turn of Fate, and Lonely White Woman). <br /> <br /> I could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even a little boring), but none of them are bad. In general, I give “Paris, Je t'Aime” 8.5 / 10 and recommend it for what it is: a beautiful mosaic of love and other intermediate things.
