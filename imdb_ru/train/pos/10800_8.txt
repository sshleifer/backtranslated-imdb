This film is much better than the original The Jerk. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves unusual humor. We have included in our daily discourse almost as many lines from this film as from Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Card game with strollers, and then with Mr. Suicide. Scene at the dinner table and his aversion to turtle soup. The original of The Jerk was too delivered and delivered. While I like Steve Martin, he seemed to be trying his best. The Jerk Too - deception and enjoy all. The Jerk Too is suitable for families, unlike the original The Jerk.
