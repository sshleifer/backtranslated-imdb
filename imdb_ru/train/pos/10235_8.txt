An unusual film from Ringo Lam and one strangely underrated. The combination of fantasy kung fu with a more realistic image of swords and spears piercing the body is striking, especially in the first ten minutes. Rider cut in half, his waist and legs continue to ride a horse. A few horses are chopped down. This is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple: Phong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazy maniac general and imprisoned in the Red Lotus Temple, which seems more like a torture chamber than a temple. The general has a resemblance to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, as he is spewing distorted philosophy and making frightening pictures with human blood. <br /> <br /> Production is very impressive, and the situation is gloomy. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and mostly consistent, unlike many HK action scenes of the time. Sometimes a movie becomes absurd, or the effects are stupid, but never enough to spoil a movie. <br /> <br /> Find it, this is one of the best HK kung fu movies of the early nineties. Just remember that it is not suitable for children.
