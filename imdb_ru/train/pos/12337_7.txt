Poor Ivy: Despite how she was born, she was not lucky to marry a charming villain (Richard Ney). Since the film begins in the 1920s and 30s, when tough Victorian ideas about the class began to wear out around the edges, this indefinite status annoys her unnecessarily. Gretorexes (because they are so called) do not know where their next shilling will come from, but there are chic parties and costume balls in chic pleasures to seduce her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) meets a wealthy elderly gentleman (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born at middle age), she puts him in one of his extravagant introductory duties. Fortunately, one of the bosses with whom she is still strung together (Patrick Knowles) is a doctor, in whose offices there is a cache of poison, with which she says goodbye to her husband. The fact that it affects Knowles does not affect her a little, even though the clock runs until it is hung by the neck until it dies. The turn of the plot depends on the police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwick; Knowles' mother (formidable Lucille Watson); and Knowles' faithful housekeeper (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds a few subtle touches to this melody above average; The luminous face of Fontaine provides the rest.
