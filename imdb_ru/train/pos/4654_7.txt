It is about waste, Peter Ustinov, who penetrates the British company Texa-Conn or something like that, posing as a computer master and security expert. He is secretly learning to crack a computer, while gathering the admiration of his boss Carl Malden, the hostility of his office rival Bob Newhart and the love of his inept secretary Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Some of the details of the business were a bit dull for these non-business-oriented eyes, but they are quite plausible, and I understood the general idea. Ustinov, a studious Peter, founds fake businesses in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart and uses the Tex-Conn computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz institutions. Foreign companies, of course, consist of nothing more than himself, Ustinov, and the addresses are the abandoned artist's attic in Paris, the barber shop in Rome, and the bakery in Germany. He just visits them to collect the checks he sent. <br /> <br /> I did not think that I would like it in the first few minutes, because it looked rather slow. I was expecting something of a faster pace and more outrage in the spirit of the Pink Panther or the Gang of Lavender Hill. But this film hints at your good qualities when you begin to appreciate the understated humor in the plot, characteristics and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It might be a bad idea to give too much Relatively thin jokes, but here are some of the more prominent ones. <br /> <br /> Ustinov’s secretary to Smith: “Give me the assets of these companies.” Smith: “Assets? Who are they? ”Ustinov:“ Little ass. ” Now nothing is made of this small exchange. There is a quick transition and there is no delay for any laughter that is appropriate, because someone’s reaction would rather be a smile than a laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov is looking for this nasty attic in Paris. It is covered with cobwebs. The bricks are scattered around, and a couple of pictures of the former occupant are left behind. The owner does not speak English, and Ustinov does not know French. Ustinov points to a childish picture of a naked woman and giggles: “Yeah. Femtal, eh? ”The landlord also chuckles, replies:“ What are you doing? ” Ustinov: "Oh, Annie, so her name is!" Landlord: "Oh?" Ustinov: "Entente of the heart!" (Mes, though, if I misunderstood these genders, excuse me.) Bob Newhart plays Willard Gnatpol (!) Maggie Smith is wanted, and he has to take her home, but he says that he is “on a scenic route.” There is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs. "Caution!". "Lay-by". "Give Way." "Yield." Ending with the domineering "STOP / CHILDREN." There is another montage when the board of directors is about to discover Ustinov's scheme - blurry roofs, police cars, farewell hugs from Maggie, ending with the sign: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs <br /> <br /> Well, maybe another one. I still cannot come to terms with Malden as the boss, decisively declaring: “I never suffer because of the decisions”, then swallowing a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> indisputably good. For example, this is the best role of Bob Newhart. Not that he had so much, and not that his range was not limited, but he is perfect in this part. The musical score of Laurie Johnson clearly put a lot of effort. It seems she wrote a short concert for the flute. Ustinov's passion is music, and his foreign institutions are headed by fake names, such as Claude Debussy and Giakonino Rossini. Stuttgart’s deceitful president is a man named Schmidt, and he is an anomalous clinker. Maggie Smith is beautiful, sexy, bourgeois, and it turns out that she is not as stupid as it seems. <br /> <br /> Delightfully, quietly in its own way, but don’t expect comic fireworks.
