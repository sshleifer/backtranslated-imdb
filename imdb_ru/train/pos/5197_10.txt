This film has completely run around the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes a movie gorgeous ... with the exception of real actors. (Ernie Hudson couldn't do it alone, and you KNOW it! LOL) I admit that I killed my first videotape with this film, and I plan to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This film has so many catchy lines, it's a pity! I am ashamed to say that I know this song back and forth! I love the character Jimmy Lynch to death, and he should have won an award for Best Supporting Actor in Blaxploitation, but Oscar was NEVER ready for this! This is a random film consisting of "Curved Cops", "Chest", "Chase", "Bad Editing" and, of course, martial arts. (Considering that this is the 70s, and I can say that everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this film should be restored and shown one night at the height of the marathon in local cinemas!
