I'm a big fan of Woody Allen, and so when I saw that it was playing in a movie, I couldn't help it. I wanted to see how Allen would watch his great movie "Match Point", since this is another one of his films made in GB (which is unique among the works of Allen), along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much easier than MP, and humor is the most pleasant aspect of Scoop. The plot revolves around the character of Johanson (journalism student), who gets a hint about a hot story from the afterlife. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman), and she must decide whether to look for the truth. Yes, and all this is done with the help of a clumsy magician who has become the detective played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I really liked the performance of Johanson, but I’m biased a little, I can watch the three hours movie with Johanson in any frame and remains fascinated. She plays a poisonous, poisonous, clumsy lover, which is a kind of change in the stereotypical character of Allen’s neurosis. She adds the appropriate body language for a comic effect. It goes without saying that almost anyone who sees this will find the character of Johanson disgustingly cute, and this is a plus. <br /> <br /> Allen - Allen ... He still plays the same character as Chaplin and his Little Tramp. Something that happens in this film makes me wonder if I will again see a neurotic little hypochondriac. He does not act in his next picture and recently spends more time exclusively behind the camera ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also pleasant as a courteous suspect in the murder of a millionaire. I cannot say that Jackman does something concrete to make this role his own, but nevertheless he fits his character. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the plot, I can't help but feel that it is fresh ... Actually it stinks with the Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective than anything else. However, I have to applaud Allen for ending it, because it is a little smarter than your typical Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being completely innocent has nothing to do with it and has no definite guilt. Although the plot seemed old, Woody still has a knack for one liner. I found his hints on his latest film interesting ... Come for the sake of humor, laugh and have fun. <br /> <br /> No need to say that you like the work of Allen, look at her. If you do not watch something else ...
