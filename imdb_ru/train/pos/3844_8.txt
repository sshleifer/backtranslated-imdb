When you are reading the abstract of this film, you might think that this is something strange, and in a sense it is so, because for the main character of this film, Gerard Riva (Jeroen Krabbe), they pursue visions and hallucinations. The visions that Gerard sees are all (more or less) subtle hints of what will happen to him when the story continues, and it will be very interesting for viewers to try to figure out the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a few hints of ending the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement and does not get boring for one minute. This is mainly due to the magnificent performances of Jeroen Krabbe and René Soutendeyk (Christina), as well as with the great directing of Paul Verhoeven. His directorial style is clearly visible, and, looking at it from different angles, one can say that De Wierde Man is a typical Verhoeven film. This will not only be typical of people familiar with his American films because of his nude nature and scenes of violence, but also for people familiar with his Dutch films, because of the same and his talent for telling a great story. When people watch Verhoevens American films, short-sighted people can tell, he has no talent for telling a good story, and he focuses only on blood and sex. This is what some people think, while I think he is a very talented director who is trying to convey a deeper message in each film. Although the film “The Empty Man” (his last American film) and not a very good film, is an example of what Verhoeven can do more than just fantastic films, and perhaps companies should trust him more and offer him more different films. He needs it. Just watch his Dutch movies. They not only show that he needs a certain freedom, but also show that he has a wonderful talent. "De Wierde Man" brought him one step closer to Hollywood and, of course, one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
