_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Mariel, desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors, whose career is slowly becoming less active than before, but a terrific homage to French actors and their cinema. <br /> <br /> With the support of solid reflections on cinema and acting (the fourth wall, hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the history of this film, in which most of them Famous actors play their own role (not confusing life in front of the camera - the film is not a voyeur) is rather vague and follows the actors in a series of episodes that make the film quite funny. When Andre Dussolier comes out of the film and leaves Josianu Balasco to play her role (a great actress, she is very serious, especially when she fusses about herself in the role of Dussolier), when the actors run around each other down the street, ask for autographs, as fights and gossip , we get to know the part of other scenes in which each (or others) played. <br /> <br /> In fact, for those who do not know the actors (most of them are at least 50) or do not know French cinema, this film is less interesting, since most of the references will be skipped, but he still offers a good way of thinking about aging, acting, social life ...
