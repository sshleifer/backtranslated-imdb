After watching this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to find out how to get a copy. Jim McKay made a report (Q & A) about the film, which presented his ironic situation: how to get spread for the film, which depicts minorities (women, not white), working on solving controversial issues (teenage pregnancy, teenage motherhood, racial identity single-handed households and how to write the right script for all these topics, being a white man of the mid-thirties. The multinational, multifaceted audience, consisting mainly of adults, admired the fantastic storyline of the film, the detailed characters and the fantastic image of "real teenage life." However, most teenagers left the building, which made me think that this film is best viewed by adults with children as a starting point for discussion, and not, as many adults thought, “a film that teens should watch because it’s about them” From here, distribution questions - how do we handle this? The Internet (retail) would be a great way - this is a film that will be buried like “Puppies” or other radical modern teen films - and McKay seemed responsive. As for his merits as a letter Tel / director, Mackay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work - joining the Crown Heights area where the film was set, working with the actors to portray the characters in their own vision of what the results should be disarming realistic.
