ODD COUPLE is a classic version of Neil Simon's most famous play about a television news writer named Felix Unger, who is a freak obsessed freak who moves with his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, a sports writer and a complete peasant, after his wife Francis throws him out of his apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes away his best friend and regrets it from the moment he does it. Neil Simon’s classic comedy first appeared on Broadway with Art Karni as Felix, and Walter Mattau as Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes on the role of Carney in the film with an unforgettable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in this role, but also so realistic that it brings an element of melancholy into the pathetic figure of Felix Unger. Fortunately, Mattau was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar, the only one of a kind comic performance pearls, which causes constant laughter. This union of Lemmon and Mattau turned out to be comic gold, which was re-visited in nine other films. Since both of these actors are no longer with us, watching this classic becomes more touching, but no less cheerful. Simon's game was nicely expanded for a screen with a silent prologue telling of Felix’s suicidal attempt at depression, which is the winner. Auxiliary cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fidler, Larry Haynes and David Shayner as Oscar poker players playing with friends, as well as Moncia Evans and Carol Shelley as Piedgon sisters, dating Oscar and Felix. Of course, he later became a great show with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there is nothing like the original. Joy from beginning to end.
