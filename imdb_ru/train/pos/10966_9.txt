Gray gardens are a world in itself. Edith and Little Edie live in complete isolation, they eat ice cream and liver pate in an improvised kitchen in their (obviously) dormitory. The cats idle while Edith's mother insults her daughter's speech. This Tennessee-Williams play comes to life and should inspire writers and playwrights, as the strange and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The situation in the house reminds me of how my grandmother and her 50 His daughter lived for ten years (except that they were poor and clean). They would quarrel all day, the grandmother would tell about her beautifully perfect past, while her daughter constantly accused her of missed opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This film must be watched by anyone who writes the relationship of a mother and daughter of this kind. This is sad and voyeurism, but the filmmakers did an amazing job, getting Eddie comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly. It is rare to see real life in this way and even more so, given the context - the remnants of a powerful family disappear into oblivion in the skeleton of their own mansion.
