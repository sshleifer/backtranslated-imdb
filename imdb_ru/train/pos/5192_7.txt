I'm a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I'm not interested in gangster films filled with incredible weapons. Now martial arts; *it is beautiful! And John Wu surprised me by releasing a very fascinating film about kung fu, in which almost * too many * fights, if that is possible! This is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many battle scenes are very good (and some are less good), and the main characters are funny and enjoyable. The bad guys are too incredibly evil, but nonetheless entertaining. You should see the Sleeping Wizard !! He can fight only when he sleeps - this is hysterical! <br /> <br /> However, with repeated views, Last Hurray For Chivalry can get a little boring and verbose, especially because many battle scenes are actually not that good. Therefore, I rate it as “only” 7 out of 10. But in fact it is almost “8.” <br /> <br /> In general, one of the best films about kung fu, made for the soul. from kung fu premiere movies. All really good kung-fu movies are from the mid-to-late 1970s, with some notable exceptions from the late 60s and early 70s (and, frankly, the early 80s).
