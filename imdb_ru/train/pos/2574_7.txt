Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most gifted and unsightly comedians of the last twenty years, is returning as detective Dooley for this film. <br /> <br /> If you expect more from the same thing from the first movie, you will be disappointed, but it is still a good movie. Understanding that all the “Dog and Man Battles” scenarios were probably used in the first film, this approach becomes a bit more psychological in his approach, as he concentrates on the criminal who is fixated on the recently deceased wife Dooley after she rejected a book. and blames Dooley for her death. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the script is not the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christina Tucci to show their good acting skills, while maintaining a rather light humor of the first film that will make it work, and the chemistry between the two stars can see everyone. <br /> <br /> A light, frivolous film that you probably shouldn't buy if you are not a real fan of the first film or film “Belushi” is definitely worth watching when it appears on TV. <br /> <br />
