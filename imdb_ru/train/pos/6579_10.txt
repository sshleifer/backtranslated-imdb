Is the best screen version of Quo Vadis? ever did. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and obvious as in the book, sometimes wandering and losing tension among aesthetic subtleties. But the film is really and beautifully “strange”, has a riddle and style that other versions obviously lack - with R. Taylor and the new one from Poland. It has the appearance of a Roman decline, the beauty of falling paganism and children's Christianity. At least, I believe that this is so). Brandauer, Forrest and Sydow did an excellent job of depicting their characters. Petronius Forrest seems to be the greatest success of the cast (not to mention Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors in history) and accumulates the very essence of this dying world (IMHO). That's all. And so it happened guys ...))) IMHO
