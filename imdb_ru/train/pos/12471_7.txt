I did not know the real events when I sat down to see this, just the fact that it was based on a true story. After the death of the child’s father, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree (... I didn’t know that someone had actually named their offspring so) to cope with the loss. This is really made for children, as is often the case with “family” films (with that said, go ahead and get everyone together to watch, although I will not allow teens to do this if you are not sure that I am going to buy a concept), but it does not diminish the sting that the death of a parent is, and it really does not speak to anyone. The plot is quite interesting, and moves quite well. The action varies, with Berstin's superior, eclipsing most of her fellow actors, Mathis follows this well, and Ferland and her peers (with some exceptions) are the least persuasive of the group (and frankly, annoying; then I really don’t in the target audience for this thing). Editing and cinematography are standard, and of course, no less. While humor is limited to a handful of funny lines or so, the tone is not unpleasant. There is an intense scene or two in it. I recommend it to fans of these types of films. 7/10
