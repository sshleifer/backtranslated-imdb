When I started watching the show, I said, “Oh, no! It’s as trite as Elfen’s Lies, and not even so bloody! ” Indeed, the situation is almost identical: a lonely boy lives in a big house himself, and then suddenly becomes involved in a fantastic adventure, while sexy young girls live with him. <br /> <br /> But this is where the similarity ends. The love story is almost as thin and intense as in Inuiyasha, while children's remarks and behavior are very few. The magical setting is a bit banal, because about seven people, with seven servants fighting for the Holy Grail, all the servants are someone known, half of all the masters are from the same school, the rules of engagement, etc. However, this soon fades and disappears from the beauty of the picture and script. <br /> <br /> I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with the anime I liked more, but it was from other genres, I must say that I was very pleased.
