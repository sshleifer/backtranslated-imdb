Gunga Din, based on the same poem by Rudyard Kipling, follows the journey of three officers to 19th-century India. The noble trio must endure a series of battles and other dangers, including the cult of bandits and the temple, full of gold. Their adventures on the screen remain fascinating even after more than six decades and inspire almost everything - from space opera inspired by a rock climber, Star Wars (1977) to the scenes of The Battle of the Lost Arc (1981) with a similar plot. <br /> <However, the main reason for the success of the film is the impeccable performances of a trio of extremely charismatic film actors. Victor McLaughlin was rarely better than a tough, tough guy, Cary Grant is the best comic, and Douglas Fairbanks, the youngest, is as courteous as an imaginary hero as possible - perhaps even more than rival Errol Flynn. The chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved, and such a warm and believable comrade is exactly what is lacking in most modern militants - and they get tremendous support from the wonderful Sam Jaffa, who overcomes an obvious physical mistake and makes the title a beacon character humane sweetness and calm power. Huge success in his time (the film was reportedly the second largest source of money in 1939 after the incredibly successful film Gone With the Wind), and it remains perhaps the best film of its kind.
