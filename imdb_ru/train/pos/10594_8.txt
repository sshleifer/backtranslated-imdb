Passport to Pimlico - a real pleasure for all fans of British cinema. This is not only a pleasant and very interesting comedy, but also a cinematic recollection of the past century, with relationships and scenarios, unfortunately, now it is only a memory in British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico’s resident Arthur Pemberton, who, after an accidental explosion of an unexploded bomb, discovered the wealth of the 14th century Duke of Burgundy’s medieval treasure buried deep under their small suburban street for the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> Accompanying Treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by the King of England Edward IV (which has never been officially canceled), which says that this particular London street was declared a Burgundy land, which means that in the eyes of international law, Pemberton and other local residents are no longer British subjects, but natives of Burgundy and their tiny street, an independent country and the law for themselves. <br /> <br /> This determines war-torn and impoverished dents are in order, as they believe they are outside of English law and jurisdiction, therefore, in a drunken disobedience, they burn their food books, destroy and ignore their clothing coupons, grossly ignore British licensing laws, etc., declaring themselves completely independent of Britain. <br /> <br /> However, it is that, having ever been asleep, a black marketer and a dishonest scammer follow his example and cross the “frontier” in Burgundy as a refuge from the law and the post-war restrictions on the sale of their artful goods and half London consumers are following them in order to dodge the ration, making their quiet happy little shelter, a haven for thieves and a rather crowded one. <br /> <br /> Turning to Whitehall for help, they said that because of the events, it was “now a foreign policy issue that His Majesty’s government is reluctant to interfere in,” which leaves people high and dry. However, they declare this area the legal boundary and thus create a fully equipped customs at the end of the road, mainly to control smuggling, and not to ensure the safety of Pimlico residents. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the border was completely closed, starting a siege, with residents of Bugundi, gradually running out of water and food, but still fighting in a truly British style. As one resident of Bugunda says, “we are English and we have always been English, and it’s only because we are English that we are fighting for being Bugündi” <br /> <br /> Sentiment that soon affected everyone’s capital when the rest of London finds out about the plight of the Bugndians, they all feel compelled to intervene and help them by throwing food and supplies through the barbed wire. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall, who fought back so let the invaders for centuries finally be brought to his knees by this new party of foreigners, especially since they are British !!!! <br /> <br /> Great tale and great fun. Do not miss.
