I saw El Mar yesterday and thought it was a great movie. It begins with a child episode in the life of 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tour and Francis. After that, we jump about 10 years to the hospital, where 3 friends meet again. <br /> <br /> Religion, disease, love, violence and sexuality rage throughout the entire film, creating a tense and tense film. <Br /> <br /> I see people complaining that the movie is too awful, and I think they missed the point of the story. This is a cruel, tense and sad story. People must suffer. Cry. To get hurt. Bleed. And I think that what is shown in the film is not made for pure shocking value and is not contemptible. I know that some people love their films "clean", even those that have violence. But sometimes the movie should make you feel uncomfortable at work. This is one of those movies. And this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I discovered was that there were 3 or 4 moments when some details of the plot were not 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the film did it all meaning. But it didnâ€™t make much difference to the overall story, so I still give this film 9 points.
