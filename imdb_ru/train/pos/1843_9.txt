This drama is unlike “Sex and the City,” where women drink and share their sex with each other. It is much more personal and people can relate to it. It is much more exciting and emotional at the new level than other dramas dedicated to women and their lives, such as "Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle ...". <br /> <br /> Dr. Katie Roden, a psychologist with a dark secret, seems to be much more depressed and feeling guilty than the other 3 of her friends. She is dealing with the death of her former lover, who was her patient when he was engaged in the success of his son. Her dark clothes and the empty and cold house very well convey her inner emotions. <br /> <br /> Trudy Malloy, a widow, has been struggling with problems with the “leave” of her dead husband since 9/11. And when a beautiful stranger, Richard takes an interest in her, she is suddenly forced to check the reality of her friends, who assume that she is returning to the dating business. Funny and awkward courtship scenes between Richard and Trudy are ridiculous! It is interesting to note that Richard asks her on the day when she receives millions from the September 11 bulletin board for the death of her husband ... see what his intentions are <br /> <br /> Siobhan Dillon, a lawyer, was sick of the tactics of making love to her husband, which includes only “childbirth” (because they have problems with conception), and she quickly falls in love with her colleague, who is too willing to offer him her “services”, and she does not hesitate for a long time! It is interesting to see if she continues her romance or builds relationships with her husband (played by Raza Jeffrey). Jessica, a real estate business lady, is single and straightforward until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them. Her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who, before her lesbian meeting, has sex with a "married man", her colleague. Let's see where her character will risk .... <br /> <br /> The beauty of this drama is that we are shown by 4 completely different women with different scenarios, whose ambitions and prohibitions are shown. It is also good that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other in order to be “safe”!
