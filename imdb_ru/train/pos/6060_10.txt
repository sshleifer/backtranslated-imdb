This is a great documentary. Any car racing fan should have a copy of this outstanding film. The director “Stephen Lowe” did a great job, as well as the main stars of the film “Father and Son,” Mario and Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and sounds awesome. And best of all is IMAX! Excellent home theater test disc.
