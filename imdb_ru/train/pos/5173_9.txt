Rarely do I see a film with which I am completely absorbed; it was one of them. He had a good game, dialogue, plot, and the scenery was beautiful. I laughed many times, especially the scene dedicated to the kitchen raid. A comedy with farces filled with a hired hand made me fall to the floor, but I admit that I am a lover of farce. The story told about a group of people aged 30 who were returning to a summer camp in which they participated 20 years ago. This was a farewell week for the campsite, as the place will be closed forever at the end of the season. As adults, the camp looked different, and they treated this and each other differently. I recommend this funny, touching movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
