Finally, we have a film of the third category for the 2006 season. Dog Bite Dog, created from equal parts of cruelty, crime and passion, wins not only thanks to a successful title, but also a flexible direction, excellent cinema and respectable performances of the majority of participants. Of course, there must be a catch here, which manifests itself here as a few glaring inconsistencies, but everything said in DBD reflects the mature spirit that we would like to see in the mainstream HK. <br /> <br /> This also marks the heralded return of Edison Chen, who was absent for a long time after the failure of the Initial G year ago. Chen's reserved masculinity worked wonders for the film, but without Sam Lee, whose ability to switch between physical comedy (“Crazy City”, “No Problem 2”) and insane threat, led us to play the strongest role. ”I saw him with since he did in hong kong. <br /> <br /> Together, the duo makes Dog Bite Dog, and hopefully, Edison will get an easier break from now on: his touch transformed Princess D's projects in the Hellfire saga, and yet he remains rare. <br /> <br /> Basically, after starting work, DBD shows some fascinating images, playing magnificent tricks with light, shadow and perspective. The soundtrack enhances this atmospheric effect, adding to the unreal mood of the film. Most of the resulting combination is probably related to the writer Matt Chow, who was also previously involved in the terrible Three Extremes. Dog Bite Dog retains numerous character traits caused by this horror project, namely the worn out urbanscapes and the piercing look of something creepy hiding around the corner. <br /> <br /> Rest assured that this is not a horror film, but the following path traveled earlier by the classic One Nite in Mongkok, albeit from a much more perverse angle. Replacing the reluctant character-killer from the mainland Daniel Wu, we have Edison playing a nameless killing machine originating from the underworld of Cambodia. Posted in Hong Kong for a single purpose, an almost silent killer will take care of business immediately upon arrival, a process that frighteningly portrayed the courtesy of the film’s vivid visual effects. <br /> <br /> Despite having been raised to become a professional since childhood, Killer, Edison's wild dog of the same name, still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail picked up by the CID team to investigate. This build includes a great cameo from Lam Suet moviemakers and good support from TV star Wayne Laj. However, the apostate officer Sam Lee Wai is leading the attack, indicating that he is a very concerned man, but nevertheless an excellent cop. We gradually learn that Vai’s internal conflict stems from the corrupt police background of his father, causing demons suitable for the relentless pursuit that follows. <br /> <br /> An insignificant number of casualties occur, since Edison seems to believe that taking captives no, no, the violence factor is quite sufficient in stock, despite the fact that the blood itself is felt depressed in some places, and an adult language only symbolically looks. Once again, no nudity, prompting the conclusion that Cat III, is being handed a little hastily these days. However, DBD is a relatively mature theatrical release, and we welcome its arrival. <br /> <br /> Between fights, stabbing, breaking and shooting, even a career killer needs some kind of romance, and just like Daniel Wu had Cecilia Chung in One Nite, so fearless Mr. Chen gets a sweetheart, beautifully made by rookie Pei Pei. Her unnamed character (a lot of anonymity in this) meets Edison on a strangely deserted dump, insulted by her father to the point of disgusting madness and eager to escape. When the killer throws HK, he agrees to take her with him, and they run together, love blossoms along the way. While the film does not linger on favorite things, our hearts turn to Pei Pei’s tragic character and its endless suffering. She surprisingly well shows a timid, but valiant protagonist, claiming that there are no good or bad guys, as evidenced by a very sobering final. <br /> <br /> In the portfolio of director Cheang Soy there is the recent unknown thriller Home Sweet Home Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, two numbers probably surpassed most ominous behavior of Dog Bite Dog in most accounts. Cheang manages to maintain a regular DBD job, and given the many components he plays, he meets the critical standards set by people like Johnny Toe in his nightly epic Mission. Several glitches occur when Edison miraculously throws a shot in the chest, but this is very forgivable. <br /> <br /> Celebrate the triumphant returns of two young, talented performers of the kind that Hong Kong needs, if we want the flowering of urban films to return, Dog Bite Dog does not stand out with history. Its strength lies in vivid images and style, based on the strength of muscle mass and keen eye on visual and auditory grace. <br /> <br /> HK has a long-standing, time-honored tradition of stories related to the city’s nightly alter ego, something canine Dog bites a dog with love, tantamount to running, if not a frank masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
