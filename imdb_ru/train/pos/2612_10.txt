This is a film that was very well made. I heard mixed reviews while he was in production, and waited for his release! Greetings to the director and all the actors. The auxiliary cast gave Eva Mendez what she needed to raise it to the top. As everyone else here states, the last part of the film is exciting. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with her character because she didn't do a lot of work when this movie was made. She has a real career ahead. I was amazed at her performance. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, questioned my life values ​​and priorities, and I am the best person for it! Great message lies in the film. Release so everyone can enjoy!
