It's funny how your life can change in a second ... Being on the Water Dance for the first time was an unforgettable experience, then how you need to get used to a new way of life may seem frightening and notice that other people are faced with a similar situation. it may help you to continue. <br /> <br /> The performances of Eric Stolz and mainly Helen Hunt (oh, man! Helen is the purest and most graceful woman on earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. The film is simple and at the same time deep, which does not leave us indifferent to the message being transmitted: enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Indeed, the film is not visited like any hour !!! (sorry, this is a Brazilian expression ...).
