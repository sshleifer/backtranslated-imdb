Roman Polanski is considered one of the most important directors of our time, like the mind behind such classics as The Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown. Probably what makes the Polanski movie very interesting is the fact that, although he is able to create commercially attractive films, such as the aforementioned masterpieces, he also likes to shoot more discreet films of a more personal nature. Le Locataire, or The Tenant, is one of those films; horror / anxious story of paranoia and obsession, which is one of his best work and probably among the best horror films ever made. <br /> <br /> Polanski himself plays Telkovsky, a young man who is looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds him, he discovers that he is empty because the previous tenant, Simone Chole, tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window. After Simona dies from injuries, Trelkovsky begins to dwell on her, believing that her death was caused by the other residents in the building. <br /> <br /> At the same time sharing the same feeling of claustrophobia, his other films on the theme of flat (“Repulsion and Child of Rosemary”); this film is about a strange conspiracy, which may or may not be entirely in the head of Trelkovsky, the disastrous effects that paranoia has on his mind, and the strange obsession he has with a previous tenant. <br /> <br /> Polaski depicts Trelkovsky's descent into darkness. At first, his speech seems strange and wooden, but gradually it turns out that Polanski is acting like that because Trelkovsky must have acted in such a way as a simpleton who has almost no life who catches himself in this insane world, which, as it turned out, is inhabited a lot of strange people. The cast actors really gave life to the people in the building, creating memorable characters. This is very important for the success of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, the beautiful cinematography Polanski uses in the film helps to increase the sense of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as a cage for Trelkovsky. The ghostly images that Polanski uses to convey a sense of bewilderment and madness possess supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive. <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw in the film, then it’s definitely a little slow at first, it may sound like a shutdown, but in fact the slower pace of the beginning works great, because it mimics Trelkovsky’s own boring life and how it gradually enters. to another kingdom. In addition, the intricate storyline is definitely not easy to understand because of the many complex layers. Nevertheless, more than a disadvantage, it is a joy to face such a plot that makes you think. <br /> <br /> Although the Tenant may not be for everyone who is interested in psychological horror and surrealistic plot lines, he will be pleased with the experience. "Le Locataire" is truly one of Roman Polanxi's masterpieces. 10/10
