And this is a great rock and roll movie in itself. Regardless of how it developed (at the moment it is a film about disco), it turned out to be one of the best films in which children want to leave the game, but the main thing stands in their way. Remember these rock and roll movies from the 50s, in which the day is saved when Alan Fried comes to town with Chuck Berry to prove that rock and roll music is really cool and safe for children, and on Tuesday Weld will get new sweater for dancing. Forwards to 1979, repeat the same story, but add DA RAMONES, which no one understood then that it would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter of a century (and then for Don Steele's obligatory DJ shot “The Real”). ). Also add all the elements of the comedy film created by Roger Corman, with the exception of the two-day filming schedule, some familiar Corman repertoire players such as Clint Howard, Mary Wurnow and Dick Miller (starting with “Bucket Blood”) and you have one of the greatest stupid films of the day. One of the few films that uses deliberate fun and gets away with it. I showed a new DVD to a friend who remembered that he only saw parts of it through a burr of burrs when he got behind the wheel, and he agreed that it was one of the best lmov for drunken view, not least for the beautiful leading ladies and excellent Ramones frames.
