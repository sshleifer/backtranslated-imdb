Nowadays adult films are pretty common. By 1980, "Foxes" really give their meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character straight. Since she starred in Taxi Driver four years ago, she has a stronger character in this film. This is Gini, a high school student who has a lot of courage, and she seems to be coming out of any situation she is in. Scott Bayo plays Brad much earlier than Chachi in Happy Days. He is considered immature by other girls. Cherie Curie is Annie, she is not meeting with the crowd that her policing father is after. Gini and her three other friends decided to live on the wild side, until they move into a rented house where the party is completely out of control. Learning life on the other side of the tracks can be fun or dangerous. Annie saves Genie and Brad all the time when she gets lost. The reality is hard to return to where she died in a car accident. And everybody marries a much older man. Growing up is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life as it is. In fact, you should be careful with the people around you. For me, I was my own person, and I tend to stay that way! Great music, great story, this film is a pearl! 4 out of 5 stars!
