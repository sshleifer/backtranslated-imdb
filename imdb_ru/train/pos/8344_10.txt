This is one of my favorites for all time. It's so simple and cute - definitely a romantic comedy. I really like the movie, full of good quotes, and it is ... one of my favorites - when Albert Einstein says Ed Walters: "Do you think what I think?", And Ed says: "What are the chances for that?" In my opinion, the film is incredible, if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of pleasure from it, but with this you can !! I also really liked how Walter M. portrays Einstein. I think all the characters fit together very well, and the story goes well. There are so many times that I smile with the movie and quote my favorite lines when I watch it! I would recommend this film to anyone who has a heart and who love a romantic comedy!
