"The Life and Time of Little Richard," as Little Richard, producer and director of Little Richard, was almost one-sided than one of his songs. This is not a biography and not even a dokudrama, but she has a good composition, excellent energy and an outstanding leading actor who plays Richard. All music is written by Little Richard, so in each song it sounds hard, <br /> <br /> The film tells about his early childhood, his musical years, his rapid success and how Richard throws it all out. praise the Lord. All this is well connected, and the apparent return in 1962 manages to steer clear of the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles, who had opened up for him. <br /> <br /> My main objection is that his outrageous, anti-cultural behavior is underestimated, and you do not feel how his audience survived him at that time. Part of his energy, which he still possesses, does not collide with full force. He seemed tame compared to what I remember about him at the time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes are how Lucille throws up Richard and writes a song about it, and also undresses in bikini shorts during a performance. The point is that I do not have a decent place to change clothes. <br /> <br /> If they got into “Bronze Freedom,” which Richard uses to mention himself in an interview, that is, a story. Believe me, I just saw him performing a couple of months ago, and he still flirts with cute white guys, giving one particularly good dancer in the audience his headband. Almost 68 years old and still strong. I recommend this film and any T.V. concert or concert that you can find. Little Richard is always on
