This should be seen by independent movie fans, but it is also well opposed to popular films. I think we have plans for the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> The budget is painfully low. No special effects at all, and they seemed to use ambient lighting (shot in digital video.) - And yet this movie captures you and never lets go. The scenario is somewhat strange, but the actors and directors deal with it with complete realism. He has humor, he has intrigue, he has pathos, and it all works together. <br /> <br /> There is no point in describing the details. If you want to see an independent masterpiece <br /> <br />, a virtual lesson on how to make a low-budget film that really works, watch this one. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, this is also REALLY entertaining. <br /> <br />
