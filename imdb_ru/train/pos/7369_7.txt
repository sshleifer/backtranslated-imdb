Personally, I could not get into "This is not a love song," this is a brilliant film, and it has a wonderful storyline, I just checked the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much is left of the movie. <br /> <br /> I like the relationship between Spike and Heaton, they are so close that they depend on each other in life. At the same time, I would like relationships to be more than they are. Heaton loves Spike, but Spike doesn't love Heaton, or he doesn't know how to love him. The acts of betrayal, on both sides, have a great influence on two men. They are both devastated by the fact that others fled and left them at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
