What a funny movie! If you're a Giallo fan, the Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. To begin with, it is difficult to make a mistake with Barbara Bush and Marina Malfatti in the same Jallo. Both are wonderful - especially Bush’s innocent, wide-eyed, like a woman tucked away in guilt, fearing for her life. The murder scenes in the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially good and contain enough blood to please most fans. One of the first killings is quite unexpected and really gives a good start to the film. The killer, the Red Queen, is one of the most outstanding and interesting killers I saw in the Italian film. The sets and fashions of the 70s are wonderful. In fact, all the visual effects are interesting because the laughing Red Queen, running over the bridge at night, is one of my favorite moments in the film. A tangled plot kept my interest everywhere. Finally, the score of Bruno Nicholas may be the best that I heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I could not get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> The only two problems I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times are in the final of the film. First, the person responsible for the killings is too easy to spot. If you have seen more than a pair of Gially, you will not have problems determining who is behind the killings. Secondly, the finale seems too hasty and, as a result, a bit confusing. I’m definitely not the one who needs all the points of the story set out for me, but I confess that I cannot explain all this. The second viewing may simply clarify this.
