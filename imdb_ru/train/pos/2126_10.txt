You can learn a lot about love and life by seeing people in the SHOP AROUND. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubic has added another quiet triumph to his credit in this beautiful film. Thanks to the sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his long-time co-author Samson Rafaelson) and the wonderful performances of actors with a huge number of talented performers, he created a truly unforgettable film. Always believing to play up to the intelligence of his viewers and approving sophistication than farce, the director came up with a brilliant cinematic performance, flavored with this elusive, mysterious quality, known as "Lubich's touch." <br /> <br /> Although the story unfolds in Budapest (and there are a lot of accents among the players), it doesn’t matter. The beautiful simplicity of the plot lies in the fact that any great American city or small town can easily become a scene of action. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are great because the clerks are in love with romance and then with each other without knowing it. Their dialogue — so skillfully managed that it seems completely natural — perfectly conveys their confusion and quiet despair when they seek soul mates. This is one of the classic movie love stories. <br /> <br /> Cherub Frank Morgan plays a more serious role than usual, the role of a man whose transient significance in his small world is destroyed when he turns out to be a cuckold In addition, Morgan offers the film the most joyous moments - towards the end - when he decides that the newest employee of his store, an impoverished young man, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Joseph Shildkraut adds another bright image to his list of screen images, this time to the list of the greedy, sycophantic Lothario, who fully deserves the punishment ultimately assigned to him. Gentle Felix Bressart has an excellent role in the film as a family man who really cannot afford to participate in the intrigues of the shops, but at the same time remains a true friend of Stewart. <br /> <br /> Sarah Hayden plays the small role of a salesman, William Tracy is very cheerful, like an ambitious errand boy, who uses unforeseen events to use her strength for sales. <br /> <br /> In tiny roles, Charles Halton plays the detective story, and Edwin Maxwell looks like a pompous doctor. Filmmakers recognize Mary Carr and Mabel Colcord - both without accreditation - in their only scene as grandmother and aunt, Miss Sallavan.
