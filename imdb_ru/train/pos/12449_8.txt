Finally, a good film, Modesty Blaise, was released, which not only tells the story, but actually tells the "real" story. I admit that this is a bad movie if you expect an action movie, but if you stop on your way and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that this story is very similar to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover version to talk about how Modesty has become a great person, which it is. This is not a film for attracting new fans, but a film telling a true story. Some things could be better, but when you can't forget the horrible movie of the 66th, then this is a great movie. So you're a fan, and then relax and just enjoy being a real story with a cover so that Modestia tells her story.
