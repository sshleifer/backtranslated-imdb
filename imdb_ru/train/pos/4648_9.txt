A fun, catchy, confusing, brilliant movie. Reminds me of L'Age D'Or Buñuel or the Holy Mountain of Yodorovsky - many strange characters who wander and search ..... what is it? I laughed almost the whole way, all the time closely watching the astounded and sometimes terrible reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. To have fun through, from the beginning to the intestines and the poisoned bowels to the end, if this was the end. I just wanted to remember every detail. Sometimes it haunts me. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have only the most positive memories of this film. Since it seems that there is no way to take them home and see, I suppose I will have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes to me again with his Big Slideshow (and the subsequent “What is this?” Show) ... I saw this the film in Atlanta almost immediately after having had a rather destructive car accident, so I was a little stunned at the time, which might have been a very good mood to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and mentally retarded Suits superheroes and the god-like Glover P In a comfortable environment, poorly dressed girls, rising from under the floor, like the magnificent wet dream of DADAist. <br /> <br /> This is a statement about life, how do we know it? Of course, everything EXPECTS art to be just that. I rather think that the truth is more obvious in the absence and in negative space. What you do not tell us is what we have to bring out, but it is much more reasonable than the lie that other people feed us day by day. Rather, one "WHAT IS IT?" more than 5,000 films such as Titanic or Seattle Insomnia (trembling, gag, moan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Glover (in addition to an amusing person who can be seen on the screen or on his big slide show). - smart, funny, freaky and insanely hot). Make more movies, write more books, support a living nightmare.
