This is a short, gruff animated series by David Lynch (as stated at the beginning), and he follows the wilderness accidents, dressed in a large, large man, with his wife, who has a stress disorder and an irritating son. In these short episodes, both of these elements are constantly repeated, and the real plot is not visible. It's easier to think about it as an exceptionally strange, slightly dark Looney tune - with a lot more blood, profanity, bloody violence and random moments of fun. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD with Eraserhead, having previously seen Eraserhead. Do not look at this series, if you want an artistic masterpiece - it is nothing like. In fact, it seems that this is almost a statement against such things, as his rude style is contrary to any animation agreement you can see. As Lynch says: “If it’s funny, it’s funny because we see the absurdity of it all.”
