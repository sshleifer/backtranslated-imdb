I have seen a lot of PPV in the past, but this is the most interesting, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. The additions to the DVD are worth it because they give a different idea of ​​how the wrestlers behave after the show (for example, an interview with Chris Benoit), some insight into the era of Monday Night Wars, the first match for the Hogan winner title. gold and some advertising talk. Additionally there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Team table match: Babby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 It was a pretty good tense match to start the show. Not too many holds, just pure raw physical form. Spike can hold their own matches at the tables, and Gerro and Benoit gave good clean fighting skills on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Heavyweight Championship: Jamie Noble with Nidia vs Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd was really not interested in any of the wrestlers and was not interested until Kidman made a press shooting star. Usually people expect a lot of high flying at the championship cruising weight, but this was very little. In fact, everything was so bad that when Noble struck at his finisher, no one even took care of it or found out (this can be judged by the absence of a camera flash). The ending was quick though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy vs. William Regal 5/10 I have never loved Regal as a wrestler, he lacks intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but in fact he did not get a chance to demonstrate his high flight, although he still showed good results and added that a fast paced match was needed. It all ended quickly, which was perfect for this match. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena vs. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny to look back at the very first Seine PPV, how he used to behave, how he used to dress and how he looked (see his interview, it's pretty funny). It was a good intense match with Cina, showing a good selection of holds, suplexes, counters and some antennas. Jericho was secondary, but definitely helped Seine to begin his career. Sina Wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontinental Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 It was a very tense and good match. Both styles of fighters are really well combined on the screen: Brocks pure power and coarse energy against RVD skills, full turns and speed. RVD looked great in this match (better than his later matches with the edge and sina), and the entire match was held at a fast pace. The ending worked fine because she still kept Brock's unbeatable series, giving the RVD his fresh desserts in his native state. <br /> <br /> 6. Match without disqualification: Booker T - Big Show 7/10 Another serious competition that lacked a certain intensity, like in a match with RVD, but still a good continuation. Although it all started rather slowly (which always happens with a big show), Booker T was impressive and made a bad move at the table of announcements. The finisher was awesome, the final was a big chagrin and a big step for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge vs. Christian and Lance Storm 5/10 It was a mediocre match. Hogan, as usual, comes out of a huge pop, but his variety of movements lacks this intensity and energy. On the other hand, Christian doesn’t exactly have the greatest sports abilities. It ended up being a mediocre match at best, but it was still good for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match Match for the Undisputed Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easily matches the year. This is by far the best triple threat match I've ever seen. He had close falls, many finishers, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity, and a fast pace. No one could predict who would come out of it. If you are going to buy this DVD, I would buy it strictly for this match. (ending? watch yourself!) <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good PPV with lots of extra goodies that made you look again and again. Although it is hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD), it is definitely worth your money.
