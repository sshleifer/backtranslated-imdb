Maybe I'm too generous in the rankings ... but I just adore this movie! I have seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love with it again and again. It's just a romantic comedy, in which there is nothing huge or monumental. But I'm a big romantic, and this movie is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. Scientists make me laugh like this ... I definitely recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. It's such a clean, good movie - and such are rare now! My 20-year-old brother also loves this movie, so it's not just a chick. ;-) I recommend this if you need to laugh, or if you are just lonely and you need to * watch * a novel if you yourself cannot participate in one. It's good!
