This series was the same as you would expect from Mr. Spielberg. This is really one of those scary, funny, children's shows that you will not forget. Just like the Outer Limits (another great show), this little series does something that not so much can. It was great and deserved to run longer. It was a great show that even children could watch, although some of them were a bit intimidating when they wanted to, but everyone at the end always had a moral (for example, the Twilight zone) that made you understand what situation you were in the end, or the ones you did. I remember watching some of them in science fiction when I was 10 years old, and even now I still like to see them when I can. Really fun, creative show. I loved it, and still do.
