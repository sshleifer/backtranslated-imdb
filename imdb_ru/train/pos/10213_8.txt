This bizarre film had the misfortune of being released at the same time as the very popular Amelie, both with a wonderful Audrey Toth playing a central role. Laurent Firod, a talented director, starred in one of the most enjoyable films that came out of France lately. <br /> <br /> The film deals with randomness, as its English title indicates. The French name refers to how the wings of butterflies can create chaos over the Atlantic during flight, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean, which cannot be trusted just by looking at these multicolored insects. From the very beginning, the director alternates all the characters that he sees in the film, and how each of them has a connection with the other, which is hard to imagine, but in the context of the film it works well. <br /> <br /> A random meeting in the subway sets the tone for the film. Seated opposite her, Irene, going to work, asks her to tell her what is her zodiac sign, and begins to read her newspaper. Irene seems to cross paths and find his soul mate on the same day. After Irina leaves the train, a quiet young man sitting next to a woman tells her that he has the same date of birth as Irina. It seems that they are meant for each other from the very beginning, but, alas, they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film. <br /> <br /> Audrey Totu is as beautiful as Irina. Fodel, who plays Younes, has nothing to do until the end, but he shows that he is present and plays his part well. A talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as the wings of a butterfly. <br /> <br /> We look forward to the future films of Laurent Ferod, because he seems to be the director with his heart in the right place and listen to how people are connected.
