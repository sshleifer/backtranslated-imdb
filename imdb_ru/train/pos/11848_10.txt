Well, what can I say, this film really got to me, it's not as bad as many say, I really loved it, although the idea seems so simple and rather boring, it is not. First of all, I liked the soundtrack (Brian Adams), it really fits in with the film. Secondly, a simple story, and the drama of the Spirit attracts your attention. Most of all I like the fact that they did not give the stallion a human voice to interact with other horses, it makes the film more realistic, not many animations seem realistic, do they? you know, forcing animals to just talk like that ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animations of 2002, in my opinion, I recommend to everyone, not just children :), because itâ€™s relaxing.
