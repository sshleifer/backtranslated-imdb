When tradition dictates that the artist must pass on his great skills and magic to the heir, an aging and very proud street performer, known to all as the “King of masks”, begins desperately to look for the young man’s student to adopt and improve. br /> <br /> His warmth and humanity, however, force him to pay a few dollars for a small man who was forced to leave the country as a result of the devastating natural disasters in China, in this case the massive flooding in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> He takes his new 7-year-old companion to the straw houseboat to live with his dear and lovely monkey, the “General,” only to discover that he is a girl. <br /> <br /> His life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave is interwoven with a silly tradition that requires that he pass on his art only to a young man. <br /> <br /> There are many stories in this story ... many people are touched, and the culture of China opens up to our western view. Thousands of years of heritage come down to a cup of drama, and few will leave this DVD with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical translation itself is not that great, as I discovered that the sound levels are everywhere meter, and could actually see the video transmission lines in several parts of the film. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
