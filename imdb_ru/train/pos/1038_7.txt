Loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors in this. But for me, Mrs. Davis’s very bad attempt with an accent, and her tough acting really makes a film that is otherwise irresistible, very difficult to watch. Seriously, if any other modern actor played the same role in the same style as Mrs. Davis, they would have laughed off-screen. <br /> <br /> I really think she "called this one." Now, if Mirna Loy or Ingrid Bergman played the role of wife, I would have enjoyed it much more. <br /> <br /> I guess I just don’t "understand" Bette Davis. I always thought of her as an actor who "plays herself" no matter what role she plays. A possible exception is “Now Voyager.” <br /> <br /> I am sure that many other reviewers will explain carefully (and I hope, civilian) in detail how I'm completely wrong about this. But I will continue to watch films in which she is removed, because I like stories / essays / support, but I will always think of different actresses who could do better.
