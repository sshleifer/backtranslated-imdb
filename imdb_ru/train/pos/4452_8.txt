Do not be inclined to skeptics. This is an amazingly creepy movie. It was a thesis project for the writer / director J. T. Petty He coped so well that I sat on the edge of my seat. I never knew what to expect, and for a harassed viewer of a horror movie, this is Nirvana! The film tells about an elderly man who lives in an isolated log cabin in the forest. One day, while searching for his cat in the forest, did he witness the murder of a child or not? The rest of the film suffers. What is most unusual in this film is that there is no dialogue here until the last few scenes. I found it to be intriguing. The writer manages to master your feelings and constantly tug them. Try this movie, you will not be disappointed.
