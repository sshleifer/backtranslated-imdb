“Moonstruck” is a film that I liked the first time I watched it. I really enjoyed the second time. I loved it the third time. Now this is one of my favorites for all time. <br /> <br /> Humor is subtle, but very good. The film offers a lot of warm humor. The story takes place in the old school district in New York. Looking for Cher love is a pleasure to watch. This film is by far the best work of Nicolas Cage in the movies. The character of the old man is fantastic. He lights up the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. But perhaps the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is the scene in which the main characters play it at breakfast from oatmeal in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and completion.
