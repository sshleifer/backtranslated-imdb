First of all, let's start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE, gaping integers in the storyline and the questions raised that will not give an answer; 2) The film is not for all people, so impolite viewers will worry and start yapping during the movie. <br /> <br /> The second point is important because the film is very quiet. In an older type of theater (for example, in the one I went to), sometimes you can hear the reel go through the projector. I loved it. The film does not distract you with music or effects: it allows you to think about what is happening. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm, which creates an atmosphere that is delightfully pleasant. The same atmosphere was created by Stanley Kubrick in the Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to movie lovers, since the cinematic work is simply awesome. Those who base their assessment of the film solely on history will be extremely disappointed. This is the story that you must then create in your mind. (My version is damn cool, but probably completely out of sorts!) If you understand the film, there is one very cool part: when two policemen are talking to each other on a mobile phone. Ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the man who thought about it.
