SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> I'm really in the minority, but I liked this movie. It's not a classic, but it definitely involves and fully feeds on adrenaline. I definitely thought it was worth at least 7 points. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the reason I liked it was because I didn’t see the original. Something tells me that with such a film it will be the most powerful fans. people who have not seen the original version and, therefore, have little to compare it with. It was not a masterpiece, but I entered it quite often, and this actually made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were a few things I liked about him. One of them was casting Kowalski. Viggo Mortenson was great and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since most of the film fell on his shoulders, he really had to be excellent, and he was. It was a great role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was that it was made for television. I had no idea that this was the case when I watched it. Of course, it looked like a big motion picture, and I would never have guessed that it was not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also discovered that the story is very fascinating. I'm not alone for action movies, but I was involved in this. In addition, it was much more than an action movie, in which there were drama, mysticism, a love story, bizarre people from all sides. (I didn't even recognize Priestley.) And it was touching. It was not a very good movie, but you can watch it. <br /> <br /> And now, the end. He has a strong blow, and if he has been involved in history before this point, it’s very difficult not to be shocked at the very end. I'm not sure how I feel about the final. The implication was that Kowalski had survived, and although I am very skeptical about HOW this would be possible, this is a film, and realism is not the component that is always present in the mix when making a film. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I found the end to be incredibly unrealistic, but very touching in a manipulative sense, which I usually do not like, but for some reason it is almost excusable in this film. Admittedly, many things were just props for the plot (were the villains more stereotyped?) But the creators did a lot right even if they were mistaken in many things. However, having said this, I admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original will hate this version because, although I have not seen the original, I have seen many original films that I liked that were redone with terrible results. (My big dislike is actually a continuation.) But I can understand low marks if the original is of such high quality. <br /> <br /> People compare it to Smokey and the Bandit. What about the road version of "Legends Of The Fall", which also meets "Thelma and Louese"? I am sure that I felt the touch to both films (both of which I am a fan). However, I don't think it was a great movie. It was better than average for me, but far from great. But it was a fascinating, touching adrenaline, touching film with an excellent selection of the main characters. My vote is 7 out of 10.
