One of several musicals about sailors on vacation, this is an ordinary sailor, meets a girl, complications arise, they happily understand the plot. This happens quite smoothly, but in some places it also drags on. The dialogue is not as fast as, for example, in Top Hat, and Randolph Scott seems out of place. <br /> <br /> There are compensations. It has some of the best songs of Irving Berlin, including “Let Your Go Go”, “I put all my eggs in one basket” and “Let's face it in music and dancing”. These are Fred and Ginger, who, when they dance, raise any film to heavenly heights, and they do not disappoint here. They perform an instant tap dance, a terrific comic dance and a spinning graceful dance, all in one movie! Excellent versatility and artistry. <br /> <br /> She also has Harriet Hilliard, who is pretty good at her role. She had a varied career that became more famous for Harriet Nelson with Ozzy. Here she is touching, not being sentimental. Her two songs are simply and efficiently delivered. She contrasts well with Ginger, but you can believe that they are the sisters in the film. <br /> <br /> Even more protracted, and the film has become even better. Pretty good though.
