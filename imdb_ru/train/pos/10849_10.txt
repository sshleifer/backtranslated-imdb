This is perhaps the best rock document in the whole history of Britain, the spine is better. The characters are believable, the plot is great, and you can sincerely empathize with some events, such as Ray's problem with fitting to the group. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great. The material of the real period, even if it is in one key, you will hum some songs for several days. What I liked was almost all the British actors with some of their favorite names. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The film never pulls, it just goes at the right pace, and there are really funny sections in it. A generator of really good phrases! <br /> <br /> This is a hidden diamond.
