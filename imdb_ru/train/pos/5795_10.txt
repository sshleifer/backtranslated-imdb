This film is my favorite for all times !!! You really should see Michael Jackson in this great movie! I am always in seventh heaven watching this !! This is a film that you really should watch, even if you are not a fan of MJ, because this film writes like Captain EO, E.T. and ghosts, some history of cinema and music !! This wonderful film, from Michael's feathers, should be !! And: Smooth Criminal, really the most wonderful, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard in my life !! Thanks to Michael for this film and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to hit this planet, he is a good person, and he always brings sparks into your eyes when you listen to his music !! Please, if you don’t know this movie, watch it and don’t miss it because it would be too bad for you if you missed it !! - Highly recommended movie for every movie buff
