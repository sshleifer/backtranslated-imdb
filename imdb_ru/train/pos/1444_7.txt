*** SPOILERS *** When Undercover Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano, was supposed to meet with his drug provider Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Brooklyn district of Williamsburg during the “buy and go bankrupt” operation, and Tito was the only one who went bankrupt, and with both Children it went wrong. Santos and Tito end up killing each other. An innocent bystander, six-year-old James Bon Jr., Jalil Lynn, was also killed during the deadly crossfire skirmish. <br /> <br /> New York was planning to adopt the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer the last thing the bright mayor of the city of Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible uprising because of the possible tragic death of young James Bones, it was later found that it was a bullet from Tito's pistol that killed young James, a member of New York. City Police Department. <br /> <br /> What was much more shocking than even Kostya’s death was that his killer, Tito Zapatti, received a probation from the distinguished judge of the state of New York, Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When they were to put him in jail for 10–20 years, he was arrested with a kilogram of cocaine in the back seat of his car! It soon became apparent that the man who got the job of Judge Stern for a reward of $ 50,000 was not the political boss of Brooklyn, Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It is Anselmo who is involved with Mayor Pappas in a land deal involving the New York subway system, which will bring tens of millions of dollars to him and his real estate friends over the next two years! It also indirectly linked Mayor Pappas to killing bones, linking him to Judge Stern, who allowed Tito to be free, who is his mutual friend and his Gomba, or landowner Frank Anselmo! <br /> <So that all this is not blown up by the late Det. Santons created, working undercover without the permission of his superiors, in shooting at the bones. In fact, those who set up Santos went so far and hid about $ 40,000 in cash in his upstairs summer house, giving the impression that he was paid by Tito Paul Zapatti’s uncle-boss, Anthony Françoise, for letting him his nephew handing out drugs along with him, getting a piece of the action. Which may well explain him, as well as Tito, whom Tito shot for paying Santos! <br /> <br /> As it turns out, this is the deputy mayor of Pappas at Kevin Calhoun City Hall, John Cusack, who ends up spoiling everything for his boss, being too honest in finding the one who was responsible for hiding Tito’s criminal past, who allowed him go outside. The facts that Kevin has revealed lead directly to Frank Anselmo, a major political supporter of the mayor of Pappas, who, as it turned out, was associated with the thigh with the mafia leader Tito uncle Paul! <br /> <br /> The City Town Hall plan is a bit overpriced. It really shows how corruption in large cities can be hidden and suppressed by everyone, like Mayor Pappas, mayor Pappas, without even knowing it. The biggest sin of the mayor of Pappas was that he was friends with the Brooklyn boss Anselmo, who arranged for people to work, for example, to judge Stern, who was subjected to blackmail from the real boss Anselmo mafiosi Paul Sapatti. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** Williamsburg needed a deadly firefight to set in motion not only Tito, but also Det. Santos and James Bon were killed, but why was he allowed to go outside to shoot down the very popular mayor of New York? Mayor Pappas was looking forward to much more, for example, from the governor or even the president, in his future political endeavors. As it turned out, his High Deputy Kevin Calhoun did not look the other way and was responsible for his demise. And also a good friend of the mayor Frank Anselmo and the man he helped put on the bench, as a state judge, Judge Stern. Whose decision to let go of Tito Zapatti made this whole disaster possible, which led to at least half a dozen murders and one suicide!
