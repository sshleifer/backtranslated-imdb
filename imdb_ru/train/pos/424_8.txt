I like this movie because I grew up racing. Pat Bun, standing behind the sullen, reminds me of my father, who was attracted to trotters, because, unlike purebred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, "The House of 1944" in Indiana is the best film, but it is also a completely different film. April love is easy and easy to see, a good movie. (Although it is disappointing that Pat Boone’s religious / moral views did not allow him to kiss a girl! Compared to today's standard fare.) Indiana’s Walter Brennan house some hesitates) better captures stress and struggle, thus making the final achievement more satisfactory, but requires large emotional investments.
