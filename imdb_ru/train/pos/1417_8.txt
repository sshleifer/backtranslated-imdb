I saw this movie with my family, and it was great! This film is more than just a documentary (which offers no more than cold facts) with long mono / -duologs and a multitude of diagrams ... All the “strength” of this film stems from impressive images taken under water in the air or the Arctic. Watching this film, you can learn more about our planet than by just reading a book, it shows that WE are immersed in the circular flow of life. This film is not just for "fanatics of the environment", although people who want to watch a good movie with a message should watch it. This film taught me that we not only live on earth ... we live on Earth and through it, and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
