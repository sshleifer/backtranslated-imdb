To understand and enjoy the many situations, characters and jokes of the "Testament", as well as many other films about Kusturica, requires a Serbian or even Balkan acquaintance. Look, for example, the first scenes with a remote village in the Serbian mountains, with low-tech devices protecting the integrity and lifestyle of the inhabitants, nostalgia on the good days of communist rule and awakening. The young boy watches his naked teacher to the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica is not only trying to move away from the tragic history of Serbia, described in his previous films, but also creates a whole world of herself in this process. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film or not a clearly political film in any case. This is a fun movie first. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. Music plays an active role in this film, as in all of his other films. His style is direct and grotesque, now we know what he thinks of his characters, and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The space in which he develops the present, combines the present, history and magic, and the colors seem to resemble Douinier Rousseau from modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie is also not perfect. The main disadvantage is the length, some edits and abbreviations would be useful, because at some point the director seems to run out of ideas, and repetitions appear. This is another one of the most exciting, funny, touching films I've seen lately.
