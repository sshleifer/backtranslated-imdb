In our family, we are huge A Christmas Carol fans and we see almost every version of every Christmas, including the old 1968 Reginald Owen and the modern 1999 Patrick Stewart. Our common favorite is the black and white classic of 1951, because Alastair Sim IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and its appeal ring true. Nevertheless, this performance in 1984 has its unique advantages and makes an excellent and fascinating history, on the whole, quite faithful to Dickens' novel. (See My Comments on Other Adaptations of the Movie, if Interesting) <br /> <br /> First of all, George S. Scott, of course, may seem rather capricious and quite good Scrooge. I adore his sideburns, his long coat and hat. He cuts the best figure in the fashion world and is a rather handsome gentleman. However, sometimes it seems that Scott enjoys his role as Scrooge a little bit and does not take it as seriously as he should! <br /> <br /> In this performance the best Christmas atmosphere, full of hope and optimism. Somehow you know that this story will have a happy ending. Filmed in Shrewsbury, England, he seems very British. The film has excellent musical accompaniment, with wonderful, lively carol music in all relevant parts of the story. Sometimes I almost smelled roasted chestnuts and pudding in copper! <br /> <br /> The painful ghost of Marley (with his wonderful jaw dropping scene) and the three spirits are all pretty convincing. Christmas Past is a wonderful, unearthly woman, a Christmas present, surprisingly gigantic and cheerful, Christmas Want To Come, shrouded and apprehensive, as always. However, I found Scrooge's nephew, Fred, a bit quiet and gloomy, not as merry and hearty as he should be. I like the nephew's wife, whom they called Janet, with her beautiful, cheerful hairstyle. Instead of bluffing a blind man, they came up with a game called Similes for his nephew's Christmas party, and it was a small touch: Scrooge immediately understood the spirit of it. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and their somewhat scanty (although highly appreciated) Christmas dinner is well depicted, with Bob (David Warner) sympathetic and distressful, in his scarf miles, respectively. Mrs. Cratchit is charmingly portrayed by Suzanne York, who also played a major role with George Scott in the 1970 film adaptation of Jane Eyre. First of all, in this version, undoubtedly, the best Little Tim, not only a charming and cute little waffle, but also a painful one. With these dark circles under the eyes, the fragile thing is unlikely to survive the hour! <br /> <br /> This is a delightful and touching version of holiday classics. With its festive atmosphere, it will surely immerse you in the spirit of the season.
