I liked this show so much, and I'm so sad that it was canceled, I thought it would be back too, but only two stupid weeks. It's horrible. I hate how we will never know how everyone ends up. it sucks. Return it! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and whatnot, but they donâ€™t give time for good ones like Six Degrees. If they complain about the ratings, perhaps because they had a bad slot, because it was a really good show, something I could relate to and expected. JJ Abrams delivered, he's awesome, I wish ABC could just trust him enough to finish the story. I also loved the whole cast. I could not wait to see how everyone would ever meet each other right away. Universal history is now left incomplete, now I will never know whether Stephen and Whitney or Carlos and May will gather. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura, Damien, and everyone else. This is really such a depressant.
