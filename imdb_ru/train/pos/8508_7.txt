Richard Dix decided to retire, and Michael Duane took his place, playing the role of Ted Nichols, who meets with a young French woman named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple knew each other only for two days, and they decided to marry the justice of the peace (judge), and it rained when they drove up to the judge's house and found out that he was not at home and would not return until the next day. When a couple is inside the house, you see someone lift the hood of their car and remove the car part from the engine. As soon as you see that this event is happening, you realize that this couple expects a big surprise, and the story tells about a very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley, and therefore poor Ted Nichols starts with a lot of problems and without marriage. Good riddle, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
