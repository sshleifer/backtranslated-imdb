When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visits London, the British journalist Alan Foster is approaching him, who becomes the object of a special rate. Not believing Poeâ€™s claim that all his dark stories are based on real experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend, Sir Thomas Blackwood, that he cannot spend the whole night in Blackwood's haunted castle. Installed in an abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone because various beautiful women and beautiful men turn to him, as well as a doctor of metaphysics who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay their death stories the anniversary of their death! When I first saw this great classic horror, I was hypnotized all the time. I found the movie really creepy and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. Musical accompaniment makes the atmosphere twice as daunting. The scene without toples made me close in the loop, since I did not expect it. It seems that Synapse did a great job with improving the image, because this movie is damn good for its age, and this is the bootable version of Uncut International. This is the film for which I start the Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection.
