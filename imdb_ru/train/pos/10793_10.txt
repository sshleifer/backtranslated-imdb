There are several spoilers in this comment !! <br /> <br /> Contrary to the comments that I just read from nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and I would like to see it on the weekly TV series. <Br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills, but also a big fan of Chuck Norris, and although I admit that some of the action scenes could have stretched the line a bit, the storyline fits into other weekly TV shows. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes, when Dick ran away from the bad guys after the explosion of their missiles, were very intense. I do not understand how many “professionals” could not hit a moving target, but the action was definitely, and Dick, as a hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> Regarding the commentary on the need to “get a film in a bank to fill the time interval after the playoffs”. This film was not originally planned for CBS to be shown in January, and filming was completed in May 2001, four months before the terrorist attacks against the United States. <br /> <br /> If the author of the comment turned his attention to the film instead of trying to avoid it, they might have understood the plot of this story: Rashid, a character like bin Laden, planned to launch a nuclear device in the United States. The president’s man was called to find and fix the problem. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the author should watch a movie before commenting on it. <br /> <br />
