This game is awesome. In fact, you should get it if you do not have it. Although it is now older, but when it came out, it was amazing. I believe that this game will always be a classic. It's as good as Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I sat and played this game for hours trying to beat her, which we eventually did. It’s not as advanced as the Super Mario Galaxy, but if you’re a Mario fan, that’s important. It is fun and interesting. Everything you could want from a fantastic game, except for good graphics, (well, it was released in 1996.) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
