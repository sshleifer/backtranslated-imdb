Pierce Brosnan sipped his last Martini and returns in an outrageous self-parody like the aging dirty killer Julian Noble, who especially loves teenage girls, bullfights and sticky clothes. While working in Mexico City, he meets Denny (Greg Kinnear), a straight-line commuter business man in Denver, who is in the city to set up his business for life, in a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and the rude and inconspicuous remarks of Julian, they become friends. <br /> <br /> Directed by Richard Shepard, he said that he was largely inspired by the performances of Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinner, he did not write a film with the thought of Pierce Brosnan, but I can hardly imagine it without him. He has a real talent for comedy, and he can be more than just James Bond or Cold War spies. The scene in which they meet in a brilliant hotel bar (stunning scenery and beautifully photographed) is, in fact, a bravura of acting. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes, and, although it was probably carefully thought out, both actors mostly improvise, but they do it great! This is similar to the new standard in the on-screen game. Think of Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in “MEAN STEETS” improvisation and add one of the most subtle foundations of many genre cliches and your own typography of actors (in particular, James Bond Brosnan), and you get one of the most delightful couples in recent Hollywood <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is over time. An hour later, the film just ran out of steam. However, and I can’t point this out exactly, I really enjoyed it. He looks very fresh and original, with an original use of scenery and lighting, as well as some hints of Seijoon Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. Other heroes have little to do, but this film does offer something new, in this respect it almost effortlessly transforms all ordinary genres into a rather entertaining parody. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 7/10
