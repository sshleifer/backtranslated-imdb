The first animated film from Ireland is also one of the best cartoons I have ever seen. This is a real wart and the whole story, which is not like any of the other Oscar nominees and any other film of this year or any other year. <br /> <br /> In the plot of the film there is Abbot Kells, a village in Ireland is building a wall around his city to prevent the Vikings from destroying the city if they ever attack. His nephew Brandon, a young monk who tries his best, but meets the wrath of his uncle, doing things in his time. When the legendary enlightener Aidan arrives from a ruined monastery, Brandon drifts towards him and his warm personality. Much to the chagrin of his uncle, Aiden proposes to teach Brandon to illuminate. To help Aidan work on his great book, rescued from a ruined monastery, Brendan goes into the woods for ink material. Being outside the walls, he meets Ashley, the forest spirit, with whom he develops friendship. Unfortunately, the Abbot finds out that he has gone beyond the wall, and there is hell to pay. But the Vikings are hiding in the distance ... <br /> <br /> Forget that you think you know about this film, you are mistaken. Even what I explained does not make this film fair. This is a simple story with a lot more going on. This is a wonderful film about trying to find your way in the world, about the approaching demons and finding the beauty of the world outside the walls. (As stated in the film, the world is a dangerous place, and it does not cease to exist, even if you build walls). <br /> <br /> This is a film that appeals to its adult audience and concerns all life, including darkness. There is death and destruction, joy and happiness. Its not covered in sugar. People are dying. Monsters are hiding. (it infuriated some children), but in the end there is hope. Frankly, the darkness in this film is completely different from any of the recent American paintings. Forget about “sadness” in the Pixar movie, it's a real thing, and it is refreshing, and it shows how even Pixar is homogenized. <br /> <br /> This is an animated film by Jenny Tartakovsky-Esquire (Samurai Jack), which look is actually based on the Celtic art of the period. This is a movie that is not like any other. Here again, another film that takes a frame of the film and uses it in all possible ways. Images are designed to fill the maximum available space. Often a movie manipulates things to make it look like a page in the legendary Book of Kells. Its stunningly beautiful and best described as art comes to life. <br /> <br /> Director Tomm Moore created the film, which is a masterpiece. I can not say more than that. It is a masterpiece. This is one of the best cartoons I've ever come across.
