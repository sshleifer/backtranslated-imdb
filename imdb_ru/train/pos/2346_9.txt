Very cute pilot. The show smells like Tim Burton's best films ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & The Chocolate Factory. Cinematography, narration, music, exterior scenery - all this Tim Burton shouts. There must be some connection or strong influence, I just didnâ€™t explore enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw on the forums, yes, Anna Friel plays the role of a poor man. Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen, I see Zoe. Don't get me wrong, Anna Friel is doing a great job. Her character is very sweet and sweet, and you easily become attached to her. It distracts me more from the thought: "Why didn't they get Zooey Deschanel?" <br /> <br /> Lee Pace does a great job too. I kept trying to remember how I knew him, and I was just looking for it. Wonderfalls !!! Magnificent, short-lived series in 2004. If you like Pushing Daisies, you MUST rent Wonderfalls, which is another Brian Fuller creation ?? (Horror shop) again. Two underestimated character actresses who never fail to bring it with their actions.
