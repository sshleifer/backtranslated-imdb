it was my personal favorite when I was young, it had everything that was wonderful with the children's films of the 90s ... cute dinosaurs, cute children, an eccentric villain and some great songs (and not a typical mermaid of a beast type song, but those that are really interesting)! I recently encountered this film again and still love it as much as I always have! I recommend that every person of all ages watch this film, and I definitely think that it should be presented to younger generations! I'm sorry, not the most informative, Iâ€™m in a bit of a hurry ... just please believe me. all who go against this film kill their inner child!
