Lay out the funniest parody of the pretentious art home movies ever made. <br /> <br /> This film shows all the clich√©s, and then some! Agonizingly bad (Down syndrome) actors. A terribly difficult, important dialogue for me. Scenes that should shock but fall. Sharp editing. Pointless plot points. All of them are shrouded in a kind of smirk of miasm of disrespect for the public and a vague mental disorder. <br /> <br /> He achieves exactly what the Merry Satire of these tedious films made by spoiled sponsoring teenagers is intended to show their parents when they ask them what they have been doing for the past two years! After "What is it?" Having received his Cannes award, the host, Werner Herzog, is rumored to have received a message that the film was in fact a fake, in part of his own films! He allegedly exploded from the information. To this day, he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> In any case, look at it and laugh, it will be a classic of humor for many years.
