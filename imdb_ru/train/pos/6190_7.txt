Fay Grim is a continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with Henry the Fool Hartley. I have not seen an earlier film, and I do not know whether this is good or not. I can only appreciate the current film. <br /> <br /> For most people, the Hal Hartley film making style is something you like or dislike. His combination of action, drama, absurdity and dry ironic humor really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. It sounds sharply written intelligent parody, which made me and many of the spectators of the Melbourne International Film Festival laugh out loud. For the first half of the film, it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness. This style of humor, unfortunately, lacks cinemas and long-awaited relief for senseless youthful comedies that Hollywood plays like pancakes. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the film, humor begins to diminish as the film turns into an international spy / conspiracy thriller. Whether it was Hartley’s intention or if he’d run out of ideas is unclear, but I think a little editing or rewriting to cut the film’s fifteen minutes would support the film’s initial impetus. <br /> <br /> The performances were generally good, especially with Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most screen time. Saffron Burroughs, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina Levenson all played good supporting roles. The visual effects of the film were good (set in New York, Paris, Berlin, and Istanbul), and the music (also Hartley) was good, without being intrusive. The film is well written, and I really enjoyed it. If you like Hartley's earlier work, you will probably like it.
