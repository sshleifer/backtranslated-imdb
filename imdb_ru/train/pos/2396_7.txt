This is a very interesting film that follows the rehearsal process of Macbeth's New York production. Although in our modern world much can be said about strength, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth themes), the film works best when it does not take itself too seriously. Famous actors such as John Glover, Gloria Rubens and David Lansbury do an excellent job of starring, but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where Banquo (John Elsen) was “rehearsing”. Perhaps a more interesting film for those involved in theater, but anyone who loves Shakespeare should enjoy this film.
