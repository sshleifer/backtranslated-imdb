The Peter Jackson versions are the best films in general from an objective point of view. However, they are not my favorite screen versions of The Lord of the Rings, and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First, the action of the screen characters is too ordinary and boring with LOTR Jackson. The whole cast is too run. “Are you saying that these stupid cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi's version are better actors than real people?” One might ask. Well, they are not very stupid (with the exception of the Hobbits, and later about them), and they certainly have a greater personality than the Jackson party - even with a much more limited communication time. And this is because of the excellent _voice_ action of LOTR Bakshi. Take, for example, Aragorn. In this version, his voice is deep and charismatic with full authority (the lord of Aragorn) and an experienced rasp (ranger Aragorn). This is due to the brilliant voice of John Hurt. Compare this with Viggo Mortensen's rather high sound without a soul, and the duel quickly becomes uneven: Mortensen hurts his hands. <br /> <br /> And then there is Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the whole saga. In this version, Bakshi Gandalf (William Squire) is a real wizard. And by this I do not mean that he bolts from the tips of his fingers (he does not do this), but his presence simply fascinates. He is mystical, powerful and can easily move from a gentle old man to a terrible person. Add to this its appearance: tall, old, like an ancient oak, a beard with a long body, sharp eyes, a magic hook nose and, of course, a classic magic hat. Perfect Gandalf, as in books. Gandalf Jan McKellen, on the other hand, is just too boring. He looks too human, sounds too human, behaves too human and does not wear hats or does not wield a sword. Yes, the sword. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf slaughters a pair of bloody kills of orcs with his sword (as he did in the books). And these are stylish slow killings. Gandalf is not a force to mix with. And it should be noted that, although I am sad to talk about this, the great Christopher Lee did not bring Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr in this film did it, even with very limited time and screen lines. <br /> <br /> Before I fully get to the visual aspects of the film, it should be noted that the sound and general presentation of the Orcs is also superior to the dominant bad guys Jackson. Bakshi Orcs constantly tease their enemies (or each other) with growls, screams and nasty language. They are more believable as monsters and more true to the book, in my opinion. And, finally, the Black Riders - or the Nazgul. These worst guys are scary ghosts in this, and not just some riders dressed in black. And they speak in an obsessive voice that hypnotizes their victim. My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazgul are stalking Frodo by the river. While Peter Jackson could do nothing but show riders who were just after a party, Bakshi offers a nightmare with cool scenes in slow motion and a rattling sky. <br /> <br /> But I like this film more than Jackson, the latter, at least technically, is even better. And this is due to some key visual effects. As you know, Bakshi LOTR is a mixture of animated characters (all hobbits and the main team) and real actors covered in paint. In fact, I have no problem using real people in animation, but they are not well suited for traditional cartoon characters. This is especially true for people (Riders of Rohan, taverns, etc.). Orcs are another matter, as they must look very distinctive from other characters. Orcs, in which people play with animation, look much better than the Jackson version. They have brownish green skin, shiny red eyes, a flat face and sharp teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistakes in this film, however, are the hobbits. Although I prefer almost every character in the version of Bakshi compared to Jackson, the latter is clearly superior to the hobbits, in fact, they are perfect. With Bakshi, you get some annoying and rather badly drawn humanoid Disney assholes. And you have to spend a lot of time with them in the cinema, so be careful. Again, the voice acting is all right, but the mouths of the actors cannot save the “damage from the dive” inflicted by these little caresses. Well, anyway, I never liked these halflings. <br /> <br /> Common mistakes in the Bakshi scenario are well known. Limited playing time (with limited budget) and lots of missing scenes. So, although this film covers almost half of the story, it does not do this in detail compared to the Jackson version. <br /> <br /> In brief, Ralph Bakshi’s LOTR version has an excellent: <br /> <br /> overall atmosphere (this is more like Middle-earth) -to the general voice acting — music (I really dig a fantasy score of Comte and Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (one of John Herth's best roles) -King Theoden -Orks -Black Rider -Elrond (He’s not some kind of fabulous hippie in this!)> Although Jackson’s version is better: <br /> <br /> - because that it covers the whole story - all the visuals and special effects - Gollum / Smeagol - Balrog - The Hobbits <br /> <br /> Lord of the rings Ralph Bakshi, even with his zvestna flaws, is one of the best animated films ever made, and it reflects very well, if not perfect, the atmosphere fantastic world of Tolkien. I'll rate him 8½ out of 10.
