I saw it a couple of times on Sundance a few years ago and got a good cinematic hit on the system. A semi-surrealistic but hard look at modern media culture (or lack thereof), which focuses on some of the bewildered, far-reaching Hollywood people. He had a funny early performance by Mark Ruffalo and a little memorable cinema from DP, which was filmed in the films " Polish brothers. There was a wild, uncompromising humor and a strange original feeling that definitely distinguished him. In this film, a cult classic was written, and I am surprised that it is not on DVD yet. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon.
