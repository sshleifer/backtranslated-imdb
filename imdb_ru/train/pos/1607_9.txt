As someone here said, every scene in this movie is a gem. Most films are lucky that they had one perfect scene, but director Jewison left the house every time. The cast got the perfect idea of ​​the excellent screenplay, and, moreover, the musical settings of Dick Heiman's opera and other music were created for a perfect match. It’s hard to imagine how they maintained their exact mood throughout the long production of the film. Comedy is subtle (mostly), and camera work reflects every little emotional intonation of the story. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (whom I know mainly from the role of Frank Lorenzo in the film “Everyone in the Family”, until I saw him in this, and then on Broadway in the 80s) deserved much more fame than he ever got, and at Aiello, Unhappy losers are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to paying tribute to this terrific composition. Did jevison ever write about this movie? <br /> <br /> I would like to read it. It's hard to understand why the average rating here on IMDb is so low ...
