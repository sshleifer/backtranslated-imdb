The inspirational story of Karl Brashir (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, seeking to become the first black diver-master in fleet history. We are shown a series of battles from childhood that Brashear must overcome in order to realize his dream (and then bring it to life). An equally important task was master diver Bill Sandy (Robert DeNiro), the head coach of the Scuba Diving School, which the Navy sends to Brashear, who is not particularly sympathetic to Brashir’s goals, but eventually becomes an unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; fast paced and with a lot of action, although not “action” pic in the usual sense of the word. There is also a very human history and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; there is also a sense of struggle that occurred in the 1960s between senior and junior naval officers (the “old fleet” against the “new fleet”). The indicators are pretty good — especially Goodings. ” I thought that DeNiro was perhaps a bit exaggerated in his Sunday image (although, who knows, Sunday might well have been such an extraordinary kind of free gun), and the image of Sunday's wife Gwen (Charlize Theron) also made me wonder if these pieces were "Shocked" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Good movie though. I never wondered whether to tune in. <br /> <br /> 7/10
