This film is good if you like thoughtless actions, banal games and a very small plot! The special effects are decent, considering that this film is from the director of "Event Horizon". Costumes like something from a mad max movie. None of the soldiers speak, so others tell them what to do. In the end, this is a big fighter with explosions everywhere. Personally, I liked Russell more in “tango and money”, “escape from New York” and “executive decision”. It is to see that this film left your mind in the doorway for a frivolous sci-fi action movie !!
