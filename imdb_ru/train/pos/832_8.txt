I wonder how realistic Brosnan’s presentation is compared to the original James Bond novels compared to the bond films. He is neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and womanizer. This is the perfect break for him, even if you laugh at the bond icon. “I am a mess, a parody of myself,” he says. It does not get better than that. I just finished reading “Doctor No,” and that’s how Ian Fleming portrayed James Bond. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as Bond, because he was too close to the icon. He has nothing to personalize, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's nice to see Brosnan play a character based both on reality and bright behind the wall. Shallow nature, trying to come to an understanding of deeper emotional and psychological problems with which he has no experience. This is an impressive image, and having Greg Kinear to justify it is simply poetic. This film reminds me a bit of the dynamics established between the main characters of "My blue sky", but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.
