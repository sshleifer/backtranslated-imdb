This is a very dark and intriguing horror thriller, based on the idea of ​​religious killings. The storyline tells about a deranged person who lives in Texas, USA, who suddenly begins to kill his two young sons after God instructs them to redeem the world of bad people. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton, who directs In this film, plays the abnormal Father known as the Assassin's Hand of God, while Matthew McConaughey plays his best performances to date as the eldest son, Fenton Meyks. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides that he can no longer bear the burden of his murderous childhood, and uses the memories to compulsively tell the story to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Booth). <br /> <br /> I can’t think of many films that literally keep the viewer chained to the place from start to finish, and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you can't do it because of the great power of this film. <br /> <br /> The directors made this film very well and they help determine the plot through a good landscape. The acting in this film is great, but if there is some flaw, it’s that some parts are very powerful and can get in the way of some people. <br /> <br /> Although the concept of this film is very dark, small children help to portray the idea through a brilliant game. This is really a tingling film on the spine, and you are guaranteed to be on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves horror films, exciting and powerful films, or those who just want to see something else. <br /> <br /> 8/10
