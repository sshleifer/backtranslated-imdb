My observations: postwar gaiety. Tom Drake and the grandfather of "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed is charming and sweet. Margaret Hamilton is as good as ever; a smaller part than in The Wizard of Oz. In the spring, Byington is much prettier, also with the obligatory provocative little nose that Hamilton lacks. The tent scene at the end with the ex-boy next door was fun. As a two-year veteran of army tents, he looked rather young and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. <br /> <br /> I used to work in a department store, and it was as elegant as this one. Unfortunately, it disappeared and disappeared into obscurity. We were famous for those wonderful shop windows that were used to lure passersby to the store to make them buy all these wonderful products. <br /> <br /> 10/10
