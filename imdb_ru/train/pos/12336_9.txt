Wonderful period killing melodrama, with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive Wallflower type, in a role that Olivia De Havilland reportedly rejected. This is good because Fontaine is wonderful. The screenwriter is Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the thirties, and then wrote a great script for the classic British horror movie “The Night of the Demon”. The opening scene where Ivy visits the sinister fortune-teller, played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (fame writer James Whale), is the acting force, and the film holds interest throughout the many sinister machinations. I hope to see this movie on DVD someday, but the despair of it ever happens because it seems an undeservedly obscure film. Fortunately, I saw him at AMC seven or eight years ago, but I have not seen him since. Catch it if you can!
