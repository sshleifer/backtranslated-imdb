This is not as strong as I expected, which makes the scenes of violence even more violent and effective. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of turns, stabs in the back and double crossings along the way. In the film it is difficult to understand on which side this or that character. <br /> <br /> The plot is very dynamic, with good dialogue and character development, and gives an interesting look at the work of the Triad gang, which it follows. /> <br /> Violence, when it happens, is cruel, without weapons or scenes of martial arts with special effects, it is plausible in your violence against a person, and with all the dialogue you are never allowed to forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The ending is amazing, but quite consistent and believable.
