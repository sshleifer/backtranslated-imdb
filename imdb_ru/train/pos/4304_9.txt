I remember watching this movie when I was about 7 years old; and at that time it shocked me. I have seen a film about violence before, but I have never seen a film with the consequences and reality of violence. This film not only shows this, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and failed to do did not have to be true. Crash tried to show how bad racism was (and Crash actually had anti-Asian prejudice) and come to him from a morally superior position. The Grand Canyon came to things from such a rough and realistic point of view, that in fact he was at a higher level than the wreck. Especially when you compare endings. The end of the crash is supposedly a neat little ending that binds everything together. While the Grand Canyon just ends in a quiet note, where you know that nothing will change in the character's life, but this is because life goes on, too, there is no suitable end. No matter how good ... you are bad. There is no end to one chapter to start another.
