WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns him on two separate DVD releases and on VHS. He claimed that this is one of the funniest and coolest low-budget militants ever created. Usually I don’t watch movies, knowing that they’ll be bad, but I made an exception for this ... and I was very glad I did. <br /> <br /> This is filled to the brim with action (most of it is amazing, graphically bloody), mucus (an isolated nude with a key female character, but in one scene there are so many that it becomes fun) and incredibly awkward by dialogue, all this adds laughter causing the tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Ginty, an unusually looking EXTERMINATOR star (and countless other low-cost action games) is funny in the lead, giving the best performance he could muster. Williamson is better than usual, clearly pushing at him with unmatched exultation (and he does not enter until the middle). It is also interesting to watch the other actors, especially the villains, one of whom is a sadistic sex sweat, speaking with an accent that looks like a mix of Spanish and Italian. She is priceless. <br /> <br /> Again, I can not stress how terrible it was. He is not so bloody that he feels sick, but he is unusually cruel in parts, when fleshy chicks fly in the shootings and there is exhausting torture in it that no one will soon forget. In addition, when Ginty teems with a flock of bad guys, he comfortably grabs a chainsaw, and the subsequent spray moments will have all the action fans cheering and spilling their beer. <br /> <br /> Don don’t miss the white light. This is awesome - if the stupid mind is a classic action.
