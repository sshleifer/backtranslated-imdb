I first saw this film during and at the International Cinema Study Course. I am a "non-traditional" student, and, perhaps, by long-term or accumulated wisdom, I appreciated the slow, reflexive rhythm of the film's narration. This story, filled with heat and dust from the arid climate, is deeply psychological, replete with multilayered symbolism and a distinctly expressed inversion of the theme of the “Other” in a country that no one understands. the understanding that comes is fraught with unresolved memories and the subjectivity of an outsider. Created almost 20 years ago, it is also a forerunner in the genre of many other international films that explore the themes of colonies in colonized spaces, ignorant of the nuances of the cultures in which they are included. The more generously removed - and largely funded - works that have been done since then reflect the same themes: “Indochina”, “Nowhere in Africa” - are two that, by comparison, may make Chocolate pale and boring. He has no action that causes a surge of adrenaline or violent violence. The fight is mental, emotional and subtle. But as they say, this is a good movie that is worth seeing.
