Financially limited Paramount pulled out all the restrictions for this adaptation of stage 34: a big budget, a big cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen, labeled as director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley didn’t work for defocused rock and the mysterious murder scenario that didn’t deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan who threw on the street for the first time. I have to believe that the reduction was from the hands of Leisen, since the number of the Grand Duke Ellington is wildly chopped, but this does not mean that you should not look at it: the number "Sweet Marijuana" with the participation of topless chorus girls is a mind blower , and she also has a delightful Toby Wing (whose, unfortunately, harbored terrible lines and playing the prototype of a dumb blonde) as a chorion for the hot-tempered Jack Oka. Carl Brisson’s acting skills are no different from Melba Toast, but he is a competent singer. McLaglen reaches a new plateau as a stereotypical blunt detective. And try to find Lucy in the choir. It ranks 7.0 as curiosity. February 2010 to rethink: I recently watched the film again, and now I feel that I was wrong to curse the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I can understand Leisen’s argument about more realistic performance in the context of the plot. I still have huge editing problems. Paramount, the largest studio in the city, faced enormous problems with the Production Code at the worst possible time in its history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the restrictions on this (also look at the “Search for Beauty” of 1934). Be sure to look at the pre-code buffs.
