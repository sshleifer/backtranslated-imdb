The audiard made a very interesting film here. He begins by describing an almost deaf young woman in her working universe as secretary; she is ignored, disappointed, rejected ... Hiring a trainee as an assistant seems to be a way for her to find someone in her life, but the guy just got out of prison. Both are rejected by society and gradually reunite them. The description of the characters is deep, goes into detail ... both begin to help each other; because she knows how to read lips, which in itself is very useful for him ... She will gradually develop, far from what she was at the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is beautifully shot; everything is very convincing, even if at the end it turns into a film noir. The gesture is especially beautifully seen on the set of Audiard. Emmanuel Devos should be nominated for the Best Actress Cesar award for her master's game. The action by the end of the film prevents him from being a simple "etude". This is actually surprisingly interesting: 8/10.
