I thought this film was very well made. Voice overs were great too. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this film to everyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has several comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes upset me. And others pleased me. This is a movie that any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo becomes a crazy "professor," or until he brings together a team for a fantastic sea voyage. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was good, but the film makes you think about the best shots. This is like a book. But go on and watch this movie!
