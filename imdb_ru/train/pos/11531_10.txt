I remember that I was a kid when I first saw this film, it was my first horror film (perhaps, therefore, I still remember some parts of it). I donâ€™t remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things, but I remember that the male blew his head with a grenade, the male dismembered over the tree, and the male hit a truck and shot in the head :) Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene, when Jennifer McAllister tore the killer's stomach to get the keys to the truck. This is a movie that gives you goosebumps and is worth watching. But where can I find it? How can I download it?
