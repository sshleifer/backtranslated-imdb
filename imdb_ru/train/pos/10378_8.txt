This film is an hour or so of good fun and has some really funny moments. I liked the character of Matt, as well as Tini. They seemed like the most attractive and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (like his bad cousin), and a police woman and a blonde biker suit offer nice eye candy. I have to say that I saw a striking resemblance between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Ban. My personal favorite part was the brothel scene, I liked it. In general, I liked the film, and it will get about 8 ratings. Punishment, however, I was disappointed. It was a curl of the side leg, and not the corresponding lace. <br /> <br /> I am joking, of course. :)
