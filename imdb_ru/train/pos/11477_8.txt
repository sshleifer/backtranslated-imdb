In my honest opinion, everyone should watch this movie at least once. It really put things in perspective when I watched it. Although this film was fictional, it talks about what can happen to your children. <br /> <br /> It shows how easily two children can hide both their hatred of the school and their plans to kill innocent students. This film would not work in any other format. They shot the camera perfectly. <br /> <br /> This reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students, and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed. Everyone wanted to watch the Rampart video, and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes. <br /> <br /> This film is a fictional version of the realization of our dream. We see the child behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is bad in this film is that it does not sell very well in the market, and few people even know that it exists. If he had one preview of a blockbuster film, everyone would have gone to see what was the matter, “Zero Day”. <br /> <br /> I think that this is the best film version of school filming. of the few who really tried to do it. The shooting itself takes only about ten minutes from the one and a half hour film, because it mainly focuses on Kehl and Andre, and on what they have been doing up to this point. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this movie yet, rent it and see. I guarantee that when it is finished, you will not have words.
