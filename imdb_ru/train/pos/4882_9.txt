This is a fun business watching movies. These days, when “internalized emotions” and “emotional detachment” are preferable to direct sentimentality, it must be difficult to remain true to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Soon after performing my jury duties at the 58th Berlinale, I managed to catch Kabei Yoji Yamada. <br /> <br /> After watching, I watched as people, dreamily leaving the house, with watery eyes, men, women and reviewers, left the theater hall. Even the director of “Berlinale”, a clearly inveterate movie audience, admitted that he was caught off guard and found that he was three-quarters of the way to this shamelessly sentimental experience. <br /> <br /> But what really surprised me was the feedback came after. Despite the fact that the film was stunningly touched the film, many reviewers decided to be calm and emotionally unbridled in their works. Obviously, after crying, they put on their “thinking hat”, and, therefore, missed what I felt was a genius in Kabei. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> In pre-war Japan, the story of Kabei revolves around the family of one writer and their fate in it after he was imprisoned for what was called "mental crimes" against imperial will. Through a series of protracted emotional scenes, Yamada introduces us to a man, his faithful wife and two daughters, as well as three side characters - a rather young sister, an awkward former student and an uncle uncle? ? everyone comes to help the family cope with their plight, in the absence of a person from home. <br /> <br /> History moves slowly, albeit at a steady pace, and grief happens at precisely those moments when everyone can predict. This, of course, makes it impossible for any person in the audience to be too emotionally upset about a dramatic event. <br /> <br /> In other words, although you learn to love your family and their assistants and sympathize with their unhappy. In this situation, you are so comforted by the certainty of the plot that you expect a certain end. <br /> <br /> However, after two hours of the film (do not worry, Yamada gives the viewer enough moments of gravity and levity to put you in motion), he gives you a slap in the face, which I can only describe as a “sting”. All you suggested was that it was a story about an innocent man, torn from his faithful wife and daughters? now suddenly points to one of the family helpers. Someone whom you have so far taken for granted is now in an unexpected twist of fate. <br /> <br /> At that moment, something curious happened in the theater in which I was located. Everyone began to sob with little or no restrictions. <Br /> <br /> "My word!" I muttered to myself. Then it struck me that “Kabei”, ultimately, was more than a film about a family torn by an empire on the verge of war. In fact, it was a tricky study of one human weakness: how little we cared about the secret feelings of people close to us. <br /> <br /> The most common criticism of the film was that it was technically sound, but there was no innovation. This is what happens when reviewers put on their notorious thinking cap, I think. I’m sure that, with Kabay, Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to use to touch on one unique aspect of humanity. An evil old trick that he so painlessly applied in the Torah-san series, and then in Tasogar-Seb. <br /> <br /> Having dragged the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone, he throws us into a realm of emotions. rarely studied in the movies. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the most effective cinematic tool of all. One that avoids detection, but deeply affects you. And the proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex, thrown into a trash can next to this thousand-seat cinema. <br /> <br /> Now, if only some reviewers resisted being so caught up in the mind that they forget what a movie really is. Human emotions. Clean and simple.
