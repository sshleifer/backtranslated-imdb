I have not read all the comments, but at least one of them mentioned that the 30-minute version can be shortened. I myself find this interesting, because the later parts of the film did not make much sense to me, even when I revised them. 30 minutes seems very short for a 1917 film. "Poor little rich girl", which was Turnner's next film, lasted 65 minutes, and "The Pride of the Clan", which was his previous film, lasted 84 minutes. Therefore, I am relieved to see that I have not lost my mind, it must be that part of this film is missing, and therefore the resolution does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s hard to see or comment on a film that you can only half see ... but I would recommend this film anyway because of the really breathtaking view that gives us the insides of the East Coast Film Studio of that time. This is the earliest film that I personally saw, based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star, played by Robert Warwick, who later became the supporting Hollywood character and starred in almost all Preston Sturges films. He plays a Western actor, perhaps vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, whom Warwick really resembles. After the really exciting episodes set in the studio, we see them on the set, where he discovers a village girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test, which passes very badly. After this point in the film, the main fragments seem to be missing in the form in which we are now. <br /> <br /> Again, I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of cinema for documentary value, but in the form in which we have it does not stand much like a movie and is not a particularly good example of the work of Maurice Turner.
