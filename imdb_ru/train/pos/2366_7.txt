This film (with the alternative title “Martial Law 3” for some reason) first introduced me to Jeff Wincott. And it was a great introduction. Although I had never heard of him before, he seemed like a great fighter. The scenes in this movie are great! By the way, too many of them. Fighting recruits at the headquarters of peacekeepers is especially good. There is something that one guy knocks the crap out of a group of people, it's really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Bridget Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. The roles as it suits her (but others do not). Matthias Hughes, as always, also did a good job. He is a great fighter and macho-like character, and was a good competitor to Wincott in this film.
