People are too diligent in the film. Sometimes we have to just sit back and enjoy the story, not trying to "view" it. <br /> <br /> All this happens together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his goal is still falling. Then the fun begins, when everyone around him “leaves” too. <br /> <br /> Think only, JFK and all the people somehow connected with his murder, whose lives were suddenly and doubtfully ended, and you appreciate it. what is meant in this film. <br /> <br /> I think this is a great interpretation of what could have happened. Although my EXACT storyline was not followed (retroactively after reading Jim Maars “Crossfire”), but this is what is meant is of interest. <br /> <br /> I would like to receive a copy of it for review it again. In the light of what is known today, the Domino Principle is true.
