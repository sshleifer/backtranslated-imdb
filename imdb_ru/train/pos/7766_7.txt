After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said goodbye to her cute sister / wife roles and demonstrated the ability to play spells with the best of them. She and Gloria Graham played the same hobo - and thanks to her efforts here, in a very manipulative role, Malone got the best supporting actress Oscar. <br /> <br /> The film in which she appeared was not entirely consistent with Oscar standards. , but this is quite a strong melodrama under the capable hands of Douglas Sirk. The explosive opening scene looks almost shameless, and it sets the tone for the rest of the lavish fireworks in history, featuring Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malon as headlining. Domestic quarrels among rich family residents with an oil past are the main theme of the drama, with an emphasis on strong supporting players, Stack and Malone. Both of them use this opportunity with both hands, and Stack should also be rewarded for his excellent work as a weak alcoholic, driven to despair by his wild motives. <br /> <br /> Nominal stars have less impressive work, but do it with their usual skills and beliefs - Hudson and Bacall. They play their more sympathetic roles with calm authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly striking (as is usually the case in the film Sirka), and yet this does not prevent me from thinking about the film. as the film "Technicolor" in the spirit of "REMAIN IT HEAVENLY." <br /> <br /> Worth watching some interesting performances of the entire cast.
