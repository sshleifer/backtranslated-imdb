Gung Ho is one of those films that I never get tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, and he is very funny in this film. He is approached step by step by Hedda Watanabe. They both work great together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like the way it shows how Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) fight for the role of the leaders of their groups. They both try to keep the peace with all their might, and then finally fight (which is hysterical to observe). First, they are both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps onto a chair. Kazihiro jumps on the table. Hunting jumps with him on the table. The fight then pours out of the office at the factory. I like the fact that after the workers are separated, you can say that they both feel bad because they let things get out of control. In addition, there is a scene where you can see the impact that Hunt had on Kazihiro. He is at his home, and his boss from Japan arrives and says that he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is locked and we cannot find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you canâ€™t imagine Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> <br /> I think I really like this film because it is really funny, and also shows how people who are radically different from each other can not only learn from each other, but also become good friends.
