I like the movie. Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorites and one of the cutest actors. Melissa Joan Hart - a good actress. I have seen most of her films, but all of Jeremy Jordan’s films. What I don’t like in Twisted Desire is when “Nika” is arrested, and “Jennifer” gives him away. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is guni. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
