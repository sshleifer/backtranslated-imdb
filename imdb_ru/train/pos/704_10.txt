This film, no matter how low budget, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you agree from the very beginning that this is a small budget, you can appreciate how good the story is, how well the script was written and how great the director was who created something wonderful for so little money. <Br /> <br /> All the elements of a great movie are here. The visual effects, although shot on digital media, were great in some places. The strange, dreamy sensation of the film is particularly well captured in the scene with the talking dog, this scene was simply amazing. This is such a trifling work, but not pretentious, so I really respect this film. This is highly recommended for those who are looking for something unique and exciting, and is different from most of the recurring films that are there.
