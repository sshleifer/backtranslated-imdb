Well, let me say something about these actors, they really were a good decision, and from experience, the actors really liven up the dialogue. If you enter it even fifteen minutes later, you will be shocked, the film has already begun. You do not want to miss the first few jokes, if you came to not miss a single joke. <br /> <br /> Wow! I have never seen a movie that ends with such a final ending. Not to be sharp, I mean that I liked it, but I was just surprised that it really continued until it stopped! But I'm running ahead, let's start from the beginning, when it started. The plot is as follows, there is this person, and do not give out any spoilers, (* Spoiler Alert !! *) (he never had sex (!), They use this plot device to make the plot move, and there is (intentionally or no, it can go anyway) some funny situations that the main characters had, some containing irony and jokes, and embarrassing situations, you know. <br /> <br /> The director uses technological advances that combine a film made on film set and in the dialogue script, some music and ducks to make a funny movie, designed like a comedy, where it leads us from the opening credits to the end with a completely full movie between them. I entered this movie, expecting to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew about it, and left a feeling as if I had just left the theater, which had just played a funny comedy. TEN STARS !!!
