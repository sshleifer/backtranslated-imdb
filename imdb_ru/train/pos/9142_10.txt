Purple Rain ... what else can I say, the name speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well chosen. The film had a great story. I like it! Since I watched this movie, I was stuck in the eighties, and I am only 13! My favorite part of the film was when his father died, and he collected all his musical compositions, and Apollonia sat on the staircase with his ears in her hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more of a romance. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the film, he really behaved like him. I'm so glad I saw this movie. The beautifully sung Purple Rain song was very soulful. I cried more than once.
