Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a senior gangster who submits himself to the police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unclear to me). Tony Lo Bianco is a low-level thug who frequently visits the billiard room and spends his free time jealous of Frankie. Being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to prison ... where they form bonds that may not be entirely friendship, but for now it will do. <br /> <br /> This film came to me under the title “Frank and Tony”, which is disappointing because I see the alternative name “Sneaky Frank and Crazy Tony”, which would help to sell the film more effectively. I guess this is a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Mad Larry," but what do I know? I watched it shortly after the next Italian criminal film “Violent Professionals”, and I must say that they complement each other very well. <br /> <br /> Italians have always lagged behind Americans in their budgets and production values, which is a real shame with this film. He is considered a Greenhouse film, which unfairly turns him into a b-film (or worse). I suspect that with a clearer sound and image this could be a Hollywood hit. The story seemed very interesting to me, the characters (and actors) are better than average, and unlike the “Violent Professionals” the plot is rather clear - not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like movies about mafia or crime, movies that you should try. The film about the Mafia, which is actually from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) - this is as much as you can ask. Of course, this is not the "Godfather", but it should not be. This is not a drama, this is a light comedy, a heavy fighter ... as "Sturdy weapon with revenge" from the point of view of the bad guys. Well, well, not really. <br /> <br /> This movie made me want to watch other director films and main roles. Movies besides "Escape from New York" (where Van Cleef plays "Hauk") and ordinary cult films. What could be more fun than discovering lost classics?
