I do not want to spend a lot of time wandering around the plot - you saw the trailer, and if not, then online. I do not recommend seeing it though - it was poorly processed and did not pack any laughter or magic from the film. So those who avoid this movie because of its lousy trailer should give it a chance. This is really funny. I was amazed by the wit and originality in this film. The first 40 minutes brought me into a state of hysteria - my only problem was that it unnecessarily turned into a bad Austin Powers film in the final 20. However, this is one of the few films where the end of the camp did not dislike me. the rest of the film (which usually takes place). Everybody gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack), and here are some really great moments. I personally plan to see him again when he comes out - only to catch all the details that I laughed at during the first viewing!
