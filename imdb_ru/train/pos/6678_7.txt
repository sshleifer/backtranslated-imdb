I really did not expect much from this film, but it was not bad; actually it was pretty good. This film contained a couple of the funniest lyrics I've ever seen from movies. Now I’m not saying that this is one of the funniest films of all time, but I was pretty laughed at some episodes. “Police have recognized my father’s death as suicide. They said that he fell on the elevator shaft. On a few bullets. Now this film is not for everyone, its mostly silly humor, like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated these films, I would recommend you stay away. In general, it was a pleasant film about a group of imitators, superheroes, who eventually became real heroes. This is a very overpriced comedy that many people probably haven’t seen yet, because, like me, I expected it to be complete garbage before watching it. After watching this film, I finally understand why this film was able to assemble such a superstar cast, which included Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and even this guy from Good Burger. This is because Mystery Man is full of excellent comedy works of period 7 out of 10. Very big surprise.
