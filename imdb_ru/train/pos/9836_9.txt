Although he is not as creepy as the cult predecessor (ZOMBI 2), I actually like this one more. This is due to a faster tempo, better settings and a cool 80s soundtrack. It is filled with action and has sweet bloody effects from Lucio Fulci. Zombies do not look as angry as ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. It was done pretty well, but it definitely has its share of fun; for example, some zombies are moving very slowly, and others as fast as a ninja. some of them are mentally retarded, while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How glad is that? Definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie lovers. this will probably satisfy most action movie fans. Also check out the Zombi 4.
