My children recently started watching replays of this show - both the early N episodes and the later ones on the ABC Family - and they like it. (I did not know that the series lasted even after the first or second season). I am curious about what caused all the changes in the cast - I saw them described as “highly advertised”, and yet half an hour looking for efforts on the Internet revealed nothing but endless comments that the earlier episodes were much better than the later ones. . (Personally, I don’t see much of a difference - the scenarios and themes remain pretty much the same everywhere - but they lose some great people along the way). My daughter included the DVD in her wish list, so perhaps the land of special features and comments will shed some light on all of this. I would also like them to make some humorous humor about the changes — like in “Boy Meets World,” where they throw their little sister for the entire season or so, and when another actor appears later playing her, they ask her where she is was, and she says "upstairs", or when the Minkus token-geek appears at the beginning of high school, they ask him where he was, and he says "there", pointing to that part of the classroom that they never showed before camera "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and running off the screen (Mr. Turner is another character who left). Well, okay, maybe this will be the real Hollywood story? I was just glad to see that Aunt Hilda appeared in the finals - she was always one of my favorites - it’s too bad that this could not have been a more exciting reunion of actors. (The Zelda candle just didn't cut it off for me)
