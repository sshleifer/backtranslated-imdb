Damon Runyon's Time Square World in New York, before his disneyfication, is the basis for this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew about the movie, sent this nostalgic tribute to the "crossroads of the world", which show us the other side of New York past. The music of Frank Lesser sounds great. We are seeing a magnificent set of characters typical of the area. People on the edges of society sought this area because of the world, actions, opportunities in this part of the city. This city belly was making a living from street life that was so intense. <br /> <br /> Some songs from the original production were not included in the film. We don’t know if that makes sense, but for a Hollywood musical, it’s not unusual to change what worked on stage. This original cast included the great Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kay, and we are surprised at the decision not to let Robert Alde, Sam Leven, Isabel Bigley repeat his original roles. These were outstanding actors who could make a terrific contribution. <br /> <br /> The film is visually stunning. The look follows closely the fashion of the times. As for the cast of Marlon Brando, otherwise not known for his singing abilities, Frank Sinatra and Gene Simmons seem to work in the film. After all, Sky Masterson is a man who otherwise would have looked stupid if he represented a different "look." Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit. Gene Simmons, like Sarah Brown, does an excellent job with the image of a woman from the Salvation Army, who suddenly finds satisfaction with the same man he is trying to save. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is a delight. She never ceases to amaze, like Miss Adelaide, a woman with a golden heart, Nathan Detroit’s loving love. Mrs. Blaine makes a fantastic impression, like a show-girl who is wiser than she allows herself. Stubby Kaye handles the role of her Nicely Nice Johnson. <br /> <br /> The magnificent production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows, who adapted to the screen. The costumes of Irina Sharaf set the right tone.
