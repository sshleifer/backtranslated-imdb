This film was shot by one of the most absurd comedians in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. For a moment I was shocked that he starred in a romantic comedy, but, knowing that he was a heavy film fan, he was seen at every local festival and local cinema hall, I had a positive opinion about this film. <br /> <br /> Damn, I was right. The script (written by Pelletier himself) is a bit distorted and difficult for him to follow, but in fashion Pelletier is a unique 90-minute jack in a box. <br /> <br /> Inspired and mostly transformed hint of “Dangerous Liaisons” (by Laclos) “Les Aimants” consists of a distorted game of writing notes on the fridge. Throughout the film, you will have the opportunity to find out who, who, and who writes to whom on this damned fridge ... which pops up in an interesting love affair. <br /> <br /> Great storyline, great photo, great quotes from other movies. Should we ask for more for the first movie?
