College student Joan Murray undertakes the unenviable work of preparing the building for students to become apartments, which includes the sale of unnecessary furniture. This happens during the break, so the mysterious psyche pursues almost empty rooms on campus. “Blood” is a low-budget slasher, which is quite interesting. Acting is pretty bad, the plot is predictable, but the horrible effects are pretty good. The film was filmed by UCLA film students Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrou almost for nothing. Soon a dreamy atmosphere begins, very similar to the surrounding forests of the fantastic “Shortly before Dawn” by Jeff Leiberman. 7 out of 10. It's nice to see Daphni Zuniga, known as the “Initiation”, passing by car several times.
