This is the second film based on the lives and times of ultra hung porn stars, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. The boogie nights are also roughly based on his life. Maybe someday someone is going to make a film about the life of Tommy Byron. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not very well told. There are many episodes of “Law and Order” in which there are more turns than in “Wonderland”, and the director never initiates a criminal case with any pleasure. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not as hung as Holmes (and this time there are no artificial limbs, unlike “boogie nights”), and he looks much better than Holmes hops. <br /> <br /> The director does not represent a single handsome person among the actors. Racist, immature meanness with which he hangs out, or his wife, and the police does little to characterize. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is Eric Bogosyan, telling Paris Hilton to “get lost”. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, anyone interested in the sleaziest side of porn business in the 1980s or a true crime should not miss it.
