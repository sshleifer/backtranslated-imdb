I like movies like this, in spirit, without a pun. This is a decent, clean film about a baseball team that is lagging behind, and the young fan wants them to win, since his murdered dad said that this is the only way he came back for him. <br /> <br /> Spirit shines through in two ways: an amusing cast with Danny Glover and young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and heavenly messenger Al, who takes on the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. This is an energetic movie. It makes you smile and really draws you into the sport. <br /> <br /> This is my grip. The only thing that bothers me is sports films that turn you into an unexpected fan of the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just find it strange that I leave the film, thinking that the Angels are a strong, cool team, when really my basic loyalty, as it is, belongs to Toronto Blue Jays. This is really interesting. If this is just a film about a team of failing children, then everything is fine.
