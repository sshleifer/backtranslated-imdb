I was expecting something else: more passion, drama ... Again, another failed attempt at originality. I'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old cliche "cheesiness". Although 15-year-olds can appreciate it. not very convincing, and common lines, without any wit. However, the soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can not say that this film is a complete failure, because people are watching it, but it does not meet the expectations of the public and reached mediocrity. So in conclusion, staging keeps you in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is a noticeable thing. So, I think it's worth seeing if you are not annoyed.
