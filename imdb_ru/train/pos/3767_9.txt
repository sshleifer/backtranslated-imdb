Go back to the tenth page of this section of the review and go back. Succeed; I'll wait. <br /> <br /> Done? Well, then you probably noticed the same trend as me. You could quibble all day about unconvincing jokes, dated dates, and obviously derivative plot lines and tricks in Fake, but this film seems to be one of those that "hate me now, love me later." <br /> <The main problem of Bill and Ted was that the original was liked by those children of the 80s who followed the trends and considered themselves at the forefront of fashion. It worked perfectly for the original, but obviously exploded in 1991, when there was nothing a self-respecting bum. will be caught dead, dressed in anything other than flannel or admitting that he likes something in the 80s. As Ted would say: “Dude, this is an absolutely deep hole. Want to play 20 questions? "They say that nostalgia goes through 20-year cycles, and this is certainly the case here. Here, in 2010, those who grew up with Cindy Lauper and Megadet begin. look back, to evaluate some of the key films that (like it or not) made us who we are. If you are one of those who look at Fake, as if it were outdated (“Fa gs!” ) robbery, then you are missing the point and probably spent six years growing your facial hair, wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed . <br /> <br /> Independently referring to its origin (Star Trek episode) and time traveling with a phone booth), B & T does not try to hide its creators' love of reverence. Quentin Tarantino, anyone? I don’t I say that “Fake” is “True Love”, but I think that it should be appreciated for what it is: a funny snapshot of our society at a time when there was no child psychology, Ritalin, anti-smoking advertising , terrorist paranoia and media distribution. <br /> <br /> So for all of you haters of B & T ... turn off your Screaming Trees CD, get your hair off your face, go to the beach and lighten up. Narcissistic depression and intellectual longing SO SO corporate.
