Well, I admit that the cast in the film is REALLY strange - partly due to the plot, but I still had some problems with the belief that Pierce Brosnan played this role (although he did quite well) <br /> < br /> It is based on the true story of an Englishman who went to live with Canadian Indians at the beginning of the 20th century. He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian. In fact, he was so successful and well thought out that people came from all over to hear his lectures and take part in his walks through the desert - even if he was not a mixed blood Indian, and all his knowledge was from books or fakes! The film tells about it and what happened when the hoax was revealed. <br /> <br /> The game and the setting were great, and I really liked the movie (when I suspended disbelief in Brosnan). It was not widespread - probably because it was quite mental - not a Bond movie or romance - just a really strange movie about a wonderful person.
