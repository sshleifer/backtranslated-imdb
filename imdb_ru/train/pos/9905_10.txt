I lost count of how many reviews I wrote on Slaughter High. I read a lot of bad, and now I will say that this is a fantastic film. Simon Scaddamore became famous for his famous suicide in a short time, and although it was his only film, it was he who made the film so wonderful. At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide. Then I found out because of the current web page www.IMDb.com, he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pretentious character known to man, but his real life undoubtedly had its strengths and weaknesses. He did a good acting job, who can disagree? I always wondered how he felt, showing himself naked in the movies. It must be rather embarrassing, to say the least. I first saw this movie when I was 12 in sixth grade. I agree with some instructions that the girl will not take a bath after someone was killed, and that there are no baths in high schools! I think that Carolyn Munro, who was 36 years old at the time, was the only other star who had a decent acting talent, and, unfortunately, after Simon’s death, he didn’t make future films. The reasons for his suicide are a mystery, and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. Doing math on his webpage, he says that he was 29 years old when he did Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this movie with two thumbs, the best horror movie. Probably, because of their terrible game, others have not gained fame in the movie business. Jacob Young
