Diamonds are made from time to time in an amazing world of horror, and everyone becomes completely overwhelmed by its sheer brilliance. This is no less than a diamond! This film is full of eerie, chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere, and I think it is safe to say one of my favorite horror films of all time! And, of course, it contains, perhaps, the most terrible and terrible sequence in horror history! Every time I see a movie, and it comes to the point that you know what will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I get scared, but this will never happen; I never get it right, and I feel as terrible as the first time I saw it !! Now, I must say, to scare such a tormented fan of horror is nothing but pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, they are proud of the art of acting, they do not need any special effect to convey the atmosphere, they rely on the power of powerful history and the eeriness (in this case) of suggestion and expectation. Every element is impeccable, from the scenery, acting, plot to the threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran certainly can make the devil whimper, that's for sure !! In conclusion: if for some insane reason you don’t like this piece of madness, then you honestly don’t know what horror is and, frankly, you don’t deserve to know it either. Thank!
