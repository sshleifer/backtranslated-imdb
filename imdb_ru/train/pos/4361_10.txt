It was probably one of the most well-made films of the 40s - Warner Bros. in full swing of their style. Photography Sol Polito, perhaps, is his best achievement - great compositions and lighting with subtle shadows. Max Steiner contributes one of his most difficult and beautiful points - the embodiment of his classical method of leitmotif. The music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same film crew that made this film went on to shoot Now, Voyager at the end of the same year — a wonderful film that won honors and awards and became a historical favorite because Bett Davis starred there. In my opinion, “Gay Sisters” is a much better film - better shot in all departments, more interesting, complex and enjoyable. The most unusual film that entertains those who accept it as it is, and does not project its own modern creative abilities or its advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection. Each thing must be assessed according to its own time and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints that I read in these reviews are so childish and completely untrue. If you crave the perfect filet of a minion, do not go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the lush dough. The art of film criticism is really lost for a large part of the population. Sorry, guys - maybe if this movie had a Rolling Stones account and a hundred intricate and intriguing storylines, you would all be happy. I will take an old film without modern intellectual claims on the day of the week!
