I remember watching this movie a while ago, and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland, everything flooded again. Why hasn't this yet had a video or DVD release? It is blasphemous that this greatness of filmmaking has never been released, while other trash was. In fact, this is the John Carpenter film, which has not yet been released. In fact, I have not seen him on television since the day I looked. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely the role he was born to play. John Carpenter’s break from horror brought this gem that I would love to watch TV. It worked well and performed well as far as singing goes. With pleasure I beat off most of Elvis's hits. I think it was also a film that formed a partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which led them to make a number of great films (Escape from New York, Things, Big Trouble in Little China, and Escape from Los Angeles Angeles ”) release it before someone makes a remake or his own version of his life, which, I feel, will not only stain the king, but also destroy the magic that this one has. If it is not released, we will be in the Heartbreak Hotel.
