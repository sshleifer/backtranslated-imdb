This film has a steady, haunting pace, supported by a great game (one of Chamberlain’s best performances) and a story that unfolds over time. <br /> <br /> In addition, the music completely sets the mood and helps maintain an awkward, cautious and gloomy tone. <br /> <br /> Weir’s story is enhanced by the use of Aboriginal people, their stories and their tensions among the dominant white population to create a sinister tale. <br /> <br /> Although they are not related either to the plot or to the genre, it supported in me the same feeling as Ursula Le Guin's “Grassy Sky” (1980). <br /> <br /> “Last Wave” is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember that “breaking and cutting” does not make a movie a horror, it is a psychological element of fear and trepidation that lies in all of us.
