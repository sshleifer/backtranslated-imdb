There are other reviews here, so I donâ€™t need to say how good he is or what he is about ... My point of view: I heard about this film many years ago before it was shown. I can't even remember HOW, I just know it was over the Internet. Distributors went bankrupt before it ever struck! Within a few months I moped and complained. Please note that on this page there is a link to purchase this movie, and the only area highlighted is VHS on Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Babelfish from Alta Vista for translation. I know that this is PAL format, and they REALLY changed the text on the screen to German, and at first there is a small part of the narration, which was also voiced in German, but, despite the fact that this film is funny and polite, it only makes funnier! If you want to watch this movie, and you have a place where the transformations are carried out, it's worth it! It cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the USA from Germany. Believe me, it may seem that you will spend a lot of money on the film, but if you like banal films, you will get money left and right, getting conversions for your friends!
