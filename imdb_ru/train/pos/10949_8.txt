First of all, I would like to say that I am a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and what other people say and then a rag on a pilot is beyond my power. Everything in the pilot was in typical Sarah Silverman form, maybe not entirely funny, but the situation and the delivery are important. <br /> <br /> If you liked that Jesus is Magic, then I don’t understand how you didn’t like it. He has the same flow and the same rhythm. True, this is only for real fans, but if you like it, then <br /> <br /> Again, only for real fans. If you are not used to her style, you won’t understand why this is funny. However, this is true, and I hope you think so too.
