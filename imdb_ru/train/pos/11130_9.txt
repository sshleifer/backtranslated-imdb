John Voight is great in the movie Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman’s performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Reinman, is the show that makes me watch movies. As an image of the New York character, only the image of Daniel Dey Lewis, depicting Bill Butcher in The New York Gangs, comes to mind as comparable, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives to Ratso. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is characterized by the fact that the actor that we most identify with the Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think that Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of the film, who plays along with the people around him in such a way that he raises their performance far above their normal level. <br /> <br /> Buck Voight is so naive that he will generally fly out of the film, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a film about escape that turns into a film about how to find yourself. I think that no matter how tough the film is, it has a very beautiful message that no matter how much you are a loser (Ratso clearly defines a “loser”), if you can find a way to be truthful with yourself, you own the secret of life and you can even share this understanding with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy and Klute a few years later, and I think it’s more like a movie about finding yourself, which turns into a movie about escaping.
