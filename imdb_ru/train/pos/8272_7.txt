The family (mother Patricia Clarkson, father Jake Weber, son Erik Per Sullivan) get together to sit in some remote house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer when they went there. It angers some of the locals - especially Otis (John Spredakos), and everything is going slowly (VERY slowly) wrong. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started watching it. Most of the reviews on this site are extremely negative. Well ... I do not agree. First, it is NOT a horror movie. The horror doesn't even begin until the last 30 minutes. This is more like a family drama with added horror elements. At this level, it's damn good. <br /> <br /> First, the bad thing: the pace is too slow; Jake Weber is a terrible actor; Too many false dreams scare; Wendigo barely appears in the film, and a clear picture of Wendigo at the end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: a pretty good drama script; Clarkson is superb as a mother; some great direction with creepy sound effects that are a bit scary; a rather obvious hot sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the plot!); Sullivan's pretty good game (only 10 at the time!) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending. <br /> <br /> I think that this film annoys many people because it is being pushed as a horror film - itâ€™s not so. So, if you can ignore it, I think you might like it. I give him 7.
