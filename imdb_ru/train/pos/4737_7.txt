Hack hap (Black Mask) - this is what I would like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Of course, the plot was tried and heard earlier (a biologically engineered soldier who is part of the elite fighting power of supermen, decides that he feels that killing and brute force are not ways to settle everything and become a pacifist, and the Librarian. But when he finds out that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will support their life, inflicting police - his best friend - the policeman - he becomes a black mask.) The style the film is going to, very clearly, works and at least for men exciting. I love martial arts movies that are spectacular. People flying around lighter than air and recovering in fractions of a second after a strike maintain pace and action without stopping. But this is what this film is right about anyway: a demonstration of how Jet Li does what he does best, and this is the amazing entertainment of his skills, which, to put it mildly, are top notch. Like most martial arts movies. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who only now show themselves here in the states, have little plot and many amazing physical feats in these films. But I have to say, even with large holes left on the site (for example, as we see him safe in his apartment, when there were 20 people just one scene before him who were not more than 15 feet away from him with an escape sign Who knows? The scene just interrupts him in the apartment ... ooo, well, I think, the suspension of faith), the film remains interesting to me. Only until the last 20 minutes it seems that the film may be a bit shorter. But still around a great action.
