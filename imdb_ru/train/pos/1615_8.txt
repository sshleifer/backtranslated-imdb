A wonderful romantic comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher), who plans to marry the man she is comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until she falls in love with his stubborn, evil brother (Nicolas Cage). The script is sharp, with many wonderful lines, the acting is great, the accents (as I was told) are perfect writing, and the cinematography is beautiful. New York has never looked so good on the screen. Be sure to look first of all for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they are both fantastic and well-deserved Oscars, which they received. Beautiful, funny movie. Must see!
