I first saw this version of “The Christmas Carol” when I first appeared on television. I really expected to see the film when it was advertised, and it more than met my expectations. Now I bought a DVD and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of “This is a wonderful life,” I consider this version of The Christmas Carol to be one of the best Christmas films ever made. George S. Scott is superb, and he is surrounded by a great cast, led by Roger Rees! Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. How can someone be remembered as Patton and Scrooge? Scott makes it easy. The direction is amazing with subtle decorations, costumes and music, which give the film a special sense of time, place and era depicted on the screen. You will simply love this movie and place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
