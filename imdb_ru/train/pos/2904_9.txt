This film is the second immersion of Damian Sifron in the cinema after his excellent study of the character in "El Fondo del Mar". With Tiempo De Valientes, he creates extremely well-made characters, away from prototypes and with unprecedented chemistry between them. I saw the talent of Sifron to present each character carelessly, but enough to emotionally attract us to them. His control over them is great, so he restores the film to an excellent direction and a beautifully honed script, the characters laugh and cry with real feelings and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on the screen. <Br /> <br /> The Spaniards are taking over the British, the night cityscape of Buenos Aires replaces the Hollywood scenery, and the premise is as interesting as any other, so we have a film that dared to fight for Hollywood technique. <br /> br /> But I want you to watch the movie mainly because I have never dealt with such cute characters, all of them. It seems the script is perfect for the actors and vice versa. I really believe that with such films Argentina is really ready for the competition.
