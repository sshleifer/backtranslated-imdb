I'm shocked. Shocked and alarmed by the fact that 428 IMDB users who voted before me did not give this film a rating above 7.7 ?! ?? - this is C! If I could give FOBH 20, I would gladly do it. This film is highly regarded on the top of the pantheon of modern comedy, along with Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most fun movies of all time. If you know anything about rap music - YOU MUST SEE THIS !! If you don't know anything about rap music - find out something! And then take a look! Comparison with Spinal Tap is unable to appreciate the inspirational genius of this unique film. If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll like it. Watch and vote for 10!
