A great family movie ... gives you a lot to think about ... There’s absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is great - it is so ... real ... such things can happen in everyone’s life. And don't forget about acting, it's just awesome! Just look at Frankie, and you will understand what I was thinking ... This picture is a real one that cannot be missed !!!
