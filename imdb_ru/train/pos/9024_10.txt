Five years have passed since the Tenko survivors returned home, and from the double-edged Marion, "Ok, like this." <br /> <br /> Now is 1950: the time of reunification. Here is the whole gang: Marion, Bee, Ulric, Kate, Dorothy, Christine, Dominic and late Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is beautiful: just as well written and effective, and just as thought-provoking and touching as the original series. <br /> <br /> All questions left at the end of the series have all the answers. From the Marion family to the Joss Medical Center, everything changed in five years, and not everything changed for the better. <br /> <br /> A trip to the plantation of Dominica brought a lot of shocks and truly unsurpassed results. seat tension There is a real sense of tragedy and catastrophe, since fate again takes over and women fight for their lives. Dominic finally reveals his true colors, and there are several dramatic moments of “screaming on the body.” <br /> <br /> Juicy shooting in Singapore and the opportunity to meet with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. This is such a shame that it really is the end. I could watch it all over and over. Perfection.
