This film is why I found this site. I could not find this movie anywhere! I'm so glad we found it here! We saw it on TV before and desperately wanted to find it and buy it, and several friends became interested in buying it. Another author commented that it is boring, although I must say that it is NOT. Especially if you are a horse man, you will love this movie. The horses are awesome, well trained, and the film is well made. This is definitely the one we will buy for our home DVD library. We will recommend it to our friends. The relationship between man and horse in this film was so inspiring that you wanted to spend more time with your horses. This is definitely a film that we will watch several times.
