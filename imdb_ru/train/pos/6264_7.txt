The team Merian Cooper and Ernest Shodzak made a documentary about 50,000 Bakhtiar people and their animals about the summer migration to winter pastures. The main value of this film today is a temporary capsule of “forgotten people” and how they lived during the times of what we in the West called the “stormy twenties”. A sharper contrast is impossible to imagine. Raging river and barefoot mountain transitions are cruelly realistic, and animals that disappear underwater actually die. To make sure that viewers of the time believed that the story happened, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered at the end. The version that I saw had delightful Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without a film. Having said all this, the film is probably more valuable to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of good evening entertainment. The crew had barely enough headroom to take the pictures they recorded, and there is no unusual camera work resulting from repeated repetitions. Western titles distract from experience, but are actually part of the report, as they demonstrate how Hollywood tried to contribute to the lives of indigenous peoples so that they would be appreciated by the viewers of the day. Exit entertainment of the desert police turn into a “police ball”. The producers produced the documentary drama "Chang" (1927) and the fully commercial King Kong (1933). The migration theme is again used in People of Wind (1976) and in the Himalayas (1999). It is recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting involved in, and then it is highly recommended for them.
