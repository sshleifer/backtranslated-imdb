Love it or hate it, it's hard not to find the capture of Warren Beatty "Dick Tracy", a 1990 film version of the famous comic by Chester Gould, anything other than the classic genre. Films about superheroes come out of wood in recent years, and may soon become a genre alone. <br /> <br /> Beatty’s movie takes full advantage of Gould’s original material, filming stripes in all six films. the primary colors, and thus this unique and at the same time familiar world of gangsters, mutants and loose, seductive women gives a lush visual style and tone. <br /> <br /> It can be argued that the film’s strong visual aesthetics are sharply short to change the characters and their acting ability, which I don’t think could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> “Dick Tracy” enjoys his appearance and terrible characters, as well as Beatty herself, who plays the pursued and incorruptible detective with a title, he is quite stable and ready to ruin the bad guys at any cost. <br /> <br /> In addition to visual delicacies and Oscar-winning make-up, there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, delightfully excellent in the Oscar nomination), seeks to eliminate Tr Acy in one well-planned step, but also seeks to get control over all criminal activities in the city, uniting all warring gangs under it. <br /> <br /> Tracey, meanwhile, is fraudulently framing her relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenn Headley), who, as her name is, remains faithful to him on the side and takes care of Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who ultimately finds father figure, which can pay attention to our criminal hero. Tracy Tess's loyalty is verified by the tempting achievements of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), which is also the main problem of the Big Boy. At the same time, when all this is declining, everything becomes hotter when a new criminal figure arrives in the city, who decides to play both sides against the middle. <br /> <br /> The game is as good as the Beatty trick. At the same time, the intense and romantic relationship between each of the leashes becomes the center of the material, and not just a focus on meaningless actions and special effects. Pacino freely chews the scenery in a role that really stands out among the rest. <br /> <br /> “Dick Tracy” is one of the best and most ignored comics genres. I think that if Chester Gould was still alive, he would have been proud that Warren Beatty had shot his favorite crime crime detective. <br /> <br /> 8/10
