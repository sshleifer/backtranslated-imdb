This is a beautiful, rich and very well executed film with a rich and informative history. In fact, this suggests that the old master of the narrator must find a male heir to continue his craft, but in the end he does not get what he expected in his world dominated by men. Then the heroes must deal with their situation, and the old master must deal with the conflict between his desire for a companion and the heir and his traditional ideas and society. <br /> <br /> The story is funny, emotional and complex. The study of characters, their lives and emotions is rich and irresistible. Character development is strong, while characters are complex, not one-dimensional. The film masterfully conveys the emotions of the old man and his desire to find an heir, and convincingly shows how he and the child deal with the situation. At the corresponding points there is also humor, sometimes quite subtle. The film also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of traditional Chinese culture, which creates additional interest and depth to the film. <br /> <br /> Directing, acting and scenery are all outstanding. In addition to other strengths, it creates rich and compelling visual images and compelling, real characters. As a result, the film evokes strong sympathy and feelings for the heroes. <br /> <br /> Some claim that the final weakens the film, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the overall film would be rather minor.
