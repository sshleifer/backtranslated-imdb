“Foxes” is one film that I remember, because it portrays teenagers in the late 1970s. Since I'm the same age as Jodie Foster, I was related to this film. This applies to disappointments, temptations, relationships, and youth rebellion. The soundtrack is great with inspirational rock, for example. “More than a feeling” of Boston and sad numbers like “On the radio” by Donna Summer. The music of my late teens. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it was not huge.
