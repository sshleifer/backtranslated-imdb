One of my favorite movies ever. Just beautiful, full of human emotions, wit, humor, intelligence. The story evolves, like a life lesson, just a wonderful film in many ways. <br /> <br /> The cast is also fantastic ... an excellent selection of the best British talents. I loved them all for every element in the film. <br /> <br /> Italy has to become one of the most romantic places to create a story like this - everything works in this film. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
