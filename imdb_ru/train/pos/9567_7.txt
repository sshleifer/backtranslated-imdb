I watched the DVD of this film, which also comes with a great commentary (in English). It seems that in Cambodia (English subtitles say that the character speaks Thai, but the film says Cambodia) is a very cruel, evil person who brings up boys to be killers, using hunger and teaching them to fight and kill. He sends Pangu to kill some people in China, and during the killings they kill the policeman’s partner. Policeman Wai is a free gun that worries about his father, who is also a policeman who was shot and who is in a coma. Wai leader is a friend of his father, and he is worried about Vai’s erratic behavior. He does not know that Vai was the one who caught his father in connection with drug dealers, shot him and fell into a coma. Pang runs away and hides in a squalid hut at a dump where he meets a woman who came here to find his mother and continues to repeat that her father will not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand it, but rescues her from her Father, who seems to have sex with her, perhaps this is the reason Kate III). Wai is becoming more and more obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost impossible to stop. Even after Pang stole the boat and took the woman to his home, where they got married, and she became pregnant, Wai follows and joins the evil man (who trains the boys) to make a deal to fight and train so that he can get Pan. Between Vai and Pang there is a big fight with a terribly offended woman, the main victim and leaving Wai dead, and Pang cuts his baby from a dead mother only to die and leave him as a possible next boy to be raised as a murderer. This film is beautifully photographed with a great soundtrack. There are many very violent scenes of violence. A woman with a long nail pulled from her legs. Knives on the neck and torso. The guns fired right at the head. And a few very bad beatings. It may be darkly intense and cheerful, but it is definitely worth seeing.
