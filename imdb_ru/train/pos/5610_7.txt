Roman Polanski expertly manages similar variations on the same theme as Repulse. I can’t imagine that there is one honest movie goer who isn’t able to recognize a great director in Latitude, but both parts of a diplomat may not be entirely satisfactory for most people, including myself. <br /> <br /> Polanski very well makes us feel the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in “Disgust” and himself in “Locator”), starting with some self-doubt, soon gradually turning into psychological anxiety, eventually growing into irreversible physical discomfort. A common test for characters and spectators is really different from the horror and tension of horror films, since there is no tangible supernatural element here. While horror films allow some kind of catharsis (be it cheap or more complex), Polanski sadistically torments us, and if in his latest opus dark humor is constant, we mostly act on nerves, and not on the edge of our places. <br /> <br /> Suspension, horror, it's all a question of the game with the expectations of the audience (or, conversely, deception and execution), and not literally the nerves of people. In my book “Rosemary's Baby” is a much greater accomplishment, because sheer paranoia and simple rationality are in constant struggle: the story of a couple moving in a strange apartment, while we are forced to identify with a single character. Moreover, if all the fantasy elements are in the hero's head, the situation is most uncomfortable, as we, the audience, are forced to judge him, reject him, while we are expertly tempted (“draw and seduce”) to become them.
