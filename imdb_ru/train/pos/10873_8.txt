This film really deserves more recognition than its receipt. This is really an amazing and rich image of blood ties, services and devotion in the world of crime. The film is shot beautifully and reveals all your classic crime themes, such as betrayal and power. This film is a film for movie lovers, it requires attention, understanding and full reward at the end. He is the godfather of Hong Kong and is a welcome change, not another wire fight, a martial arts epic that seems to be a major contribution to the world of cinema from Hong Kong and China. It includes the location of great characters, actors and developers, although it is fair to say that I had to watch it twice to understand what is happening with some characters because of their large number of interactions in the film. ALL in all 8/10 .
