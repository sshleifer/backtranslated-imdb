Having read only two comments here, as a lifelong Bronte fan, starting with Heathcliff Olivier and ending with many versions of Charlotte's Rochester, it is more than frankly clear that it was UNSung Bronte's sister who gave the lies to the male chauvinist period in which the trio lived. Of course, the “miracle” in all three versions of the 19th century British home life is that all the “girls” were “virgins” and their only realistic tassels with “men” were their vicar father and their beast? brother. Nevertheless, in the end, it was Ann Bronte who, in her only analysis, proved the “feminist” point of view, significantly outstripping the modern types, including the ranks of the “electoral franchise”. Nevertheless, the story shows more than a few preceding ones, including Greek heteries and sappho, as well as those like the ancient emperor Jan Quay-fei. What about "Eve" and her apple?
