The last time I watched the movie was about seven years old, so my opinion may be distorted over time. At that time, I enjoyed filming that switched between cartoons and live action. At that time I was sad because of the blue camel and his sad life. I also felt joy when, after Captain Contagius kidnapped a heroine (a princess or a toy shepherd), the tables were turned towards him. Unfortunately, the producers did not decide to transfer this film to VHS, so I have only the memories of twenty years ago. I’m sure that if I watched the movie again, I’d find it banal and juicy, but at that time I really liked it.
