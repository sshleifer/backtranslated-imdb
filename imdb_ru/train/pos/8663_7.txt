“Rich in Love” is a film about life that tells the viewer about the strange family of Charleston, South Carolina. Heavily romanticized, beautifully shot, well-written and acting, “RIL” envelops you like a summer breeze, because its meaningless meanders breathe life into the characters so that at the end of the movie you feel like an old family friend. <Br /> <br /> A wonderfully created movie with character motifs from the director Driving Miss Daisy, RIL is a little unclear little “sleeping” that will appeal most to a mature audience.
