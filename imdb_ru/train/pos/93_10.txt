My first child was born in the year when this program came out, and after that I played Christmas for boys every year. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives when they start a family ... it always becomes their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (possibly made on DVD-R from videotapes) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was a great copy, and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are several songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both the CD and the DVD will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.
