I was honored to see parts of the original Aardman show in the UK. It was always fun and always fun. None of the charisma was lost in translation - it is as fresh as that of the people surveyed - regardless of whether any of this is written or not, as rumored to have no meaning. It is always interesting. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations demonstrate a lot of imagination in the characters used for each voice, one aspect that I probably like most about the show and its concepts (hostility between pandas, porcupines, discussing the fear of pine needles, painting the monkey ). Regulars such as teenagers horses and donkeys from Maryland, most of each couple (parrots, insects and cats, and many others) and a character with a childish voice really grow up on you, and I really came to dig a ferret! Monday has finally become a day to which you can look forward.
