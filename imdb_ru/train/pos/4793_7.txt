After watching this movie, I feel I know a little more about the United States. David Lynch is synonymous with shock value and strangeness for the sake of strangeness, and indeed, these elements are not missed in the Straight Story. However, this is in a light that I had never seen before in Lynch. We start with a simple family living a quiet life, but we end up with a lot of absurdly interesting characters with a depth in their lives that cannot be evident from their presentation. Especially touching was the scene of the bar with two veterans of the Great Patriotic War, who discussed the events of fifty years ago and how they still affect their current life and emotions. If you are looking for a wild at heart or Dune, do not look here. But if you are looking for real people with real stories, this film is for you.
