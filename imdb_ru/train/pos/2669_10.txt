This story, filmed in Wellington, a suburb of New Zealand (Tawa - home of the famous Tawa College), is the first feature of McCarten. <br /> <br /> The Via Satellite modern flavor is replete with absolutely funny situations that develop into an adult family context. At the same time, he manages to evoke strong emotions of sadness and despair. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting and humorous films of the year - not to be missed!
