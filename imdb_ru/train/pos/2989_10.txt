First of all, I would like to say that I am a big fan of Bette Middler. Stella is a very good film with a great cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). This is one of my favorite films of all time. This concerns a mother who is raising a child by herself, she is experiencing many things that her daughter Jenny, who is beautifully played by Trini Alvarado, cannot bring up. This film is very good, and I suggest you take a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And it deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I give it 4 of 4!
