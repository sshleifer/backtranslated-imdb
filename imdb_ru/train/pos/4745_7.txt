I can't understand why they decided to release this film in order to introduce the American public to the Jet Li Dynamo. Fist of Legend would be a much better choice. In any case, the Black Mask is not terrible, but of course it is not great either. The final battle is well organized by Yuen Wu Ping, who continued to coordinate the Matrix. But the English release suffers from rough editing and duplication. (I beg Hollywood studios to release these films without subtitles.) Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the lead role, and Francoise Yip plays the cool, but short, role of a 701 woman. <br /> <br /> Black which adds some interest, but it is overloaded with gunfights and explosions. More attention was paid to Lee's fantastic physical skills. “Black Mask” is a worthy movie, but do yourself a favor and take the “Fist of Legend” if you want to watch a stunning movie that really shows Lee's skills.
