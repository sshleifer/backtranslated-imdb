This film is one for ages. First, I must say that after watching this film, it became one of my favorite films. What for? Simply; Ben Kochio (writer, director) created a true work of art. While 99.9% of films today are purely entertaining, director Ben Kochio gives us the truth, gives us the reality, gives us a learning tool that allows us to find out why this happened. The mainstream media is spinning and spinning, but Ben Kochio looks at school shootouts right in the face, able to go where previously no other form of media existed, into the minds and hearts of two young people planning to kill their classmates. Although it is certainly graphic and terrifying, how could it not be? Gloves break, lies and sugar coating our media masters shrug, and we find ourselves in a place where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes itâ€™s not just chatter, as everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hate and isolation are deeper, more human, we are shown that these boys are us, and we are them. Society left them behind, and the consequences were terrifying and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your fellows. The lesson we all have to learn, thank you very much for making this movie. Mr. Coccio, I hope with a great expectation that you will continue your film career.
