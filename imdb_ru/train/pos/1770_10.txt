In the preview, the "40-year-old virgin" boasts a depiction of another immature sexual prank about a 40-year-old Lonely Guy, who suddenly feels the urge to commit an act simply because he has not done so. Too many past failed experiences have weakened his enthusiasm to such an extent that he completely avoids women. And here comes the unexpected: he falls in love. Moreover, there is a film about it, and it is called "40-year-old virgin." <br /> <br /> A girl named “Andy Stitzer” (Steve Carell), who is 40 years old, works as an employee of an electronics store and collects vintage figurines that are visible to everyone on his pretty bachelor lining. He has a great home cinema system and he watches “Survivor” along with his two kindly elderly neighbors. This is a pretty pictorial definition of “The Lonely Boy,” who needs to go out more and talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now the real novelty with this picture: it makes an impossible task to really understand its subject matter. in a nice, mature way. This is a film that could very easily be completely different in the hands of a more transparent team of cinematographers. This could turn into endless sex jokes and jokes, but, fortunately, this picture never goes so low. Of course, there are sexual jokes here and there, and even a few nudges are aimed at the gay community (which should in no way be taken as beating gay), because the two characters exchange insults with each other while playing a video game (Mortal Kombat: Cheating, no less - the best fight for guys based on testosterone). <br /> <br /> As a person who is rapidly approaching 20, he assembles McFarlane Toys figures. And I never actually made it myself, I found this movie as funny and touching as a movie of a similar subject could never be. I was able to relate to Andy Stitzer’s character more than anyone in the theater, because I was the only teenager present at this show; everyone else looked like they were already over 40. I’m a bit arrogant, I know, but you (“you” would be italicized) could still communicate if you were the only teenager present at the day’s 40-year-old "Virgin"? <br /> <br /> Of course, Andy never had sex and wakes up with a "morning rise" every day (don't ask), and he is attacked by his friends to try out outlandish methods of attracting the opposite sex. When Andy first learned that he was a virgin, he is 40 years old, his three friends and colleagues from ma gazina electronics David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romi Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) first assume that he is gay because he has never been with a woman, that he cannot be further from the truth. The truth is that Andy loves women , but past traumatic experiences (fun revealing one after another in the episode with memories) left him forever. <br /> <br /> David, Jay and Cal begin each mission to put Andy, so help them all . But you know that such escapades will end only in disaster, as evidenced by one meeting with Nikki (Leslie Mann), who is carrying Andy through his worst drunk driving experience, I think no one would like to survive, and he has a rather creepy meeting with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a pretty girl who works in a bookstore and eventually turns out to be a full-fledged sexual pervert. <br /> <br /> Andy is getting better when he meets Trish (Katherine Keener), a friendly woman who works in a store across the street who sells things on eBay for people. Hmmm And with this cute collection of figures, you can understand that in the end it is waiting for a large financial return, that is, if he ever can "make a deal." <br /> <br /> Finally this is the sex we have been waiting for. This is dealing with a very real problem that many Lonely Guys are likely to encounter, not that something is wrong with a virgin, but let's look at the big picture: how many of us, Lonely Guys, want to be lonely guys forever and ever? In this photo we are taught that the Lonely guy must be himself. I do not think that he needs to wax his body, as Andy does (to be honest, this is splitting the sides, and, according to this site and various other news articles, it was actually real, like blood on Carel’s shirt afterwards). <br /> <br /> “The 40-year-old virgin” was filmed by Judd Apatov and co-written with him and Karell, who originated as a parody of the main role of Carell. Carell is sweet and human, since his character is not some simple person who approaches this with his eyes closed. This is probably one of the smartest games I've ever seen, and she’s not insulting (in general) because her characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's pals, who give bad advice to hide their own relationship problems, can be related at a fundamental level. <br /> <br /> The way the "40-year-old virgin" plays out is really fun at the end, but I will leave it to the discretion of the viewer. Of course, if someone can go through what Andy does and still have the power to attract such a sexy woman like Katherine Keener, then it’s true: it's never too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
