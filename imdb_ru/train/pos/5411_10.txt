I see no reason to bury a similar film in sulfur sarcasm, when it is in no way intended to be something more than a means to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of products, which you can insanely ask for. /> <br /> This is a funny movie. My children sat quietly during all this and loved every minute of it. Of course, the villain is a little obsessed with his silly suit and manic laughter, but it's much easier to take him than a gloomy, gloomy and very painful Pokemon 3. <br /> <br /> My children have since he started watching Pokemon they will soon reach the age when they “put off children's things” and move on to others. I'm glad we enjoyed it together.
