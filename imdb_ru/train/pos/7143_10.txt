"Holes" - my favorite movie! So far, I have seen this film three times in cinemas and I look forward to purchasing it on DVD next September. I read the book after watching the movie and was amazed at how similar the book and the movie are. The director of this film did an excellent job of re-creating the book as a film. In addition, all the actors chosen to perform the roles played their characters perfectly, especially Max Kasch as Zigzag. I recommend to everyone who participated in the creation of this film, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend everyone to see it!
