Blade Runner (Deckard - Replicant!), <br /> <br /> City of lost children (heightened feelings or something used and offended and basically, well, just giving us much less than we could dream) <br /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> They really should be added. <br /> <br /> For a while, I waited for an animated film that can affect me just like Miyazaki's stuff. This is the first. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch the “lively” part of it. <br /> <br /> I have an intense love and hate relationship with the film noir, and, hey, if you don’t go, it should be mostly love, right? But there are so many science fiction and noir themes in this film that are just amazing to watch. <br /> <br /> These people have done an incredible job!
