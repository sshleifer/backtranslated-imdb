This is a film that I saw when it first came out, and which I saw several more times over the years. It is always nice. <br /> <br /> One thing is that comedy does not take sides: it turns the labor and capitalists alike. Only Sid seems out of the classic struggle, although he is responsible for this. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning: read no further if you have not seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is fantastic, although itâ€™s presented rather plausibly. Ask yourself: can someone support most of their weight in a single strand of fabric? This would break almost any support. <br /> <br /> In addition, when he is cornered in a side street, Sid uses the garbage lid like a knight's shield. Nice symbolism. <br /> <br /> Someday I will get it on DVD.
