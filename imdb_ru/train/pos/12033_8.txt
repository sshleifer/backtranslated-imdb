When I was flipping through the TV guide and came across “Twisted Desire” in the film section, I read its description. Three words caught my attention: “Melissa Joan Hart” ... I find her role in “Sabrina: Teenage Witch” absolutely nasty, I hate such programs, so I just thought it would be a boring old life, a love story in which she played a major role ... I never knew. <br /> <br /> It finally began on TV, I had a ready-made bucket in case I was torn about his vivacity or sweetness, you know what I mean. At first you think that she is just a sweet, ordinary girl who is in love, but has bad parents. Then, when you find out that she pushed her boyfriend to kill her parents so that she can be with her TRUE love, you look like “Wow.” You just do not expect such a role for such an actress. She played her role very well, in my opinion, I never expected that she would be able to act like such a bitch, and voila, she did it perfectly! Congratulations, the film was very good, I will definitely watch it again and recommend it to others.
