In this “critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on real events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a famous writer and talk show host of late night, captivated by the heartbreaking story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Tony Collette). There are questions about this boy (stories), but Gabriel finds himself embroiled in an expanding mystery that hides a deadly secret ?? according to the official synopsis of the film. <br /> <br /> You really have to stop reading these comments and watch the movie NOW ... <br /> <br /> How did he lose his leg? The end, when Miss Collett is planning her new life, should be cut off and sent to the country of “deleted scenes”. This is unnecessary. By the time Mr. Williams returns to New York, the true nature of her physical and mental illnesses should become apparent. Perhaps her blindness might have been in question — but the revelation could be verified in the “highway” or “video tape” scenes. The film will benefit from re-editing - how about “directorial work”? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Cannavale (like Jess) do not initially seem believable as a couple. A scene or two establishing their relationship might help set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers exceptionally strong characterization, not “gay imitation.” Sandra Oh (like Anna), Joe Morton (like Ash) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect. <br /> <br /> Best of all, “Donna” Collett belongs to a creepy hall of fame. Mrs. O correctly said that Collette could be "you know, like that guy from Psycho." Several years passed when the organizations awarding acting awards seemed to reach women due to a weaker distribution of roles; of course, they could notice Collett with some reward. She is so good. And director Patrick Stettner definitely reminds Hitchcock - he even makes a sandwich with a gun unattended. <br /> <br /> Finally, the writers Stettner, Armistead Mopin and Terry Anderson deserve thanks from flight attendants all over the world. <Br /> <br /> ******* Night Listener (01.21.06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Tony Collette, Sandra O, Rory Culkin
