This game is a bomb, and this is a game of the year 007, and it should be on hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire appeared, and it was better, but now a new type of James Bond game has appeared. This time it is a third-person shooter and more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game is outside this house. It even has all the great actors and actresses in this game, such as Pierce Bronsan in the role of James Bond, William Defoe in the role of the villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench in the role of M (forgive me for everything I write wrong). This game will be the best of all the games of James Bond. <br /> <br />
