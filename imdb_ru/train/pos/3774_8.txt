In the continuation of the brilliant adventures of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted are threatened from the future, because evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots disguised as Bill and Ted to kill the man Bill and Ted to change the future. <br /> <br /> In an excellent comedy sequel, Winter and Reeves are perfectly combined with delightful humor. Despite the lack of sharpness of the first one, Bogus Journey still has excellent phrases and dialogues from the lead couple, not to mention William Sadler's hilarious speech, which brings a humorous side to the depth figure, the grim reaper. Watch the episodes of the game, the best moment in the whole movie, but one of the many great tricks used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> Although this film is still filled with humor, there is a more dramatic film in it, the stakes are more serious and the situations are more risky. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a big dimension and another attractive feature. The creators also expand the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, and hell and heaven are largely symbolic and are present in the plot. The fantasy genre is again in place using this amazing time-traveling machine, but again it is somewhat confusing at some points using time and objects and situations placed before it happens in the present, as seen in the last a pair of scenes. <br /> <br /> The first watch I hated in this sequel, but the second time was real joy, because I valued jokes and narrative more, and although the jokes and plot are not as strong as those of its predecessor, Bogus Journey enough motives, jokes and a fairly flat plot to make it a good-natured family film.
