I have not seen all of Chan's films, but this is by far the best film I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> The story itself is nothing special, so I won "don't go into that." What makes it special is tricks, fights, good play, a warm sense of humor. The film has a frantic pace, and you are just stunned to see it. All the cool tricks (of course, made by Jackie himself) make you jump on the couch and scream. It's just awesome! Even my mom was impressed by this great movie when she saw him. <br /> <br /> I know that this story with the police can be quite difficult to get, at least here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it is worth a try.
