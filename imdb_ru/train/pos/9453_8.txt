“Liberation” is a fascinating, intrusive, and sometimes even disturbing tale by James Dickey, turned into a brilliant film by John Boorman. These are about four businessmen, driven by masculinity and courageous behavior, who spend the weekend in a canoe high in the mountains. There, at the top, they face every darkest side of a person and all the worst forms of human suffering ... poverty, bagatism and even physical persecution! These four people intended to travel along the river for adventure and excitement, but their journey soon turned into an odyssey through the stormy and hidden mountainous terrain, completely alienated from all forms of civilization. All of these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I've ever seen. Almost everything that happens to these people, you pray to never be in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema, Deliverance is a very important film. John Bourman's best film (followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film, and it has several memorable scenes that have already been shown in countless other films. Remember the amazing dueling banjos musical score and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual rape scene "screech like a pig." All the actors give (haha) great acting. Especially John Voight. Must see a movie!
