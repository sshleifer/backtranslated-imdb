This film was very funny, I could not stop smiling when I watched this movie, and I already watched it twice in 2 days! The film is unique in its humor and visuality, both stunning and on a par with other (more serious) films by Natalie Cube and Cypher. Since I looked at Cypher, I have become a big fan of Vincenzo Natalie, and everything he did is very interesting. <br /> <br /> In this film, the music and the “losers” Dave and Andrew, who are portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), are actors that I really love. Also cool are X-Box Dead Or Alive duels (you even see Dave playing Halo at some point) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things. <br /> <br /> In general, a well-being film about friendship. You have to see it!
