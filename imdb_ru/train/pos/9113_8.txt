Probably the first Portuguese film that I saw in my life, and I liked it. The plot is related to how young army officers seized power in Portugal in 1974 to finally defeat the Caetano fascist government, as well as to end wars in the colonies, that is, in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Verte. Most of the events shown in the film accurately reflect the behavior of army officers and soldiers during the coup, the oppressed people who were very pleased with this new development and freedom, the resistance of the Caetano people, and the subtle way most conservative officials, including Spinola, who entered possession as a new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the actions of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain declared that Portugal should develop in a democratic way, and this is what the country has achieved a few years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; at the end even the most serious enemies were respected.
