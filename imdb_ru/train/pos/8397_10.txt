This film earned each of the ten votes I gave him! Thank you guys for making a movie that is worth seeing. You showed the world, you can still write, direct, produce and star in a black film without negative stereotypes. Poetry, too, was awesome, hats off to poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I watched her last night when I fell in love with my beloved one over and over again. Today I will add it to my movie collection and will recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, do not worry about the quantity .... <br /> <Thanks again and best wishes and blessings to you!
