Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. I usually don't go to war / war movies, but it was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was with humor. Behringer's character was heroic and honest. No matter what, you know that he got your back. <br /> <br /> Zaynâ€™s character developed throughout the entire film. He was not just a costume, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a pistol. <br /> <br /> Although it was all through me. In fact, this did not concern the action throughout the film, but, nevertheless, I am glad that I saw it. <br /> <br /> Worth checking out.
