“This is my bush” is a live project created by the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after one season, not because of bad reviews (in fact, it received good reviews), but because it was very expensive. This is my bush this is a pretty fun parody of an average television sitcom. This is also a political satire. Now it’s not as good as South Park, but it’s a very funny parody of a comedy series, and also a pretty good political satire. the guy who plays my bush looks a lot like him! If you can find a show, check it out. There are a lot of laughter to be had! <br /> <br /> 9/10
