I like this episode of Colombo. Maybe this is because Ruth Gordon is involved, and she is remarkable as the successful mysterious author Abigail Mitchell, the American version of Dame Agatha Christie. It is pleasant to look at her as a cheerful, sweet writer who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died as a result of drowning. She blames her niece's husband, nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death, as the police left her. I would love someone else besides Marietta Hartley to play Veronica. Personally, I never liked Hartley. And, of course, there is some laughter with Colombo, for example, when he asks Veronica in a belly dance class. Abigail Ruth is a clever by herself, and it goes well with Colombo, which Peter Falk always plays beautifully.
