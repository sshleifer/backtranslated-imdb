There are not many stories about overcoming chances like the Kristi Brown story. Born from cerebral palsy in Dublin in the 1930s, his parents believed that his disability was not only physical but also mental. Despite the fact that Brown eventually got the correct diagnosis, the family from a lower working class, numbering almost 20 children, had to try to be appreciated. Using his only fully functioning limb, his left leg, he learned to write and draw, both skills he developed masterfully. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film-version of Brown’s autobiography “My Left Foot” such a great retelling is its humility. Director / screenwriter Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis were able to tell this story so that it doesn’t attract attention and doesn’t resort to melodrama. Cheesy struggles and scenes of disappointment, as well as the glorious moments of a minute victory - are light traps in a story so wonderful, but “My left foot” remains real and truly inspired. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest highlight. Playing with any such serious disability should be challenging. Day-Lewis not only gives us a very complete picture of Christie, but he can also chronicle the growth, improvement and internal change of character at different stages of his life. He plays Christie at 17, when he had limited language skills, and he was emotionally changeable, just like the intellectually educated Christie, who struggles to understand why he cannot find non-platonic love. The latter theme is the strongest in the film, and it would be nice if Sheridan and her co-author Shane Connaughton really confirmed it. Despite this, Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all these elements, giving an idea that is so plausible that you often do not have time to think "wow, he is such a great actor." These are the most meritorious performances. <br /> <br /> No less important, but more cunning, Sheridan’s work on the film. This story is about everyday life and struggle. Although Christie has such a unique set of circumstances that interfere with his life, his struggle is not much different from ours, and Sheridan fully understands this concept. Christie fights with love, parental attention, self-esteem and ability issues. His struggle is simply more physically manifested (in the literal and figurative sense) than ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that reflect the spirit of the big Brown family and Christie’s unique place in it. Drama develops in a natural way when tension is at its highest, and humor in much the same way. The dinner scene, when Christie finds out that his doctor / teacher — the woman he loves — is about to marry her brother Peter, is the best example of a film from Day-Lewis and Sheridan. Sheridan has proven so well what comes out when we are ready, and Day-Lewis draws us from there with his amazing work. <br /> <br /> Another strong component of the film is Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. I did not know that she won an Oscar, but there was something in her performances, like Christy’s loving and wise mother, who had just shouted, was worthy Oscar Her love for Christie and the constant struggle for him seem so convincing and cordial, and she deserves great sympathy, considering her situation. <br /> <br /> The emotional impact of the film in view of the story is surprisingly minimal. Perhaps this was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels organically human. They should be compatible, but I think it’s hard to tell a story that seems plausible and that gives enough dramatic moments to carry our emotions on a roller coaster. Choosing to downplay the last one was definitely wise for "My left foot." Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - they do not need to be squeezed for a more dramatic impact. <br /> <br /> ~ Stephen See <br /> <br /> Visit my website at moviemusereviews.com for more information.
