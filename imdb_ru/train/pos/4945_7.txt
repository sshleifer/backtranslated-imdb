This is a difficult film to categorize "10 items or less." As a rule, I don’t care about the definition of genres, but there’s something in this film that makes you want to put it in a certain category in order to convey, in one word, your feelings about it. I fully recommend this film to everyone, and if you really love the movie and if you like life, you will want to do the same as soon as you finish watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film and call it beautiful and delightful, recognizing that it is not perfect, but it does nothing bad. I don’t want to sound like I’m contradicting myself, but I think that writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he got into when he finished writing this inspiring script. I am sure that he wanted to create a product that has nothing to do with perfection: a product that would be as simple, attractive and uncompromising as its name is. Well, he did it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long, complex, dramatic films such as “City of Angels” and “Moonlight Mile”, proves “10 subjects or less” that end in just 70 minutes, the passion he has for his work, as well as faith in him. Putting an actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) at the grocery store and delivering them exactly to the places to which ordinary life would bring them is what Silberling suggests. <br /> <br /> I can’t tell you more, because in apparent simplicity there is a background that makes you think that you shouldn’t underestimate. Because everything is open here: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters, who carry endless conversations on a car trip with stops that are not endless just because life is life. And let me express my praise for how well Silberling copes with the situation, saying that he achieves in less time (not only by the length of the film, but in one day, when the film develops events) and in a smaller place, the kind of connection between two characters which Sofia Coppola generated in the “Lost Translation”. <br /> <br /> In this film, filmed in Tokyo, an actor and a woman also met, and they also discussed the moments in which they lived their lives. It is in conversations that we feel the defensive quality of “10 items or less,” and, like in the Coppola film, the naturalness of each situation is never lost, and images with all the music and without words do not seem to be forced or turned on. in the picture to “win time”. <br /> <br /> In this aspect, the cooperation of Silberling and his director for photography Fedon Papamichael. The man who shot the beautiful landscapes in the "Side" and focused on each emotion in the "Patch Adams", pleases us here with visual passages of real natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the absolute beauty of “10 objects or less” can be found in his role (Avi Kaufman), in his two main characters. They convey this feeling, which I mentioned at the beginning, and I cannot clarify; we feel their connection, and we can say that they have fun, and that they can even improvise. Oscar Morgan Freeman laureate, also the executive producer of the film, just stands there and confirms the status he has in the film industry today, and one that is well deserved: a quiet person filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry when he can make you laugh And Vega's beautiful Paz (well, I said she was great in "Spanglish") ?? Here she proves that she is a real bargain, and Hollywood is not small for her.
