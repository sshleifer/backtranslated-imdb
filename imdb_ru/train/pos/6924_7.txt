This complex western became a milestone in the career of James Stewart after his return from military service, wanting to change his image by making a western, which is largely regarded as the cause of the influx of westerns in the 50s, as it is very impressive. It is a pity that it was not photographed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart wins first prize for "the weapon that won the West", but then has to spend the rest of the film, trying to restore it when it is stolen. SHELLY WINTERS is a shadow girl with a dubious reputation, and Stephen McNally is a local fighter in Dodge City. Will Gir is Wyatt Earp, and Dan Durya is Shelley's bad guy. And don't you know that in this universal international film Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson (both completely unknown at the time) play one of the main roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence shows the first Indian attack, with the result that Charles Drake shows himself to be a coward who leaves, leaving Shelly alone in a horse-drawn carriage. Later, he buys himself, but this is only one of the turns, when the gun moves from one dubious hand to another, but eventually it turns out with the legal owner. <br /> <br /> Steven McNally and James Stewart have a pretty final shootout, which is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as the final of the DUEL IN THE SUN flaming cannons. McNally makes the perfect villain, and Dan Durieu is equally cunning in the villainous role he played during the 40s as a shooter with a low standard of living. <br /> <br /> An enthusiast, well-designed plot, very well shot by Anthony Mann is funny to see Rock Hudson (credited as Young Bull) in Indian military paint and Tony Curtis as a young soldier who throws a dreary look at the then slim and attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing and definitely above average story.
