I saw this pilot when he was first shown, and I’m sure that countless fans of “Spirit” hate him because, like Batman, the Green Hornet, etc., He took the character in the direction of the “camp”. But I obviously never got enough Batman, because I thought it was interesting, in a sense, just like this show. There are two parts that remain with me. First, when Danny's partner was mortally wounded, and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always defended the law, and obeyed his exact letter. Then he says something like: "Boy, I was stupid!" Which is his way of telling Danny to be vigilant instead, which he does (although the look of Batman’s TV). Then, there is a scene where he tries to seduce the evil, so that he let him go, kissing her, but she is not fooled because he is too honest to kiss her convincingly! It was a great example of a “camp,” which was also “underestimated” by both the actor and the actress.
