I really liked this film when it was released, and I'm still doing it, because the storyline makes you hope for life as a whole and for people too ... one of the things that I like about Lawrence Casdan films. In addition to the positive emotions from the film, there are other reasons why the Grand Canyon is liked. First, he has an outstanding cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, a well-known film that won an Oscar for the best film, was very similar to this film. The difference is that the Grand Canyon leaves you with positive feelings. Collapse had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose the Grand Canyon instead of Crash any day.
