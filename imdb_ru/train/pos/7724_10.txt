Of course, “Star Wars” (a film that I saw at least fifty times) wins all the others in special effects, but this film has everything else! <br /> <br /> It has horrors (no graphics), romance, robots. Witty repeater, ingenuity, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this film a couple of years ago in awakening with a new imprint, and I was amazed at how well it lagged today. I thought that the old electronics in the style of the 40s would look strange, but it somehow looked futuristic and modern. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis here is (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to win, it still gets out of me. <br /> <br /> Monster Krell, appearing in the rays of the rays, still scares the runners from me. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all know that “The Great Bird“ Galaxy ”probably modeled most of the Star Trek from this film. <br /> <br /> No one has yet been able to defeat Robbie, the robot, in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This film, in general, is a standard that must be met by all other science fiction films! <br /> <br /> Commendation of a haunting electronic score that kept us all on pins and needles.
