This show is awesome. I thought that the two episodes where Paul died were so sad; I actually cried. But the other shows were awesome; Kerry was my favorite character because she was on the "dark side." I also thought that Bridget was funny because she was very fun. I also thought that the guy who played Kyle was very, very cute. I liked it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, who was played by John Ritter, was really funny. This whole series is funny, and I would like him to still show it on TV. when they showed it on TV, I watched it every time it was turned on. The next time he shows, I will watch him again and again.
