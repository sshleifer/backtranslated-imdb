Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those films that captures you and does not let go until the end, especially when you watch it in childhood. Seeing the film as an adult, you have to admit that in fact it is not so scary, but the story is very exciting and contains many magnificent mysterious scenes (especially scenes with a creepy mom) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the film , no doubt, the scene with the grandparents in their new RV; the scene with the stones is very exciting and pretty scary. In addition, the scene where the protagonist reveals the secret of his mother, quite frightening. <br /> <br /> Okay, the acting in the film is not that great, and the film sometimes seems a little boring, but overall, Ghosts That Still Walk is fun. It is a pity that only a few people have seen this film, this film really deserves better. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And for all of you, Hollywood producers; If you want to remake a movie, remake this one!
