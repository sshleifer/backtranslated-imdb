“Una giornata partolare” is a film in which closed spaces are brilliantly used. It is in these boring empty spaces that viewers see the emotional turmoil and violent flashes of the two main characters, Ettore Scola. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two disappointed people, they decided to come together for a few short moments of their lethargic life. This is the element of sadness associated with the narration, which makes us believe that people will side with the characters close to them. All men will be very sorry for the character Sophia Loren. All women will surely scream in their hearts because of the existential position of Marcello Mastroianni. Disguised sexuality is also one of the key problems of this dark, sharp film. Most characters struggle with issues related to their own sexuality. The film is about gay, although it was well depicted that a homosexual guy goes well with women. This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has created a pretty good mix of facts and fiction. His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed the fates of ordinary Italian people. A word about a courageous character, great played by the great Marcello Mastroianni. He acts like a real man who does not ask for forgiveness. He happily accepts his fate and prepares for the worst of his short but meaningful life. This movie masterpiece !!!
