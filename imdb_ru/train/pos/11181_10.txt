This is one of the scariest, scariest and heartbreaking horror movies! <br /> <br /> Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family are moving to a new home with his wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie), and young son (Gage). Everything seems normal until Dr. Creed loses one of his patients, who had a terrible head injury. Then he is haunted by a ghost who knows how Victor takes him to the Sematarium of domestic animals and shows him where the dead come to life. <br /> <br /> Louis doesn't know if it was all a dream, talks to Ellie, who is worried about her cat, which can be killed by a truck, and then Rachel tells Louis that it is very difficult to talk about death because of her Zelda’s sisters, who were really sick (as we see in the memories, how sick her sister is) are in fact, and this is one of the worst scenes in the whole story!) <br /> <br /> The next day, Louis calls Jed and says that the cat was killed by a truck, and Jed will take him to where Victor Ghost told. he does not go! And bury Kota, his wife and children went to see their grandparents, and Louise was alone at home when she saw that the cat was back, and now she is angry in her eyes, so he goes to see Jed, then Jed tells him that he also buried his dog there too (as we saw other memories). <br /> <br /> Later in the film Family at a Picnic, Gage plays with a kite, and Gage says, “I dropped it.” The road where the truck approaches the past, Gage approaches the road, Luis hurries after him, The HEART-CLUTCH scene in any horror movie will leave with your Jaw on the floor, or the Shiver will fall on your back when you hear Louis screams. Soon he misses him so much and then Louis buries Gage in the same place where the Cat is buried. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this film is that some of the scenes in this film are not too far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is just amazing and everyone played great! 10 out of 10
