How truly friendly, charming and welcoming this simple old TV series; I was happy to see old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. This is a document of a long-lost ship. (The best TV shows today can hardly compete with these old moderately good TV shows.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It refreshes the mind. This is not stupid; stupid are those who do not understand the conditions under which such serials work. CHANDU has an overwhelming sense of simple, unassuming and friendly fun. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much ?? Chandu is a western sorcerer who is also known by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece from the sect of murderers. <br /> <br /> Chandu shows his supernatural gifts in a rather restrained and moderate manner. <br /> <br /> As for the pretty sexy niece, Naji, she was kidnapped by the priest of Ubas. Ugly Vindhyan Poor sexual girl actually stolen many times in the sarcophagus after falling asleep with a flower; almost stolen from a boat; fake policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, terrible ceremonies resemble the images of King Kong and are barbarous mockery of the ceremonies and rituals of the RCC. <br /> <br /> Would you protect the girl as bravely as Chandu? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old libidine and rather heartless, mean drunk, and this only contributed to his performances. He is a prototypical mean drunk uncle, naughty, cunning and oblique. This may sound like a rather crooked respect for Lugosi, but the Burton biopic of Wood left me with that impression of Lugosi and made him very sympathetic to the decrepit actor. I like the fashion shows of Lugosi. <br /> <br /> This series is unfairly beaten.
