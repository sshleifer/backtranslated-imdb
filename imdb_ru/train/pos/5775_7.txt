Come on people, look at the name! LOL! I remember watching this movie on Saturday "Late Night Features," many years ago. This is a great, stupid movie with monsters, with a funny bad game and two wonderful idiots that reinforce the sloka factor. 2 guys for boat rental are a redhead - this is a movie! LOL, and you will enjoy the scene on the boat where the English guy and his wife talk about all the stars, and now it's noon and sunny. Bloody cheerful !!! You can say that they just didn't care about the plot, they just wanted to go through the film as quickly as possible. Bottom line, you'll love it if you love the 70s Schlock.
