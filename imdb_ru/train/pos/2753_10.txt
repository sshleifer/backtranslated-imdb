My favorite movie of all time! I've seen a lot of movies, but this one surpasses them all! Great game, great story. You, as a “normal” caring person, will love George. Despite the fact that he is an actor, he is also a very nice person himself. And most importantly: you will learn to respect and look different to people with Down syndrome.
