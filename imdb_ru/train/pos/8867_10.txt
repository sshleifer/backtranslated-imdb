I sincerely hope that sometime the first season of Cosby will be released on DVD. The episode with the eccentric genius brother of Hilton, George (played by the late Roscoe Lee Brown), is a classic gaiety. It reflects the classic rivalry between brothers and sisters and the love between brothers whose lives went their separate ways, but both were happy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Ms. Rashad brilliantly adopted the chemistry they have shared on the Cosby Show for many years, and translating them into a more average role demonstrates the dimensions that they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> A list of comedy dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Phillicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... a classic genius!
