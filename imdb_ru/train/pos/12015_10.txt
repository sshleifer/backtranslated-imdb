At first, he thought it would be your typical western film, but it turned out to be very interesting and kept me enchanted to the very end, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgad), Midway, 76, had experience with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), Fall, 93, and Zach never forgave Sam and did not stop at anything to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), Portrait of a Lady, 96, managed to get into this situation and was among the hungry men who never seemed to leave her alone. Sam Burghade had to make very difficult decisions, and I was very surprised by the conclusion. This is a very interesting film, and the acting was outstanding.
