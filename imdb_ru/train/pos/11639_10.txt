I saw an extended show of this movie tonight. I really liked it. The film kept me on the edge of my place all night. Killian Murphy is very creepy like a villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character was much more terrible in this film. He played his character very well. The worst "bad guy" I saw a while ago. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and greeted at the same time, as if we were on a cue. The wait lasts throughout the film. The amazing part is that the end was not anticlimatic. I was not disappointed at the end. I was pleased. The trailer does not make a movie of justice. The film is much better than indicated in the trailer. Do not wait for this movie to be released on video. Go look. Although I did not have to pay to watch this movie, I would gladly give 10.75 to watch it. Enjoy!
