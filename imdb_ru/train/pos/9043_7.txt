I once stumbled upon this movie on TV. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on the channel, not quite famous for the transfer of good films. This one, however, was nothing more than good. <br /> <br /> The October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickame, a boy inspired by the launch of a satellite to become a rocket science scientist. He and his friends start building rockets. His father doesn’t like it when his sons acquired a new hobby, and he would prefer that he himself become a miner or go to college for a football scholarship, like his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written, It may be too predictable, but this is normal, because it does not focus too much on these parts of the story. This is an important part, but where there is obviously an internal action, the focus is on the actions between the characters. The story is good. He has some clichés, but that's fine. This is based on real events, so you can't just drop these clichés. Characters are really good. Where the story takes place on the way down, the characters are identified and they manage to maintain the action and quality of the film at a high level. You will recognize these characters and feel sympathy for them. They are well written and believable. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful film. The sets and style of the 50s are fundamental, and the paintings are well-composed and well-lit. All this creates a good mood of the film. <br /> <br /> Acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job with Homer Hickame, and Chris Cooper is as good as John Hickam. As for the other actors, they are also good. All together it makes quite a strong cast. <br /> <br /> In general, I'm glad I caught this movie. When I first saw this, I learned that it was based on real events. If I knew this after seeing this, it would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. I believe everyone will like this movie. This is a good movie. Not bad at all!
