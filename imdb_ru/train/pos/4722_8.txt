Given the low budget and production constraints, this film is very good. This is believable, realistic and shows how Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta)) risked their lives to save the downed American pilot from the ruthless and wild Nazis. who admires the American pilot. If you are looking for special effects, superman heroes and magical endings - this film is not for you. If you want to feel what it was like to dodge persistent, immoral Nazis and their absence radaniya, then you will be charmed by this film. I really liked it and for those who like horses, dogs and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to it, this film will be the one you will remember for a long time.
