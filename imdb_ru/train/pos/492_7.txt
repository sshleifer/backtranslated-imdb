Let me first say that although I have watched every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I do not consider myself a tracker or tracks. These are people who live in the basement of their parents and attend meetings in suits with pointed rubber ears. I gave this film seven casting away fantastic historical mistakes. The game was better than average, but the plot did not bring surprises. They tried very hard to reconstruct the technology, but the special effects were just a big temptation. As for historical mistakes, if you call them that, then the first captain who ran the Enterprise was Commander April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to Riker and Kirk, we found the Klingons trained them and gave them technology (for this reason, the main directive was created), but, as I said, this is no reason to discredit this beautiful series. I hope that the plots will become deeper, and then the special effects can move to the back seat.
