As a young teenager at the time, Airwolf was a must-watch for a generation that wanted their Cowboys and Indians to have amazing gadgets and explosions of collisions. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was essentially a Knight Rider in the Sky: a similar comic book technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and a repetition of the concept of one person who matters. <br /> <br /> But in other, important aspects, it was very much thematically different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, A-Team and other militants of the time. First, the premise of the series is not based on the desire to help the needy, but on the possession of Stringfellow Hawk Airwolf for personal gain (as a lever to try to find his brother MIA, St. John). And then there is the dark edge, secured by a solid foundation of the series in the context of the 1980s Cold War, full of Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the enemy inside. Of course, the A-Team constantly referred to Vietnam and the status of the team as fugitives, but usually it was done with a light touch and rarely was central to the plot itself. With Airwolf, intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show â€” although it was (unknowingly) diluted as the series went on. <br /> <br /> Looking back, the production of the Cold War clearly dates the series. Many stories are squeaky and far-fetched, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly implausible even with modern technology. But it's not that. The air wolf was incredibly fun, he tried to tell interesting stories, not relying solely on large sequences of actions, and he did not embellish everything, miraculously guaranteeing that no one died. Sometimes it did not succeed, but often it succeeded perfectly - and when loading the television budget. <br /> <br /> For DMAX UK readers (Sky Sky 155), has just started (January 2008) the Airwolf daily replay. Install your Sky + box for this blast from the past - we can even get a revised, re-abandoned (and, unfortunately, significantly inferior) fourth season, which, as far as I know, has never been seen in the UK before.
