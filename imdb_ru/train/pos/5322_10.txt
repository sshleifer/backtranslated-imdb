A real dark noir film and a very graphic film, a good storyline of a person pursuing redemption who may have just left it too late. Visually, there are some really good scenes from an artistic point of view about what can be done with a minimum budget. Full ratings to Gareth Maxwell Roberts and his team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although I hope there will be more British actors. Lisa Ray looked great, had not seen her before and hoped to see her again in the future. The theme of all the interesting is Sex, Drugs and Violence. Come on. I would definitely say to rent it and check it out if you are in the mood for a semi-precious noir.
