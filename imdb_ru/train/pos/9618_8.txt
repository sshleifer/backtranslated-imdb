I recently bought this film, and I do not regret that I even have it. I really want to add this movie to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, the directors of the film, shot less than one month and spent about 1 million euros to create this wonderful film. This proves that not only large productions make great films. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie is perfect. In the computer language BUG means a program error that causes a reaction in the computer. Our reactions can cause both negative side effects and beautiful moments of beauty. The dizzying events in this film begin with the death of the BAGA. A man becomes a witness to a "crime" on the other side of the road ... From this point on, things get complicated ... <br /> <br /> I mark John Carol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallis, a man who cannot do everything right .
