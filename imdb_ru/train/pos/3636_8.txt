This is a good film about the dreams of one person and the desire or desire to realize them. This is a beautiful and inspirational film. Why do some people try to find flaws in every movie that comes out, especially in good. Dennis Quaid shows off a great game in this true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach, who his team pushes for another throw in baseball's professional career. With a great cast, including Brian Cox, as an old, former Navy officer who allowed his son’s many accomplishments to pass without his support. It was nice to see him not a villain in the film. If I have one complaint about this film, it’s like this: never let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film belongs to those great baseball films like “The Field of Dreams” and “Natural”. It evaluates two thumbs and a big "well done".
