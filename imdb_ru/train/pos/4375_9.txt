Mel Gibson's Braveheart was an amazingly perfect film, but it left a sour taste in its mouth. Rob Roy, on the contrary, is a little less polished, but at the moment the best movie. This is a historical film that combines timeless themes with truly historical values, while Braveheart gives a coarse and unpleasant modern luster to an ancient tale. What this film does is the cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero in a role that he basically repeated (in a relaxed way) in Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but not the greatest fighter and not the most demonic lover. Amazing, but man, he commands the screen. Against him are a number of equally human opponents, including Tim Roth's Cunningham, a nasty, but brilliant, and morally bankrupt John Hurt's lair. Jessica Lange also deserves praise as Rob's pragmatic wife: she is also strong and noble, but at a distance of 300 years from the modern heroine, that is how it should be. This is not the most original film you will see, but it has the courage of his convictions, and strong performances make you care.
