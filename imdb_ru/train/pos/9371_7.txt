One thing I've always liked about Robert Ludlum's thrillers is that when you think you understand, everything goes in a completely different direction. There are so many turns in this film that my neck hurts from watching. <br /> <br /> I also like the director John Dale (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) that he may be dependent on sending and, in this case, writing (with his brother Rick) good story <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT. Walsh to the cast, and you have a story that will keep your interest, even if they play characters that they all have perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best in people, and it will keep you interesting and guess to the very end.
