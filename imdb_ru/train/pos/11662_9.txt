The Secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful, and stunning cartoons I have ever seen. Before watching this film, I was convinced that nothing could leave the race for his money and that it was an attempt to win in this category, but I found a serious rival in Kells. <br /> <br /> Secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, Abbot Kell. The abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps he is too strict and much more concerned about strengthening the wall around the city from the impending Viking attack, than it nurtures the boy's imagination. When the legendary brother Aidan appears (who looks amazing like Willie Nelson) and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan sets off on a journey into the forest and meets a beautiful forest nymph named Eisling, who he likes (and saves his life) more than once. With the help of Aisling, he is trying to save the city and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book, which, as legend has it, can turn darkness into light. <br /> <br /> See my full review of The Kells Secret at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of- kells.html
