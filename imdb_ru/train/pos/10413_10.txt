I grew up with this as my favorite movie of all time. The special effects are incredible for that era and won awards. I remember the dialogue as if I heard it yesterday. This is just a great, timeless adventure. Music was written by Miklos Rosza, the best in the history of cinema. Sabu is a thief. Konrad Wade is a great villain. I have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane. Stop! Rex Ingram wants a genius from his bottle!
