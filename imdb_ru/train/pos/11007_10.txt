Jeremy Northam's testimony about the stuttering, softly brought up book Morgan Sullivan and watching him, as he loses pieces of his real personality under the influence of single malt whiskey and under the influence of the presence of Lucy Liu, brilliantly thought out and joy to observe. He offers her a cigarette in a bar - an old habit, thoughtlessly and without even asking, and he is lost in her face, neck and lips. No matter the brainwashing, love is a persistent way. Love also cannot be brainwashed by either of his two fake wives. Gradually, he begins to do without glasses, walk and talk differently, and even his face looks different during the film. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and occasional. The widespread use of black and white and gray tones makes this film an almost fantastic “film noir” in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would like to see more vulnerability in the image of Lucy Liu, whenever she sees him in his various exhausted states, the person she loves and for whom she performs a mission based on blind faith, some restrained vulnerability and flashes of sincere sympathy and anxiety would make it a less one-dimensional representation on her part. She simply cannot compare with the talents of Northam, but in general I really liked this film, and I would be pleased to learn about other scenarios written by the same author.
