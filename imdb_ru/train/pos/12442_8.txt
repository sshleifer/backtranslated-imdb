Filmed on incredible graphics and without a budget, the film turned out much better than you expect, and, of course, much more true for Peter O'Donnell’s books and comics than the previous two films. You can read the strip now in reprints from the Book of Titan, or in Comics Revue monthly. This is one of the greatest adventure comics of all time. The film is not very good, but unlike most low-budget films, it does most of what it has received, and this interests you. On a single DVD interview with Quentin Tarentino, which is clearly stoned, is gas. Some people blame Tarentino for linking his name with the film, but without him it would never have been done. He is a fan of Blaise modesty, and chose a good writer and director. All things considered, it’s worth 8 stars.
