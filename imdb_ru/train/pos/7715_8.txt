First of all, keep in mind that this film is almost fifty years old! Nevertheless, he is still considered one of the greatest films of all time. I wonder how many today's disposable celluloid works will still be discussed in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple but convincing enough, and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. I still remember how for the first time, when I was a child, I watched it when a monster enters a force field protecting a ship, and for the first time (and only) you saw its shape. If I trembled with fear, I can tell you. It looks today, but still more than quite efficiently. <br /> <br /> Scenes with a tiger show their age. You can see the outline where the tiger was glued to the Altair frames, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the effect by which a creature melts through Krell’s doors is miraculously completed. <br /> It is also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (better remembered in the films “Airplane” and “Naked Gun”) as a young but still mature person. He was 30 years old when this film was released! Almost 80 now! <br /> <br /> In general, a good film that will surely be loved for many years. Timeless
