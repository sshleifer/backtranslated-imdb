PG-13 rating for violence, short sexual humor and drug content. Quebec rating: 13+ (must be G) Home video rating in Canada: 14A <br /> <br /> I have already seen the Police Story several times. In my opinion, “Police Story” is Chan's best movie from the 80s. He did this because he did not like another film about a policeman, which he was supposed to shoot in the film “Defender”. I did not see a defender, so I can not compare. The game is not so bad, and the plot is pretty good. I don’t remember the plot very well because I saw this movie some time ago, but I remember that there are a lot of great action movies, tricks and comedy films in this movie, just what a good Chan movie needs. If you can find the Police Story, and then you're a fan of Chan, buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Duration: 106 min. <br /> <br /> 9/10
