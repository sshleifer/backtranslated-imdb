Halloween is a film that I need to go out and watch every time it is THIS day of the year. I even watch it sometimes when it's not a holiday !!! This film is SO wonderful. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I will never stop loving Although I did not see the remake, I already feel that it is not completely needed. I think that Rob Zombie should NEVER redo such classics. Although itâ€™s killing me that I know that there are people who have seen the remake without even hearing about the original. I'm just mad about it !!!!!! This film was great, and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.
