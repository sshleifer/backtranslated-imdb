Recently, when I went shopping, I saw the American Gothic box set and thought, “I remember it!” I used to turn on the alarm clock and watch it when it was on channel 4 in 1996 at 13:30 (I was 14) . I remember this mainly because it was really scary and strange, no one could be as scary as Lucas Buck (with the letter B!). <br /> <br /> What annoyed me was that they did the same thing with the box set as they did on TV. Episodes in a funny order, did I keep thinking when Dr. Matt leaves ??? - they made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the fault of scriptwriters, producers or directors (his TV people make money in the background. They still do the same - just look at shows like Carnivale and Farscape, they don’t like originality in the studios. !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Finish - If you have not seen this and call yourself fiction, horror, supernatural drama ... Fan = YOU MUST. They even said the same thing in SFX when viewing the box set.
