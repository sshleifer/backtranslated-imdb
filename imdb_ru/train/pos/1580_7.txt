This is not just a close look at the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in Berlin, and some people who were involved in this. This film begins now in New York, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) mourns the death of her husband, and all family members have gathered on her side. Daughter Ruth Hanna (Maria Schroeder) slowly learns that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fisher (Doris Schade), and so she goes to Germany and finds a 90-year-old girl who tells her about the events on Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER WARNING ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, when the Gestapo housed all the Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse, although they were supposed to be immune to marriage with the Aryans, and for nine days a group of women waited outside and shouted for their release. Eight-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) is waiting for her mother to come out and she has nowhere to go, but she meets 33-year-old Lena (Katya Riemann), who accepts her. Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Fifel) is also inside, and in the end she is trying to communicate with Nazi officers to get them to do something. <br /> <br /> The director of the film is Margaret von Trotta, shooting her first full-length film in almost 10 years after working in television, and although this is clearly not the film. of her more provocative efforts, she remains one of the most revered directors in Europe. This is not one of those Nazi films in which we watch horrible acts of inhumanity towards Jews, although we do see cruel treatment, but instead itâ€™s rather a retelling of a small event that meant life and death for the people involved. This film does not attempt to shock or open the door to debate about circumstances, but it just wants to shed light on a small but true life event that happened in a historical period. Part of the strength of the film comes from its actors, and there are some good performances that shine through, especially Riemann and young Lod, and it's always nice to see Schroeder (Aimee & Jaguar) in a key role. This is not a big film or something that will change your perception of World War II, but, considering that innocent lives were killed because of the events that have occurred, I think that one reason is important enough to tell this true story.
