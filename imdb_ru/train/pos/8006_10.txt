This is a great game! Well, maybe he didnâ€™t have some of the features he should have had, but Digital Anvil still came up with a good game. There is a certain similarity with the Elite (you can trade, collect weapons and cargo from destroyed ships, carry out missions), however in this game there is a scenario with a large number of scenarios. This is a great mission. The control system is different, it uses a mouse! You basically fly the spacecraft around the system and go up! The game has pretty good graphics, despite the fact that it was made in 2003. It should work well even on a modestly specified PC. The plot tells the great voice of John Reese Davis, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (she appears in every computer game). Stick to the story, it gets better and better as it continues. There is even a race section where you and the enemy must drive their spaceships around the course (this includes passing the rings). This section took me some time to win. This adds variety to the game. Some sections are a bit complicated, but overall you can win this game. The game has an active mod scene on the net. Pick up several mods to extend the game. I have not played any of the mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the continuation of this was canceled, shame!
