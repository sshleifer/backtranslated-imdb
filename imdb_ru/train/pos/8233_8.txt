Fido is a story about more educated zombies who are trained to serve the human race. Everything falls apart, though, when a zombie young Timmy Fido is eaten by a family neighbor. Since then, a disaster has happened (well, maybe not a disaster, but to some extent chaos). Most people are right about their zombies, and one such character sleeps with his zombies (a very funny part of the film, if not too disturbing) And we find a loving Fido, whatever he does. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent films about zombies (there is no negative in this statement). I highly recommend this to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate it 8/10. Rated R for zombie violence
