Director Edward Montagne does a little over an hour that other more expensive and well-promoted films are not able to do. Mr. Montagne shows us the police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr., which, although not one of the best in the genre, it keeps the viewer in everything that happens. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a Type B movie. In fact, the best thing for Tattooed Stranger is the opportunity to look at what New York looked like in those years. William O. Steiner's crystal-clear cinematography has either been preserved in this way for many years, or has been lovingly restored. <br /> <br /> The debut sequence offers great views of New York. Later we will be taken to Brooklyn in the section of Dumbo, and then the film will go to the Bronx and Gun Hill Road with its many monumental stores in the area. <br /> <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella did a great detective team. Patricia Barry is ideal as a plant expert from the Museum of Natural History. Jack Lord, who in his career was engaged in more significant things, appears in a non-speaking role. <br /> <br /> It was a lot of fun to watch the city as it was, because it no longer exists.
