I don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, this movie is swinging! Great movie, everything, great music (Prince rough!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad film, very touching. I don’t want to talk about much more, I’m not going to play the plot, but I’ll say this: the film is VERY realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, so many acquaintances look like the one in the film. I think this is very realistic and so real that it makes the film much more exciting. My generation liked it when this film grew up, so many of us loved Prince, and there is a lot that is needed for any teenager who has experienced similar problems. <br /> <br /> However, this is definitely NOT a movie for teens. I recommend it to all age groups. And not everything is so dark, there is great music in the film, scenes with performances of the group and sexual funny scenes between the Prince and Appelonia.
