In general, this is a delightful, carefree, romantic, musical comedy. I suppose one could make a small case for the film. But I'm not sure what you would cut out. The singing that Kelly and Sinatra perform? Not. Fairy dance that Kelly does? Not. Time needed for the film to develop the storyline and develop the relationship of the characters? No (in many cases this is a common complaint that in later films the characters do not develop). <br /> <br /> Some comments say that Iturbi brought little to the film, but it gives us a chance to see and hear great talent from the 1040s. So what if he wasn't an actor? He was an important part of the film because the main story was to invite Grayson to audition. <br /> <br /> Initially, Catherine Grayson wanted to become an opera star. Louis B. Meyer brought her to MGM for an on-screen test involving aria. During her audition for the film, MGM Copper nods and smiles. You can imagine that this was the case when she conducted her real tests on the screen several years ago. <br /> <br /> This film is so full of life that it is difficult to cover all the main points. Throughout the film, colors and lighting were used. You can see why Frank Sinatra was the star he made. A good counterpoint in the film is how Sinatra (even then the ladies) played the role of wanting to just find a date on vacation. You will feel good after watching this movie. 7/10
