I watched it last night with low expectations. The reasons are that I usually don't like “Made for TV” films, and I rarely like “actor reunion” films. But it looks like the Los Angeles Times liked the criticism, and I gave him a chance. I'm glad I did. It was pretty good. Adam West and Bert Ward reunite like themselves. But, in a sense, they acted like their “Batman and Robin”. They were polite and did not take themselves, or this film was too serious. The film begins with the fact that they are looking for a “Batmobile,” designed by George Barris, who was stolen by someone before it was auctioned off for an orphanage. While they are looking for a car, they also recall the series they did together. This is stated in the memoirs. It was well done. The actors they received for the younger Bert Ward and Adam West were dead. And, for a television film, it came to the last detail about their real behavior on the screen and beyond. I give this 9/10, I really enjoyed it.
