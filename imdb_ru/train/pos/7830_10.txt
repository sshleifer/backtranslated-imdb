In Die Nibelungen: Siegfried, Siegfried was betrayed. Now Crimhilda is seeking revenge. She marries Hagen, and through a series of events, eventually, participates in a very radical (but appropriate) action. <br /> <br /> One of the things we are seeing now is that we can see the pictures. Attila Gunn (nicknamed Ötzel in the film) is shown as a strange person from the east, perhaps a hint of the Soviet Union. Obviously, it is not Fritz Lang who is to blame for the fact that Hitler used the “Nibelungi” for the national pride of Germany in the Third Reich, but you can see what the Fuhrer liked in this story. However, this is an absolutely formidable movie.
