Almost 60 years later, you can watch a few films, but they remain as fascinating as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. The special effects used are great for the 1946 film. The game is great. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an outstanding job. Using Black and White / Color adds the creative character of the film. This has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people even know about its existence. This is my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for the release of this film on DVD for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death.
