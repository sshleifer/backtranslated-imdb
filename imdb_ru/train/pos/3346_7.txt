In the Old West, there are always men who breathe violence and women who hold their breath. The famous "city tamer" named Cleith Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) arrives hired by citizens to get rid of shooters (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, etc.), Hooligans of the Baronland. There he meets a blacksmith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharp), her boyfriend (John Lupton), a marshal (Henry Hull) and the owner of Saloon (Ted De Corsia). Clint as a lawyer is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some cartels, saying the following: ¨ Warning, carrying weapons or other weapons in the city is prohibited. Check out all the equipment in Marshal офисе’s office. Clint finds his ex-girlfriend, a local madam (Jan Stirling), in charge of the girls from Saloon (among them, Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence). But the city council is afraid of the rude methods carried out by Clint. In the end, the landowner of the kingpin appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly exciting story about a hired sheriff who had another murder. It begins as a slow West, but follows to surprise us with dark characters and a solid conspiracy. The tale is almost gloomy, the nipple arrives in the city just in time to verify his citizenship, but later the events worsen. The main points are the burning in Saluna and the climatic opposition at the end. Phenomenal and excellent role for Robert Mitchum as an avenging angel and bitter shooter, he is the whole series. Bright and lively music by Alex North (Spartak, Cleopatra), Atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Lee Garms. The film is stunningly realized by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, “Three in the Attic”), who made a good western like “Invitation to fire a weapon” and episodes “Zane Gray”. Watchable results for this unusual western.
