Ko Tamo Peva - the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me which one makes you smile every time you watch it. But the truth is that the humor in this comedy is special. This is typical of Serbia. And the entire former republic of Yugoslavia knows this perfectly !!! Therefore, I think that the rest of the audience (for example, in Europe) cannot enjoy so much. Because subtitles destroy the hole. But they should at least try !!!! Yes, it is ironic! This is the best film in the history of Serbia, and the world does not understand this! :-) If you have a chance to see it, don't blow up OK!
