“Who loves the sun” is working through some thorny plots with sufficient wit and grace, so that the story was not only fascinating, but often fun. It's been a long time since I found such a touching, very nice movie. <br /> <br /> The film is great, attracts the attention of beautiful landscapes and tranquil landscapes. Peaceful images contrast wonderfully with the tension between very human, very spoiled, and at the same time very cute characters. Because of the excellent composition of all five major players, surprisingly interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who Loves the Sun." This is a really funny film, in which the sharp pain that we can inflict on each other, and the surprisingly complex, but equally useful process of forgiveness, is striking.
