I was not completely sure whether this would be another idiotic night soap opera, which seems to clutter up prime time, but as it turns out, this is a pretty good show (not least due to talented casting). Four friends from different backgrounds get together and share their personal lives weekly. The watch program follows each of them individually through their often intricate quests to find love, and does it, not boring and not banal. “Trudy” Sharon Small is a housewife (presumably widowed after 9/11) who becomes a little preaching and annoying with her friends (who are usually a little weaker and more creative in their endeavors). It's nice to see Small on television, since she was great in Inspector Linley's Mysteries. Chicken can act. The character Eagles Brady (Siobhan, a lawyer) may be the most affected, but still very sympathetic women, as she struggles with her kind, but self-absorbed husband Hari (Jaffrey, the former of "Ghosts") in his quest to have a child with her regardless of her needs. The last two cast members are effervescent Jess (Shelley Conn), an event planner, a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone, regardless of gender, and Katie (Sarah Perrish), a gloomy doctor who communicates with a patient. And his son sent her a career and love life goes out of control. Nevertheless, I now hooked and hope that the BBC continues to release this series, because it is good, different, and she has an excellent cast.
