I loved this movie! I look biased since I'm a big Disney fan, but I really liked it. The action begins at the beginning of the film and just continues! It’s kind of a departure for Disney, they don’t spend that much time on character development (my husband pointed it out) and there are no musical numbers. This is an adventure adventure. I really liked it, and I recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, whether young or old.
