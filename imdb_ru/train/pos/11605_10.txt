The main reason I had to watch this film was that it was Susan Swift, an outstanding and over-appreciated actress. Films about time travel, as a rule, do not interest me, as well as films about witchcraft, but this film was exciting and creepy. He did not rely on outrageous special effects and did not pay so much attention to time travel that the viewer is lost and confused. It was a really creative film, simple and focused, with great acting.
