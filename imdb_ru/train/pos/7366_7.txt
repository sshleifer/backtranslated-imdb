This is a film that the mass market will probably never be able to access, as it does not give the viewer a simple view. The story of the troubled Spike and his friend Heaton is not quite a Friday night movie, but he has his unique advantage, and I discovered that he is interesting. There are moments of brilliance, given that the film was shot with such a low budget, for example, when Spike inhales aerosol. However, I didn’t really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and, frankly, it made me spend most of the film trying to solve it. And also I didn’t like the fact that most of the film was being played with two friends who were talking, and not really “action”. This is a small film that is difficult to watch, and it makes it attractive.
