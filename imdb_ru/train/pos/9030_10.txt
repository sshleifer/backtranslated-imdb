This film took me by surprise. A friend of mine told me that this film was a “flick of a tiptoe”. Boy, he was wrong! This film has a great family attraction, without sex scenes, like _Others_ films. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job with Homer's Hikam. The cast is also great. <br /> <br /> Science, coming of age, family quarrels, great train scene ... There is everything in this movie. The soundtrack is good, although the score is presented rather chaotically. Music of the 50s Puts the film on the brink of greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD is definitely worth the weight of coal. The replay value is great - I have seen it several times already.
