I watched the film, recovering from a major operation. Although I knew that this was just a film “B”, a cosmic western, I liked it. Perhaps he lacked a flash of high dollar works; nevertheless, they struck my imagination and provided a great escape. Unfortunately, our society has so many opportunities that it is too easy to ignore petty attempts. Just as I can enjoy Shakespeare playing even in elementary school, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for the sake of art. I am a policeman and I found a connection with a retired policeman. I dream of his dreams that I will not be able to answer them at the moment of crisis in order to save someone else’s life (or my own). while it was a romantic ending, where Farnsworth really killed the bad guy (predictably), I needed a little happy romance where the good could win. My world is really too cynical.
