In this episode, a lot of dated (as in most episodes of the Twilight Zone), such as the incredibly sexist military "form" of a woman. And some things are so incredible, like the easy availability of clean water. However, consider the year when it was done, and time, and you will quickly understand why this episode is so special as you watch. He has a good sense of hope, something is missing in many of the Twilight Zones, and an interesting female character (despite what she rarely says), something else rare in the Twilight Zone. “Two” is a great example of how the Twilight Zone, in just 20 minutes, can bring more emotions and drama than most two-hour films today. And it's great to see two people who became American icons so early in their careers.
