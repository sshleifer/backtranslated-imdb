I saw a movie on the Viennale a few years ago where the audience liked it. I liked it too, the performance of Summer Phoenix still haunts me, so I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in London around 1900, where a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She desperately tries to become him, but not before a man treats her badly, she understands on stage that she has talent, that she is associated with the audience and becomes a stronger person. <br /> <br /> There were certain reviews, where her performance was broken, they accused her of being boring, unable to revive her character. I think this is her forte, this is exactly what Esther Kahn should be, and Phoenix makes the bold decision to make her Esther a rather boring girl. Thus, its transformation at the end is more powerful than it could otherwise be. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is gorgeous, the images of London at the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how life was unpleasant then. <br /> <br /> The only mistake, in my opinion, is the duration of the film, you lose touch with the characters, after all, it’s only about finding an actor in yourself, so there’s no dramatic action in the film. This is a Phoenix loan that we do not lose interest in the film after the first hour.
