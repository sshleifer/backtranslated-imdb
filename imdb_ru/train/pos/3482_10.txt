This is my first comment on the IMDb website, and I write this because we are talking about one of the best movies ever! 'Do not be sad!' make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will love (if you are not yet a fan!) the traditions of Georgian choral singing, and perhaps you will accept the difficulties of your own existence and just feel good after watching this :) so this is the fact that the actors in the main roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the main character. The film starred Vakhtang Kikabidze (who is great), but you will remember every face around him in the film. You will find that you quote their lines, which have become common names for many Russian-speaking people. Film for life. Simple but deep, you will want to watch it again and again.
