I entered this movie, thinking it would be a crappy movie with a rating of b. I came out surprised and very surprised. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had an amazing comedy time. The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes between them. The story was enough to tie everything together, the woman (Eve) dies on her wedding day and comes back to chase a woman who meets with her future husband, it sounds far-fetched, but in fact it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - In general, these are decent watches with a movie theater, if they are not on the DVD when they appear.
