If you read books, then forget about the characters that Tolkien created in his head. Representation of hobbits, gnomes, etc. The “Disney” treatment has passed. Dark riders are excellent, and, as I have always imagined from books. <br /> <br /> Cinematically this is an excellent film that combines live movement and animation to create amazing effects throughout the year. It is a pity that he (Bakshi) was given money to complete his epic. <br /> <br /> This video is worth it, as they will cost a little later than the "Lord of the Rings" 2001 !!
