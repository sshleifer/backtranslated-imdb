The industry threw the ball at that. The trailer does not make the film fair, and when it opened, it was on a hand full of screens. If people had the opportunity to see it, word of mouth would make it very successful. Each of the two leading actresses provides excellent emotional insights that really draw you to the story and especially to the characters. I checked it based on the enthusiastic recommendation of Richard Roper or (Ebert and Roper) in his book. An example of a great movie that was never completely released, except on a few screens. That did not give the opportunity to be seen. Some films go to the video quickly, because they are not so good. This is a worthy Oscar, and this is a tragedy on many levels, about which the majority will not even hear. Maybe by word of mouth he will get the next one on a DVD or cable. If you have not seen this movie, you should. Great performances of two leading actresses make this film. It might just be another formal teen movie after the school curriculum, but instead it’s great for other notable films. Girl Interrupted comes to mind. If you like it, you will like it. <br /> <br /> Both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without looking melodramatic. Although Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying for most of the film, this is done in such a real way that they don’t look like stereotypical characters or melodramatics. The film will affect you in many scenes, and if you are a novice actor, use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better at this than traffic. I hope that both of these actors will get more roles that also use their talents and allow them to shine. Watch this movie and, if you want, recommend it to your friends so that it does not get lost among the crappy blockbuster that comes out every year. This film was buried while Spiderman 2 heads the records. What word do we live in? AGHhh. So, to make the world right, look again at this and recommend.
