The comfort of the creatures in America was to be released on another network, or at least he was given the opportunity to get the full set of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Considering that the American audience (apparently) has a mosquito focus when it comes to humor, which does not consist of profanity with gadgets or is concerned about scatological functions (both sound and scent), such shows will be a little far between . One of the main problems was that, no matter how brilliantly it was, it was made for a discharged audience, who knew what to expect, but was watched by the audience and conference rooms who had no idea what they were looking at. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would like to see at least three more seasons of this show, even if it were released for a direct DVD release. The material and interactions between the creatures were rich in subcontext, and there were other conversations just waiting to be under the surface. But thanks to political correctness, such conversations occur only in my thoughts.
