I turned on the TV as a satellite of white noise and heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment," so I ran into the television room, waiting for another 70s movie, and received much more. Fortunately, I could rewind to the beginning (DVR buffer) and press the recording button to watch it completely (Cinemax is not cut and no less in HD!) Besides some holes in the history and intermittent incredible dialogs / events, this is an effective Thriller worthy of your time to watch. Quite creepy and progressive at times: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, who is deftly played by Christina Raines, Parker strikes, very cruelly, her father clearly controls the scene of the trio to watch) The film is completely 70s full of bad clothes (costumes from polyester and sticky ascot) and decor, bad hair, inflated musical score and familiar cinema. The cast is excellent, find a second on the main page of this movie to check it out. It was amazing to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles - always surprisingly creepy! ENJOY!
