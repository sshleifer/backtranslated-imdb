I am one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about the show secret. Pushing Daisies, however, is my exception. I was curious to learn about the program from commercials that gave an idea of ​​the premise of the show. At first I was skeptical about this, especially after the Six Feet Under final was still in my head. Here again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all other episodes. Blimey! First, I thought that he took the topic of death and was presented in such a way that it was acceptable, but not painful. The characters were attractive, and I like the idea that Ned can't literally touch the love of his life, Chuck, without the consequences of her death. <br /> <br /> Most characters crave things they can't have. Apart from Ned and Chuck, Olive craves Ned. Lily and Vivian are hungry for their niece, Chuck and Emerson, are always hungry for money from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are perfect and believable. I love the way black Emerson plays with the rest of the characters, being African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from it. <br /> <br /> In general, this visual fairy tale is one of the most valuable entertainment that I saw in the 2007 season. I think that the show has enough romance for romantics and enough one who did it for lovers of mystery. I just want the writers back to work so the show can continue to evolve.
