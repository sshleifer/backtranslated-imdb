This is an excellent modern film noir .... "excellent" in that it is interesting, from beginning to end. There are some holes and some silly parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ... but I haven’t found anyone who isn’t involved in this story. The film has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it presents pleasant colors and cinematography, as well as a good guitar soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I called this crime film “film noir” because it is sandy and all the characters are no good. Even the only supposedly good guy, played by Nicolas Cage, gets into trouble, lying, and he has a fast connection, which he should not have. He also does something at the end that is not right, but I am not going to spoil it with words. Suffice it to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad that Cage looks good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of the “bad guys,” does anybody do it better than Dennis Hopper? Little. At least in the category of "irresponsible" it is difficult to win. Lara Flynn Boyle is interesting to watch for several reasons. J.T. Walsh also gives another great auxiliary performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that has never been widely publicized, but it should be. You will have fun watching this. By the way, try to pronounce the name of this movie three times quickly, without spoiling it!
