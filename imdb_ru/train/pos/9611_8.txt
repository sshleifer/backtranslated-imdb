It was amazingly clever for a television movie and was quite consistent with my own experience of bulimia. It was actually well researched, and I can only assume that it was written by someone who went through a similar experience, because he had all the small details. The characters were pretty well drawn, and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Loman were great. I think what I like the most is that they made them specific and clever, and there was no explanation for the causes of bulimia Beth (it was not some kind of “diet out of control” caused by the pressure on girls mass media). , pressure, we are not really going to decide ... "). Her mother was not completely ignorant - too often on TV they take on a problem that EVERYONE knows about and try to tell us that their main characters are the last people left earth, which do not do this ("Diabetes? What is it? Oh, my world is all crooked, doctor, please explain all this to me as if I am a little child", etc.). It was wonderful that her mother was a psychologist, and even she did not see signs. And the scenes in which Beth vomited were not just melodramatic and sensational, and focused more on the bulimic need for secrecy and their uncontrollability. The scene where Beth tells her mother that she is sick would make me cry if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Okay, I liked these pieces. What didn’t work so well for me is the end that has returned to the territory of television films, which we know and don’t particularly love, but I think they had to finish. “You can cure your child’s eating disorder too, if you have a lot of money and you live in America ...” <br /> <br /> And can I say again that I really like Mara Winningham. She is gorgeous.
