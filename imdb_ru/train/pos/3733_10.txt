I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of the mental problems he faced after returning. Therefore, when one evening I saw part of this film on a paid channel, I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt how he was preparing for Vietnam. I went out and rented this film, and I must say that this is the most heartbreaking film I've ever seen. I bought a DVD right after the rental. The way he emotionally pulls you in all sorts of ways is something I have never experienced in any other film. As for the thematic films in Vietnam, I think this is the best movie, although the platoon takes second place. Besides all this, I think this is also the best performance of Colin Farrell as an actor. I like him in most of his films, but in this he was incredible. I put 10 points because it is one of my five favorite films.
