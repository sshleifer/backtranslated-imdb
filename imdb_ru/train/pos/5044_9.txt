Bill Paxton plays the title role and directs this very original film. Looking the first time, I realized how good it was. The feedback I heard was fine. As a result, I was expecting a maximum average thriller. However, because of the excellent director and acting skills of Paxton, the film is worth seeing, especially if you are a horror film fanatic. closing loans. The strongest place in the films is the storyline, which, as I should say, is very original and similar to the one I have ever seen. Well done also to two young leashes that convey emotion well if these embarrassed boys. I give this film a 9/10 and I highly recommend everyone to catch it.
