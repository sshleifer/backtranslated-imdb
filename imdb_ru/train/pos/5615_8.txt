Kafkaesky thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done, and Polanski performs well as an uncertain introvert who tries his best to adapt to his dirty Parisian apartment and his fellow guests. Terrifying early because of seeming meanness and obsession with fellow tenants and terrifying later when he develops his defense, which in the end will be his destruction. Personally, I could do without the disguise element, but I accept the nod of Psycho and the fact that there is some logic in it, given the storyline. Nevertheless, it could work without and could remove a little theatrical element, but then, perhaps, this was conceived, because in the courtyard, of course, it looks like the theater finally looked. I can not refrain from feeling that the director himself has several feelings, that he is not a “real” Frenchman and Jew. Nevertheless, there is something to rejoice about, including the wonderful game of great looking Isabelle Adjani, and good old Shelley Winters is more trustworthy than ever.
