I loved this movie. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtroy, although he is present in almost all German films that are taken into account. But also because he is NOT the main actor. The lead role is taken by Barnaby Metshurat, who was the only reason to watch Juliette in 2001 and who really carries this film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> The family moves from Italy to Germany in search of the “German dream” (this is my own invention and ironic ...) cheap labor in the metallurgical and coal industries. Nonetheless, they end up opening a restaurant, and the journey that the film takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From this point on, the story is told mainly about two brothers from this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtroy) and Gigi (Metshurath). Gigi’s dream of becoming a director is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother’s determination to return to Italy. What follows is an excellent — and absolutely neutral — view of what kind of life the choices you make can shape. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film does not say what kind of life (Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or complete or more interesting. It just gives us a useful perspective on what it is to seek identity when it comes to two countries and mentalities. and this view is not caused by bitterness or contempt for any country, which makes it such a wonderful film for any country facing immigration tension. The fact that the director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also gives this film a greater degree of trust and emotional precision. The icing on the cake is fantastic performances of the entire cast, especially Metschurat and — I really need to emphasize this — the little boy who plays the young Gigi. Execution of this child would be a difficult act to follow for almost everyone! Great movie, go take a look.
