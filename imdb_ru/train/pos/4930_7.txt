Panic in the Streets was a decent thriller, but I was a little disappointed with this. The central theme of the city attacked by the plague in our time is enchanting, but the film never explores or develops it. It is well made and interesting, but not as interesting as it should be. The script for this is really weak and destroys the whole movie. None of the central characters is truly convincing or believable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film is very well made, so it compensates for weak scenarios. Director Eliya Kazan keeps the film in a tense and lightning pace. There are several outstanding sequences, especially the catchy climax of the chase. When several years later, his directorial work was combined with the best scenarios, this person in most cases could not be mistaken. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been a watchable lead man and does everything he can with a signed character. Paul Douglas is wasting his time shouting a little too much, but also doing a decent job. Outstanding in the cast are two villains. “Zero Mostel”, best known for its comic roles, is essentially slimy, as one of the main characters of the movie. No wonder Jack Palance is a frightening villain. “Panic on the streets” is disappointing, but still worth seeing. (7/10)
