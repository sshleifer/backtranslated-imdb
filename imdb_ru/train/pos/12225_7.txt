I saw this film, and although I knew from the very beginning who the killer was, I still enjoyed watching it. I would recommend this to other people. Lifetime has a lot of movies. And I think that since it's close to Halloween, they could play more. Therefore, please be careful if you are interested in viewing it. I believe that Alicia Silverstone played her part very well. I really like her as an actress and as an individual. She seems so cute and down-to-earth. Kevin Dillon, he was a performance like that for me. I'm not trying to confuse him or something, but I believe that his brother Matt could better cope with this evil evil serial killer. Kevin seems too cute to me. But I think he's fine.
