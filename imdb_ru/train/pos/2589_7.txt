Brothers with psychokinetic abilities (yes, indeed) duels not only because of Debra Winger's affections, but also because of the secrets of their childhood, which left them at odds with their abilities. <br /> <br /> There are surrealistic touches (the fire brigade behaves like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor, wit and romance. The soundtrack is great too. And just as the American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get, but with fire, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmm Dennis Quaid), who also puts his own lady trailer ~ Priceless;) <br /> <br /> By the way, in the section with quotations, the best line is omitted ~ ~ "Once you have a clown, you will never return!" <br /> <br /> This is for me like the movie (I just ordered a DVD from the USA), and if comments written by people who were happier with Legally Blond 3, aren't ditched you - try it :)
