I tilt the scales a little and say that I liked it. However, the cartoon really only pleases those who have very absurd tendencies. This is definitely something that most people will not get, just like the nature of the absurd. <br /> <br /> Animation is terrible, but yes, that's the point. The protagonist foul language, cruel and stupid. no redemptive qualities at all. his wife screams and screams, obviously barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any meaning. <br /> <br /> But again, this is the point;) <br /> <br /> If you donâ€™t like the sequitas, foul language, complete and complete coincidence, you will like it. <br /> <br /> This is very short, so I would probably rent it instead of purchase.
