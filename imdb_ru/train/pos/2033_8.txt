In fact, the answer is only a tiny part of this excellent film Imax, which teaches us our subtle personality. C.G. and special cameras - supported by Imax - incredibly display the inner (and external) work of the average person, whether they are adult men and women, boys and girls, or children. Almost every aspect of the human part of the body is worked out in detail: digestion, reproduction (with Marvin Gayâ€™s punch), heart, etc. Some particularly revealing moments include how a child can be submerged under water, and how brain impulses look. It's amazing how we function. <br /> <br /> The topic disappears a lot. But we still learn a lot of new things about our bodies that we need * to know *.
