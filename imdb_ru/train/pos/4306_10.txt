The fact that I still think about the film a decade later is what the film really says. For me, this justifies the Grand Canyon as a film that will somehow affect you. I truly believe that before the movie Crash was the Grand Canyon. The main difference between the two films, in my opinion, lies in the timing of their release. I'm not going to argue which one is better, but I will struggle with the idea that they share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this issue. I will start a comment that you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to publish any other movie topics we can share, because I really like movies.
