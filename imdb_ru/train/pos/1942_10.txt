I consider myself a big movie lover. I was sick on the couch and surfaced in this movie. From the very beginning to the end, I looked with reverence at these great actors, whom I had never seen, say, a great word. The shot was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope this message is heard on any bad comments written by others. The director has a heart, and it beats with his actors everywhere. Thanks for making a movie like this one. Simply surprisingly clumsy, beautiful kind characters who are vicious and graceful at the same time. Just great. I can not imagine it without 10 lines, so I just want to say that I want more from this director, more from all the actors in this film and more from the author. I did not want this to end. the end
