A best-selling book of honor killings in Jordan was withdrawn by publishers after accusations that the story was fabricated; linked to other allegations about the past of the author as a fraud. A few years later, she comes to the surface, recognizing that she took a certain number of dramatic licenses, but is willing to work with the director to prove the essence of her assertions. What follows is a fascinating understanding of the pathological personality: someone whose behavior did not make sense does not make sense, if only what she says is not true, but he who is apparently unable to say something amazingly dramatic, but not proven at best and most often verified by false. Itâ€™s almost impossible to imagine what Miss Houry hoped to get by appearing in this film: an excuse? celebrity? - all that it seeks is to project a certain image of oneself as a deeply damaged person, and even this cannot be taken at face value. Directed by Anna Brunowski increasingly appears on the camera as her film develops, and more and more enraged; but she is finally rewarded with a wonderful, albeit frightening and disturbing tale - and one of those films that remind us of what a completely strange world we live in.
