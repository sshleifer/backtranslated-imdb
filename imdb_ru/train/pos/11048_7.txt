I did not feel that this film was as smart as it seemed to me, but I still liked it. <br /> <br /> This is original, although it reminded me a bit of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mainly because of the coloring, but also because of the sharp quality of close-ups of the characters. <br /> <br /> Being in a prison cell, but don't let it push you away, this film seems to go beyond many multi-stage blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with many years of “Black Art” to the fore and very good characteristics make some too believable! <br /> <br /> Scary with some blood, it's worth a look.
