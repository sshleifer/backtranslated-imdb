Ok, I confess. This is the film that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes an excellent parody of someone who makes a parody of James Cagney, with charm to save. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is solid workers, and it will fit and do a good job in this 80s comedy. Fake gangster films from the 30s and 40s, it constantly opens new horizons thanks to surprisingly original material. . (Well, yes - some of them have been copied since then - but when this film was shot, it was original, and most of it was not copied elsewhere.) See how Joe Piscopo warns people not to do ______ with one of great slogans parodies. See how Roman Moroni does something with profanity in English, and this will make your grammar teacher laugh. Watch amazing shows, such as the pet shop owner Johnny Kelly, who uses a price tag with a gun for his puppies and dusting his kittens. Watch the greatest educational film, Prevention Against Sex. Look at the most amazing distortion of church Latin, while the guy who never went to the store collects a Thompson machine gun from the parts. Watch the lines you’ll use in everyday conversation over the next decade. See how Maureen Stapleton makes the exact opposite of a hardworking mom with unexpected gags that you will never see. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that doesn’t touch your funny bone, have patience - another will appear after 30 seconds or less, and chances are that you will need to stop until you finish rolling the floor several times . Crumbs and bunnies? They, too. Keep an eye out for small details - some sights can go unnoticed in the first few views. <br /> <br /> There are a few minor flaws - but this is probably the best of the fakes. Some come close, but none are so good.
