I think Charlotte Gainsburg is one of the best performers in the world. I can not understand why some people say that it is not. Boring .... ??? Maybe the one who said that she is boring because he / she is boring. She is a great actress and the film was excellent. He has a lot of great ideas and very good performers. The direction was great. I imagine myself in the French environment with all refinement and perfumery, flowers, churches, problems, etc. Everything is great. We have a very good actress, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Shabbat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like him more than in his next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigo did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
