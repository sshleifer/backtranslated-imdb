Coleman is assisted by a brilliantly written script. Giant Hollywood studios of the 30s and 40s were able to copy some elements of German expressionism and incorporate them into Hollywood films. very good use of shadows, light and silhouette. I really liked the scene in which Coleman turns off the light in his dressing room at the beginning of the film, and he starts reading Othello when his face instantly becomes dark and angry. the viewer already sees the text and drama of Shakespeare, which captured "Tony", and sets off on the road of doom. I also enjoyed the dramatic scene of death in the play, when he was overwhelmed with emotions and accidentally strangled his partner, too hard for her to bear. her requests “Tony, stop, you're hurting me” are frightening and disturbing. you just don't know if he is going to go upstairs and kill her at any moment. the chase for the cat and the mouse to uncover the killer was nicely added 2/3 of the way throughout the film to add a faster pace and also add to the narrative of the film. Masterwork from George Cukor. He is like a skilled director. A great movie. It is a pity that they do not make them as before ...
