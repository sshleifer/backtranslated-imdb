I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was a great movie about family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was funny, warm, touching and touching, as well as entertaining. A film like this would go very well with word of mouth reviews. I would definitely tell my friends and family to watch this movie. Let's only hope that they will have a chance. I would rate this film as one of the best films I have seen in a year. There is no violence, scenes of militants, murders, sex in it, therefore, obviously, distributors are wondering whether it is worth choosing it. Believe me, there are people who would like to go see such a film that has an expiatory value, instead of the many typical large box office blockbusters that we usually get.
