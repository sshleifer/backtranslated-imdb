Nine out of ten may seem like a high-score sci-fi film shot live that was accused of being rolled out in the US and sharply criticized as the worst movie about Kurt Russell’s career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First, when you read negative reviews about this film, they usually begin with the wooden essence of the interpretation of Russell Todd, a soldier of the same name. I will also start here with my amazing statement that this is perhaps the best part of acting that I saw when Russell was filming. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffers from severe post-traumatic stress disorder — this film was written before this phenomenon was as widely accepted as it is now. <br /> <br /> Image on the spot. Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and lonely. He suffers from irrational anxiety - he is associated with a fever, teaching him to analyze every movement and interaction with another person for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyperfocusing entails an inability to comprehend a larger continuum, in which there are tasks that he has been given to perform - there is a scene where he cuts himself carrot cutting and continues to work without gaps without removing cuts or blood. Many interpret this as a sign of his physical strength and focus on current work, but it is also a sign that he simply performs the requested task by heart - not understanding the relationship between the vegetables he prepares and the food that will be eaten later. <br /> <br /> Todd’s dialogue, at least spartan — the two large talking scenes he receives are central to the plot of the film and both underline the grim nature of its existence. Fear and Discipline tell us. Is always. The fear of keeping him pumped to high alert, where the smallest details will not pass by him, keeping him ready to react to the point of the knife. Discipline to keep him under control through his fear, to overcome him and act tactically. It is assumed that he does not have time to think and he cannot afford feelings. Many viewers interpret his reactions to Sandra Nielsen’s embrace differently - but I believe that you should interpret this from the point of view of a person who is just embracing in battle - the trembling represents his suppression of his fight / flight instincts for fear caught, his movement and vision is limited - fear and discipline are valid. <br /> <br /> Then there is the implication of his abandonment (actually twice) - as representatively as our society seeks to throw the marines into the garbage heap of society when they have served their conditions. 40% of the unemployed are former military personnel in OUR world, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly takes on the responsibility of Mace to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one who has such a high probability of his death. <br /> <br /> Then there is a military subtext - a conflict between the Church of the Bouzie and the hot shot from the headquarters in Mekume. New people Mekuma faster, stronger, more accurate and more aggressive. Any one of them can strike Todd in the ground - but it's not about the tools that you have, but how you use them. Inspired by Todd, who has been given the freedom to exercise his initiative and act without the overwhelming effect of perceived superiority, he uses ambush tactics and cunning tricks to break through a new unit — sent without support, cover, or intelligence. This is a reminder that military power cannot make up for failure in leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle topics. When a movie is shot and written so minimally, the script leaves a lot of empty space for your own interpretations to take root. Look at the Soldier with an open mind and see what he teaches you.
