I was surprised that “Secret Fury” was a nice good movie ...... Probably because I had no expectations from this movie ..... Although, the movie does have its own holes in the plot ... .. I would say that you could not guess who was behind this whole scheme until the very end of the film ..... At first I thought it was Robert Ryan using the same method as “Gaslight” when the husband trying to drive his wife crazy, but I was wrong ...... The main problem with the film is that they are moving in a completely different direction, which at first did not give about no clues. ..... I thought Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert coped well with their roles ... Plus, Vivian Vance, a wonderful actress who shoots scenes in this ... Those who love movies, it makes you guess, like this ......
