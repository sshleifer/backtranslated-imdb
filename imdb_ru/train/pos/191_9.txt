In those days, if Marion Davis had his assistants, and she didn’t just listen to William Randolph Hearst, she would make more films, such as Show People, and would be much happier. In fact, when you see how she gets her first big break in a comedy with two drums, she would really like to do it in her career, rather than such epics as “When Chivalry was in colors” and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> All that you see in The People Show is a real Davis, a talented comedian, an excellent mimic and a generous kind-hearted man. She really could identify herself with Peggy Pepper, known as Patricia Prepayur, and put up with her share of pretense in her Hollywood fame. <br /> <br /> If the storyline “People’s Show” was set on a legitimate stage, you would call it a backstage story. I think it was one of the first films about films that could be called plot-by-frame. Marion is eager for young hopes who come to Hollywood, like many others, in search of such a long break. She wants drama, but her introduction to film is like foil for burlesque comics. She gets her share of the pie and the Seltz muzzle, but she studies her profession. And also wins the heart of the young comic actor William Haynes. <br /> <br /> She really gets her first big break, but not for Haynes, and Marion does arrange a legitimate drama with actor Paul Rally. Played Andre Telfair, pretending to be uncounted by Count Avignon. Someone here was shooting actor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others, and heard about it, one of the most despised people in the movie. <br /> <br /> People show was one of the first films that have unpaid cameo star appearances like themselves. You can see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleonora Boardman, etc., who are just inside and around the cinematic colony. This in itself makes Show People a movie that is worth saving. <br /> <br /> Show People also made good use of the standard Tin Pan Alley songs, such as: “Not Fun, I'm Sitting on the Top of the World”, you would be surprised, California, here I am. When the film came out on the threshold of the input sound, the song Crossroads appeared in it. This is not a bad number, but the boy and girl singing it on the soundtrack have nothing to do with it. I assume that since they were not noticed, there was no need to invoice. However, I would like to know, and I am sure that you will do this if you are lucky enough to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see why Marion Davis loved this film so much and thought it was personal. favourite. She looks so much at home in this film, and her real lack of complaints shines through her work, which makes it a real pleasure for the audience.
