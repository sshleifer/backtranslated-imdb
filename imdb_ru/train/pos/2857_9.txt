As part of our vocabulary of the late 1950s, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. well in that great show "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> This happened on Saturday evening, and everyone was glued to the TV. It was a real show featuring family values. Perhaps there was a weekly crisis, but a strong family atmosphere brought everyone together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Green was the dominant patriarch of the family. His words portrayed wisdom. We often had to wonder that Ben Cartwright, a widower, had to be the best of husbands of this poor wife of his dead. He raised wonderful sons. <br /> <br /> Naturally, we all wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine, and Roberts turned in a lot of money when he left. His career never began, since he was linked as Cartwright's son. He should have tried to return to the series. He, of course, lost Bonanza, leaving school.
