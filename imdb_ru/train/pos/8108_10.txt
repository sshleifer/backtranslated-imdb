I have a “Future” on D.V.D. and this is very clear compared to my version of VHS. The sound is honest, but sometimes it is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the film so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found it. It described in detail why something happened. The best things about the film are the little things that I didn't notice at first. For example, John Cabal was playing with a toy plane at a party in honor of Christmas, as if it was a diving bomber that measured the power of the sea, calling the battleship Dinozuar. Aircraft sunk ships, undeclared enemies steal aircraft attacks. Rolled flying wings of the aircraft. Strong rollers for women throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are others, watch the movie to enjoy them.
