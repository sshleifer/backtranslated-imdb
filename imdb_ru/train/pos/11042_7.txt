In prison, four inmates occupy a cell: Carrer (Gerale Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud and was betrayed by his wife; Drag Lassalle (Philip Laudenbach) and his protégé, retarded Puquett (Dmitry Rato), who ate his six-month-old sister; and intellectual Marcus (Chlodwig Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrer finds an ancient magazine hidden in a hole in a chamber wall. They understand that the book was written by Danvers (Jeffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and about black magic. They decide to read and use its contents to escape from prison when they learn the truth about the fate of Danvers. "Maléfique" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French low-budget horror film. The story in almost the same place has no cliches and attracts the viewer's attention to the last scene. I'm a big fan of French cinema, usually romances, dramas and police stories, but I noticed that I recently saw some good French horror films, such as “Un Jeu d 'Enfants”, “Belphegor” and “Dead End”. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Sinais do Mal” (“Signs of Evil”)
