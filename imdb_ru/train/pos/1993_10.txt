This is Dicken’s musical adaptation of Oliver Twist. For the most part, the original story was retained, although for the flow of the film, some supporting plots (such as the summer that he spent recovering and the half-brother) are omitted. The biggest difference in the film and in the plot is that by the end of the book Fagin was hanged - the final, very different from this musical film. <br /> <br /> This is a one-of-a-kind musical - one whose style and field really didn’t match either before or since. The songs are not only often sung and remembered, but the choreography of the film is a spectacle. While in most musicals several people or perhaps even a small group dance the choreography, here the numbers are often in the hundreds or maybe more. This is really a spectacle, and I was lucky to see him in the theater when he debuted, and this is one of my earliest childhood memories. Just seeing it again a few minutes ago, I have to say that the film only improved over time. Great scenery, great acting and singing is a special pleasure that is hard not to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I watched the movie again tonight, I was surprised at how high and feminine the Mark Lester Singing was for the film. Well, according to IMDb, his singing was voiced by a girl, and this definitely explains his voice.
