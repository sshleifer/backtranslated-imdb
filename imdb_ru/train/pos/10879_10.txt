I wanted to see a reduction from the day I heard about it, which was somewhere last year. Anyway, I watched it today, and when the film started, I thought that it started soon after a week, but he recovered after 10 minutes or so. I thought the movie was pretty good. but what I didnâ€™t like was how the killer was created, I thought before renting it that it would probably suck like urban legends: the final version, I almost died, basically everything in the final version of UL needs improvement. CUT is 100 times better than UL: the final version. The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scene. The killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give 8 out of 10
