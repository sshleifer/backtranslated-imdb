The “straight story” is a story about an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state border. He decides to make a trip on his lawn mower, since he cannot drive a car, and he wants to make a break on his own. The film perfectly describes his journey and the lives he touches along the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth performs a wonderful performance just like the rest of the cast, especially Sissy Spacek in the enchanting performance of his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely important role. <br /> <br /> At first I felt that the story of an old journey across the country would be boring, but I soon discovered that Lynch was making this film with all the insight into a person’s life, which I would recommend to anyone.
