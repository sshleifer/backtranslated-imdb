I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who watched it. I was not sure what I was getting. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has made many funny films; i.e. sister act. <br /> <br /> However, it was not exactly a comedy. This is a drama with comedic moments. so if you are looking for a riot to laugh, keep looking. <br /> <br /> This film is about a black family, which moves from the nice quarter of the city to the middle class. I would say more, but I think it will spoil the movie. This film is not only about racial relations between white and black, but also about relations with the black community. I think it is worth the chance. if you are not interested in watching another movie about race relations, then this movie is not for you
