Before I see this film, I see a lot of comments that everyone can see perfectly well in a film, good or bad ... <br /> <br /> What I really want to draw attention to is Woody Harrelson. on behalf of him, he may not be in many parts of the film, but when he appears or even the introduction, I was struck by the "message" of Will Smith and Woody Harrelson, which they tried to create, and, perhaps, slipped the whole plot to the end, in order to truly understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> I am not a very sentimental person, I believe that a good deed should not be repentance or pity. But the act to show redemption is not many films that, in my opinion, can show it. This is one of them that can. <br /> <br /> I agree with one person who commented on this film, showing acts of "suicide", and this is a fall, but I do not believe that I am trying to send this "message" of the film, but "to the sacrifice." A little to the extreme, but this message is in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This film has potential. Acting is worth every penny, the script is incredible. from a man who really doesn't like to watch dramatic movies ... if you like drama, you definitely need to watch it.
