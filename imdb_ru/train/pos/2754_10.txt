I really love this film, I saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great direction / camera work / music. This is a gift to show it to someone you love. It is a pity that Jaco Van Dormael did not shoot more films after that. Top 5 artworks. Really !! <br /> <br /> Today, after 3 years and 3 days, the comment is higher. it was never sent because it was not more than 10 lines. In any case, yesterday I saw le huitieme jour again. This is without a doubt in my top 3 movie along with “Cinema Paradiso,” which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also really good. I am really interested in learning about the new Yako von Dormael film. I hope this completes my top 3 movie. If you watch this movie, rent it. Or even better. buy it. Because you want to see it again.
