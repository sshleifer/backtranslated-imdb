The story is told smoothly. There are no breaks. Flash backs are seamlessly woven into the present. Casting was superb. Young Yara looked very similar to Yara at that age. Her image of a blind man was convincing. Directed by Daniel Syrkin did an excellent job, forcing various actors to work together in this story. Cinematography is very good. You feel that you are with Y'ara and Talia going to the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles follow Jewish script very closely. It is interesting to note that, although “Out of sight” is not a direct translation of “Lemarit Ayin”, both names are very consistent with history.
