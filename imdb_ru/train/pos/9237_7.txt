This movie is pretty good. Six months ago, I bought it on DVD. But at first I thought it was an original film. I saw the series, and this is a good film, but here they put together The Living Legend, Part 1 and 2 and Fire in Space. The same as with the first film, but with other episodes. But, nevertheless, this is a pretty good movie. Only the ending is strange (you do not see what is happening with Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. Actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen this, look. Cast: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Green, Herb. Jefferson, Jr., Tony Schwartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
