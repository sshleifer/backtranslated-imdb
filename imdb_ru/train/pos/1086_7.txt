This film is a little unusual in that it has a very delicate plot, and the film itself is very slow and unhurried. Although it is very different from the usual grant film, it is still very watchable and interesting. Itâ€™s as if someone said, "Let's just follow Carey and see how he resents all the little problems that arise when you are repairing a house." Considering what a funny actor he is in the film and how much support he gets from Mirna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. Although the film has rather modest claims, it makes the most of the material. This is a great movie for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family.
