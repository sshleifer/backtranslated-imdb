This film is an explosion of punk rock fun, from beginning to end. The Ramones, the ruling princes of the late 70s punk rock, look like themselves. PJ Soles stars as Riff Rendle, a rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock and roll. Riff is addicted to writing songs for Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school in a rush and encourages her fellow students to join her in her jubilant tricks. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the school where Riff is studying has just hired a new director named Ms. Togar. She is a tall, frightening Amazon woman. And she vows to make pupils "toes." She even has a couple of students who act as observers who report to her with mud about their classmates. Miss Togar is particularly determined to catch Riff and put an end to Riff's anarchic machinations. But Riff has smart ways to prevent Togar at every turn. <br /> <br /> The prestige of the magnificent performance of Maria Voronova in her role as Chief Togar. Mary is a legendary movie actress. And in this film, she plays the fascist Miss Togar with mocking pleasure. PJ Soles, like Riff, turns into an electrifying performance. Clint Howard, like the two-faced Eaglebauer, is very funny with his role. <br /> <br /> The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential in the punk-rock scene of the 70s. Of course, this is a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you donâ€™t like Ramones or punk rock, this movie is a terrific burst of (literally) vigorous fun.
