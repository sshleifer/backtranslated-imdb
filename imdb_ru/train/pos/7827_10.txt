This movie is just great. The cinematography is good, the acting is great, and the plot is just breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who considered himself a liberal, until he learned about the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on television several years later, I recognized him from the image of Klein. Denzel Washington, as always, also plays masterfully. <br /> <br /> I urge you to watch this. It is a long time, but it is worth your patience, because it tells such an incredible story. Remember guys, it really happened.
