It was a Saturday evening, and the film “BASEketball” was shown on TV. I always wanted to watch it, but never bothered when it was in the movie. Boy, I was wrong. Words cannot describe how funny this film is, with the participation of the creators of South Park, who share natural chemistry on the screen, being funny. I recorded the replay the next day and exactly one week after the first viewing, I saw it 7 times !! I am obsessed with this, and I know anyone who appreciates the work of Trey and Mats, and will appreciate this film. SHOULD SEE, THIS IS MY COMEDY NO. 1 OF ALL TIME
