I once saw this film as a child on a late late show and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> More than 30 years have passed, but recently I found it on DVD - it was not cheap, either - in a directory specializing in military films. We watched it last night for the first time. The sound was good, however it was grainy and had trailers between the drums. However, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed by how truthful this play was. <br /> <br /> Somewhere here is a directory. If you are sincere in your search, send me an email and I will see if I can get you information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
