I really liked it, and although the final made me angry, I still give it 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four college students (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) go to Florida in their own way, they meet 2 guys (Turner, Davis), they really add nothing to the plot, but at least they are somewhat cute. The girls agree to meet with the guys in Florida to have fun, but they have problems with the car, and they never cope. One of the girls decides to turn to the nearest gas station for help, the other three remain in the car. <br /> <br /> Soon one of the girls is forced to use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere. there is no choice but to go to the bushes. Soon she becomes a witness of how a man (March) chokes a woman, a girl leaves the area in horror, she is not very far away, but lost. <br /> <br /> Her friends at the car go searching for her, they also go into the forest and face the same man, one of them sees a dead woman, the man answers, shooting the girls, another girl runs away, they manage to get to the car where she is also killed. <br /> <br /> In the end, the two remaining girls find each other, and because they rush into the gas station, they are arrested. It was then that I began to get angry, these poor girls are afraid for their lives, and the police of a redneck do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are mistreated, and one of them is left to kill one madman in her cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without falling into dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This movie has nudity, good actresses, a psyche-showering shower scene, graphic violence against women and a solid story. Some women will probably find it offensive, and sensitive people will NOT like the end, but overall this is a great little unknown movie.
