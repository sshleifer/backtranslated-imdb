This film is a lyrical and romantic memory told by the eyes of an eleven year old boy who lived in a rural Cuban city in the year of the Castro revolution. This is clearly genuine, decent work of love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are simply attempts to mistakenly advertise it as a thriller. Julia's dreams make much more sense. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO, and the revolution is just an inconvenience in everyday life and peopleâ€™s activities. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most of the works devoted to this period in the history of Cuba. <br /> <br /> The excessive use of the voice-over narrator undermines the story, but the film compensates for this by unconditional clips from Hollywood films that tell a lot more visually than the narrator could. <br /> <br /> Comparison with CINEMA PARADISO and a fair game, because the film really longs for movies, but the loser is the hidden pain of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like the movie Julie, never ends.
