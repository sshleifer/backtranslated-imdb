Red Eye is a nice little thriller for watching on Saturday night. Intense game, great villain and unexpected actions. <br /> <br /> Some may not want to watch this movie because it goes for a very short 85 minutes, and 88% of the movie is on the plane and just talking. Do not worry, they do an excellent job with a smart and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> The PG-13 movie seems to be a new basis for director Wes Craven. But, of course, he put as much violence into this thriller. <br /> <br /> The strongest place in this film is its cast. This film needed good actors to deliver dialogue and thrill. If they didn’t have these actors, the film would be lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from "Mean Girls" and "Wedding Crushers." Cillian Murphy from Batman begins 28 days later. This cast is completed by Brian Cox from the movie “X-Men 2.” <br /> <br /> There was a great pace in this movie. Just when your thoughts become boring, they throw a perversion on you. Fortunately, this is not a long film, and I do not want to. Much better than another movie about flying. <br /> <br /> Here is my comment on the flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too shabby. <br /> <br /> 8/10
