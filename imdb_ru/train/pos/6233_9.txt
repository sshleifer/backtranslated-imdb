Musically speaking, Irving Berlin gave Fred Aster and Ginger Rogers another great musical after Top Hat, if possible. Although in this case, as in that confectionery house of Jerome Kern Robert, in which they were located, “Follow the fleet” kept Randolph Scott with another singer, this time with Harriet Hilliard. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is a naval career officer, and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudeville companion who joined the navy to forget Ginger Rogers, his former partner. But now these two go ashore. Fred and Ginger study where they left off, and Randy accidentally meets Ginger Harriet's silly sister, who turns into a real beauty. But Randy is a typical love, and leave them a sailor. <br /> <br /> Again Irving Berlin wrote a stunned musical score, carefully controlling the production. Ginger makes a really outstanding vocalization with Let Your Go Go, which he and Fred then dance to. But the real hit of the show, “Let's Face the Music and Dance,” is a number made at a Navy show. “First we will face music and dance”, sung first by Astaire, and then dancing under the pair is one of the greatest romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dancing on this is absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I’m sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard, several young people may ask who it was. But they'll know right away when I mention her along with her famous husband Ozzy Nelson. That's right, Ozzy and Harriet. It's a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became the mother of David and Ricky on TV. On the other hand, she did not even keep her name. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzy nor Harriet sang on television. Ozzy was a pale imitation of Rudy Valley as a singer, but Harriet could really carry the tune. She sings "Behind you behind me," Satan, and I, and the Moon are here, but where you are, with real feeling, and with the class. I recommend that you watch “Follow the Fleet”, if only for some other reason than to hear the incredibly forgotten dimension of Harriet Hilliard today.
