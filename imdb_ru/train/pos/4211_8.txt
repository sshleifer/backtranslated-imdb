I watched it last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit that the tension in this film was unsurpassed by most other FN-era films. I liked how Chip will be calm in an instant, and then FORCE the next. It was a classic. Aaa da Ladies, Willian, cigars and gangsters! It has it all. This film delivered me all the goods. I especially liked how they mixed communism with the plot, very common for this era of cinema. Very brave, since the blacklist was popular in those days. I rate this movie as one of the best I've ever seen in the FN genre!
