I understand that many people hate this film, but I must admit that it is one of my favorites. I like it more than its predecessor, and I am happy that I like it more than many films. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I think that people never give credit to history, like “Back to the Future, Time”. It is difficult to write about travel, and in this film they included Time Travel and Spiritual Journey. <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were the best in this film, they looked cooler, acted cooler, and said cooler things. <br /> <br /> The scenic design of this film is also amazing. The sets are quite detailed and massive, and it is sometimes hard to believe that these sets were made for a film about two teenage germs that can hardly be spelled ... but isn't this the genius of the whole franchise making these two idiots more than life characters responsible for the whole utopian future of the earth. <br /> <br /> The costume design was awesome. Bill and Ted look really cool in Fake Journey, where, like in Superb Adventure, they look pretty, how would they put it, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this film is awesome, the rating especially. I have so much to say about this movie, because I love it. But this is one of those films that I grew up when I watched, and every time I did this, I liked it more, so I can understand why people hate or simply think that it is Fake compared to Excellent Adventure (which I also love, by the way). <br /> <br /> GET WITH YOUR BAD SELF !!!!
