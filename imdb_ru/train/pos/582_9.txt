out of habit, I always love to read "hated" reviews of any film. especially the one that I would like to comment on. and this is not so much a deal with counterpoint; I just like to see people talking on the other side. <br /> <br /> However, I want to dwell on one thing. many people who hated it called it, paraphrasing, “beautiful but shallow”, some even went so far as to say that the desire for the norm, but the inability to help his brother, was at best a worldly plot. <br /> <br /> I would disagree. <br /> <br /> As a brother of a sibling who has similar dysfunction, I can tell you about it. every day you see them cursing themselves, knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self-destruction. and it's not about the specifics of what they did when; how or why Paul decided to engage in gambling and socializing with dubious people; it's really more how they are related. on the one hand, they are real geniuses, and on the other, painfully self-destructive (this is very similar to people like Howard Hughes — the very same forces that drive them are the same forces that tear them apart) the time you see it, you know it, and, even worse, you understand that you cannot do anything about it. <br /> <br /> for Norman Maclean, the river flowing through him was probably the way to find the answer, why the Tragedy should have happened, and who was to blame. after all, there is no one, and often no reason. but in order to truly realize this, it takes a lot of personal pain. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it never comes at all.
