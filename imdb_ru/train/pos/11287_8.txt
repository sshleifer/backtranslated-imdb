As noted by other reviewers, this is one of the best films of Tarzan. However, unlike others, I like the beginning of the film, because it seems to me that this is a fairly accurate description of what a trading post should be. Plus, the exposure is needed so that we know why Harry wants to return to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and terrifying chase sequences ever made. This happens when the safari group of Harry has to overtake the tribe of cannibals. The values ​​of production to censorship add a lot of realism, sincerely depicting the terrible dangers that were expected of Europeans going to the jungle. The film also offers, although perhaps earlier, an accurate description of how badly the white Africans treated the Native Africans. Besides the sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some great sets and two couples! Do not miss the classic adventure.
