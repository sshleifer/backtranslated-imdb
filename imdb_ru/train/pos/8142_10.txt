Most likely, you will think that this film is incredibly stupid when you watch it for the first time. But if, by chance, you watch it for the second, third, fourth, and fifth time (I'm already in the hundreds by now), you'll find that you spit out a line here and there and break your head! My friends and I actually had a “Fear of a Black Hat” party to encourage our friends “as they say, to fight the unrest.”
