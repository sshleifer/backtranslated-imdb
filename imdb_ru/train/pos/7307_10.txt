It was “The night he came home,” warned the posters for the classic horror of John Carpenter. Being in a small American town, Halloween centers around the attempts of serial killer Michael Myers to hunt down his sister Laurie Strode and in the process destroys all her friends in rather cruel ways ... leaving poor Laurie to fight with a seemingly indestructible Michael. This plot plan inspired countless horrible forgeries during the 80s, 90s and continues to do so today, as well as the poorly accepted remake of 2007. The difference between them and this is that Halloween is the best. <br /> <br /> Made with a very modest, tight budget ... Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned a subgenre of "sexually dissolute teens pursued with a knife / ax / chainsaw / owning a psycho."
