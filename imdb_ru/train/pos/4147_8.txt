I do not think this film is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and thought it was so funny. I did not laugh for a long time during the movie. I thought the whole cast did a great job. You will laugh from the first moment to the very last scene. I suspect that some movie lovers (especially those who take themselves too seriously) will be rejected by this type of humor. Not me. The film was a real surprise. And the whole theater rolled around laughing throughout the performance I went to, and it makes me think that many people enjoyed and were happy to have a good time at the cinema for a change. I can't wait to see it again! If you are in the mood lol, then this is for you. Funny funny funny funny!
