This is a strange film for me, because after I watched a good film from a new director (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and watch his film THE CURE, I don’t watch movies this way, but damn it, I love shorts and can’t wait to see others. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, as it turned out, I liked THE CURE, I was not thrilled with it, and let Japhre know. To his credit, he urged me to reconsider it in any case - by giving my honest assessment. <br /> <br /> The film has a stunning style, and, from the point of view of director Jafri, it is exceptional - especially for such an inexperienced film. creator (this is his first movie). The combination of an exceptional selection of color, tempo and music that was well suited to the film created an excellent sense of atmosphere. You are really involved in the film, and this is a merit in making the film. However, what I disliked was part of the writing. While the basic idea was great, the ending was too easy to foresee. I would really like the final if it were a surprise or an unexpected turn. However, given that this film is from someone who should not be able to make such a professional film, given his experience, it foreshadows his future. Good job.
