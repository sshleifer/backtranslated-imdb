I love this movie songs and storylines very fun. and the song "goodbye" always excites me. what a wonderful thing to make puppets alive, in such a way that you really care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever great voices and talent. why were all the other mappet films that were released after that so less interesting, touching and funny? is that mr. Did Henson just miss you so much?
