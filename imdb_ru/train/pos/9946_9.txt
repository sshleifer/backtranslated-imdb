Dream Quest was an amazingly good movie. There were some noticeable nonsense, but this can be expected in a film like this that was made in such a short time. I did not feel any desire to fast forward during the film, and I found it quite interesting. Sometimes it is stupid, but in general I recommend it. They probably used all the glitz in nearby stores, and some of the costumes were pretty good.
