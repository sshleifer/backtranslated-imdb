Of course, one of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best films ever made anywhere. Screenplay, cinematography, directing and acting in the classroom on their own. This film works on many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Never been shown on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly shown at the National Cinema in London in crowded rooms?
