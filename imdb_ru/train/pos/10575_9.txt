Fast paced, fun, sexy and entertaining. Cagney is always awesome. Blondel fascinates you with its wit and energy. Obviously, this is a pre-censored film due to the understatement of the script, costumes and how they relate to each other. And bikini, before that there were bikini! This does not prohibit fun for everyone. I do not understand the problem of John Garfield, though. Does it matter if he is in this film? If he is, he has such a short screen that he is basically a prop. You should watch this frame by frame to even find it if it is there. I'm a big fan of Cagney, but I've never seen this before. I found this on Turner's Classic. I found this by pure chance. Relax and enjoy the ride!
