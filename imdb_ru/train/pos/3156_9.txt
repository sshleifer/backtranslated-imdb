Like the characters in this show, I was also a teenager in the 70s. Producers really survived the whole spirit of the time to being a teenager in the suburbs in the 70s. The 70s fashion, cars, interior items, food and fads are all very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show features a very talented ensemble that is very well shot together on camera. I really like the unique, psychedelic movie styles. No other show gives such camera tricks. These cutting-edge film sequences really help convey a fashionable style typical of the 70s era. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very funny comedy series. One thing that worries me about this show is that it is overly dependent on cruel humor to make you laugh. So, I think this show is too much like Married with Children. While Married with Children is a great comedy series in and of itself, it's a pity that the creators of the 70s show continue to try to emulate him. <br /> <br /> I recommend the 70s show, mainly due to nostalgia. This could even be a better show if the authors relied more on witty dialogue, and not on obscene, tasteless jokes and practical jokes.
