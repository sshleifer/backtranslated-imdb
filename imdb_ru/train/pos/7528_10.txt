If this film hits you (like us, and, obviously, others leaving the theater) as depressingly thin, it may be because the topic itself is a little disappointing. The film truly represents us to Betty Page, which she probably was: playful, almost innocent from the rural South, whose “Queen of the Universe movie star” career was just silly, natural fun for her. Her possible moral doubts, religious appeal, and a sudden deviation from nude and unwilling modeling are biographically accurate, but difficult to understand, considering how carefree she was with her life. <br /> <br /> There are many reasons to watch this film, even if Last but not least is the amazing black and white cinematography of V. Mott Hopfel III (complete with old-fashioned napkins and disintegrating), true game of the 1950s starring the cast of Mary Harron, some of our most brilliant performances include the most underrated support actors (including Chris Bauer, Lily Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak); Hen Mall. <br /> <br /> Ms. Mole shoots several scenes completely naked and most of the others in amazing historical lingerie and “special” costumes (superbly assembled by costume designer John A. Dunn), but she surprisingly supports the unexplored pleasure of Betty Page your lush body. Looking at Miss Mol as Miss Page, a beginning actress, passing more and less “bad” auditions and student acting scenes, is to see a really beautiful actress who fully controls her skills. <br /> <br /> the script cannot effectively lead us to 1950 America, where in childhood sexual abuse, lawless abductions and rapes, and the legal repression of pornography brands that today seem ridiculously tame, is a reality. New York 50s caused by the continuous shooting of news clips. Miami 50s come to life in a super-saturated color in the style of 16mm. The real Betty Page seems to be running, smiling and posing in front of us, and yet the effect is strangely light, hardly obscene and not at all dangerous. <br /> <br /> How strange it is that the greatest icon of bondage lacks poison and that this technically excellent biographical film should have so little bite.
