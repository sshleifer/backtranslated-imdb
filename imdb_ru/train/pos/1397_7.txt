“Coastal Outlet” is basically an adventure in Star Trek. There is nothing wrong with this episode. I just think that this is not the best idea of ​​what the show should have offered to fans. It is easy entertainment, nothing more. Nevertheless, I am glad to see that this type of TV show had enough common sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his team some free time, and the landing party goes to a planet that looks like the perfect place to rest. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems. There are some action and tense moments, but most of the story is played out for a laugh. Good, but unusual.
