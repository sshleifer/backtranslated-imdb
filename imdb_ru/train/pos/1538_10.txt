This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is because I live a few miles from the village where this story took place, and I know how things are going in this area in Sweden. The film is telling the truth, believe me! He simultaneously criticizes and respects the lifestyle of Dalarna, and the producer wants the people who are watching the film to be more open and to take care of your closest friends and relatives. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village, anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you will probably also learn a lot from this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Maria Blom!
