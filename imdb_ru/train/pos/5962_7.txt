I have seen a lot of "80s horror rockers" over the years, from rubbish such as "Terror on Tour" to funny funny gems like Slumber Party Massacre 2. Somehow I managed to postpone it, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and well received. Well, I finally caught up with him, and he is undoubtedly the best of this terrible (but almost always charming) subgenre. The plot (which was largely filmed in the movie "Black Roses") concerns a ridiculous inconsistency named Eddie, who was ridiculed by everyone in his high school for his musical taste. He loves the metal of the 80s, especially his idol Sammy Kerr (played by the late great Tony Fields.) After Sammy was killed, radio favorite DJ Eddy gives him the latest recording of Sammy. As soon as Eddie plays the recording backwards, he discovers that he is a bit tougher, and bad things start to happen to those who scoff at him. Is Sammy music obsessed? "Trick or Treat" is well made and full of cry. The special effects are awesome, although it contains typical laser beams from the 80s. I grew up in the 80s, and although I was not a fan of heavy metal, I remember the urban legend about playing the record back after hearing the sounds of the worship of Satan. Haha I also remember how my older brothers and sisters said that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it’s very funny to see that they both make cameos as a harmless radio DJ and anti-rock priest. If only I had seen this film in childhood! Although the film seems to ridicule the connection between supposed devil worship and heavy metal that was popular in the 1980s, the viewer won’t know why Sammy Kerr came back from the dead, creating havoc and killing anyone who bothers him. This is the weakest point in the film, but if you don’t notice it, it's a lot of fun.
