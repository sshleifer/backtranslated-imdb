Great story about teenagers, leaders, school football "stars". How far will you go to protect your friends? To lie, to kill? How much can you lose if you study an innocent girl? Can love exceed all chances? Can you beat the narrow-minded people from a small town? When your friend scores and you “lose,” you will do everything in her power to make her pay for it, or will you be a man in this and respect her right to choose? Will you rape her and show it with your victory over the “problem” girl? Can you support someone who has the only sin - to have their own opinion, to be able to make their own decisions, to choose for themselves? It made me think twice before expressing my opinion about who was right and who was not, but one thing is for sure - a very disturbing film and a theme in general. Thumbs up!
