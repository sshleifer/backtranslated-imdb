I still liked it though. Warren Beatty is only honest as a comic book hero. What saves this film is the film set, the incredible cast and the passage of the mediocre script. I really expected something more substantial in terms of action or plot, but I received very little. The main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest Hollywood stars at the time in such an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> One of those who did a terrible job and didn’t even participate in this film was Madonna. She did not participate in this film, and her acting work was rather bad. The film in some moments just stood still. You expected something more and received nothing. Al Pacino plays a very bad dude, and he plays well. He and Beatty are a great good guy and a bad guy. <br /> <br /> It’s also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a film different from Istar. I did not see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. The fact is that the film is good, but it could have been much better. I liked it when I was a kid, because I thought it looked cool, and visually the film is awesome, the scenery is incredible, the script is just honest, and with the cast in the film I would expect a little better. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> Especially it seemed to me that the final was not big enough. It was interesting, but for such a grand film I just thought that it could have ended with a little big blow. The reason for watching this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only 7 colors of comics, which makes it even more excellent visually. <br /> <br /> The costumes and makeup were also flawless. The makeup for the villains was great. Beatty is simply not up to such a larger than vital character. Nevertheless, this is a good film, which could be much more. This is better for me than Batman, another comic book adaptation that came out almost at the same time. Of course, this film was much bigger in terms of gross.
