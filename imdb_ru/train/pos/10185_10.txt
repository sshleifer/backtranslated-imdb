Watching this movie was the most fun thing I've ever seen in a movie. However, I cannot say whether this is a good film or a bad one, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. In this picture there is everything that any film can have. It has the features of a romantic comedy, political commentary, thriller, drama, action movie, musical and an absurdist self-conscious film. This is all that complements the myth. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is about the Indian couple Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), happily living in Canada, who rush to India to visit her husband's parents after disturbing news. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple finds themselves at the center of a fratricidal violence plot. At some point, the story is borrowed from “Not without my child”, but calling Shakti a remake of something would be unfair. <br /> <br /> Allegedly, the storyline is pushed back into the background by a number of amazing breaks, including Shah Rukh Khan’s dream of Aishwarya Paradise, which seems to come from another film. In fact, two stars on all the posters, but they appear in the film very late, and only Shah Rukh turns out to be a real character. However, he completes this with an energetic and truly unexpected presentation. <br /> <br /> Karisma Kapoor is the biggest part of the work in this film, and she does a wonderful job linking the turns of the film. and turns with a demonstration of plausible emotions. Another known presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of Shekhar’s husband. Nana Patekar dominates each scene in which he plays, with a scary but nuanced character. <br /> <br /> The film is not without realism. Violence is rampant, but the violence perpetrated by most female characters, when Karishma is severely beaten several times, is truly alarming. Sometimes this violence is clearly disturbing, but in the end it becomes surrealistic, since each dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the total effect is nothing else but catharsis. <br /> <br /> I have seen Bollywood's share of releases, mixing genres and incredible plot resolutions are definitely their norm. But "Shakti" raises the bar, absorbing even more masala, without becoming ridiculous. This is a film that achieves the greatness of Shakespeare's tragedy, where the audience of the crowd and the royal family are equally entertained. This is a clean, free movie theater, and the director Krishna Wamsi must have dreamed of having a good time inserting every trick in the book. Perhaps the most important message of violence that engenders violence, and the inspiring degree of maternal love were not my thoughts, but I came out of what I was watching “Shakti” in delight. Making movies can be the most fun in the world!
