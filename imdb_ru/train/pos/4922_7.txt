Interestingly, the audience thought of the day when they first saw Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Of course, he looks like no one else at the time, with a skull-like face, a flattened nose and an elongated body - even now he remains a disturbing presence. And what could be more appropriate than his appearance from these dirty slums of New Orleans, which seem to fester like the plague that Blacks are losing in the city. I just wish he had more scenes. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very skillfully assembled ?? Morgue's black humor, Widmark and Douglas interaction, non-touristic locations, battles between officials - all this is woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a threat, unlike others at the time. Even Widmarkâ€™s home scenes that put a woman (Bel Geddes) on a tent cannot be too destructive. The director of Kazan clearly demonstrates his propensity to lead studio products (Fox), regardless of what he may have felt with regard to the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark is doing his modest job well as a public health officer. But my money is for a single Zero Mostel. Has there ever been a more performing performer who could scream louder or push more than a bulky falling guy (for example, Enforcer, 1950). The scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Moslel's astute wife (Liswood), is the jewel of insane submission, as Mostel tries to reassure everyone like some kind of crazy pinball. It is a pity that he lost so many years in the black list. (I wonder if smug Kazan called it?) <br /> <br /> But not only professionals add color. Locals add both character and authenticity, especially two Asian guys polled by the police. The whole scene has an improvised look, as if Kazan realized their potential and created an elegant scene on the spot. In addition, this colorful recruitment hall with all decks of hands is pure inspiration. What about those bitten cafe fleas in which I run to the nearest Danny? <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is still well thought out, an exciting thriller with an apocalyptic look that strangely foreshadows many of today's megalopolises. -hits
