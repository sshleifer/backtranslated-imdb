Serious comedy. The French prediction of the French play Les Joies de la famille produced by Ross Hunter (later Americanized as Very Rich Woman) is a smart, well-played, sometimes funny ... and, unfortunately, timeless. A wealthy Californian widow, who seems to be taking away her money, is sent on the railroad from her two adult, greedy daughters, who fear that Rosieâ€™s mother casually spends her inheritance. The whole question of a vital, but elderly woman sent to a rest home against her will, and then having to prove her responsibility at the court hearing, is offensive material for the comedy (and his merit, directed by David Lowell Rich, does not overload the picture with rude jokes or obvious feelings ). Some of the humor is a bit wide and does not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the seriousness of this scenario and never falls into a false note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter, and James Farentino is a very young lawyer. The film talks so much about the importance of our seniors and how they prefer to spend the rest of their time, that the seriousness of the Rosie theme is almost lost in the pursuit of a happy ending. The picture makes you smile - and at the same time wonder how many older women who have never been so lucky. *** from ****
