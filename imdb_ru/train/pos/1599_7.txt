"Moonstruck" is a beautiful little movie made by the wonderful storyteller Norman Javison (In the heat of the night, Fiddler on the roof, Hurricane). The film is great on many levels. It shows a good bit of Italian culture, has a touching novel, and (best of all) is a funny comedy. <br /> <br /> In the film I liked the relative unconventional appearance of the actors most of all. Nicolas Cage looks weirdly positive for most of the film, and Cher ... well, Cher always looks a little weird. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie and easy to recommend. <br /> 7.4 out of 10
