David Duchovny creates a role that he had to replicate in California â€” a problematic talent. And he plays this role well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts with good speed and brings you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a beautiful villain, and Angelina Jolie blows. The history of the disgraced doctor who got into the criminal world is well written. Drug addiction and the desire for sultry Jolie to mix non-alcoholic cocktail. Unfortunately, by the end of the story becomes a little weaker, and the relationship between the villains and the FBI entangled and torn, as if it was created only for the development of the final scene. But besides that, it's worth watching a movie.
