The shooting is pleasant and the setting is very realistic. I liked that he boldly distorts ideas about the many difficult moral and social problems of the rural areas of mainland China of the 1930s, as well as about simpler human issues — I felt I could get a real idea of ​​the time recreated even in the magnificent frames of traditional Chinese theater and in purist images of street life. It seemed worth a try. The interconnected role that Buddhism plays is probably the most correct in form — in its devilish and philosophical aspects, perhaps the most effective one I saw in a Chinese film. Casting is great. Images are remembered. Act quite solidly. Thematically childish, but still rich enough to complement the means of expression.
