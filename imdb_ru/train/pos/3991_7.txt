“If I sit down, I will never get up again,” says the mother (one of the names) to her son, when he tells her to rest for a bit (she was simply widowed). He means that rest is what a woman of his age should do and in her situation: rest in peace, neglect herself. But she is not in the mood for "rest." She also has a daughter who blames her for every calamity in her life ... Suddenly comes a revelation: sex and passion in the form of a muscular carpenter who is 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the newcomer James Bond) when she "thought no one ever touches her again. " This is a story that makes you think about many things, especially what a woman should do with life when her husband dies. It does not seem that we have put forward such in these aspects. I mean, no one wonders when Sean Connery has a romance in a film with Catherine Zeta-Jones ... but what would you think if that were different? Old woman, young guy ... no, you are not ready for this, are you? <br /> <br /> In the film there are intimate tones along the entire length, with the exception of 2 or 3 episodes in which this will sound tonality, and several obvious and disgusting dialogues will be released. These vulgar touches and how the son and daughter learn about their mother's love (quite absurdly — you will understand what I mean when you look at her) are the only contradictory elements in Mother. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
