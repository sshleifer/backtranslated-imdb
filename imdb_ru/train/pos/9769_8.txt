I enjoyed it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I am also partial to Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the fascination of dinosaurs. I read for fun, but when I feel overworked or really dying, I watch TV and movies to run away. Theodore Rex allowed me to do this. This makes it a success in my eyes! I didn’t even leave to do something else while he was running. Whether it was rated as “good” or not, it does not matter to me. And no, I'm not underage. I'm not a moron either.
