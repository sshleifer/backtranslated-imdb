This wonderful film can be brought very easily. First of all, although the comparison with the "Princess-Bride" is inevitable, it is almost useless. Although both films combine wit and humor with a fabulous backdrop, Stardust is very different from any other sci-fi / sci-fi film I've ever seen. This is such a hybrid of these genres, but its plot and script are so unique that — along with performances, special effects, cinematography and musical score — the finished product is simply not comparable to everything that has ever appeared on the Silver Screen. Secondly, the score is very effective for simultaneously drawing us into the story and fantasy world in which it takes place and for advancing the plot, while creating the necessary amount of fear and excitement necessary for the magic to become believable in the area where the characters exist . Thirdly, I did not find that the film is even remotely difficult to understand or any confusion. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main plots actually made it even more attractive to watch. Wonderfully cast and works great in all directions. This fantastic adventure (with elements of science fiction) was the best I've ever seen since the Return of the King (not that I compared them at all). Okay, so it's not so easy to summarize, but don't let any rude and / or heartless and cynical review, nor the pitiful PR of the film prevent you from taking part in the best time you could have in movies this summer (or perhaps for a long time)!
