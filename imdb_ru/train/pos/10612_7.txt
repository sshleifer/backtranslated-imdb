It's stupid, it's creepy, it's rude, but it makes it so fun. It went through the best melodramatic moments that are ridiculous. This movie is a great joke. Rent it to laugh. <br /> <br /> The film tells about three female speakers, while in front of mobile phones. They go to a small town to light the festival, but they don’t have enough space to sleep. And then they meet Ernest Keller. He is a terrible in a sense psycho. And he invites them to stay at his home. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst’s play is so amazing, like Invisible, that he really wears this film. Most of the film is rather boring, although finding out the truth about Ernest's family is quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Just seeing this cast in these scenes is worth seeing. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make pleasant eye candy. <br /> <br /> I think the film is an old gem that is hard to find and worth seeing.
