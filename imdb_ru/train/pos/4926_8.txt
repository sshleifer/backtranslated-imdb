Eliya Kazan, one of the best directors of this country, showed that he is equally well versed in movies. With “Panic on the Streets,” Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what will happen later, perhaps with his masterpiece On the Embankment, although both films have only a water situation because they have different visions of different objects. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan is shooting at a location in New Orleans. Adaptation of Daniel Fuchs to the stories about Edna and Edward Anhalt, which formed the basis of the film, is remarkable because it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting the “Big World”. One of the main advantages of this film is Joseph MacDonald’s magnificent black and white cinematography, which features New Orleans at its best. In addition, the music of Alfred Newman and the song of Billie Holiday give a pleasant touch to the process. <br /> <br /> This film may have been filmed in New York or another northern major city, because it presents us with characters who speak more like “broclines” than maybe a southern accent that can hear in this part of the country. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows that Jack Palance, making his debut on the screen, smolders every time the screen sees everyone. He was so intense! At the same time, this cool guy shows his tender side when he goes to visit his sick partner, who is unknown to him, struck by a deadly disease. Blackie, comforts this man, caressing his sweaty face and running his hands through the dying man's greasy hair. Also noteworthy is the fact that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seem to have done their own stunts, which is very refreshing, because both actors make it real. <br /> <br /> The film also has a normal side with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We see how the family man paints the furniture with his little son. Later, he and his wife discuss how it turns out that they cannot make ends meet with his salary, which many families have to face daily. Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, like a wife, sounds like she is a Connecticut suburban. <br /> <br /> The film is a pleasure thanks to the direction of Mr. Kazan and the excellent acting role in the film.
