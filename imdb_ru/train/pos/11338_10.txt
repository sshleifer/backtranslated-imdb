I saw it in Dancing with the Movies, and it was awesome. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only your parents get divorced, but the monster is after you. <br /> <br /> It was both soulful and scary - there were a few moments when viewers screamed in fear. It reminded me of a Japanese horror film, except that this story was really good. <br /> <br /> And this is what distinguished Jake's Wardrobe from the usual Indie-Film - an excellent script with convincing characters. In addition, by mixing elements of a horror movie with family drama, the movie gets the best of both genres and avoids the clichés of both. <br /> <br /> If he doesn’t go out in theaters, be sure to buy a DVD,
