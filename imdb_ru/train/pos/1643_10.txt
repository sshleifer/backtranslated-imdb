This is a movie that everyone should watch if you want to see a great game. Mr. Thorn and Miss Farrell do an outstanding job. I think they have to show it on TV again so that the new audience can enjoy it. Great views. <br /> <br /> This gives you a real idea of ​​what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally. Great unheard of film. <br /> <br /> This was done when Miss Farrell was very young. I always thought of her as a comedian, but this, of course, is not a comedy, but she is just wonderful. There are very few dialogs, but this only makes them more real. Mr. Thorn, as always, is magnificently present, and his breathing makes him feel strong. I have to see the movie.
