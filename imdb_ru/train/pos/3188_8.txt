I had almost the worst day of my life. Then I stumbled upon this cute film, watched it, and now I am ready to go out and kiss a street lamp. <br /> <br /> I confess that I only watched it for two reasons: LEGS BELIEVE-ELLEN, But this is really much more. The plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its delightful misunderstandings. And, of course, there is ... FEET VERA-ELLEN. <br /> <br /> The only unpleasant aspect of this film is that the version I bought (100 Family Classics collection from Mill Creek Entertainment) is not I have the best video quality, and I heard the same thing about the release of Alpha. The brightness and contrast are too high, so many scenes seem to be discolored, especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I believe that you can mess with the management of your TV to compensate for this. I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen in the distant 51 year. Stage decorations, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling and delightfully eerie - as in the style of Dr. Caligari's Cabinet. <br /> <br /> As for romance, itâ€™s just perfect. Not juicy, not contrived, not melodramatic. Just 100% ahhhhhh. Sorry, poor things, your miserable lives will never be so charming. Har Har Wait for me to laugh? My life sucks as bad as yours. Oh shit. Time to watch this movie again.
