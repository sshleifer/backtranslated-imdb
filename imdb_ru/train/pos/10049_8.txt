I am not a parent or a man. But I was able to identify myself with the heartache and pain of each character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teens should watch. Maybe in this way they will again begin to appreciate the value of the family. I apologize for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. And it is very nice to see Ben Affleck, 19, who is laid out in a touching and sincere performance. At an early age, he showed that he was capable of spiritual drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Pay attention to Hollywood ... his first major role in recent years, and he went out and won the title of Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film will be appreciated by people of all ages. Perhaps children under the age of 10 should not be watched, because they may be afraid that the same thing can happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it with friends many times. Because he portrays the values ​​that are important in life.
