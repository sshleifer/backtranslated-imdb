In my opinion, “Guy” is a funny, witty, sexy, romantic and absolutely beautiful film about tiptoes, which the guys will also like. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles are blinded like a bewildered groom and his future sexy cousin. If you ask me, they lit up the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before finishing, I would like to say that the performances were top notch, the direction was impeccable, the production design was good, the casting was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, to anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this film. You will find a lot of laughter and thrills, so, go to the video store, rent or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
