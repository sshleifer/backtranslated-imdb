Broadway and film actor, directed by John Cassavetes (from the film “Baby Rosemary”), creates a masterpiece from this film in 1977. It starred Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondel, Paul Stewart, Zora Lampert, Laura Johnson, and also a cameo by Peter Falk. The premise of the film: an aging theater actress (Gene Rowlands) overestimates her life after a fan dies in a car accident, trying to get her autograph. The film has a slow tempo and a gloomy, naughty, frightening quality. He has a cinematic look of the 60s and even reminded me of a child Rosemary Polanski without supernatural horror. There are fears that every successful actress has - she grows old and she becomes useless in her career. In addition, she feels that she has lived a life in which there is a lack of true spirituality, humanity and dignity. She lived only for the sake of her career - she has no children, she does not engage in charity, etc. Gradual disintegration of her personality is the main thing in this film. She falls apart. She is in crisis. Gene Rowlands really penetrates the character's tormented psyche and plays a role quite well. She is an amazing actress, and this 70s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and / or disaster films or adventure thrillers. This is a film with a lot of deep emotions, but with a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes is criticizing the main films and actors of the 70s generation. Either that or this film is a product of the 70s, which in itself was cynical in many respects - Nixon deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values ​​are not great and this film is not very well known, it is a very intrusive with haunting moods. Kudos to the underestimated and deceased director Cassavetes, who died in the late 80s.
