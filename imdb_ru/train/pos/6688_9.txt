In the history of films based on comics, “Mystery Men” is one of the most underrated. This is no ordinary comic movie about superheroes! It follows the exploits of a team of benevolent imitators, including Mr. Forrius (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Jane Garofalo), Spade (William H. Macy), Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) and Spleen (Paul Rubens). "Mysterious People" fake several aspects of superhero movies, such as Superman or Batman, such as informative remarks and questions about secret personalities. Most superheroes are not billionaires, like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar workers who do dirty work and neurotic home lives. Thus, it seems that the director Kink Asher turns the heroes into something that the average viewer can relate to. I found that the Mystery Men were visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it does not turn into a franchise, it is still a joy to watch!
