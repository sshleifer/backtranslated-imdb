Does anyone know where and how I can get a copy of this movie? !! I have been looking for too long, to help someone! Back in 1997, my friends and I were extras in this film based on Long Island, and we never actually saw it. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping that I could find a copy to finally check it out and share it with the girls! Is there anyone who knows where to get this copy, so I can stop reducing myself crazy? (besides, it doesn't matter if it's in VHS format, I'm still in the ice age.) If you or any of your acquaintances have a copy of this film, please help, I would be willing to pay for good copy of it!
