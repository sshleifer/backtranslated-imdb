Unlike some comments, my positive. This film takes place at the dinner table with a group of friends, someone likes it, someone does not. Several relatives - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not smooth, satisfied with everyone and everything, type of life - much like in real life. Some storylines do not develop, they just happen. But, like real families and good friends, they stick together. Parents who want to buy a child, such holes! You are happy for the end. Poor Delmar was stuck between a stone and a boulder, taking care of himself, his mother, son and trying to save his whole life together. It does not end with a walk at sunset or a house in houses, and everyone lives in a dream world, but it is a very real depiction of people living day by day, month after month. Overall, this is a good story and a great movie!
