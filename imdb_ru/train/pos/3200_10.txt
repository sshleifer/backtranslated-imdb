This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film tells how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the main screenwriter of the show and his buddies Ricky and Bubbles play it perfectly in a true satirical outlook on life in the trailer parks and inhabitants of these dirty hubcaps make their more advanced forays into the world of crime. WHY and the reasons for everything will be a spoiler, so I won't give the real reasons for their more brilliant antics. Their friend and often time partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole performance is great, and the lack of a film will in no way affect how you watch the sitcom. This is a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire about life in a trailer park and little scammers with little ideas of the time, but big dreams. If you have the opportunity to see - buy - steal this program, take it. You will not regret it. And my American friends will break you too. 10 of 9. Brilliant. TV, as the TV should be.
