I saw this movie when I was traveling in Brazil. It was difficult for me to really understand the Brazilian culture and society, because there are so many regional and class differences in it. Watching this movie in Sao Paulo was a revelation in itself. This shows something from the daily life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, it sometimes dramatizes a little. And this is the only negative comment I have on this movie. Sometimes it's too much, too much sex, too much murder, and too much cynicism for one movie. The director could shoot some things a little more subtly, it would make the film more effective. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I liked the film and how the story unfolds. Characters are complex and very similar to real people. Not cute American actors and actresses with a lot of makeup, but people who can be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the film realistic, even if the story is not so convincing.
