It has been about 50 years since the film about romance and mysticism was made. I can only recall two films: Enchanted April (1992) and Enchanted Cottage (1945). Both films used great actors, not stars. In both films, all the actors gave their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> “Enchanted April” is about four Englishwomen after World War I, who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation. The amazing "Enchanted April" was made in 1992. He stands out as a nice classic.
