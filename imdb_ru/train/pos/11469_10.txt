Everyone knows about this event "Zero Day". What I think this film did that Elephant didn't do is that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their life for about a year. Throughout the film, we like them, laugh at them, although we know what they are going to do. And it gives me a chill. Because I felt guilty about their comments, and I just thought that Cal was a nice guy. Although I KNEW what would happen, you know? Even at the end of the film, when they were going to commit suicide and simply decide whether they did it at the expense of 3 or 4, I thought it was funny, but still I was horrified to see that their heads were torn off. Of course it was. I have to love them. Perhaps they were evil, but I felt that they were really normal guys, that they really did not realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> This, IMO, is the main strength of this film. It makes us realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone else, can plan for something crazy, and that we will not even notice it. This film, no matter how good it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can't go to sleep right now. I still have this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies
