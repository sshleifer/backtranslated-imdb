The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite wellness movies. I first saw him when he was a Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall, when he first appeared and loved him since. In the end, I saw him 6 times in cinemas, and if he played today, I would watch him again. <br /> <br /> Now many reviews mention remarkable presentations by presenters. Mattau was great, but he was unlucky to be nominated for Jack Nicholson's Oscar play by Randall P. McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Burns won, although Richard Bendzhiman deserved at least to be nominated. The roles were perfected, such as listening to Fritz Feld in an ad for potato chips. <br /> <br /> In this regard, I decided to revise this film, guided by the extremely undervalued Herbert Ross. Ross, who had previously brought two people playing Owl and Pussy to the screen and making a complete movie out of it, does it again. He opens the plays without making them look like a photographic scene. He throws out the plot and characters. <br /> <br /> Here we have 20 minutes before we get to the stage, which opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about a special comedy. play for the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is completely new. A few years ago, I saw a play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall on the Broadway revival, which was great. But I think that Ross and screenwriter, playwright Simon improved it. This is just a great movie.
