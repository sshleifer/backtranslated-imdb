This Night Listener is better than what people usually say. He has weaknesses, and he seems to be experiencing a crisis of genre identity, but I think that his creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for it. It all looks like one of those fireplaces: “It happened to a friend of my friend.” - ghost stories. One big complaint about the film is the pace, but a slow, and sometimes awkward, deliberate step. Everything that unfolds in this film is well kept within the limits of the possible, and real life is just like vanity. So there are no bright endings, no startling revelations, no “opening” scenes. Thank God When you watch this movie, you should get to the zone, forget about booking and what makes (conditionally) a good movie. Williams is not terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character should be somewhat general (“Nobody”), since he is “Everyone,” the avatar with which we ourselves enter the story. Tony Collett's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (even if she may not have to win it). Give him a chance. In terms of quality and content, Night Listener is undoubtedly one of twenty percent of the films that are released today.
