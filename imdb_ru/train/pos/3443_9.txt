An irresistible, honest, brash and unforgettable psychological horror film, which tells about the painful experiences of pain caused by rape. “Descent” is a film that went out of control due to its insufficient distribution, because, frankly, the film is so cruel in its images that, if it were released theatrically, it could have run into strong prejudiced hatred. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be revealed not only by dark themes and not only for its amazing direction and authentic style - but most of all for its performances. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning, bringing enough disease and vulnerability to make him not to be related to himself, but to understand this broken man with a distorted look at his sexuality, not only with the women he rapes, but also with fragile self-doubt. This is an ancillary work that is so complex, daring and emotional on the part of Faust. And hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, an outstanding one is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. Tour de force of realistic dramatic ticks and one of the most subtle, but loud, as it may be, performances for a long time. While Dawson can be seen in some good auxiliary views in some films with poor treatment, she proves here that she has everything that is needed to deliver emotionally stunning and touching performances, plausibly and thematically. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of his year (and the year 2007 was strong) - if this underestimated and clever film had fallen into a theatrical release, I would have shouted praises for him, as well as Dawson and Faust. It is a pity that it was too stupid for wide circulation. Such films deserve better!
