******* SPOILER! ******** <br /> <br /> I saw this gr8 film a few years ago, it's a beautiful story about a young guy who wants to drink his mother's milk at the breast, but she thinks he should be old of this. he ends up craving other women's breasts and ending up competing with his brother, who loves her. Throw the jealous husband of this woman who cannot “wake up,” and you have a bold, but warm story about love, friendship and beautiful pairs of pitchers, hehe. <br /> <br /> its brilliant <br /> <br /> do not postpone the subtitle hehe!
