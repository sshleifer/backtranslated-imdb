In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves the poker game, winning a little criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldy (Guy Tomajan), who were killed by Blacks, are chasing him, and his body is thrown into the sea. During the autopsy, family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Public Health Service discovered that a dead person had a pneumonic plague caused by rats, and he needed to find out who had any contact with a person in for forty years. Eight hours to escape the epidemic. The mayor of the city instructs the skeptical captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint find the killers infected with the plague and plant them. <br /> <br /> “Panic on the streets” reveals a simple story, but it’s still effective and with a big villain. The exciting plot is not outdated after fifty-seven years. In his debut, Jack Palance performs disgusting scum, and camera work, while he tries to escape from the Zero Mostel, is still very impressive. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Pânico nas Ruas” (“Panic in the streets”)
