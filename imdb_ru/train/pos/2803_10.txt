As a former two-time world champion in Okinawan karate, I like movies about casualties for the sake of sport. But this film is about much more. This film is so good and deep. I have recently been plagued by a very serious injury and an almost complete lack of passion. Almost light to me. And this stupid little film touched me so deeply that, as if stunned, it reminded me of what life is. This is a film about life. Live your life for yourself and respect others. Empowerment. God bless "Beat the Beckham." I believe that this is a real gem.
