This is a very good Spanish film, but I’m worried that many will feel lost there, because many around the world have no idea what the civil war in Spain is and when it was fought. As a history teacher, I had a big advantage, but I could easily understand how a movie can be confusing until you get all the pieces together. I doubt that this will be a big problem in Spain where this film was made, but for other viewers they may be a bit confused until late in the film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with 12-year-old Carol and her mother returns to her mother’s hometown. Years passed, and you realized that they were coming to Spain from New York. Despite the strangeness, Carol speaks quite well in Spanish, and most of the film talks about how she adapts. As for why she and her mother are alone, I will tell about it now to those who do not understand that Father Carol is fighting in the war on the Republican side (who ultimately lost in this very bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The film received exceptional marks for its excellent camera performance and music. A rather slow and awkward pace is not bad if you are the one who can accept films in this way. I have seen several other Spanish films about this war, and this compares quite well with them - no better and no worse - just a decent fragment of a life movie about those left behind, as well as a good film about coming of age. /> <br /> PS - If you don’t know which side, the Republicans were mostly socialists, they were supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as volunteers from many countries (including the United States). The nationalists were led by Franco and were assisted by Portugal and the fascist states of Germany and Italy.
