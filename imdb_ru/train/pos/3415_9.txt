This movie was awesome. This is an inspirational film work. The characters are fully developed thanks to the truth that director Lucy Walker brings to the film. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for this special film that shows humanity in a human condition. Lucy Vlaker demonstrates the beauty of the landscape. This film is a true example of a man against nature, and sometimes a man against man. Inner turmoil and triumph are huge in their subject matter. The topic of how Tibetans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker spoke the voice of Eric Weichenmeyer when it was not usually heard. Thank you, Lucy, for being true to your vision as a director.
