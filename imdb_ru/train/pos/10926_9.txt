If you love kung fu movies and have not seen this movie, you are fooling yourself. This film is one of the cheapest kung fu that can be recommended to fans of all types of films. Usually, to see something in these films, you need to be a devoted fan of the genre, but thatâ€™s it! The story is well told and completed. The fight scenes are great and tend to end before they get bored (unlike the Prowling Tiger). Add a little mystery and torture, and you get a damn good movie. Watch it at all costs. Damn, my wife even liked it. <br /> <br /> Do doo it! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
