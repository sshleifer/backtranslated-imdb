First, this movie was not released to the cinema (PROVEN THE BAD THAT THEY SAY), I say that they came up with a story about how scammers, politicians and devoted people of newspapers were killed, just send it to DVD and cable TV money and run. <br /> <br /> As they say, I usually like movies of this type, especially with that title. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLC. Jule, Carey Elway, John Hurd, and also on the side of the tap, Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> The plot and the story were made to death, BUT the above cast brings life to this cruel film, and it really is watchable. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is good as a devoted young reporter for a one-time newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman. The rest are either crooked policemen and politicians, or some decent guys. Two ladies - friends LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and do what is required, it is quite cruel, a lot of murders, etc., not for children. In no case is not a great film, but for the fact that he is and the actors. This is definitely good, <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
