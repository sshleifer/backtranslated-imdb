In general, I would say that I liked the movie. Some fighting scenes are really good. Especially the fight with Leung Ka-Yang. One thing that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During the battle scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor laughing. Otherwise, Sammo perfectly copies the fighting of Bruce Lee. 5 out of 10 stars.
