This animated series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works. Yes, this is biology, but they will never say that it is. <br /> <br /> I really believe that this is the best part of this stream of "educational cartoons." I remember that you can find small books and a plastic body in several parts: the skin, the skeleton and, of course, the organs. <br /> <br /> In the same stream you will find: “homme”, which link the history of mankind from the Big Bang to the 20th century. There is also “Il était une fois l'espace” (about the cosmos and its explorations), but this is more of an invention than a description of reality, as this happens in the future.
