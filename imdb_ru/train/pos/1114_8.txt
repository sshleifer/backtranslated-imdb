At that time, I remember being amazed by this movie. I called it the most important film I've seen in ten years, and I ran into people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusually astute behavioral notepad. And she formed the bitter personality of a teenager that we all had, into a fretting, adult worldview. Together they represent a striking blend that may be too hot for some viewers. (Hello. Let me through. I wish you would not be my brother, so I could make friends with you!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards is looking for himself after returning to Los Angeles from New York, which leads to fascinating fitting different characters (they are all poorly suited) for our entertainment, but enough of them involve appealing an appeal to the black imperative's value system, according to which the real barometer of its recovery is whether the black culture accepts it. (It has been a while. Nina Simone comes to mind. And she has an impressive, tightly built black lover in the film) A pretty black girl attends the show and seems to allow Sandra's fake blackness, but eventually rejects her. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics consider themselves lucky enough to suffer for Christ, here Sandra portrays herself suffering from the black culture in which she longs for a place; as if she treasures her dignity and failure. This is the only value system that is involved in the world of cinema, except for the fact that Bernhards portrayed confusion. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main problems are racism and money, it's nice to see that one of the two topics is considered atypically the way.
