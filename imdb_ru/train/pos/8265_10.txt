The name of this film alone made me want to see only what it was all about, so I taped this film in the early hours of AM. If you ever wanted to see what the miners had to go through in the early days, and see the dramatic scene when the mine collapses into people. This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and make friends after the First World War and how the Germans came to the aid of the French miners in many ways the disbelief of the French citizens. All the actors were outstanding, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a little boy who worked in the mine. There is an old retired old miner who manages to go down the mine stairs when the elevator breaks. If you are a real movie lover, you will not want to miss this movie.
