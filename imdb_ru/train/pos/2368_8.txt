Plot: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter, ex-cop, goes undercover in Peacekeepers after his friend is killed by their leader. While there, he discovers that the woman wants to run for mayor, and will do everything to achieve this goal, even murder. The cast is good (Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and a good actor) ... Bridget Nielsen plays sexually Antagonist together another bad guy plays Mathias Hughes and his good martial arts master. The direction is good (fight scenes too). The rest is fine, with Tony Burton, who plays Kurt's friend, killed by Nielsen, and Cindy Pass plays a bad girl. From producers of another action movie / martial arts film (Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas) is a good action movie. The best film from the martial law series.
