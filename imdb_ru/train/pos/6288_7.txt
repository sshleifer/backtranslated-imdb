"Gone in 60 Seconds" / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, stylish, action-picture with a high power of octane stars and lots of amazing looking cars. If you are a spectator interested in cars, then this product, created by Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock"), is worth a look to admire the glossy cars. Although the film hides the stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement makes it a moderately successful summer exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> In the film, Giovanni Ribisi (“Maude Squad”) was shot as a young crook named Kip Raines, who, as the film opens, cannot deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip’s life is threatened because of this, his elder brother, Randall “Memphis” Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to perform a task in exchange for his brother’s survival: there are fifty cars named Model, color, year and make-up - just four days. <br /> <br /> The first three days Membis is recruiting a team of bandits to help him cope with the robbery. The crew includes Sarah "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy but rude retirement fraudster, familiar with Memphis from past affairs, a guy named TJ Cross, an aging and wise Otto Holliwell (Robert Duvall), and Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atli Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donnie Astrikki (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> Facilitating the movement and tension of the film is a plot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebek (Delroy Lindo) and Draykoff (Timothy Olyphant), who by previous experience suspect that Memphis and his team are insignificant. watch them well and carefully. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development; Viewers get to know these people through their difficult lifestyle and accept tough personalities through the hard base of the film, the stylish atmosphere. Worse for the film, the dialogue cannot define characters with a coarse cultural tone. I do not claim to believe that profanity and vulgarity are necessary for thrillers to thrive; I actually respect the decision of the director to endure from the extremely obscene language in the film, which could earn R-rating without much effort. Nevertheless, I believe in such a film as "Gone in 60 Seconds" to strongly develop the character's enlightenment, the dialogue must be believable and reliable. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective due to the high quality, they perfectly work out responsible performers. The melodramatic rendition of Nicolas Cage is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's sloppy appearance is perfectly appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is delightfully sturdy and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide compelling supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains a standard structure with a satisfactory first act that develops the style of the story and the motives of the character, establishes a rapidly developing theme of action, but lacks the depth and strong presentation of the character. In the second act, we face several more problems: history spends time throughout most of this segment, never preparing for the third act. While the middle of the movie takes a lot of time, and the sex scene provides a solid average plot, not much happens. The third act is a real surge of adrenaline, containing violent excitement from wall to wall and one of the most intense episodes of car chase ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for the film “Gone in 60 Seconds” makes a great contribution to dealing with inspiring action scenes. It is scenes like car chases that make this film work, despite several devastating mistakes. Dominic Sena, whose career mainly consisted of directing commercials, has an attractive style and a decisive attitude in Spirited Away in 60 Seconds, which will give viewers two hours of excitement, thrill and excitement, but not much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
