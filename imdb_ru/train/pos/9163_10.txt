When my daughter was in college at preschool age, this mini-series appeared on A & E from 8 to 9 every morning. My neighbor and I made an agreement that we will not miss a single minute from the life of Jane Eyre, and our children were late in the preschool institutions every morning for the whole week. A good choice. <br /> <br /> I forgot how much I loved this movie until I recently received my old copy of VHS. Timothy Dalton is very beautiful, but still as beautiful as Rochester. Dark, rocky face, imperious behavior, tempered with humor and tenderness, were right from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats some scenery, I could not watch the adaptation in the lead role with William Hurt or the grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and are addicted to love. <br /> <br /> I would really like to know what happened to Zella Clark. She is dead like Jane, quiet, formal, speaks volumes with a facial expression. The glitter in her eyes gives viewers an idea of ​​the strength and energetic nature that helped Jane to endure the cruel treatment she experienced in her youth. Criticism of her performance as “wooden” is inappropriate. A servant in a proper English household would support just such behavior, but she speaks passionately when he is overwhelmed with emotion. Unlike many other on-screen Jane, she looks clear enough to be Jane, and at the same time attractive enough to allow the audience to get Rochester's appeal to her. <br /> <br /> Bronte Dialogue is a big part of why the book stands, the script keeps a lot of it intact. Dalton and Clark record the interaction of Jane and Rochester with sharpness and quiet intensity. Although Jane looks as simple and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be intimidated by dark noisy Rochester. Two squads play beautifully against each other. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romantic novel.
