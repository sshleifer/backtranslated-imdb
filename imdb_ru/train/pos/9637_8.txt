This film has a special way of telling a story, at first I found it rather strange because it jumped in time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> In any case, the storyline was simple, but still real and touching. You met someone for the first time, you completely fell in love, but finally broke up and became the cause of death agony. Who has not been through this? but we will never forget such pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would say that Iâ€™m very touched because the two actors showed excellent performance in showing love between the characters. I just want the story to be a happy ending.
