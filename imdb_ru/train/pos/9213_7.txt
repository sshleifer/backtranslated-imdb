Gomez Pereira is responsible for some of the most disgusting comedies of the last Spanish cinema (just take a look at his resume), so I didn’t expect much of “Cosas Que Hacen ...” ... In fact, I don’t know why in the world I decided to watch it. Anyway, I just ... And what a surprise. It seems that Gomez Pereira has finally matured, and now he is able to make a good film. His latest work is about a middle age crisis, frustration, and finding a second chance after you messed up. The last half hour of the film (more dramatic) is the best part, and it's just worth watching a movie. Also the main role is played by Edward Fernandez, and I continue to think that he is the best actor of his generation (of course). <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
