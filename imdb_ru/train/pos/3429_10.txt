I saw this movie premiere on Friday (1/19) in the evening in Park City on Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in the theater and hearing firsthand how the soldiers' torments pass, was almost more than I could bear. Other viewers were equally touched, and although we wanted to turn away, the minimum that we could do was witness when these men and women shared their experiences with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rikhoff, Sean Hughes and Herold Noel, all the Iraq war veterans and those shown in the film, were present. Although they may be at home now, you can say that the war is still inside them and probably will always be. Whether you support the war or not, our duty is to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
