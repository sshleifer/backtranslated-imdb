This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams. Anyone who knows about William's work knows that this is a bit unusual (if not ingenious), but this one shoots a cake. <br /> <br /> There are two unfortunate rag dolls in it, who must save their owner's new French doll from the lustful Pirate toy and are caught in the grip of several strange characters along the way. The strength in this film lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; his weird character design, his powerful animation and the sharp contrast of sweet and scary. Williams' brilliant animation portrayed Ragdy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls, flexible and cursed, rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls, which made them more believable (at least in a visual sense). The animation shines over to bring us a "Camel with wrinkled knees", whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end, chasing in a silent film with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, Greedy. <br /> <br /> By itself, a greedy animation, perhaps the most sophisticated psychedelic animation I have ever seen. In this animation there is something from which your jaw drops, and every second it is something new. Living in what was considered “Fossa Tuffy”, Greedy is a massive man who lives in and mercilessly eats sweets. He sings a song I can't hold, but I feel restraint in sexual connotations, then he tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy heart. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this film is that there are too many of them. songs. It continuously slows down the pace of the film because there are SIXTEEN of them. There are about six good songs (which were supposed to be the only ones), including “I look, and what do I see?”, “A toy without a girl”, “Blue” (although they didn’t have to make him sing twice), “I never getting enough, ”“ Because I love you, ”and, perhaps,“ I'm at home. ” Others just seem unnecessary and, frankly, not too surprising to listen to. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie with strange overtones, but if this is what you are looking for, you will not find the best.
