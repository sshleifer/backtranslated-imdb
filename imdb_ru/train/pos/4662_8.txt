I just saw Hot Millions on TCM, and I completely forgot this gem. Ustinov creates a clever and controversial conspiracy in which he deftly goes from two beaten crook to a genius ... Well, you will see. Maggie Smith is beautiful as an awkward secretary / neighbor who finds it difficult to work, but he has a warm and bright personality who shines through this picture. She creates a beautiful image of a warm, witty and real person who ultimately ... well ... <br /> <br /> Malden and Newhart, as top executives, take on the task of creating something like a banal role and make them go out into their own comic life. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Caesar Romero are just nice to see, and I know that, at least in the case of Romero, Ustinov lends a helping hand. <br /> <br /> This film is designed to take it off the rising computer age, and this is a problem for the average con artist or man for that matter, but the characters are really so exciting and so fun to watch this computer story almost lost ... I say almost. <br /> <br /> Drop your usual expectations of a modern comedy and look for great performances and a friendly, forgiving and deeply engaging plot in this picture.
