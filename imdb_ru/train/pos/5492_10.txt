For some time I was impressed with Chavez’s position against globalization, but only when I saw the film at the Amsterdam International Film Festival did I understand what he really achieved. This film tells the story of the coup d'état / conspiracy of Venezuela, the oil companies and the corrupt Western governments who love oil to shift the democratically elected president Chávez and return Venezuela to a cruel dictatorship. This film is necessary for everyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I thank the people of Venezuela for taking matters into their own hands and saving their country from people like Halliburton and the Bush regime.
