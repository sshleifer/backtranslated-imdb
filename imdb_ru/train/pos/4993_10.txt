Unfortunately, this film was unavailable for a long time (as noted by other authors), but it is one of the most important dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and touching drama of love that takes place in slums. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, who are perhaps the best in their careers, and this is an excellent example of how filmmaker Frank Borzage was able to create an almost fabulous aura around the elements of poverty, crime, and terrible social inequality that only proves his talents are truly romantic and spiritual. This film shows how love survives among wretched and desperate needs, and this fully confirms life. This is a real masterpiece of that time, and it is a film that deserves wider fame.
