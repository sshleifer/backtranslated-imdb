Yes, the archetype of a simple, but inspirational film. The very end, when the whole crowd in the stadium gets up and people raise their hands, gives me a cold when I see it. This is just great. Joseph is beautiful as a lonely and sad child who has so far been disappointed by someone and something in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and angels is fun and exciting. A very good family movie with - I admit - a pretty trite happy ending. But, in fact, it does not matter, the film retains its basic qualities due to good play and inspiring motives.
