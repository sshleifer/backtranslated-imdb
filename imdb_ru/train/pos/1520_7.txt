Four stories written by Robert Bloch about different people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them. The first Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees that the killer he writes about comes to life. Some scary moments and the turn at the end was good. In the second, Peter Cushing becomes obsessed with a wax figure resembling his late wife. The third is Christopher Lee, who has a child (Chloe Franks), and she is afraid of her. All this leads to a rather scary end (although the end in history was MUCH worse). The latest comedy with John Petvey and Ingrid Pitt (both chew on scenery) and a cape that turns people into vampires! There is also a cute line that Christopher Lee plays Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good horrible anthology - that's okay, but the first and the end of the third gave me some nice little chills. Also the fourth is really very funny, and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire! Also the house itself looks beautiful ... and very creepy. It is well directed with some pleasant atmospheric touches. Very good and unusual movie score too. In general, a good little horrible anthology to look for. Try it on DVD - Lions Gate looks fantastic with bright colors and great sound.
