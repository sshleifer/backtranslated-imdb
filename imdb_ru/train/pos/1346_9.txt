As a kind of "refutation" for the 100 best AFI films, the British Film Institute has developed a documentary with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I am a big fan of films and am proud to have seen many, many films. But I do not compare anywhere with my idol. In this fantastic (albeit long) documentary, Scorsese tells the viewer about several stages of American cinema history. It is divided into several sections including Western, Gangster film and Noir. Martin Scorsese, full of vigorous enthusiasm, is an excellent guide and fantastic professor.
