I watched the episodes on the air online, and I was so sad that the show will not return. It had the best actors of mature, talented actors and amazing chemistry. It seemed that all the actors are personal friends in real life. By the end of the show it became attractive, sexy and very watchable. Of course, some storylines are not realistic, but so what ... The characters are all cute, and you support them. The show reminded me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Big respect to all the actors. Note to ABC executives: Nielsen rating reports do not show true results. The show audience will basically record it. I was very disappointed with large networks for flooding us with reality shows or teen shows. To get mature, thoughtful, well-thought-out material, should we go to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for posting the rest of the episodes online. New streaming media will become increasingly popular among viewers.
