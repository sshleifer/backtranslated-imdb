I'm not a big fan of hiking kitsch and like "so bad, it's good." Nevertheless, I really like this film for its funny factor and - believe it or not, this is an innovation. <br /> <br /> It all sounds like John Waters and endlessly enthusiastic, but with some superb actors and thoughtful Direction, making the most of the farce and stalizovannye movement. Billy Zane moves with an incredible expression (see Scene on the bus for a tutorial on how to use the movement), and it is framed by unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie, you may not enjoy it, but if you have the opportunity to watch it, then save time, because there is a chance that you will finish the movie with a puzzled smile on your face and a new look at the sense of humor of some big stars. Highly recommended.
