A really great movie and a true story. Dan Jansen The greatest skater of all time. A touching and beautiful film that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansen fighting cancer and Dan Jansenâ€™s love for his sister. An important promise made by Jansen to win the gold medal to prove that his sister Jane was right to believe that his talent in speed skating was justified. This picture is worth it. I wish they made more films of this quality. Thanks for a great movie with great actors and a great story. This is a very touching story about excellent family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their younger son and his sister.
