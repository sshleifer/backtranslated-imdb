The acting in this film was excellent. As a rocket fan, I discovered very few bugs. As a person, it touched my heart and soul. To watch the actors, you would think that they are real characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, did not miss anything from her performance. Young actors playing the Rocket Guys showed talent beyond their years, especially the young Homer. Homer's father inspired this eternal relationship of love and hate between father and son to make them seem real. If you do not have a lump in your throat or tears, when this first successful rocket rises or when father and son agree, then check your pulse (you may be dead).
