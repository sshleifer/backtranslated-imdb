Definitely one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the acting is great, all the technical (especially cinematic) is clear, and the script is clever. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is awesome, like Edward Ned, Kelly. He is considered a legendary criminal, and is well supported by Jeffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All sequences of actions are at the point <br /> <br />. The film is all you need until the very end. One of my favorite films of the late legend Heath Ledger, which was the highlight of each film in which he starred. And not mistaken here. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie from all sides.
