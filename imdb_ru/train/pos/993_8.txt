In fact, this film was not so bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, such as Doug Hutchison (Percy from The Green Mile) who plays Bristol. Another famous actor is Jamie Kennedy from Scream and the Three Kings. The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx in the role of Alvin, who was pretty good and funny, but what surprised me the most was David Morse in the role of Edgar Clentin. He plays a different character than usual, because in other films, such as Green Mile, Indian Runner, Negotiator, or Langolera, he plays a very responsive person, and in The Lure, the play is almost the opposite: without any emotion that was nice to see. The only really negative point in this film is a few photos of the World Trade Center, which makes this film perhaps a bit obsolete. In general, I thought it was a pretty good little movie!
