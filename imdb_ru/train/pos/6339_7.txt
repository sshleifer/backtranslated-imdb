The part of Grinch was created for Jim Carrey, and I was very impressed with his game. Not being his big fan, I was scared, but pleasantly surprised by the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou, who was the cutest little girl I’ve seen on screen for a long time, and she showed maturity over her years in her acting skills. I was even drawn to tears! I never read Dr. Suze’s story book, so I didn’t know what to expect, the humor was rather dark. In general, I liked the film (except the songs!), And I would recommend it, especially for family viewing.
