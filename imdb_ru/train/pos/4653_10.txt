This is a terrific British comedy film that I can watch again and again without getting tired. Peter Ustinov never played a bad role, and this is no exception, especially with his mind, but a very clever master plan. Karl Malden has always been a fan of mine since he starred in San Francisco Streets. I believe that Maggie Smith is the real star of this film, although she looks so inept in everything she tries to do, but, to tell the truth, she is so involved, especially at the end, when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she discovered while washing his clothes. One thing really concerns me, maybe someone, please tell me why I can't buy it on DVD or VHS in the UK, can someone help?
