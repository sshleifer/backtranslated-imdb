So I'm at home, changing channels one night, and I run into this man, dressed in heels and makeup, facing a colored background on HBO. Naturally, I made a double double and decided to look a bit. I didn't change the channel until he finished, it was incredibly fun. The next time it was turned on, I took care to tape it so that I could watch it again and again, and this remained one of my favorite things to watch. In the first few minutes you can say that the audience is not quite sure what to think, but he quickly defeats them with his incredible humor and wit. While many humorists come together in my brain, Eddie Izzard is one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it's nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty, when most comedians stick to current events. His show stayed with me after that. I went to Italy in the summer, and all I could think about while I was there is how “Italians always ride“ CIAO ... ”” 10 out of 10. Look. You will not regret it.
