I grew up in Houston and I was nine years old when this movie came out. As a result, I do not remember anything about the film. But I remember the feeling it caused from Gilley and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's hit lookin 'for love, which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it. <br /> <br /> However, a few years ago I first saw this film as an adult, and all I can say is that I was amazed. Several films hit me harder. This film is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's ranch, the Texas chemical plant, the Gilly, Bada and Sissy dance halls. And perhaps for this reason he does not have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (for example, I hate it, despite my roots in Houston), Urban Cowboy is a unique piece of American pie. For this reason, I love it!
