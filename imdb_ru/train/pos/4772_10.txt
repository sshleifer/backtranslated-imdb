This film is perhaps the most touching and inspirational I've ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes such a great work of art as this film can give me an almost religious experience. Suddenly you realize that life really does make sense. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that when I first heard about this film, I was skeptical. I thought that the plot seemed far-fetched, and I was afraid that the story would be banal. But, being a fan of David Lynch, I decided to try. It took me about 30 minutes to be completely captured by the film, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the movie, feeling that I really learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch film, and in some respects it was very surprising that he shot such a film after studying the film. the dark sides of human nature over the years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and deep human understanding, because I also thought that he did it very well in the Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the world's most gifted directors, and I think Straight Story is his best. 9.5 / 10
