Well, I have to admit that I have never seen Rod, and only one or two episodes of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Although I do not know anything about this duet with a comedic talent, I still really liked this film. <br /> <br /> Mary returns to work. Rose tries his luck as a comedian. Rhoda struggles with a photographic career. And Meredith ... what is she doing again? These three stories, which we read for two hours, are funny and interesting in their own way. When two longtime friends reunite, it only makes the film better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how well it was written. The little jokes that Mary and Rhod put in were fun. The script itself was very well written. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years I have seen Moore and Harper in other films and thought they were very good. But I had no idea that they worked as well as the team. Although both actresses contribute to the execution of the title of this film, they never let me down. (During the screening of this film.) Joey Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles well, but nothing special. The rest of the actors, such as Jonah, Cecil and ... all the others also work well together. <br /> <br /> Given that this is a reunion, you can expect a fan of any show to enjoy it. From a non fan I still enjoyed this little party. Good storylines for each character and two main characters - this is what makes this film very good. (A newer version of the MTM theme song also won't hurt.)
