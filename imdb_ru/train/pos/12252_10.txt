I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma". I have seen her many times and always look forward to seeing her again. Despite the fact that it lasts only 107 minutes, most of the plot of the novel and subplots was developed in a satisfactory manner. All characters are well depicted. Most dialogues come directly from the novel without silly jokes, as in Emma Thompson's “Sensation and Sensitivity”. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I especially appreciate the perfect diction of the actors. The decor and costumes were beautiful. I find this version quite comparable to the 1995 miniseries Pride and Prejudice, but then the producer and screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did an excellent job of portraying Emma, ​​about which Jane Austen said she would create heroin that no one would love except her. She is a snob-girl, but she has enough youth and inexperience to remain attractive. Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr. Knightley, I think that this is not an easy role, although he does not have the charisma shown by Mr. Darcy Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice. Even the end scene (harvest festival), which does not occur in the novel, provides a suitable end, unless it shows that Emma is cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill, whereas in the novel she was completely reconciled with him, even telling him that she would enjoy duplicity if she were in his position. A strange deviation from allegiance, otherwise shown throughout the film. I find costumes more beautiful and thoughtful than other adaptations from Jane Austen's novels.
