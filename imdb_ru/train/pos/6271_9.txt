I like this movie. It was pretty cool. It has everything: cars, rifle shooting, fighting, and even a symbolic girl. It is not superior in any of these things, with the exception of cars. A bit of shooting, a little fighting, a bit of fooling around and a lot of cars, with a big chase at the end. You can say that the jump is inappropriate, but according to our good friends here in IMDB, this is possible, therefore the film is not as bad as people draw it. He has a quality, and I liked to watch it. Actually, I liked the movie. And I didn't need to turn off my brains to watch this. I didn't always think, "Is this possible?" or a tramp like that. 9 to 10.
