With a relatively small budget of an animated film of only $ 60 million, the staff at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios did an incredible job. <br /> <br /> They have combined modern digital animations. Perfectly voice the talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a very exciting family film with a strong message about collaboration, friendship and care for your fellow human the herd. And how sometimes it takes a lot of different creatures to make a herd. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie I received a strong political message about how to get along with people who share your space - maybe this should be seen for all the world leaders! <br /> <br /> David Newman - another member of the family of Hollywood composers Newman - provides an excellent assessment that is not intrusive, but serves as a driving force and sometimes a positive blow to the nose. <br /> <br /> The overall look of the movie is incredible; intensely colored, strangely believable fairyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. Individual characters were also delightfully believable, and Ray Romano’s “Manfred” facial expressions were a special pleasure. <br /> <br /> The entire sequence with DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression “Dumb as DoDo comes from. '<br /> <br /> This is a good family film, which contains things that can alarm or scare children, largely sanitize, but, nevertheless, really. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie to watch in the theater and buy for home.
