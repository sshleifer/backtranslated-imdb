There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about the exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of the Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) prepared a long list (think of the aviation fifth element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. He was titled "Things that Bruce Willis does when he acts." It all ended in a simple message: "Please do not do any of the above in my film." <br /> <br /> There is a fact in this film (surely true). Gilliam did not have a hand in writing. <br /> <br /> I would say that these two factors have played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success - “The Twelve Monkeys”. <br /> <br /> Visually, “The Twelve Monkeys” is all that we rightly expect from the film Gilliam. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and common (but magnificent) weirdness. Gilliam admires attacking his audience. Although the final of the Twelve Monkeys will not surprise anyone who survived the first real, Gilliam borrows a heavy clock from Kafka, a bureaucratic tireless movement of the characters to their fate. This journey, and the character development that they are experiencing, is alarming. <br /> <br /> I love the films of Gilliam (particularly Brazil). But they all tend to suffer from the same weakness. It seems that he has so many ideas and enthusiasm that his films almost always turn out to be a mess (in particular, in Brazil). I still claim that Brazil is the power of Gilliam, but one cannot deny that the Twelve Monkeys is a breath of fresh air in the department of the dense conspiracy. Style, content and form seem to merge not in the way that usually happens with the ex-Python. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the truth of the rumors above, Gilliam also manages to achieve a first-class (and very atypical) performance from a bald one. Bruce is great in this film, as are all the actors, especially the crazy - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> More than ten years have passed since the release of this film. When I looked at him again, I realized that he had not really grown old. I have changed, of course. And it made me look at the film with fresh eyes. It seems to me that this is a fitting tribute to the film, which, at least in part, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives, and the absurd one-way time travel that we all do. First-class film. 8/10.
