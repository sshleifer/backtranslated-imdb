I liked this movie, and I really didnâ€™t expect it because of all the negative reviews I read before leaving. I went because I was curious about what all the noise was about, because some of the publications were so angry at this film and at the Koreans. Oh, and this is from Korea, which released some of my favorite movies. I liked the Host, but not my favorite. Some of my favorite science fiction / fantasy movies so you can get my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil series, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> This was not confusing, as everyone said, and the monsters looked good, and the battles were magnificent. There are some holes in this story, but it didn't matter. I kind of turned off something and stopped asking why long ago when I see summer blockbusters. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation stuff was different, and I thought the main characters were suspiciously dressed like Korean actors in other shows. Ethan's hair (Bera) looked so Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it could be better, and I hope that in the future, Korea, with its unusual unusual sense of life, strong emotions and unexpected humor, can bring a little variety in the blockbuster genre. Maybe a combination of Host and Dragon Wars in the future?
