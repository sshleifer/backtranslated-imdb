I think it has the potential to be the best Star Trek show, I say POTENTIALLY ... we all know that there is a chance that they will throw the ball and run out of ideas ... BUT I HOPE NO! For those who have not seen it yet. Without this annoying “PRIME DIRECTIVE” floating above their heads every time they run into races, it could be cool ... and Scott Bakula certainly was a GREAT CHOICE for the captain, and the Vulcan babe is also hot (see ) I gave it FULL 10 ... it takes ALL the other newbies of the series .. I hope it lasts more than 7 years ...
