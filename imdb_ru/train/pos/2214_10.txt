My family returned to New Orleans in the late 1600s - early 1700s, and while watching the film, I knew that it was a story that my grandparents never talked about, but we knew that it existed. I have cousins, obviously blacks, blacks, and others who can “pass” like whites and prefer not to do so. It's hard to watch the story when you realize that it’s about your family and that Cane River is part of the story. It makes me want to cry, and it makes me want to kick the ass of my great-grandfathers who owned these plantations, and wonder at the thrill of how my great-grandmothers with an African heritage lived in this oppressive and yet aristocratic existence ... at the same time if I had not come out of this story, I probably would not have been a successful business woman, whom I live today, successfully living in a rather integrated world. The acting was both excellent and fair, depending on the actor, but this is a film that MUST be made. Anne Rice is incredible, and I ask myself why she writes “symbolically” about my family, but I don’t. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
