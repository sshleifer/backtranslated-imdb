This show is a great story. It has everything: from slavery, from how they were treated, from religion, from how Jews were hidden, from the Inquisition, from belief in African gods of gods, from treatment of women, including daughters. Even before homosexuality. The way the characters intertwine, and that Violante, this character makes me sad. She so desperately needs to be loved, that she destroys everyone around her. I am so glad that they decided to reprint it for television. again. Although I would like to see the unedited version. Xica became my heroine. I look at how she uses her power to help all who seek her. I love all the characters and found that they can relate to many people now, in this century. I look forward to my Xica every night. It would be great to duplicate it in English so that Americans could love her too.
