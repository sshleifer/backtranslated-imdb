This movie exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard that it would be rubbish, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I didn’t feel good about the lead girl, and I didn’t care if she was alive or dead. After a while, she definitely grew up on me and became a pleasant character. This is not just a slasher film where people die for no reason. There is a background, which takes only a few seconds of the film, but explains a lot. I would recommend this film to everyone. If you are not sure, just watch it, it’s just an hour and a half of your life. You will still live 80 years.
