I like this film "Spring and Port". I was born in Lee, a city 7 miles from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965, when I was 20. My place of work was daily through Little Lever via Farnworth, sometimes by bicycle, but then by car, when I could Allow The film brings back all the memories of the neighbors in the working class, who have almost always been ruined, but who will always help you if they can. Fred Dibna was around the corner from Bromwich Street, where my bed was. If you did not see the film when it was first released, you can be forgiven for comparing it to soap, such as Coronation St, well, I agree that this soap, but then it was called “Kitchen Drama!” Watch this movie for talented actors who soon became widely known for their frequent roles on television. I look, basically, shots from the area and a good feeling that people are poor, but happy!
