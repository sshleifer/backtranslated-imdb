Many of the reviews on this page mention that this film is a bit dark for children. It depends on the child. This is not a film for 2-6 years; it is more focused on 8 years and older. I saw this movie when I was 10 years old, I really enjoyed it. At that time, most animated films were too childish for my tastes. This film deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact. In this film, characters can die and be sent to hell! This gives a little more emotional weight to scenes where characters risk their lives. Good guys are not always ideally cute and cute (like other cartoons). They have "real" motives, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Great movie
