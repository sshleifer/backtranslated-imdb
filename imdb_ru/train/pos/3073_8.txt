This is the type of film that Hollywood has to do more. No extravagant details, no car chase, no tricky one-liners. Just people dealing with being human. <br /> <br /> William Macy plays an unlikely killer who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is an obedient son, Sutherland is a powerful father. The son wants to go out of business, the father will not allow him. Macy loves his own son, who was beautifully played by David Dorfman (The Ring). He also begins to fall in love with Neva Campbell, the girl he meets in his psychiatrist's emergency room. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting juxtaposition of characters, and the film follows a reluctant killer who balances his need with those of his family. There are many touching scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy. And, as one would expect in a film with William Macy, there is also a bit of humor in it. <br /> <br /> Excellent work, actors and director. It's nice to know that they can still make a good movie in Hollywood with a small budget.
