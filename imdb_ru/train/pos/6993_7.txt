This is not the best movie of Bela Lagoshi, but it has an old-style approach to the horrors of the 40s. <br /> <br /> Brides fall dead on the altar, like flies. I think that I will postpone the wedding until they catch the demon, but this is a horror film, so I think that for some reason people ignore the danger. In any case, Lagoshi is a mad doctor who needs young female blood to keep his older, sickly wife healthy and happy. He always eludes Capstone cops, hiding bodies in a hearse (who would have thought about finding a corpse in a hearse?), And brides just keep on throwing. be complete without a reporter like Lois Lane, who wants to catch the criminal on her own. Good at solving a crime, bad at keeping your mouth shut at any inappropriate time, guess who Lagoshi chooses for his next alleged victim. I like the little haunted house where Lois Lane finds herself caught up in a thunderstorm like a guest in the ominous mansion of Lagosi. Hidden passages, a wife who looks like a vampire, an evil assistant gnome Igor and so on. Good things. <br /> <br /> A fairly well-made tempo drives the film to move, and the story is resolved in a typical but satisfactory manner. If you like old horror movies, this one is worth a look.
