Well, I know that it does not project India in a good light. But the general theme of the film is not India, but Shakti. The power of the commander and the power of the mother. The relationship between Nandini, her husband and son will devour you in their warmth. Then everything goes terribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father-in-law — the strength of their dysfunctional relationships — and the life changed by this are the strengths of this film. The performance of Shah Rukh Khan seems to be just a cameo compared to the plausible despair of Karisma Kapoor. In this film, it’s easy to get caught up in love, violence, and the redemption of lives, and at the climax sigh with relief and a sigh. Musical breaks are strengths, believable and well done.
