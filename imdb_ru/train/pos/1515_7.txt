In the 70s, Amicus wrote almost half a dozen of these anthologies of horror, and this, from the leading scribe writer Robert Bloch, is one of their best efforts. There are four stories, all worthy of attention, but two - “Sweets for sweets” and “Method of killing” - stand out as highly effective travels to fear. <br /> <br /> In Sweets, Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower, whose beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) is offended by his neglect and gross intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll, with which she expresses her disgust for his methods. Franks is a beautiful evil evil figure that has become one of the greatest children's plays in a horror film since Martin Stevens in The Innocents. This release of the film is directed with great subtlety, and the last indignation that takes place behind the scenes is the moment of purest horror. <br /> <br /> “The method of murder” tells the story of a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott) who is in danger. one of his own creations, the eerie Dominic. This episode is striking in its simplicity and complete horror. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. Short snapshots of Dominic, reflected in a pond or looking like a passing ghost in a meadow, are really haunting. <br /> <br /> The original poster, which shows a skeletal figure holding a tray with Peter Cushing's severed head, was a rich temptation for players focused on fear.
