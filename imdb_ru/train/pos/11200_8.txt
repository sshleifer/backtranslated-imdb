This early film has its flaws - a predictable plot and some too long scenes of dubious significance - but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's editing skills and the use of powerful images. It is also one of the most expressionist of his films stylistically; notice, for example, the strange distortions that he uses during the party sequence, and the frequent echoes of both the title and the plot in the pictures. <br /> <br /> Its core remains the final coincidence, which still remains more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Even if you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite plausible that he will lose, and his wife’s move from the corner of the champion to him, which motivates the final winning of the plot, is very well intertwined with the progress of the match. Stopwatch inserts do exactly what they should; You can almost hear a tick (although this is a silent film, visual effects often have surprisingly auditory effects). The pace becomes startlingly fast, and the viewer is pulled into the excitement and cruelty of both the match and the sexual jealousy that underlies it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD release I’m familiar with is Laserlight, a public company. As was the case with every silence of Hitchcock that they released, they added various pieces of music to the action, mostly orchestral. Sound editing is often inaccurate, and sound quality varies widely, but some sincere concern seems to have entered most of the real choices, and the music accompanying the final match works very well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be followed better than here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive movie than one would expect due to its current suspense. He deserves a place of honor in the Hitchcock canon, and in the fine list of worthy boxing films.
