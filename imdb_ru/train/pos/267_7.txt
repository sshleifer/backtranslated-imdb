It all starts with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated items in a student hostel on Hickory Road in London. Concerned about her sister, who works there as a housewife, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to investigate this matter. He agrees, but the stakes soon become higher when the girl who admitted that she was responsible for most (not all) thefts, was found murdered. <br /> <br /> “Hickory Dikori Doc” is a solid exercise for the brain, not as difficult for the mind as “One, two, buckle, shoe”. Murder, theft and smuggling of diamonds are crimes, and the last turn that binds everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! Interesting characters, especially psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, Inspector Jupp have their funny moments (perhaps the closest to this show is “toilet humor”), and Miss Lemon gets a more integral story than usual.
