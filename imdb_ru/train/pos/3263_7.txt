Usually I really like movies like “Chances are,” but I’m not completely satisfied with this for several reasons. The first half was pretty well done overall, with Alex Finch dying and reincarnated in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and a friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who has now grown up. Scenes with them when they meet again, and Downey again reveals who he was once, well done, and he has a lot of emotion and happiness when Shepard finally thinks that her husband really reincarnated, but from there the film goes way down. There are several sex-related scenes that turned me off completely, especially Downey and Shepard, who want to get back together, despite the difference in age. After this, however, the film can be completed in the most satisfactory manner, taking into account the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I didn’t expect the film to become so immoral by the end. This story had a lot of potential, and the scenes in heaven are well made. There is a good themed song performed by Peter Keater and Cher, but in the end the film is not very good. For a better similar movie try “Heaven Can Wait”. Decent, but I really would like me not to see him because of the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
