What will I say about such an absolutely beautiful film? I saw this in Atlanta, GA Dragoncon, given that this is my main city. I am a huge fan of science fiction and enjoy the action movies. I didn’t sleep all night and was going to call it the day when I saw this movie in the morning. This is not a science fiction or action movie. Let me first say that I am not a fan of Witchblade and Eric Etebari, after watching several episodes (his performance in this seemed stale and robotic). But he managed to really win me over in this performance. I mean, really, subdue me. When I saw Cellular, I didn’t think that there would be something special for this guy. But his performance in the role of Kassadi was simply amazing. He was extremely persuasive as an evil demon. But in this character there were so many details that he just amazed me. Later, I looked at him on the Internet and found that Eric won the prize for Best Actor, which is deservedly considered the best in his career, and won my respect. Now I continue to read about what the script is and about the creation of this project, and let me say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry, Brian). They were very well made, but I was even more impressed with the story - which, I think, was even more his goal (watching movies like Godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off). I could not sleep after this movie, thinking about it again and again in my head. The situation with an abusive family is never easy. I showed the trailer to my friend on the Internet, and she almost cried because it affected her because she experienced violence. This is one film that I constantly think about and highly recommend.
