Flavia (Florinda Balkan from the movie “Don't torture the duckling”) is locked in the monastery of the carnal desires of her father. Tired of all the sadism that she sees around herself (rape of a young woman in piggy, sexual attraction), horse castration) Flavia decides to escape from the monastery with her friend, a Jew from outside, Abraham. These two do not go very far before they are captured, and then returned to torture and force them to repent. After the punishment, she joins with a group of Muslims called the Tarantulas, which previously invaded the monastery and leads a crusade that turns into a bloody battle outside the walls of the monastery. "Flavia Heretic" is a well-directed and rather notorious part of the Italian non-exploitation. The film is sometimes a bit disgusting and sloppy. The acting is gorgeous, the characters are well developed. In general, “Flavia heretic” is a truly touching and intelligent film with a lot of naked bodies and bloodshed. You can't go wrong. with this. 8 out of 10.
