The October Sky is a film that steals your heart, fills your mind with vivid images and will lift your spirits. The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket at first seems so simple, especially when the film takes place in a mining town where the future is as clear as pieces of coal in a mine. But Homer cannot follow in the footsteps of his father. With the support of Miss Riley, (a friendly teacher), the staff of his father and his friends, Homer is trying to make his dream a reality. <br /> <br /> And yet, as in any story about life, there are many stops along the way. Directed by Joe Johnston, we are lowered into the coal mines, where we are witnessing the chilling disaster of miners leaning under a stone ceiling. With lit helmets and a bent posture, they looked more like alien insectoids than people in the dark. The miners' coughing cough and blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the heavy load of the shaft, in the pictures of Homer and his friend’s missile launches. Under the blue ball of the sky, rockets are placed on the platform and launched into the stratosphere ... And nothing can compare with the stage when Homer first sees the Satellite. <br /> <br /> But what makes a movie such a cute relationship between characters? Homer's father is a classic seasoned man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite their many arguments. Miss Riley’s love and support is also evident. Best movie uncomfortable. It does not tie everything into a good bow. It tears at you, raises you. He preserves the atmosphere of reality, which is important in such a film. <br /> <br /> This film can be considered a finished work. At first I was disappointed that the film did not continue the life of Homer. I did not want this to end. Then I realized ... this is what a good movie does with a man. If he did his job, you don’t want it to end. And the October Sky does exactly that.
