Before watching this movie, I heard a lot about it and some of the scenes in the movie, but listening didn't help me, so I planned to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronnie Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make an interesting group of people who are obsessed with the desire to go canoeing on the Kahulawassi River and an unsuccessful series of events that happen to them all. Character development takes some time to clothe the viewer in a better understanding of each person, but ultimately you know these guys as if they were your friends. The acting, the dialogues are very, very real, as close to reality as possible for a Hollywood acting. The Reynolds character "Lewis" was interesting as a guy who is very cruel, but under the courageous appearance lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed by his playing!) John Voight seems to be the character who is the center of attention most of all, unhappy circumstances, who seem to find him at every corner, really form and eventually turn him into another person (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox really seem stupid fools who just like to joke, and it seems they don’t get too serious if they don’t have, and they did ... I was really amazed by the director Bourman’s vision of Dickey’s novel, very impressed . You cannot live your whole life without watching this movie. I give him eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
