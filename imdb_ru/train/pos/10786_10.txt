my sister and I shoot it every time we have films, and our parents are so angry with them (but they still let us go), and I like it ... I can't find anyone who lives next to me, who knows what I am talking about ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loved this film ... I wish I could find it somewhere on the DVD! I would love to see it now, simply because I loved him as much as a little child ... and I am now 15 !!! I remember so much about it ... that's where I got the little rabbit song Fufu, and all my friends know this song, but not the movie !! I think the little girl got there, sliding down the hill on her little playground.
