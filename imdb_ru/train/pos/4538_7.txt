I didn’t even want to watch this movie after reading the review of Multin and rating 1 1/2 stars. In any case, I watched this on the advice of my son and found him much better than I expected. I would give it 2 1/2 stars from a 4-star system. You have to watch a movie more than once to understand all this. If you do not know much about religion, you will be bored a lot. I graduated from high school in the year when the film was made, so maybe I can relate to it better. Yes, there is some pretense in the film, and this is somewhat strange, but it was the 70s, so what do you expect? I understand why people might not like the movie; however, I can’t understand what people say is boring. The film is not boring at all. You will either hate it or love it. If you are bored, then your brain is dead.
