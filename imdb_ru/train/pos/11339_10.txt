Anyone who has experienced the horrors of a divorce will sympathize with the protagonist of this indie film, a frightened little boy who believes that the zombie is hiding in his closet. Is Jake (the fascinating Anthony DeMarco) simply a “transfer” of the injuries of two quarreling parents to a clear image? Or can a creature be real? Scriptwriter / director Shelly Ryan carefully balances both possibilities and makes the audience guess. Her choice of using the same setting - a country house - increases the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very persuasive, like angry but loving parents. However, these are terrible minor characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Grün), the nurse, and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a sloppy real estate agent who lingers in mind. Jake's closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.
