Although it was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not an animated version), I think it still didnâ€™t seem to be a bit like what Disney could do. It was well filmed, the music was more suitable for the action, and the effects were better done (compared to 101). Perhaps the acting was better, but then in this sequel, the human characters got much more suitable roles, and Glenn Close is really not to be missed, as in the first film. She makes it shine. Her poor footman and the overly zealous helpers of furriers are great characters to play with, and they add to the spectacle that Disney gave us. This is a great family film, in which there is little or no unwanted material, but it is still fun and interesting for both adults and children. It will definitely be a classic, like many Disney movies. I hope that the third will be even better - because you know that they probably will want to create it. ;)
