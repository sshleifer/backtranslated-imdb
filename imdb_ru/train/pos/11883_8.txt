I saw this movie about a week ago and still think about it. I was very touched by this movie. I found the characters very believable and cute almost to a mistake. As in real life, sometimes people are disappointed, as was the case with Leo, who, although I liked his character, could not be more disappointed if he wanted to have unprotected sex, even if he was fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed that Leo refused the medicine that was available to him and how he treated Marcel badly when he decided to send him home by train. I think this film very realistic showed why the number of HIV-infected people is growing among young gays. It is in no way intended to beat gays (I'm gay), and you could very well make a film about a young, straightforward person who makes bad choices and seems to be unaware of the consequences for himself and others. The only part of the film that I could not understand was why (friendly to gays) the family did not want to include Marcel in Leoâ€™s illness to such an extent that it did not allow him to go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message from this movie is that gay or straight, DO NOT HAVE ANY SECURED SEX!
