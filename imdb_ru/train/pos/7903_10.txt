I saw this film in the first seconds with the voice of TR took me on a journey - well, at first I didn’t like big glued fingers, but the ridiculous humor and gorgeous glances of both sissy actors - I don’t know who played her young - but she was gorgeous, like Uma !!! - <br /> <br /> Two other people, who somewhere in the cinema came out in about half an hour, I was with a friend - and it is always nice to watch a movie that I like with one of my friends. - and we both enjoyed it to the maximum - cheerful laughter - sadness about the “realistic normalos policemen”. we are both fans of T. Robbins books ... I found it well done - I thought that Robbins would approve too, although I have no idea whether he likes the film or not ... <br /> <br /> I would really like to see cut things - I heard that Gus against the sand had to shoot a lot of scenes because of the beginning viewers (or producers ???), but still this is a feature film. too short, though ... this is one of my favorites of all time - and I know that most people hate this kind of movies and assume that people who like these movies are what they think ... ....what a pity. I hope the day will come when the DVD will be released with full material - hoping to see more Crispians, keanu - waiting to see your child and everything <br /> <br />, if you have the opportunity to see him, think twice and enjoy if you made a choice to watch ... m
