Walk the path to this important documentary, which looks like an attractive feature. "Forbidden Lie" (2007) is simply the best (cinematic) version of Norma Khouri's book "Forbidden Love", and THIS was a bestseller. Lie $ - the best of literary fraud and pretty woman, Lie $ - the best in the edited reality show. <br /> <br /> Slyly edited and colorful, Bunovsky's story is replete with Norma Khouri's moving silhouettes, meaningfully blowing out smoke, I do not agree (with Variety) that it is too long; instead, my only minor problem was the episodic nature of its key players, commenting on the feedback they had just recorded. On one viewing, your sense of narration is lost ... so I watched it twice. <br /> <br /> This Oscar-worthy effort is at the same time ridiculous, distressing and absolutely exciting, as it documents one lie. after another. The obvious fraud unfolded in the Australian state of Queensland through a very personal scam of friends and fans of Howry (!). Obviously, these friends are now “turned”, the most amusing line on the camera, belonging to KLD's neighbor, Kache Rachel Richardson, who talks about her disappointment in flat, without unnecessary colloquial expressions: “I think this is a load sh! T. Personally. " <Br /> <br /> We need to learn from their experience, hence my faith in spoilers. Any perennial liege spinner caught in a lie will simply say something to gain time to tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There are some breathtaking shots where Khouri giggles derisively from the deception of this very documentary who instead presses her (the cheater) “Artist” to confirm. <br /> <br /> Since Sydney was murdered Journalists Bulletin Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after the publication of Khouri were on the run, but they were seduced by the leadership to purge her name. Allegedly she disappeared because a) she was either scared because of her cunning husband, who sounded more Italian than Greek, or b) because she needed a passport / visa to clear her name. <br /> <br /> Unlikely. <br /> <br /> A more likely reason was that the FBI returned its mark to Queensland before she again missed the border (one assumption: no, not Jordan). According to the final card, in 2007, Khouri "is still under investigation by the FBI." <br /> <br /> I guessed that the audience might just give Khouri a benefit from the doubts, if she demands maximum secrecy and subterfuge. Instead, the audience, with whom I slowly sat, just as disappointed as deceived people on the screen. As soon as they were caught, there were a lot of ridicule and phone calls; Earlier, sighs caused by stress came from viewers who simply did not know how to perceive the developing contradictions of Khouri. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker gets the details for covering this convoluted story so beautifully from beginning to end, without missing anything. - not even your own self-sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her film with the sympathetic narration of the book by Howry herself. At first, the alleged reason for its creation was retold very plausibly - the key to how a life liar acts: in a half-truth. Khouri, though, is a very cute and intelligent 35-year-old, with a rather disarming charm and wonderfully biceps. <br /> <br /> Gradually, we’ve seen less and less attractive Australian magazines, publishers, and fans who initially bought Khouri’s accusations of killing honor, line, and sinker. Later we see their more deplorable reactions, rather restrained and taken for granted, although some are perhaps a bit bitter. <br /> <br /> Jordanian (anti) honor killing activists were deeply offended by Howri's Misconceptions, because his stirring caused them to slow down the pace of change. Honor killings do happen in Jordan; only their prevalence contradicts the book of Khouri - plus 72 other “facts”. In 2003, these activists faxed (Australian) Random House with 73 thoroughly verified objections. <br /> <br /> Publishers in 4 continents that took the opportunity to publish a newbie, Khouri, never tried to verify the facts. Leaving any confirmation of the disclaimer in their copyright agreement, they were also fair play. Thus, massive fraud with hot topics was just as easy to implement in the world as it was to print it in an Internet cafe. <br /> <br /> Even later, we were shocked to find that “factual errors” apply to Khouri’s biography, since Well. Firstly, she is not only not a 35-year-old virgin (her protection lies in the fact that she simply did not dissuade people in their assumptions), but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes she speaks too quickly with her American accent. She also seems too comfortable with mobile phone technology and western clothing. I understand that such observations may seem harmful to those Jordanian women who do not need any Western paternalism from me, but when even cultural remarks do not agree with Khouri’s “facts”, you should start asking your source. <br /> <br /> At some point, the director came to the same conclusion. She is making great efforts to personally bring Khoury to justice in Jordan. The last third is spent on the study trip back to Amman, where one “fact” falls after another. In the end, Bryunovsky makes his “swindler” recognize the “discrepancy of decades” of his history, and it was after this that Howry writes his ridiculous secret recognition into his digital camera. The secret, because in it, “American guard” Khouri, as they say, has an Australian accent: he is an actor! (We will never know how Anna uncovered it.) <br /> <br /> So this becomes the director’s triumph, as she never signals with her tone or devotion. Her revelations on camera are forcing her audience to learn from the mistakes of others who have received such a heap of reasonable doubts, documents from the FBI — and Khuri’s most shocking initial crime. <br /> <br /> Anna Brunowski (watch her now) is even smart enough to use one artistic device (key players cross-comment on the footage) to kill two birds, which makes her viewers drink again from the same well. <br /> <br /> In fact, despite the fact that her deceptively modest approach made me reaffirm that Overington and Knox did REALLY win their Walkleys in Journalism Investigation magazine in 2004 for their “Norma investigation Khouri. <br /> <br /> Brunovsky made me.
