I stumbled upon this movie when I was at eBay'ing Caesars Palace, as I am fascinated by its rich history in Vegas, as the last of the original luxury resorts still in good condition (except for Bally's, the original MGM Grand). In this regard, this film provides full force. You conducted a grand tour of Caesars property, which, despite all the updates and additions that they made during the 40 years of its discovery, looks frighteningly similar. Like the film as a whole, the plot is rather difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the horrific editing. And when I say terrible, I do not use this word lightly. There are many embedded fragments of Vegas traffic, a crowd of casinos and even a scene in which Robert Drivasâ€™s character talks with his father about how much he grew up, and without any explanation he (Drivas)) goes (in these shameful fragments) from himself to the child, to the little boy, and then returns to himself, talking back and forth with his father. (It does not give any details of the plot; in any case, you can be prepared for this, and they may not be as stunned as I was when editing.) Otherwise, the film has aged well and has a good message about the innate differences between father and his son, with which most guys could relate in one form or another to fashion.
