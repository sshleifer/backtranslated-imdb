This film, created for French television, talks about the tragic influence that it has on a friendly family. When Leo, a young man in the center of history, is diagnosed with the AIDS virus, he informs his parents about it, they simply cannot believe it. The film is a study of the nature of how this family deals with its subject matter. <br /> <br /> Director Christophe Honore must be congratulated for bringing this frank report to the screen. Nowhere, but in France, this story could not get into the movie because of the plot. <br /> <br /> News has a devastating effect on Marcel, a young brother who hears what Leo concluded, despite how parents want to protect him from reality. <br /> <br /> Janis Lesparth and Pierre Minyar do a convincing job portraying brothers.
