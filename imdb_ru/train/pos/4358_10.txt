Well, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for “10” to help offset the misleading rating of a handful of Bozo who gave this film zero or 1 star reviews. Each of the segments of this anthology shows great potential and perspective for talented directors ... three of whom have achieved notable success in big Hollywood productions. The performances range from rough to impressive, with noticeable twists of Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Cove can be a great melodramatic man, like a psychotic hypnotist with a strange strobe lamp, and Lance August is deliberately silly as an unsuspecting lab victim. But overall, this one has some big laughs and some really scary moments. Definitely worth a look, so judge for yourself!
