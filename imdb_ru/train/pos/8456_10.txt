I watched almost all the Gundam / Mech anime that showed in the USA, and this is definitely the best story. The way its plot turns and unfolds is chained to you. Gundam Wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war. The series is about a group of five 15-year-old boys trained to pilot modern mobile suits, known as Gundams. Gundam pilots were trained to fight a powerful rebel known as Oz. When events begin to accumulate between the OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and the old ones will disappear. Old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. To achieve peace, the pilots of Gundam must be aware of the events taking place in their world, and put an end to all hostilities. But how far do people want to go to achieve their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a TV series with a deep storyline.
