There is no such thing as a perfect murder. Lieutenant Colombo knows this. Ken Franklin, who is the other half of the team of detective stories, does not know this. He kills his partner Jim Ferris, who planned to go alone. Now Colombo enters the picture and asks all sorts of questions from Mr. Franklin. And returns to another question. Colombo: Murder by the Book (1971), directed by young Steven Spielberg before his glory days. Stephen Bochko wrote this. Colombo is a fantastic character with his shabby look. It is hard to believe that this man could solve any crime. But he could. Each and every one of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who can portray this character. So do not alter, please. This part is a very good example of how Colombo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer, and Martin Milner the victim. Rosemary Forsyth plays the victim's wife Joanna Ferris. There is something sweet in the scenes between Colombo and her. How he makes an omelet and all that. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sank. She really met a tragic fate when she died after the murder, as here. I have been a fan of Colombo since childhood, and I still enjoy watching them. There was a break for many years when they didnâ€™t show a story about Colombo at all, but now he is back. Let's return to one more question.
