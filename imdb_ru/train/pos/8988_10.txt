Suppose that Anton Newcomb of Brian Jonestown Massacre can also use some therapy, to say the least. In Dig! which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, we have been watching him and his group for seven years, while former friends and contemporaries of The Dandy Warhols achieve comparative greatness (mobile phone advertising, anyway). <br /> <br /> What raises the dig! A great, almost biblical comic tragedy is played out over contemporaries: a disappointingly honest treatise on art against commerce and compromise. Despite his stance "look at me, I'm a bloody genius," Newcomb actually turned out to be an extraordinarily gifted, though extremely worried, musician - much more talented than his rival, Dandy Courtney Taylor, who tells the picture. If Newcomb is Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda from Taylor. <br /> <br /> Taylor seems to understand this, as evidenced by his tedious, self-hating voice-over: he knows that his group has won the battle - but what about the cost? In truth, they sold off, made Indie-Lite records, kept their teeth beautiful and clean, and probably cleaned their hair twice before going to bed - thus winning record contracts and a big tourist bus. And giving up all trust in the process. Newcomb, on the other hand, lives in the mud, constantly goes bankrupt, beats up other band members on stage, kicks hacklers in the head - and last seen in Dig! distracted by the police, losing the right to see their child. <br /> <br /> The two best films about the rock subculture were made by women: “The Fall of the Spheris“ The Decline of Western Civilization ”and this one?” is an instant classic when it was released.
