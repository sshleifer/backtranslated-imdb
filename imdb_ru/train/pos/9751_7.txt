Once upon a time, there were different types of films. These different films coexisted, although each had something different ... <br /> <br /> At first it seemed obvious, but I thought I would point it out during this review, because it seems that several people can forgot. This is just a fun movie for fans of Pavarotti. That's all. He does not claim to be something else or something more ambitious. People who make fun of it as something that has not fulfilled a promise, do not see the whole picture in the literal sense. In the end, Hollywood makes films all the time that are shameless vehicles for people (for example, “The Bodyguard” or “The Preacher's Wife” with Whitney Houston - these are two examples that come to mind.) <br /> <br /> First I would like to refer to the film as a means of transportation for Pavarotti. In this world there are the worst things - and the worst movies. Singing is incredible, and the choice of arias is fun. The film begins with Avenue Maria Schubert, and then with Matinatta Leoncavallo. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular music such as "I left my heart in San Francisco" and a song that was nominated for Oscar and Golden Globe, "If we were in love »John Williams music and words of Alan and Marilyn Bergman - all three previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so, of course, it will not be something deep or universally applicable to the average movie viewer. This is the story of a famous opera singer who was injured on a bad night at the opera a few years ago. When he was asked to sing again in the same MET place in New York, he lost his voice from fear. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)) performed by Catherine Harrold - gives him a chance to cure his psychosomatic reaction. He offers her a chance to mingle with him, and she reluctantly agrees. <br /> <br /> They enter into a novel, she knows that he is married and promises not to fall in love with him, and he thinks that she will be just another woman. Despite all this, they fall in love (thus, in the song "IF we were in love"), and with its help he overcomes his fear and returns to MET, where he wins. I will not tell you how this will end, but it is quite predictable. What is not always bad. <br /> <br /> The performances in this are not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you are expecting a performance by Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, you are mistaken, not Pavarotti. He knows that he is not a fanatic. What he is cute, charming and charismatic. He is having fun himself, and if you can just allow yourself to have fun, it's not so bad. One funny line is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a "thirsty plant, Fini can water you!" and, of course, she says: “I don’t want Feeney to pour water on me!” Catherine Harrold is very nice and does a good job with a semi-mocking woman who learns to live a little with this extravagant man. One of my favorite lines in the film: "Life should never be full size." And there is Eddie Albert who does his usual good work as Fini’s manager. There are several “themselves” cameos of real conductors, singers, etc., and they were filmed on stage at the Metropolitan Opera in Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or you can just allow yourself to leave and enjoy the “short break” as he suggests in the film, then you can enjoy this movie no matter what. has become. is an. I know that every time. :) <br /> <br />
