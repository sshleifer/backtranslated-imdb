This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say that you have to start from the beginning, but I must say that I was a little embarrassed from the very beginning! <br /> <br /> Clark gets hit on the head and wakes up on the floor of the Fairview Mental Institution and is ridiculed for what he believes is a superhero. Clark is told that the life he knew was in his head. Crazy. He also finds some unusual things: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is tied to a wheelchair with severed limbs after a bridge accident; and Lana is devoted to Clark. But he finds one acquaintance; someone else who is dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also finds that the mentally ill is also from the famous world of Smallville. And the doctor escaped from the Ghost Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me of an episode of Buffy entitled “Again Normally”, where Buffy begins bright dreams of mental asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was the fruit of her imagination, and that she had actually gone crazy. Her parents were still married, they still lived in Los Angeles, she had no friends, Angel was never her boyfriend, and she had no sister named Don. There were no demons and vampires either. Both episodes are a little sad, because doctors do not just tell the characters that this is just a figment of her imagination, but also tell us that this is in fact: an invention, and it brings us back to reality. Although it is pleasant from time to time to feel the reality, but we watch these shows in order to get away from reality. This is again pleasant, because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
