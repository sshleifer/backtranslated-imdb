Obviously, not many people have seen this film, because no one publishes more comments. This is not a movie to miss. In the end, he won the George Peabody Award, as well as the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield should have won an award for his amazing performance in this film. Eugene Logan, who co-authored this film for television, was also part of another film about humanity or its loss, being the technical consultant for Truman Capote's Glass House film. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will publish another letter telling how it happened that Eugene Logan became the technical consultant of the film of such an amazing person as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this, and I hope that you will find a way to watch these two films.
