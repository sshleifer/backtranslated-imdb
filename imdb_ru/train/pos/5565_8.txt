I'm a C & C fan, going back to their recordings, and I liked this film, but one day, in the mid-1980s, on cable television in San Jose, California, it was shown using an alternative storyline that destroyed the entire movie . All references to marijuana have been replaced with "diamonds." In the bag that “Red” throws to Chong, there are diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation remains the same (“... it costs ~ $ 3000 per pound”). There is also a storyline in which newcomers clips were added on the ship that watched C & C and talked to each other about getting the diamonds. In the end, instead of “cosmic coke”, it is something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was awful, and obviously they tried to do this for the family / child. It would be better if this network did not broadcast it at all.
