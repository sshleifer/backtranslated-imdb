He now has a name, a personality, some memories, and a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, but, nevertheless, they traced him and destroyed the world he had barely built. Now he needs some explanation, so that people understand how he made him the way he is. Yes, Jason Bourne is back, and this time he is here with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> This film does not have the most complex scenario in the world, but its subject matter is very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, as in any Hollywood film from the late 90s, “The Bourne Suprematy” is a story of superheroes. Jason Bourne, similar to the Captain America project, was completely mistaken. In the first film, the hero discovered his abilities, and in the second - theirs. Now he is struggling with what he considers evil, after they have killed the person close to him (his girlfriend in Supremati). It's all part of the story of a superhero, including a character with a (realistic, but still impressive: he is almost invincible) super power. <br /> <br /> And it’s interesting that he fights with evil around the world (in Bourne’s films there are no borders, characters move from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), as in the best seasons “24”, the American enemy who believes that he is fighting for the good of his country completely blinds him. It's funny that the "crazy patriots" are now the enemies of N1 in the paranoia of Hollywood stories. <br /> <br /> In addition to all these interesting topics, the film is not perfect: the female character Nicky Parson is so far completely useless, and the direction is rather unoriginal when it comes to dialogue scenes. But all this does not matter, since the Bourne Ultimatum is a fighter. And the battle scenes are pretty impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here talks about the “Waterloo scene” and “the pursuit of Tanger”, and everyone is right. I especially liked the battle in Tangier, which, in exaggeration and madness, resembles my work Tsui Hark. Visually inventive scenes, lots of intelligent action films and a good reflection on contemporary American themes: The Bourne Ultimatum is definitely the best film in the series and a very interesting and original action movie.
