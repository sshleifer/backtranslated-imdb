This is a very frivolous comedy about a wonderful family that has a son named Pecker, because he is used to Peck in his food. Pecker loves to shoot all sorts of photos of people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, and he manages to attract the attention of a group of photo art lovers from New York. Pecker has a cute sister who just goes crazy about sugar and is actually a drug addict, taking spoons of sugar from her bag. There are scenes with men showing the lumps of their jocks, with rough movements and girls doing almost the same thing. With this film itâ€™s quite difficult to keep your mind away from the ditch, but who cares is just a film that makes you laugh at a simple picture made in 1998.
