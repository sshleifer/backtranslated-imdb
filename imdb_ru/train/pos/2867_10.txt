I lost my father at a very young age. In fact, so young that I do not remember him. Over the years I learned a lot about him. One of these things was that he loved westerns, and watching Bonanza every Sunday evening was an absolute ritual for him. I myself remember the end of the series when he was 8 years old, when the show ceased production in 1973. Looking at this show over the years, I somehow get closer to my long-lost father. He has all the necessary elements to make the show successful: laughter, tears, the edge of your place waiting, and sometimes he even pissed you off. My most vivid Memory of the original series, which came soon after the death of our beloved Hoss Cartwright, Dan Blocker. In one particular episode and at the end of the closing credits, the image of "Blocker" flashed, and then it turned black, and I can also Remember my older sister with tears in her eyes at the sight of this. I can remember it as if it were yesterday. On behalf of my late father, who is not here to say it himself, we love Bonantsu. Long live Cartwrights,
