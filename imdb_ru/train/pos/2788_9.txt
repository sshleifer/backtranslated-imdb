These are so-called films about well-being, but in a sense it makes me sad. What for? Because I had a talent, but my parents did not allow me to study at the sports academy, as well as the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit football. <br /> <br /> And football is the red line in this film. Together with the struggle of young people with the expectations of their parents. An Anglo-Indian girl and her parents with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand, an English family with a daughter who dresses like a boy and plays football ... a combination that bothers her mother! This film also tells about the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It is about faith in your dreams and living your only life (where we have heard it before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (beautiful woman!) Playing Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, a new clothes, make-up and typical things of a 17-year-old girl. In contradiction with his sister Pinky, the exact opposite of Yasminde. <br /> <br /> It is really necessary to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of her parents and eventually finds her luck. With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, and Indian hits. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s nice to watch, but if you, like me, have ever played football, never got to the top, then this film will make you melachonic.
