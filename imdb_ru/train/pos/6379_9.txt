The film "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a sparkling gem in the wreckage of films made recently by Disney studios. Parents who were supposed to watch the "Book of the Jungle 2" or even a movie about Pokemon will surely appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few who will try to create an original story; previous feature films were simply repetitions of existing stories. Films such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc. all do the same, but it should be noted that they were all made by Pixar and are only distributed to Disney. The latest Disney films are mostly directly on the video and are a continuation of the existing successful film. The quality of these films is inferior to profitability. A new era began with Atlantis, followed by Mulan, Lilo and Stitch, and more recently Open Circle. Script writers have created all the original storylines, not tales of the past. <br /> <br /> A good part of the film is devoted to the search for Atlantis, a task that captures the imagination of many. hundreds of years. Including about the young Milo Tatch, voiced by Michael J. Fox. Milo works at a museum in Washington, DC. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist who devoted his life to the discovery of Atlantis. His peers thought it was a waste, and they wanted Milo not to follow in his footsteps. Unable to convince the board of directors of the museum to sponsor his expedition, Milo returns home to find a woman in his darkened apartment. She takes him to her employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Grandfather Milo and wants to send Milo with the team to find Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very rich and paid for all the best. The crew that must accompany him is the same as his grandfathers. The journey is filled with many great obstacles that need to be overcome, and look at them is very fun. The viewer is trapped if he gets to Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, and not just the discovery of people. This is enough to keep the interest of the older audience alive. <br /> <br /> Animators have done a wonderful job in the depths of the animation. The film very well combines traditional animation with computer-generated images. The feat is not easy to do, most viewers quickly notice the difference between them. Characters are believable people. There are some good chase scenes with lots of action taking place. A few sleepings are filled with jokes that children may simply not get. <br /> <br /> Creativity writers really shine through. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including the whole language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Probably, if the younger audience, this magic really exists. The forces of the people of Atlantis are not quite accurately represented as magical, but they are best described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although the level of technology used in 1914 is unrealistic. Traveling in a submarine, very reminiscent of Nautilus Captain Nemo, complete with submarines that launch torpedoes. Giant excavators are driven by steam boilers, so they tried some technologies of the era. Female characters are endowed with such opportunities as women of that time would not be, even playing roles in leadership. This is a good thing. This gives a good example to follow for my daughter, not for male actors. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why this film is my favorite compared to other Disney films is that there are no songs ever. The tradition, which began with the first feature film "Snow White" and continued to "The Lion King", almost every Disney film is full of optimistic songs. It's great, and all that Seven Dwarfs without "Hello, XO!" After a millionth period, it would be almost better without him, but this one relieves the parent. Not once every person on the screen suddenly recognizes the words of a song that no one has ever heard before, and does not flash in the song. I, for one, am grateful. <br /> <br /> The storyline and depth of animation will surely attract the attention of both parents and children. This is a movie that I want to watch again and again with my children.
