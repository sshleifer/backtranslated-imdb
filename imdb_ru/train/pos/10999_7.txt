This film tells about this weak guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high-tech company named Digicorp. This stupid guy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam), is unhappy with his miserable life in the suburbs and his demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. It is assumed that he will go to congresses of other high-tech companies and learn all the plans of companies. Instead, Morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu), and largely pursued by these two companies, which force him to become a double agent. How does Morgan get out of this? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan make it alive? Blimey! What a great movie! I was completely embroiled after 15 minutes of watching this movie. This is very disturbing, and you can feel the fear and confusion of Morgan when he does his best to stay alive. The scene where they put this horrible thing on Morganâ€™s head to brainwash him is incredibly creepy and frightening. Morgan is slowly going through a transformation of personality, which is not so obvious, until you think about it after the end of the film. From a weak guy with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man actively fighting for his life. <br /> <br /> The ending, wow, the ending is incredible! Twist is so much fun! It made me gasp and hurt like crazy! Good performances from all sides, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
