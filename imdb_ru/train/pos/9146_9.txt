This electrified musical has more than a spirit of egoism from its star, a musical genius, who is a prince. The film lasts 90 minutes or so, but in fact it is easy to see why this is such a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Like other films that are centered around a struggling young musician trying to become big, there is a hint of drama to add dimension to the musical numbers. Although this film is not as good as 8 miles, as a recent example, it is nonetheless interesting, and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of the story, the story centers around the Child (Prince) a young artist and a regular spot at the club. The owner of the club is disappointed with the arrogance of the Kid, and the Kid knows little that he may soon be fired and replaced by an opponent. On the one hand, Kid's parents are in trouble when his father brutally insults her. During the film, the Kid learns several life lessons and learns to value his friends more. Of course, this is all that we saw in dramas for adults, but they are combined as a musical, a very stylized musical. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. The prince is actually quite good on the dramatic side when he does not take a pose. He seems human and sociable. Clarence Williams is also good as an abusive father. Appollonia Kotero debuts with the princes' sexual love. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film is an excellent soundtrack. The musical numbers are well set and electrified. The prince is undoubtedly a musical maestro, albeit a very eccentric one. When he is inspired, he is great, but, on the other hand, he often makes songs that are solely for his own taste, and sometimes his experiments can be unsuccessful, but the same goes for many musical geniuses. The soundtrack for this film is excellent, but the weak point is only Sexshooter. The impressive performance of Purple Rain is outstanding. This is one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
