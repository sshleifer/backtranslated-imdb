Cross-eyed - very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing look into the comedy genre and really reinvents it. This film is smart, concise, consistently entertaining and fun. As a writer / director, Jones demonstrates complete control over his characters, which are both absurd and attractive. This is definitely something you have not seen before, and this is good. This is unique and fun, and he manages to work in visually fantastic elements, as well as in the genre of long-lost farces, creating an emotional comedy. <br /> <br /> The first promising film.
