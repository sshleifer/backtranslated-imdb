I was 5 years old when I saw this musical film, when I was on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977, and immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it is still original inspiration for achieving my goals that I have set myself since then! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of the backstage "backstage" entertainment industry in the late 50s "Sparkle" successfully depicts the struggle of three young sisters, looking for their place in the sun. This story could simply become a biographical story of many young aspiring artists that can materialize, when things happen too fast, and role models cannot help. <br /> <br /> Phenomenal music, written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the story with each song. All three young girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, represent different paths from which to face, ranging from situations that leave little choice for making long-term decisions, and ending with victims, to go forward. when you decided to realize your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This film may have spawned ideas for the creation of The Girls of Dreams on Broadway and the Brilliance of Mariah Carey 25 years later. As an original viewer in both performances, I saw many similarities in both stories to "Sparkle", as well as in "Saturday Night Fever", "Fame", "Flashdance" and the hit off-Broadway "Mom, I want to sing."
