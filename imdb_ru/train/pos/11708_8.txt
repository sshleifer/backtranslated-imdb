The reason why people say that this movie scared them was because he did it !! This means that the purpose of the film was felt by the few who saw it. When I first saw this film, it scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a horrible bloody and bloody film, but one that you think may happen the way the film was written. Of course, non-believers will say that this is only a science fiction film. The truth is that this film is necessary for your collection of thrillers, even if it has a religious look. If you're a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc), this is one of them, and you definitely need to have it. I have never seen a sequel (Distant Thunder), but I believe that it begins where this film ends.
