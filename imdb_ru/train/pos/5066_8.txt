I know that some people think the film is boring, but I disagree. This is a biography of a very complex and unusual person. I liked the characters of the film, and I think that leaving part of Archie’s life secretly captured his humanity. I do not think that the goal of a good biography should be to detail one’s life, but rather the difficulties and relationships that make them interesting. And what could be more exciting than someone inventing himself so successfully? "Men become what they dream about - you dreamed well." Good job Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arkand really stood out as a charismatic actor, and I hope to see him in several films.
