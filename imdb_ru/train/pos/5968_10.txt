When you come across the jewel of such a film, you will understand why the 80s were the biggest decade for life. The rules are rock music and movies ... especially horror movies. Cinematographers knew how to entertain us, and “Trick or Treat” is obvious. When rocker Sammy Kerr, who was most likely written after W.A.S.P. Singer Blackie Lawless, dying at a hotel fire, his number 1 fan Eddie, distraught. He goes to a friend and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the latest record Sammi made; This is the only copy available. He was transferred to a radio station to listen to live on Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, it somehow brings back Sammy. He helps Eddie with the bullies at school, but then gets out of control. This is definitely one great movie. The bad thing is that this film is out of print. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it from eBay. You too must ... $$ well spent!
