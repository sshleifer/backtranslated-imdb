I was especially pleased that in this film Othello himself was black, and Desdemona did not have blond hair, as he almost always did. The cast also played very well, and I liked the script, which so faithfully followed the original text of Shakespeare. But I must say that some scenes acted too erotic for a character like Desdemona. I always thought she was very modest, and therefore it was not quite right to show her in bed with Cassio - although this was only in the imagination of Othello. At first I was a little surprised even by the fact that the love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But overall, I liked the film, and especially Desdemona wept on the dying scene.
