Saving Grace is a good movie that can be watched on a boring day when you are looking for something different from ordinary scripts and want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this film and all the marijuana in it is so insane! It was the first film that I watched with this topic (drugs / marijuana), which really does not criticize him, but only jokes about it. Grace Trevetin is a widow who lives in a small town in the UK and has many financial problems because of her dead husband who committed suicide because he was full of debts. The problem is that Grace, who imagined that she needed to save money, discovers that she needs to pay all her husband’s debts in debt so as not to lose all her belongings, especially the house she loves so much. She has never worked before and is in a tragic situation, until Matthew, her gardener, who loves smoking marijuana very much, decides to enter into a large scale partnership with marijuana.
