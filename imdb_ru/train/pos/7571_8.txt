This game is still in the first place. I had the honor of playing on the PS2, so the graphics were really good. The voice acting was higher than the standard. The difficulty level is just right. In my opinion, Wesker should be the best characters in the RE series. The story struck me and took a lot of different turns, which I did not expect. The only rating this game deserves is great.
