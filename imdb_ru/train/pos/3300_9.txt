Pakeezah has a very interesting story (which is well documented in the General Information section) about how it originated. It seems that fate has conspired to check out Kamala Amrohi (director), while at the same time secretly wanting him to complete his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Pakiz uses metaphors, poetry and visual eloquence. As a result, the intensity with which emotions go out, reaches a measurement that may not be very real, but very effective and has an impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Mina Kumari experiences the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan as her own. Other stars of the film, besides her, are Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and cinematography do not leave you indifferent. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic of world cinema. It opens up new layers for you every time you watch it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare movie poets, and he left us a gift.
