Page 3 is definitely a very exciting and exciting opening for the eyes, which very cleverly reveals the hypocritical lifestyle of the Mumbai elite. From fake kisses to smeared smiles does not remain indifferent in revealing the shocking life of the rich and famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glamor. Humanity and generosity are similar to an oasis in the desert in this world, where social Darwinism is the predominant mentality. Everyone is constantly striving for more money, more fame and a higher reputation, prompting them to do the most disgraceful things imaginable, from signing contracts for film screening at funerals to molesting children. Everything is possible in this metropolis where there is such a big gap between social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both these classes through the eyes of the main character. She observes the stifling atmosphere and the overwhelming madness in which secular people live. Bollywood, business magnates, politicians and the underworld are intertwined in a completely confused mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a good track, as is the vigorous Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Awesome movie with great character development!
