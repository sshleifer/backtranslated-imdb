Act. Comedy. Exciting. This film has it all. <br /> <br /> The story says that 4 professional thieves are invited to take part in a robbery in a small town in Montana. every type of crime movie character archetype is here. Frank, master of the mind. Carlos, weapons expert. Max, an explosives expert. Nick, the safe cracker and Ray, the car man. Unfortunately for Frank, he was detained by 2 clumsy detectives (very well pictured by Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck), who chased him from New Jersey and write after he sent letters to another 4. <br /> <br < > Our 4 characters meet at the station, and from the very beginning none of them loves and does not trust each other. The fact that Frank left is not added to this mix, and they are not sure why they came together. <br /> <br /> Now Frank gets into New Jersey by two detectives, but soon runs off on foot and tries to return to the guys who have a variety of problems. <br /> <br /> A truly excellent film, filled with laughter and great acting. Just a good movie for those who are looking for laughter or something else.
