I first read a book when I was a young teenager, and then I saw the movie late at night. About a year ago I checked it on IMDb and did not find any available copies. Then I went to the Internet and found a site that offers War Films, sooooo glad I did, ordered a copy and leaned back in my chair, and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, in order to truly enjoy the movie, I advise you to read the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer printed, but I sought out a copy of it through E-bay. Written by Alan White was a commando / paratrooper during World War II, taking part in isolated covert operations, and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows, and this fact, I believe, gives authenticity to the book and the film. I did not give ten to a film just because of the nature of the end of the film, not as good as a book. There are several plot lines that also differ from the book, which is strange, since the book is not about the large-scale nature of war, but about the individual in war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have a copy of the book so that my son can read, and then a film so that he can watch it, in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can track a book and a movie, then it is definitely worth it and I would just like it to be more accessible for more to read and see, one of my best war movies, when -or!
