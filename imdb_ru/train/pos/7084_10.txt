I can't decide if this is one of my favorite movies. This is a good thriller with an emotional foundation, but I still can not decide. I definitely liked it. This is the first Terry Gilliam film I've ever seen. My first impression? I was engaged to the very end, and it's not so difficult (to confuse). <br /> <br /> Movies in the future Man James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future to get information from the past (more precisely, in 1996). The virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent from the future to get some information about it. A psychiatrist by the name of Catherine Reilly is also involved. The love story is beautifully depicted, and you can really feel the longing in this love and the longing for ordinary life. The ends at the end are connected in a very interesting way. <br /> <br /> In this film, I liked the fact that, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film did not prefer to give boring social comments and instead focused on this one guy and his desire for ordinary life. “You want to see the ocean, be with her” - especially the sharp line in this film. He chooses to focus on tension and confusion in a person’s mind. Therefore, this is not exactly a post-apocalyptic film, but it can be called a romantic sci-fi film with themes that range from time travel to blurry realities and so on. This is what makes this film a special film of the 1990s. A complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> Performance is pretty good. Bruce Willis surprised me here because he did not act like an ordinary cool guy here, but he gave a good impression of an embarrassed man who is in love. His despair in certain episodes is portrayed beautifully. I have to check out his other films. Gorgeous Madeleine Stowe is a real pleasure to watch. Since I saw this film, I have become so obsessed with it. She perfectly played a woman who sympathizes with her patient and finally falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is a real surprise with the image of a madman named Jeffrey Goynes. His nomination for an Oscar is pretty amazing, considering that he doesn’t have so many critics who can say good words to him. <br /> <br /> The end is pretty scary, and this is another reason to watch the movie. Duration or complexity is not such a big problem, because this film is moving quite quickly, and there are enough cases to interest people. And each case in this film makes sense, and there is nothing superfluous in it. <br /> <br /> Good Thriller 10/10
