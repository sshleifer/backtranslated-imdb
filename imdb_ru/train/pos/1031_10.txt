This series is set a year after the mission to Abydos in the movie “Stargate”. This explains much of what the film did not mention. For example, how was Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did Goa'uld (racial race) come from? How many are there? <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Jack O'Neill retired (spelled 2 Ls) was recalled to active service by General George Hammond due to the attack of the closed Stargate from Apophis, the powerful Goald who killed four men and kidnapped one woman. We are meeting with Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have passed the Stargate for the first time, and intends to pass now. We learn that Daniel married Abydos, and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial. Then the wife of Daniel is captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /> <br /> This continues in the second episode, where General Hammond announces the formation of SGC, which includes nine teams, in which Jack’s team will be SG-1, which consists of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, the homeworld of the Goaulds, to save Daniel’s wife and another, captured in Abydos by the name of Skara. They are captured, and even as Apophis orders to kill them and many other prisoners, Jaffa named Til'k, First Premier of Apophis, saves them and goes with them to Earth, where he becomes part of SG-1. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning of the adventure. During the show, they are past and future, were transferred to alternate realities, changed bodies, grew old, met alien races that include the Goauld rebel alliance called Tok'ra, in which Samantha's dad becomes a participant, Asgard, a pretty little a race in which we most often see Thor (he is Jack's friend) and avoid global catastrophes through the skin of the teeth countless times. <br /> <br /> The show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons. In the ninth season, a new enemy appeared, called "Ori", who paraded new forces, new dangers and revealed new secrets surrounding Stargate and its creators, the Ancients. In the ninth and tenth season, two new characters were also presented: Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1, and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a woman from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team. <br /> <br /> Very well thought out, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this is all. Another way to travel the galaxy and different types of adventures is one show you don’t want to miss. Open the gate and go. You will not regret it!
