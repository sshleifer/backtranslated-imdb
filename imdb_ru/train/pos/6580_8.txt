DON'T judge this setting from a 2-hour version released on VHS in the USA, which is a volatile and incomprehensible mess. I had the pleasure of watching the full-length 6-hour version, available on DVD from the UK, and was fascinated. The deliberate pace and growing sense of threat fascinate, as does the amazing visual and auditory landscape; this is ancient Rome, which we have never seen, and much more authentic than most. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi was rightly noted for his 1968 Odyssey mini-series, and this mini-series is no less powerful. As Bekim Fehmiou became the best Ulysses of the screen, so could Klaus Maria Brandauer Nero screen. Now I hope to someday see the Rossi version of Aeneid, which was shown on Italian television in 1971. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know which version of QUO VADIS is more powerful, this or Polish mini-series since 2001; each has its own merits, and in many ways they complement each other. Of course, any of them towers over this Hollywood camp riot with Peter Ustinov in the title role.
