This is actually a great, neat film, made on absolutely no noticeable budget with frames on video. To warm up, you need a little time. The game is so bad that it soon finds a charm like Zen. After a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries. All characters develop a peculiar charm, especially "Richard". Forget about Anthony Hopkins, "Maiden Guys" is the guy I will hire to play the psychopath. He seems to like it a lot! Mixed with scenes of crazy blood and zombie parasites, some really visually effective shots of the title character, Midnight Skater, view the campus in a black hoodie looking at the whole world as a cross between a grim reaper and, say, the Silver Surfer. These frames sometimes make funny things that the characters say about the Skater, seemingly ominous. The soundtrack has some very funny Garage-Punk tunes, and the hoarse, hoarse meanness goes well with the mood of the film. Thumbs up, I say.
