Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar-winning biopic Patton, continues to pay homage to another American military general, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong description of the person, his genius, as well as his selfishness. With MacArthur, you never knew where one thing starts, and the other stops, and too often they mix. <br /> <br /> The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour film or television mini-series. This would encompass him from his days at the border posts with his family until his time at West Point, where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet. It talked about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, about his legend building courage on the battlefields of the First World War in France. It would also have to tell that he shot the Bonus Processions of the veterans of the First World War in 1932, probably putting the final viewpoint on any chances of President Herbert Hoover for re-election. In recent years, MacArthur and Hoover had apartments in a penthouse at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. This was supposed to be the subject they avoided. <br /> <br /> This film concentrates on the years 1941–1952, and this is reflected in the memoirs. The film begins with the fact that MacArthur turns to the student body in 1962. When he utters the words of the famous speech “Honor the country in debt”, MacArthur recalls the Second World War and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese on Corregidor Island and on the fields of Bataan on Luzon. The film tells him about his struggle for the return of the Philippines, about the occupation of Japan and about the first 18 months that ended with his release from the command of President Truman. <br /> <br /> MacArthur as a film does not work at all if it wasn’t for the images of Dan O'Herlihih and Ed Flanders as presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman respectively. This is the part of the movie that I liked the most when I saw MacArthur and his relationship with both of these people. <br /> <br /> FRG O'Herlihi captures aristocratic squire and exceptionally cunning man, who was our 32nd president. Roosevelt was a man who conveyed his points with unusual subtlety and ingenuity. Sometimes he liked to intrigue too much, but he was the main politician of the last century. Pay attention to how he treats MacArthur at the same time as a field commander and potential rival. <br /> <br /> Truman from Flanders is the people he remembered, a stupid person who didn’t like MacArthur’s arrogance of gitgo. Of course, in the history books Truman freed MacArthur in 1951 from disobedience. MacArthur was disobedient, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> And yet I could write a whole thesis about the relationship between Truman and MacArthur. On the way there was no need to come to a crisis. I have always felt that FDR would have dealt with this whole question much better if he were still president. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also eloquent, eloquent, and Gregory Peck recited speeches in some of them, which made him a legend just like winning the battlefield. Listen to Peck about Japan’s capitulation, MacArthur’s farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress and, of course, his speech to the Cadets in 1962. Watch the newsreel and see if you disagree.
