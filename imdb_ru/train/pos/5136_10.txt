Probably the best jazz movie ever. <br /> <br /> This is jazz. <br /> <br /> The first frame continues to haunt me. <br /> <br /> Leicester, of course, is wonderful and not from this world. <br /> <br /> Joe Jones is always a delight (see also “Sound of Jazz”). <br /> <br /> If possible, find the music; It is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All connoisseurs of jazz and movies should explore this amazing gem. <br /> <br /> What kind of shadow and light - what music - what kind of hat!
