I had doubts about another love story, where people with disabilities find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branah are both exemplary, almost staggering, and save it from being just another jerk. Image Carter of a UAS victim is severe, perhaps even overdone (sometimes her dialogue dissolves into indistinguishable mutters). But the overall effect is commendable and useful. Brana may be the perfect compliment to her performance. <br /> <br />
