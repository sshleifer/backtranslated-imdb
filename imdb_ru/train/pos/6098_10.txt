This is one of the horror movie series that does it right. Friday the 13th of the series had nothing to do with the movie. Poltergeist Legacy: I'm not sure. Perhaps he was loosely associated with movies. It seems that they just throw out the famous title in the show, so that the fans could watch it. <br /> <br /> It depicts Freddie, who was burned by his parents on Elm Street (in episode 1, I believe), and the number of parents was disappointing. With all the children he chose in the first 3 films, we can expect that there will be more parents. Anyway. <br /> <br /> Freddie is basically a narrator of the show. He observes the actions of people in the real world, sometimes in some way involved. Like other anthological shows, such as Tales from the Crypt, there is a supernatural or unexpected conclusion to the story. <br /> <br /> In acting, thereâ€™s not enough, but believe it or not: violence sometimes exceeds that in a movie. This show lasted a couple of seasons and was made during the 4th film. I heard it was canceled due to protesting parents. As a child, I watched a lot of R-rated items, so, unfortunately, my parents had to spoil everything. After the series, 4 more films appeared, so this was not a complete loss.
