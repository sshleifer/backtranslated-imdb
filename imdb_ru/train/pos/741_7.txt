I was a little young for this, but I had to see it. There is great music that was mentioned by many, but no one seems to notice the very rare appearance of “Angel”, which is now largely ignored, but was once quite a popular musical outfit. Wearing their signature white outfits, they grind "foxes of the 20th century" and, obviously, everyone is trying to squeeze into the field of view of the camera. The keyboard player Gregg Juffria remains the highlight of the group, and, obviously, never received a lot of haircuts, never! Cherie Kerry (former Runaways vocalist) begins a short but noticeable acting career here and is remembered with Jodie Foster and the others. (Her topless 3-D scenes in “Parasites” and her UFO sightings in “Wave” made us all watch her for a while). <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but it retains a part of its period that everyone can look at and wonder at.
