As we all know, the genre of sexual comedies is quite populous. Just being overly rude is no longer enough. I have seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that the sexual comedy really needs other positive points to appeal to me these days. <br /> <br /> When I came to the 40-year-old Maiden, I basically knew what to do. expect; I really saw an advertisement after all; "It is true that if you do not use it, you will lose it?" What I didn’t expect to find were hearts and honest attempts at character development. There are still strange “non-standard” characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler’s films, and there are still enough profanity to sink “Noah's Ark”, but for some reason there’s a decent love story and even a message in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person with whom I can communicate. In the first frame I see that he even shares my love for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the film on his wall), and throughout the film we see his really neat collection of antiquities. Andy also has a lot of video games and practical knowledge of movies and technologies. Andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most important of all; Andy is a good man, he does not swear and respects women so much that he keeps away from them. Combine all these factors and everyone will start thinking that he is a serial killer. It is like my life story. <br /> <br /> Each character has its own funny little stories that accompany their slightly exaggerated personalities, and they all work on a certain level, but not like Andy. I felt it was a little distracting, since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only real human characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I suppose since I mentioned one flaw, I could also bring another noticeable in the world. The story is smart, but too predictable in terms of romance; it's pretty simple. It has been dealing with Andy and Trish for a long time, and we all know what will happen at the end. Of course, his last detour is slightly different from what we can expect, but you know what will happen at the end, and I assure you that this will happen. These are definitely small spots on the film, but there are so many good things that I can easily ignore that there are few flaws in it. <br /> <br /> When I say “good,” I mean, of course, “bad.” This is a sexy comedy, and she wants to be bad. For the most part, I think it succeeded. There are so many funny scenes like Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with his daughter Trish to a sex education class where he ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Ah, and we must not forget that the classic waxing of the breast will be “Oooh! Como se llama!” An interesting little note about this scene; actor Steve Carell actually waxed his belly, and the pain shown is real. Of course, they did only one take, but it was still a very bold act on his part. <br /> <br /> Actually, since we are talking about Steve Carelle, I would like to say that he has risen. on my list of respected comedians, which is rather strange, since I didn’t even know who he was before watching this movie. I was so impressed with his writing, acting and time, that now I really want to follow his future roles. This person has talent. The 40 year old Virgo proves it. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I had doubts about this film, but the early words were positive, and I knew that this was what I was going to see in the end. I'm glad I did it too, since this is probably one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and it doubles because you feel worth watching. This is not just a series of sex jokes combined together, it is a series of sex jokes intertwined with a very worthy character and a truly touching novel. Now excuse me while I go out to get me out. I can't believe I just wrote this ... <br /> <br /> My review from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php ? page = virgin
