WAQT is the perfect example of chicken soup, not quite for your soul. Unfortunately, the broth has lost its true taste due to excessive dilution and seasonings that were in its preparation. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing in WAQT is that it comes from a director who kept away from the usual clichés. about Hindi cinema in his first enterprise, but which in his second campaign lends itself to all the formulas of the film stereotype. While Vipul Shah was convinced to show something as unbelievable as the blind bank robbing at AANKHEN, he simply cannot cause life in the entire WAQT package based on something as conceivable as the relationship between father and son Taken from the Gujarati play “Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu”, WAQT has a thoughtful storyline with a social message for support. Mature look at the relationship between father and son, unconditional love of the father to his son and the responsibility of the son to his family. Ishvar Chand Sharavat (Amitabh Bachchan), who founded his entire empire independently from scratch, leads a rich life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son Aditya (Akshay Kumar) never needed to strive for anything, as he got everything on order and fed with a spoon in life. Ishvara's indulgence only spoiled him more. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar, but does not do anything to make his dreams come true. Meanwhile, he marries his beloved lady Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishvar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible person, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still at her best, leading a carefree life. <br /> <br /> The endurance limit finally collapses when Ishwar banishes Aditya from his home. The sudden change in the attitude of his loving father towards him and his now-waiting wife is confusing to Aditya. He has no choice but to strive for the existence of his wife and his unborn child. He begins to turn into an independent person, but the gap between him and his father is growing. <br /> <br /> The story is simplified, but in a simple scenario a very elementary approach. One can easily identify and associate with trustworthy characters of both father and son. If you are not one of them, you could at least meet people like them somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to this the director, Vipul Shah, who easily handles the script. With such a family novel, any other director in his place would have added tons of melodrama in accordance with the cinematic laws of the Bollywood family dramas, turning the film into an obsessive tears. However, Shah copes with emotions in most parts of the film. <br /> <br /> A clear example of his straightforward direction is evident in the scene before the interval when the father expels his son from his home in a rather frivolous manner. The goal of the scene is achieved without a slip on the brains of the audience. The same applies to the scene in the second half, where the son separated from his father speaks frivolously. This is what distinguishes WAQT from KABHI KUSHI GHUM or EK RISHTAA and actually puts it one level higher in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after getting all the differences, one wonders where the WAQT still fails in? The problem is that although WAQT is different from others in its league in terms of processing, it is inferior to glitches in terms of packaging. What with the director, forcing in the song-dance from time to time in the first half. There is a Johar song, a kind of Shaadi, a Chopra song, a kind of Holi, a Dandia song, a son's father’s disco, a dream song and a dream song come true, causing a sufficient yawn in the audience. Imagine ... the father just drove his son out of his house, and the son dreams of a song in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. Out of place! Beyond the cause! and the audience is not in place. <br /> <br /> The film simply stretches in the first half, and the real story begins only in the second half. The director has spent too much WAQT on unnecessary items. The often discussed sequence of chasing a dog is not bad, but it also does not buy it back. However, Akshaya Kumar's Taandava dance is ridiculous. Imagine that he has the right to star hunt in a movie with this (unintentionally) funny story. Add to this the climax set in the finale of the star hunt when a son bursts out with emotions. It is so archetypical! In addition, the editing template could be changed to hide the reason for the father’s change of attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> Anu Malik's music is good, although not needed in the process. The cinematographic work of Santosh Tundiiyala is quite competent, but not very demanding. Atish Kapadia came up with several good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav do makeup or highlight the bright moments in the film very effectively. While Rajpal Yadav has recently gone overboard due to his comic story, this time he emphasizes his character and is completely restrained. His deadpan expressions are perfectly complemented by the incredible story of Boman. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah convincingly plays the role of a mother. Not to take it as a censure, but it is flawless both in the game and in the "look" on your character. Priyanka is gorgeous and fulfills her role well. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main applause deserve Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is especially expressive in a scene where his loving father purposely scolds him to make him aware of his responsibilities. Although Bachchan looks somewhat dramatic in several scenes, his brilliance is striking throughout the film. <br /> <br /> To summarize, WAQT is like soup, whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritious, but the final recipe is not so appetizing anyway.
