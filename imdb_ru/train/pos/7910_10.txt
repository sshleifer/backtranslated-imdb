When it first came out, my dad brought it home — we were amazed at it — it was so different from everything we saw before. Last night I was looking for a particular film and again found The Eye of the Mind. The box is falling apart, and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! Although this is not high-quality graphics "Finding Nemo", it is still very good. They have to sell it again - this is a benchmark for computer animation. Highly recommended!
