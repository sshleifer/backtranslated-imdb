This film was great for all junkie lovers! Every character that ever was on the show appeared in the film. This helped solve some (but not all) problems in the series. Unfortunately, if you hadn’t really watched the show, much of the fun would have been lost, since the film contained heavy references for each season of the show. That would probably be appropriate as a series finale, not as a separate film, but we have to take what we can get. I hope that they make more films and continue to show the heroes of the killings in the films “Law and Order”.
