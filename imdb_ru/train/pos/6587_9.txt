The Blackmailer Master, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyleâ€™s The Adventure of Charles August Milverton, is the first full-length Sherlock Holmes story with Jeremy Brett that I saw. The story is interesting and dark. The film looks somewhat sad and sad, but it is quite interesting (with some particularly funny scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are trying to uncover the identity of the ghostly blackmailer who destroys some of the most famous families of England by publishing personal letters that will somehow destroy their lives. In the end, they learn that he is Charles August Milverton, an "art dealer", after several tragic consequences for victims who could not pay. Our heroes must then help Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay an amount that is beyond her means, otherwise her upcoming marriage will definitely be canceled. The scene in which Holmes and Watson are robbing Milverton's house is tense. Although the film, in fact, has a happy ending, the tone is sad and regrettable. <br /> <br /> The outstanding performances of Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick (as usual) and Robert Hardy as the infamous villain (most viewers probably recognize him) today are Cornelius Fudge in the film Harry Potter, Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West in the role of Lady Swinsted and Sophie Thomson in the role of Agatha (the scene in which she and Holmes are involved is a riot). I give him *** 1/2 of *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Inspector Lestrade. (I would like them to add to the scene at the end of the story, where he gives a description of two robbers, one of which corresponds to Watson.)
