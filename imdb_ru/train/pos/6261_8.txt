A fantastic 1924 documentary. The geography of today's Iraq at the beginning of the 20th century was powerful. Look at this and tell me whether Cecil B. Demil made notes before making the Ten Commandments. Later photographer Merian K. Cooper created Cinerama, an idea that probably originated during the filming of the wonderful landscapes in this film. Werner Herzog's fans will find this film a treasure, with the heartbreaking tales of wrestling, complemented by the earth around them, never before has the human ability to endure so obvious. The fact that it was done when it was, shows not only the will of the subjects, but also the filmmakers themselves.
