I remember watching this movie in childhood. I do not remember where I saw it. I must have been about 14 years old. I thought the movie was incredible and wanted to see it again. Once he appeared on the Kung Fu Channel, but I missed it. I was very upset. This is the best kung fu movie with special effects I've ever seen! I highly recommend it, and now that I have discovered where to get it, I can enjoy it again and for many years. I also have to check out this film, The Return of the Poison, about which some have spoken highly.
