An incredible little English movie for many reasons. At first this is a rare look of Lawrence Olivier in a light comedy. Although his performance does not meet the standards that he later put on to be one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is quite plausible as a deceived lawyer. Historically, this film is of great interest because of where and when it was shot. Being English, he did not have a large budget of Hollywood films of the same era, and this was often shown, but more interesting is the fact that this film was shot shortly before the war and shows England, which will soon disappear. When we look at it today, we think from the point of view of modern morality and overestimate the fact that this film and its closest American counterparty “It Happened One Night” at one time was just as risky as Fatal Instinct in our time. But after watching and watching this movie for the first time, I can't help but be sad when I watch it today. Since half of the filming was made before 1950, saving the remaining films means difficult choices, and unfortunately, such films are often skipped to keep films that we all consider important. Color shifts, lack of contrast and, as a rule, poor print quality, most often cause heart-rending effects. This film, along with “It Happened One Night,” is perfect for curling a love movie under a blanket on a cool, cool evening and seeing, and even better, why not double the function.
