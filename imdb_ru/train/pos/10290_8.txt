Bruce Almighty is Jim Carrey’s best work since The Truman Show, and it was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent “Hey Hollywood look how good I can play!” Box office frustrations. Nice to see how Jim realizes and uses his strengths. He will not receive the Academy Award, but the film itself will last longer than many of the Academy's "award-winning films." He is at the top of his form in this latest film - it looks like the return of an old friend. <br /> <br /> Kerry, Freeman and Aniston do an excellent job - they are comfortable in their comedy roles, a great time for comics, and obviously fun together, but without a comedy like “hey, mom - see how I funny. " The real surprise was Stephen Carrell in the role of the sworn enemy of Kerry (Carrell of The Daily Show), who left with some of the best and funny scenes of the film. For the past three years, I've laughed at Karell more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> I can foresee that religious mad people in the US will argue with God, but the point is that the film is faithful to all the basic theological convictions - we are a mass of protoplasm trying to go through our short life using our free will . Without marrying children to complain, it is likely to be a target for people with inappropriate priorities (who know the types - men decorated with golden watches on Sunday morning and late on TV selling prayers to God). And, again, about 0.5% of the country will be taken care of, and 80% of the media will report this. <br /> <br /> Essence: this is a purely entertaining film, every spectator laughs, wondering what they will do, and well-being at the end of the film. A walk along any major street in America should confirm that God has a great sense of humor. What better comic genius to remind us of this than Jim Carrey. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Jim - it's great that you're back !!
