I can't believe they took it off the air. Especially when they have only a few episodes. My daughter, sister and a few of my friends loved to watch this show. We were so upset when we stopped showing this because of the so-called ratings. This is unfair to the people who watched this show from the very beginning. We had the right to see the end. I would like them to take a general vote from all people with a voting system 3 times a year. They could send documents by mail, and we, the viewers, could give a common voice on all the programs that we watch or hear. It can also help in promoting a new show. People will see it and ask what it is. You can not only see what the viewers are watching, but also use it as a tool for free advertising for TV and cable channels. We want to see other episodes. Return it!!
