Some might think that the rating that I just gave is a bit generous, but I think this film did a good job with the directors they gave them, this is also an acquired taste film! <br /> <br /> My immediate thought was a direct connection with the classic cult film “Things”, that is, with parasitic aliens from deep space, who infested the human army, so that, if possible, smell like chaos! <br /> <br /> You can see how this film pays homage to this film and other horror / bloody film genres, however, it cleverly maintains its originality, it's good that these things fight each other for one thing and then continue eat and then fallen rival! Just kill and choose a person when he needs a new owner! To then choose another battle with another infected host! And this film even adds a love story, but I won't say anything more, otherwise it gives up too much. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT! But, as I have already said about the acquired taste, don’t be surprised if you don’t like the movie. It is low-budget and yes, it is bloodthirsty, creatures / aliens / things turn their limbs into a coarse weapon, that is, saws, drills, blades and even strange weapons for an almost destroyed enemy. I found myself clinging to what was shown to me, but at the same time glued to the screen, wondering what would happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you love blood, you love aliens, you love to fight and maybe even a little love added somewhere, then I have to recommend this film, as I should see. It is a pity that I ran into this before me!
