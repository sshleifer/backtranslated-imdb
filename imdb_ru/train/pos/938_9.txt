Although George S. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he more than makes up for it with his unsurpassed interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge, who surpasses all his life. <br /> <br /> Especially effective when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the film. When Scott is standing in front of a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle on him; all you can see is his silhouette. Enhanced by Scott's voice, with a loud growl, the effect is galvanized ... very much like the first scene of Marlon Brando in APOCALYPSE NOW. "Horror", really! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, what works for you can also work against you. Since Scott is showing such joyous rage throughout the entire film, he is contagious. In other words, “before” Scrooge is almost as charismatic as “after,” although it really should not be. This is what you would call the “Dr. Smith” effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing this role and many other heavy things (both on stage and on the screen). <br /> <br /> Actually, I myself do not consider Scott's coarse rage a passive. But other purists of the "Christmas song" can. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
