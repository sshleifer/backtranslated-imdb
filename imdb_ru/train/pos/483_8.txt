very few chess films have been made in the last couple of years, but this film is more than just a chess film. This is a story about the need to be loved and how to beat it. John Toturro plays a psychologically complex person, 64 squares and 32 figures do not mean anything to him, the game confirms him as a person, when he loses the game, he loses one thing that makes sense to him, and John Torturro expresses it beautifully, even love for a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence. It makes you wonder if there are other Luzon who are obsessed with the game, I am sure that if you are a chess enthusiast, it will not hurt you to look at it. The works, set out correctly and performed well, achieve their goals, unfortunately, I doubt that there will be a continuation.
