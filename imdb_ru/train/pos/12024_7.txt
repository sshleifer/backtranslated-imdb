The good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you should not have seen the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest drawback. It would be nice to include a few new characters in the new story and see how their life has evolved. Sinclair, as in the original, is great and gives the films the best comic moments as he tries to cope with awkward and embarrassing situations, but the cast is not as strong as the original film. Forsyth should be congratulated on a bold attempt to promote the character and create an original sequel, but the film is ultimately imperfect and lacks the warmth of the original.
