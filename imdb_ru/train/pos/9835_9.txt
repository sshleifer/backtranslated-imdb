Behind the scenes, let me say that I am a big zombie fan, so I do not make statements like the above, lightly. Secondly, let me say that this is an Italian film about zombies, and Fulci shot it in just 15 minutes before passing it to Bruno (“Rats, Night of Horror”) to Matthew. This is not the Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Still, this is one of the most interesting zombie films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is monstrously terrible. Just look at two scientists trying to find an antidote (“Let's try to combine these two molecules together”). <br /> <br /> Zombies come in different varieties. From moaning shuffles, to maniacs owning a machete, to birds! <br /> <br /> Blood is plentiful. The legs are bitten off, hands are amputated, the stomach is wide open. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to another. <br /> <br /> Then there's a head in the fridge. Oh, head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments of horror ever since Ash won his hand in Evil Dead 2. You should already know if you like this movie. Take yourself friends and beer, and you will spend a fun night. <br /> <br /> I mentioned the head in the fridge?!?!?
