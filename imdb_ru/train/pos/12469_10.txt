This is a great movie. I sow that some people think that this cannot be based on a true story. It doesn’t matter what it is !! was fulfilled, ”and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust us and do everything in this world to make them a reality. The little girl (Desi - in the film) and her mom were the best actors I have seen for a long time. Good for them, for all the actors, all for the director. If someone can tell them this, please tell them: "A 25-year-old boy from Romania says thanks for making this film."
