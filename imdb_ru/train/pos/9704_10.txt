I cannot believe that ten years have passed since this show was first shown on television and impressed the audience with its unique mixture of comedy and horror. This show, which gave rise to a significant part of modern British humor: the House of Horrors of Dr. Grozny; The dark place of Garth Marengi; Mighty Buos; Snuffbox. Many imitated the style of this show, and I do not deny that some have surpassed its quality. But Jermi Dyson deserves to be remembered for starting this trend with actors Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Rhys Sheersmeath. <br /> <br /> Together they created Royston Wasi, an ominous little town in the idyllic countryside of England, where unsuspecting tourists and passersby meet a possessed couple who want the city to be local and free from outsiders; where the unemployed are abused and abused at the employment center; where the farmer uses real people as a stuffed animal; where the vet kills all the animals he is trying to cure; where the gypsy circus kidnaps people; and where the butcher adds something secret but compelling to food to catch people. <br /> <br /> This is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in the League of Gentlemen. By themselves, the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters. Makeup and prosthetics are so good that I thought that I was watching a lot more actors than it was. But this is also a great acting game: how they change their voices and their body movements really become different people. <br /> <br /> Most jokes start from something ordinary, from real life, and then turn into something alarming, sometimes painful. Sometimes it is pure horror without fuss, as in the character of Pope Lazaro. Imagine a terrible circus owner who breaks into someone's house and kidnaps women to become his wives. No explanation given. This is so creepy. Then there are numerous references to horror films: Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Nosferatu, the Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> Horror fans will like it, and comedy fans will like it. Any incoming traveler knows that there is a sign that says "Welcome to Royston Washi: you will never leave." Any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree. When you open the League of Gentlemen, you donâ€™t want anything else, you will never forget it.
