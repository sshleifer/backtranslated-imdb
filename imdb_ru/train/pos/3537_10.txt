This James Bond game is the best bond game I have played in my entire life. This is my favorite James Bond game because: <br /> <br /> The missions in this game are very funny, they can be very difficult, which makes them more fun to play in missions, there are a lot of actions, the weapons that you use, really good. The cars in this game are amazing, there are a lot of action games in the car missions, and they are really fun to play. The voice acting is really good, and it's cool that Sean Connery makes a voice for James Bond, and also how Bond looks really cool because it looks like Sean Connery when he played James Bond in movies, and the other character looks very much the same as watching a movie. The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. In addition, the game follows the movie to a large extent, but not all, but most of the time, that is great, <br /> <br /> the total score ********** of ***** *****
