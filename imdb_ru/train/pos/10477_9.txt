A tightrope walk between comedy and drama is one of the most difficult acts in the movie. How do you laugh because of the suffering of other people and don't start feeling bad when it lasts too long? <br /> <br /> Well, this amazing little gem of the film will deliver a huge laugh, beautiful scenery and a pretty good hum as well. I especially like the concept that the history trick made alcohol legal, because white Europeans liked it, and marijuana - illegal, because "other races" used it ... surely true and reveals the racial side of marijuana laws so openly exhibited by people all over the world. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary DVD Extra comment ... actually two of them ... show the whole film with both actors and then again with the writers. I continued to see things that I was sure were not in the first film, but then realized how easy it was to miss most of the fine comedy from the first take. What a cry! Do not miss! 9/10 stars
