this film needs to be seen. the most truthful picture of what is happening in the world, which I have seen since the days of the Nightmare Darwin. Go look! and if you are lucky to open it in your city, be sure to watch it on the big screen instead of the DVD. Writing is sharp, and the direction is good enough for the implementation of ideas, although it is hardly ideal. Joan Cusack is great and the rest of the cast are good too. It is inspiring that John Cusack made this film, and I suppose he had to use some of his own money to make it. This is a wild, absurd trip, obviously made without the necessary resources, but still successful. John Stuart, Stephen Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher did not have the courage to say what this film says.
