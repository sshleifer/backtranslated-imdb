I just started watching what I like about you, and I have to say it's a joy to watch. I always like to see new shows succeed, given that many shows take place before you really feel them. I’ve been watching Amanda Bynes ever since “All That” is a really funny girl, and the best thing about her comedy is that she is so natural and what I mean is what a person can say here, best friend, she did not rehearse. <br /> <br /> I just recently started watching the show and fell in love. Now I just watch replays, but I look forward to next season. All the characters in the show give something for the whole storyline. It's nice to see some old face from other shows that I enjoyed watching in the past, such as Jenny Garth from 90210, Leslie Grossman from Popular, and Wesley Jonathan from City Guys. The new character is also very talented, Nick Zano has the charm that makes him love him, even if he does something wrong with Holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Overall, this show has the right ingredients for success. I look forward to it growing.
