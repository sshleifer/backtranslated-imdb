Last night I received a free pass to preview this film and did not know what to expect. The package seemed stupid, and I assumed that it would be a lot of petty jokes about a virgin. What a big surprise. I laughed so hard that I cried over some jokes. This film should be seen by everyone with an open-minded and slightly distorted sense of humor. Well ..... this is not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or young children. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) rude, and talking about sex is as vivid as everywhere else. What is surprising is that the film is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it. Steve Carell is awesome, but (like Office), the cast really helps the film work. All characters have their drawbacks, but they also have depth and appeal. Everyone pulls their weight, and the chemistry is beautiful. I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure he will be there with Office Space for repetitions and quotes.
