This Restlemania just didn't do it for me. While some things, such as the royal battle and the participation of celebrities, were, so to speak, a return to the good old days, it seemed to be louder “In Your Home” than anything else. Above average ... worth a few matches, such as matching the tag team name, although it should be noted that the name change meant nothing, since it was canceled the next night.
