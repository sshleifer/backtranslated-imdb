I have to say that this television film was a work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart was. Now we are so used to seeing her in the sitcom, and I very much hope that the TV channel will soon show this television film, as it will show Sabrina’s fans that MJH is playing in the drama. It is evident that we have been watching her at Sabrina for 5 years now, and therefore it would be a plus to give the audience a taste of her unused talent. Melissa plays her part so well in this desire for her parents to “finish off,” so that she can be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice, Melissa works with David Lasher in this long before he accepted the role of Josh in Sabrina. So it would be nice to see it now, when it goes on the air again. Hopefully, MJH will get good roles in films or even in other television films, like Kelly Martin, who always starred in television films. Lots of untapped talents waiting to splurge when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always shine with Melissa !!!
