A great, unknown film with amazing slow cinematography that adds to the drama makes it a pleasure to watch and enjoy. Screenwriter Brian de Palma does a super-imitation of Hitchcock (many call it “robbery”) with this film, and a 2.35: 1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera’s performance (and several scenes with people hiding on each side, which is lost on tapes formatted for television. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of the film, at least for anyone who has a moral standard, is the general untidiness of all the characters, including the Policeman, played by Dennis Franz from New York (who Oh, here is the hair!). <br /> <br /> The first scene is still shocking to Angie Dickinson’s rather long shower scene, which is quite frank even 25 years after its release. There are several erotic scenes in the film in which Dickinson (if she is really on close-ups) and Nancy Allen is not shy about showing her body. <br /> <br /> In the first 20 minutes there was not much dialogue and not a bad language until Franz entered the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are fascinating, and although it is obvious who the killer is, it is still very interesting and interesting to watch all of this, especially for men who look around naked women.
