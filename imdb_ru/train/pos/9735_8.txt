Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe “How to lose friends and alienate people.” The main plot in the plot, for the most part, is supplanted by a much more interesting story of "dirt for princes." Although the central line of the story is somewhat urgently covered, it makes sense in several screenshots; get rid of the "dark sand", focusing on the key relationships that make the "office policy", and use these almost irrelevant scenes used exclusively for the comic effect. Yet it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. Ultimately, the film is very intelligent, it shows well the transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his colleagues, and quite well and with pleasure refreshes the line between a society with a high and low standard of living and a plot that, despite predictability, is some sort of unique. Trip. The various characters in the film are well represented, and casting is definitely a plus in the film. And the "trading places" relationship between Pegg and Houston, and the "love, hate" relationship between Pegg and Dunst work so well in a story that, if not the best word, is charming. Even Fox, whose main asset, of course, is sexual attractiveness, is shocking at the fact that it turns out to be a rather gloomy character, and acts in such a way that the role of “bumbo” is completely satisfactory. This is one of these films, where every little detail does justice to the great work. From transgender strippers to a stunning soundtrack, it all fits in perfectly with what can only be called smart comedy.
