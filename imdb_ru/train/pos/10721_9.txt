This is one of the most guilty pleasure films ever! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but I still enjoy watching how she makes her cosmic outfit “super cool” with a “like a bitch” belt and stick with rhinestones on her face . <br /> <br /> But in any case, the film is actually one of the few “family” films that interests you. I know the beginning is dragging on, especially if you know what will happen, but the second half is probably , is one of the most nervous in the family film. <br /> <br /> I would not stand in front of millions of people and announce that they love this fil m actually rolling it pretty confusing, but I admit it here, on the Internet, to hide. <br /> <br />
