If you are transported through terrible singing, under it you will find a classic fairy tale. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in this role. His signature acting style works well for a cunning cat in boots. Other actors are good for their roles. I have not found one acting terribly fake or awkward. The king, in particular, seems like a real jerk, and I wonder if he should be. I can not remember the original fairy tale. Special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not too artificial, as some of the computer tariffs we see today. In general, I recommend this film for children and adults who are children at heart.
