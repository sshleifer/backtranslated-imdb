Despite the fact that it was a disaster at the box office, this is my favorite movie. It gives a powerful message to the family. There is a lot of violence and one song with a bunch of girls in a bikini. Compared to other Bollywood films, action films in this film are more realistic. This is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see an Indian godfather, Amitabh portrays this in this film. Do not read critics reviews, they are just ignorant. In this film, a good combination of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action movie. So if you want to see the action more realistic than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is a movie.
