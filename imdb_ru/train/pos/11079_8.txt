I always enjoy watching movies that make you think, not just give answers to your viewers. “Revolver” is one of these films, and although many reviewers claim that it is difficult to follow, I received it with some concentration and impartiality. First time. True, this is not comparable with other nonsense, such as "The usual suspects" or "Souvenirs", but in itself is an intellectual and thought-provoking film. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really liked about this film is how beautiful it is. It seems that every scene, every camera angle has been thought for ages. If you see this, you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion ... look at this with an open mind, and you can enjoy it. If not, then no one has ever said that the Revolver is for everyone. And this is my 2 cents.
