This is a very interesting project that could be quite brilliant. Collect 11 prominent international directors and give each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; each short story about global reverberations 9/11. Without using any spoilers, I would say that Ken Loach’s work is a crown jewel, and the short film Mira Nair (the “India” segment) based on real events deserves to be turned into a feature film. When watching your short film, they also understand why Alejandro González Inarritu is today one of the best directors in the world? he is just a master of the environment, who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are also made. Youssef Chakhin in his segment “Egypt” takes the Arab position of self-confident collective guilt, which could potentially be the most interesting. He fails with a bang. Cheyne's short is poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among other, superior chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still give the film 7/10 for the concept, if not for the performance.
