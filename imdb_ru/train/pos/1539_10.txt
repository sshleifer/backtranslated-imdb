I saw it at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It's hard to believe that this is Mrs. Blom's directorial debut, he is well planned and executed. Most of the characters may be from Anna Tyler's novel, that is, they are layered with history and a potential future, there are no false notes, amazing flashes of humor among the self-inflicted anxieties and very real, if not overwhelming, dilemmas. If you saw “The Best of Youth”, you will understand how well the characters are drawn in small moments, even when the story moves fast. I really hope it gets distributed in the USA. I live in a rather complex film market, but we rarely get any Swedish films.
