BASEketball is an extremely funny movie in which acting makes the movie more fun, comedic material that is more than just crap in your pants, and a pretty good plot, despite the fact that its classic idlers against the evil rich guy. and the only thing I didn’t like about BASEketball was that this child wasn’t really needed in the film, but if this child weren’t in the film, some of the funny scenes wouldn’t exist. If you read any professional reviews about this film, exclude them all, because basically all reviewers did not like this film. Baseball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want. 8 out of 10.
