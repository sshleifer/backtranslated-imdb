I just watched Valentine, and I must say that it was the best slasher I've ever seen in recent years. Unlike the recent horror tendency of the 90s, this film is more about being creepy than smug. For those who hated "Scream", in this film there is not a single mention of the "rules of horror" (although the old rules of the slasher film apply here). <br /> <br /> This is the perfect combination of the horrors of the 80s and 90s. You get the style, cinematography and good performance of films of the 90s and the madness of the pursuers of the 80s. I think that 2001 will finally give the horror fans the films they dreamed of. This is definitely a move in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out here as a funny character. You can say that she liked her role, and that makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.
