High school friends Andre Krigman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrible attack on their high school. When they begin the deadly countdown to their last act of revenge, they begin a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission. <br /> <br /> There is another similar movie called "Elephant." Why am I lifting it? To compare two films, of course. I must say, although I liked Elephant, this film is much better. What is the difference, you ask? Well, first of all, this is filmed differently, largely on the principle of “Cloverfield”, “Project Blair the Witch” and “Diary of the Dead”. This makes the film even better, because it is much more painfully realistic. <br /> <br /> But I was struck by how the film wanted to show “the other side of the story.” You will get acquainted with these two arrows, unlike the "Elephant". I really cared about one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This film actually makes you sympathetic to these people, and this is good, because it is not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I almost cried in this movie. Characters are real people with logic and reasons for their actions. You understand them. Not that they wanted to kill people for attention. In general, this film is emotionally exciting and very intrusive and much better than Elephant.
