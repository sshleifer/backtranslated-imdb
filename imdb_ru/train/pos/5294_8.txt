“Pecker” proves that Waters is not going to change his bad taste in old age. Since Waters began making films in the 1960s, a lot has changed, but 40 years later, he still does what he wants. Over the years, the budget of Waters films has increased significantly. This is one of his last productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that connection to the "trailer park". Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child who is obsessed with photography. He lives a quiet life in Baltimore, Maryland, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of the New York art agent (always watchable Lily Taylor), and his life is changing for the worse. Once again, Waters mocks art, fame and heterosexuality. This is not one of his best films, but there is some big animal laughter (Mamma has the best lines in the film!). He is invariably clever and funny, and possesses the same “weird” sensitivity that I loved in the films of Warters.
