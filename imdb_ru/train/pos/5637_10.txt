I just wanted to say that I saw this movie twice, and I like it! The acting is great, and although the plot is similar to Raise Your Voice, I think the plot never gets boring for people who love these things. There are several useful lessons in it, and we see that we can do anything if we try. Incredible movie. I am sure that this is one that I will observe for a long time. Despite the fact that Britney Spears is writing a book, this is a rather realistic story, maybe not about falling in love, but about being different and struggling, but in the end it’s better than everyone, it’s very true for real life. The only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would meet the ideal guy of her dreams, whether she is ugly or average? I doubt..
