Time to strike! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir - Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast - Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Iran. Author: Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, in “Waqt” Vipul Shah we probably found the first bona fide hit of this year. In addition to all the essential ingredients of a commercial Bollywood fare, Waqt has everything you need to get the movie interested in an Indian audience. This is a kind of film that makes the distributor feel happy and reflect on his next visit to Faran! In this “saga of Indian emotions” we have a happy family (not always?) Of three people. Ishvar (Amitabh Bachchan), a postman who became a millionaire (do not ask how! ... there is something about selling toys when delivering letters and all this - seriously - who cares!) Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah)) is a devotee father to Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishvar must make a serious decision about the careless attitude of his son to the duties of life. His love for Aditya, however, leads to his procrastination of a serious problem. However, faced with a situation that will check his race against time, Ishwar has no choice but to throw Aditya out of the house, hoping that the new difficulty can make him more conscious in his own life. But this alleged solution in itself becomes a problem, as the gap between a loving father and son widens, and fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> There is no need to be a rocket scientist to understand that such a story provides ample opportunities for both comedy and drama. So, before the interval, you have an initially funny, and then annoying comedy track of Boman Iran and Rajpal Yadav; and after the break there are moments for your headscarf between Aby and Akki! Writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original Gujarati play “Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu” on which the film is based) does a good job of maintaining narrative fluidity. Dialogues sometimes become inconsistent. It does not help that the songs appear as acne on the face of a teenager and spoil the process. It is clear that a couple of numbers could be done away with. On the front lines, Vipul shows that he has a natural talent for storytelling. “Waqt”, like his previous debut work “Aankhen”, is able to maintain your interest until the last movie. On my own behalf: the swing of emotions was a bit agitated for me. But, judging by the reaction of the audience, she worked at the limit. <br /> <br /> Finally, Waqt is all his performances that make up one point in the overall ranking! Amitabh Bachchan is reliable as always. His energy is visible, as is his age! Chefali demonstrates subtle nuances and fits the superstar at every turn. Boman and Rajpal demolish the house with their history. Priyanka can do little, except to fulfill the careless role of the heroine. When everything is minimized, “Waqt” is Akshay’s car. I have always argued that Akka is as good as his role suits him. Put him in "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and he is fantastic, but in "Bewafaa" he is terribly bad. Here Akki is probably at its best. Whether it is his comic timing or his emotional representations, he is almost perfect. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his previous best attempt was at Aankhen - with the same director and Big B on his side! <br /> <br /> “Waqt” is by no means a memorable movie. This is not the film that will be shown in the best films of our industry. But this one is for the masses. And while the industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit, “Waqt” can just get things done! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> General information is the second actor film Kumar in a row after 'Bewafaa' in which he performs on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
