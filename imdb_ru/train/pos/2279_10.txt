Until then, the flawed "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this film adaptation of "Mother's Night" is very true to the book and keeps the intentions of comedy, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, it was not a Hollywood or idiotic film "Breakfast of Champions". Another good thing about this film is that you donâ€™t have to get acquainted with the book in order to follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). This is probably true for the Breakfast of Champions, but they did such a bad job that you had better just read a book and not watch a movie! Nick Nolte did a great job in this movie.
