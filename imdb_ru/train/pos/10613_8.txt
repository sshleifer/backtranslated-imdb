It is a long-lost gem of horror featuring Sidney Lassick (Carrie and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it's hard to find a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This movie is creepy but cheesy at the same time. It seems that 3 young journalists (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) are going to the small town of Solvang, California, to cover the festival when there is confusion in their hotel room, and they seek refuge in the home of Ernest Keller (Lassik). and his strange wife Virginia. Vicky is left behind, feeling bad, and the other two are sent to shoot their story. Soon she is killed in the house in a VERY stupid way of an unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is beheaded with a closing lid on the vent hole when she falls on her when she is pulled into the basement). Soon, Karen returns, and she is killed in an even more brutal way, burying her face in the lid of the vent. Jennifer struggles with her (former?) Lover on a rather boring plot, and when she returns home, her owners (whom we have already discovered are brother and sister and that everything in the basement is their son) are plotting to try kill her also. Virginia doesn’t quite agree with Ernest’s plan to kill Jennifer, but she is tricked into entering the basement where she meets Junior. Here, the film becomes almost comical, since Junior (hysterically portrayed by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally handicapped person whose actions and movements will cause a few chuckles, even if it is scary. This is where the pace of the film is gaining momentum, and the end is well made. Actors / actresses do an amazing job with the material, especially with Lassik, Furst and Bach, and although this is not the most terrifying film ever made, it is very interesting!
