I could not believe the low rating of 5.6 on IMDb about Johnny Danger when I wrote this review, and I thought that I had to do something to promote this memorable comedy as much as possible. Seriously, to get such a low rating, people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very superficial mind. If you do not like humorous films, do not watch them! Combining absurd humor, a very good story-telling and an outstanding pace, which is given by multiple gags, this film was included in my DVD collection. And this is without mentioning the visual farces embedded here and there, and, of course, the use of Clin D'Oils and Clichés, based on our favorite organized crime films. <br /> <br /> I showed this film to many people and, being presented to him without any special expectations (except, perhaps, watching a comedy) - in my opinion, you need to watch any movie. - they all loved it. Everything is going well, it's not a long time to look, and there are absolutely no slowdowns in the evolution of history, which I think is really simple. Of course, it’s not perfect, some jokes are a little behind, but no film is perfect, especially considering your other opinions. That is why I rated this film as 9 out of 10. This film, in my opinion, is a predecessor, such as “Top Secret” and “Space Balls” in the field of absurd, but well-thought comedies. Which in our time are becoming more and more absurd, reducing thought and ingenuity. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people think that they are properly understood, if they exist at all. As a last word, I would like to say: watch yourself, do not follow Joe’s usual sayings, and if you don’t like it, then you’ll understand that in fact it’s not good for your tastes, which is understandable, but hardly in my opinion .
