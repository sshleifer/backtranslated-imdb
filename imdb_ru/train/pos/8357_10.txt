A wonderful, loosely flowing, often lyrical film that makes you smile, even if there are really shocking incidents along the way. You are inspired by how women are treated, and yet, ultimately, they seem to go very well, and it is a great merit for all stakeholders that so many potentially catastrophic scenes all work very well. This is probably the best performance of Depardieu, of course, its most natural. Jeanne Moreau plays a prominent role, which was supposed to play a very complex role, including energetic sex scenes with a couple of guys at least in half of her age. Miu-Miu is beautiful everywhere, and again she has very difficult scenes. Initially it looks like a dirty swearing / noisy woman-hater joke, but as the plot and characters develop, a much more gentle and honest picture appears. In the end, this uncompromising and audacious film requires respect.
