This is a great folly about a woman from London who marries a tea planter from Ceylon, whom she barely knows. He is full of clich√©s, and Liz Taylor's character is not believable. It has a wonderful set, some exotic location videotapes. This shows Taylor in the midst of her beauty. She looks amazing.
