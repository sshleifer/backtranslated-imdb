Just one of the best! Adaptation by Richard Brooks of Truman Capote's science fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (which was supposed to win an Oscar), the ghostly score of Quincey Jones and the stunning performances of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as strangely murdered killers. This film was 0 to 4 at the Oscar and was not even nominated for the best picture, while Dr. Dolittle was. Go figure it out! <br /> <br /> Although you are not familiar with the Clutter family as well as in the book, it was the right decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the painful process of tracking these guys. way down. John Forsyth is as impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake in second place. Highly recommended!
