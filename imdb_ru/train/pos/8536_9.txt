Recently, I received the opportunity to watch the Water Dance, and I really liked it. I do not really understand why this is so called, because there are no dances there, except, perhaps, dances in a strip club near the end. We are introduced to the main characters throughout the film, people with disabilities in the hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically healthy guy and a healthy woman, and this is a very cute story. Unfortunately, today you can not watch such films. I'm not “stuck in a time warp,” I'm not saying that everything was better in the 80s and early 90s than today, but I really think that the film industry is getting worse, and we can learn a lot from old movies, by the old ones Movies anything from 1920-1998.
