I remember watching this film as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO showed it late at night when they were the only and only existing channel to pay for movies. At the time, it was unRATTATED and was the only film of its kind ever shown on pay-TV ... especially then. I would like to see it now as an adult, where I would be more inclined to understand the adult topic of this. It was probably the closest thing I've ever seen pornography at the young age of 7 or 8. Fortunately, I had stupid nannies and party current parents on weekends. Much of my memory of this film was the completely promiscuous sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into homes to smell underwear, eat unfamiliar breast milk on a public bus and commit adultery in a taxi at the request of one of their subjects - these are just a few of the shoots that these guys performed. Very colorful film of the early 70s. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea what this movie was like. Most of the people I communicate with have never heard of it.
