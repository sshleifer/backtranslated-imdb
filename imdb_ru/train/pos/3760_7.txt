He may not have claimed the Academy Award and, admittedly, this is pretty silly, but it's so much fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Attractive, optimistic and fun, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I love “Excellent Adventures,” “Fake Journey” is funnier to me. Death is frivolous, and Bill and Ted are even more adorable. People get upset about the fact that I love this film, but only very pretentious viewers will say that it is not very interesting. If you like it, you will probably also be a fan of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, though stupid, they make you smile and turn over your tickling box. So watch them only for hitting and giggling !!
