Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist master of the first order, expressing the Path through his sublime ephemeral art. Indeed, time and change are what his work is mainly about. I bought his first book a few years ago, and my family admired it many times. So it was a pleasure to meet the artist personally through this film, he is as patient and gentle as one would expect, and can say some wonderful things about the natural world, the most profound of which are expressed in his casual inability to say it in words . It is like most children who play in the fresh air alone (if they do more), making things out of sticks, sand, mud and snow before they outgrow. Mr Goldsworthy was given the gift and mission to expand this kind of game in order to create deep visions of nature and open our often weary eyes to it in new brilliant ways. And always with the greatest respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering and amazing monk.
