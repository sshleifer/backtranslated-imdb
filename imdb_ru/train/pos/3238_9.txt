Finnish version of the “Short Ways” by Robert Altman, installed in the small rural town of Janekoski. Episodes are a kaleidoscope of eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disappointment, hopelessness and death. I was especially impressed with the two episodes. The first is the story of a young waitress who is trying to stir up a romance for her employees: she radiates the all-consuming joy of love and life. In another episode in the hospital, an old man dies, and his wife tries to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way the old couple fights with their demeaning actions in the hospital, and their loneliness contrasts with the "routine" of the hospital team (despite signs of casual sympathy). Compared to the classic Altman, this film is probably less professional, but it is definitely a great work of art.
