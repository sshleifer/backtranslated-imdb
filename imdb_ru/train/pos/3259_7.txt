This is not the best romantic comedy ever created, but it is certainly very pleasant and watchable. It is directed in the old fashioned way, and it works great. Cybill Shepard in the role of Corinne not bad copes with the role of a woman who can not survive the death of her husband. She has sexual maturity. But I can't say much for Ryan O'Neill, like Philip, because he is, at best, nondescript. He may be adequate in this role, but this is not enough. <br /> <br /> However, I have a feeling that some of the characters, in particular Alex and Miranda, are not written deeply enough. We don’t know anything about them, because a few minutes after their appearance, the story becomes more and more intense, and the writers don’t tell us what happens next. But this problem was saved, because Mary Stuart Masterson has the freshness of sweetness to adorn her, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that she melts the screen. Even his smile is infectious. And it so happened that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for deja va scenes and memories. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film is light and light, and if you like it so much, why not try it. <br /> <br />
