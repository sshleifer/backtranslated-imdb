Re: Pro Jury <br /> <br /> Although the main actress is TERRIBLY beautiful, the plot has little chance of acceptance, because too many distracting details collide with the audience during the unfolding of the story. <br /> <br /> Someone may believe that middle-school students in the 1950s easily gave up their virginity without thinking about marriage with 30-year-olds, whom they barely know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> “EASY TO GIVE FORWARD VIRGINITY"? WHAT IS ABSENT FROM THE CARD ABOUT THIS FILM. PRESENT. <br /> <br /> We can assume that young high school students are very confident and confident in themselves, because they communicate with their elders in difficult social situations, but my experience was most often teenagers feel very awkward and awkward when they experiment in the adult world. <br /> <br /> YOU JUST CAN'T SEE THE WORLD OTHER THAN THROUGH YOUR EYES “IT'S BAD. <br /> <br /> Someone might believe that an experienced doctor wouldn't know about the pungent smell of stropthomy on - a stinking fermenting by-product of occupied terrestrial microbes - and would not have discovered that some lifeless soft powder is counterfeit, but I think not. <br /> <br /> AND OTHER "EXPERT" OPINION CREATED FROM EXPERIENCE. DANDY . <br /> <br /> Someone may believe that 30-year-old troublemakers may enter a public school dormitory during school parties and hang out there, creating problems, but I think school social networks are traditionally protected environments. , and parents, chaparons and school personnel will be close by prevent it. <br /> <br /> NOW BE A GOOD SPORT AND TELL US IN WHAT THE INSTITUTION WHICH YOU CALL. <br /> <br /> One final nit, throughout Hello, Baba Riba, five teenage friends called themselves the Four. There is probably an explanation as to why FIVE were FOURTHS, but since it was never detailed, each link distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> COURSE, PLEASE AN EXPLANATION. Good job finding out that! NOW, THERE WILL BE A MAD A COXSWAIN. <br /> <br /> This movie does not sound believable to me. <br /> <br /> WE MUST ALL APPEAL TO YOUR COMPETENT AND GOOD OPINION. DUDE.
