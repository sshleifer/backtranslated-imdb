Manhattan residents have to put up with all sorts of inconveniences. Worst of all, lack of space in the closet! Some people who eat out all the time use their stoves and dishwashers as storage places because the cabinets are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great team of comedy writers of that era, saw the potential in Roman Erik Hodgins, whose hero, Jim Blandings, cannot transfer the cramped apartment in which he and his wife Muriel and two daughters must share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, Madison Avenue. executive, was it! When he sees the announcement of life in Connecticut, he decides to take a look. Obviously, the first owner, Jim, is deceived by a real estate agent so that he can buy a dilapidated house, which he inspects with an unscrupulous agent. This is just the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Whatever happens, everything goes wrong. The architect is asked to come up with a plan that does not work for a new house, after the original is destroyed. Since one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and, no matter how low the cost, this leads to an overpriced price that Jim cannot afford. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny because of three principles in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he played and benefited the most from Jim Blanding. Myrna Loy was a delightful actress who was always effective playing with Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, Mirnaâ€™s old boyfriend, who became Blandings lawyer, is suave and awesome, as Melvin Douglas portrayed him. One of the Blandings girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffet, who very strangely resembles Eva Marie Saint. The great Louise Beaver plays Gussie, but has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> The film was photographed with love by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this film look much better. Direction X.S. Potter is easy, and he succeeded in this film, which will delight fans of classic comedies.
