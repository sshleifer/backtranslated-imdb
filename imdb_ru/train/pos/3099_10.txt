Along with Brothers and Sisters, Six Degrees was one of my favorite new dramas of the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> Great cast, but he really liked the work of Campbell Scott) and Hope Davis (the recent widow of a journalist killed in Iraq). <br /> <br /> Aside from the acting, the text was fresh and the acting excellent. The show was also filmed in New York, in a real city, and not in Warner Bros. or some other studio, adding an extra layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the latest “Survivor” and other trash of reality. It is a pity that it did not last.
