Charming in all respects, this movie is perfect if you are in a good mood. If you like jazz music, this is a must see. If you like to see cute characters that make you smile, you can cause tears in your eyes and sway, as if tomorrow this film is not for you. If you are looking for an intense, deep, heavy work of art that needs to be analyzed and analyzed, you may be better off sticking with Darren Aronofsky (in other words, djjohn reviewer makes it easier, don't you know a good time when you see it?)!) the only complaint was that the film was too short. I think I just have to watch it a few more times to gain strength.
