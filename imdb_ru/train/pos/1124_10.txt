I agree with all the honors, I went through a box of napkins while watching this movie. He had a tough authenticity, and he sounded believable in all respects. <br /> <br /> The question that I am going to raise reflects current sensitivities regarding the treatment of animals. I had a very difficult time when I started killing sheep and goats, and the dying deer with a throbbing neck and blood running out of life was disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is the age of "no animals were injured in the production of this step." Iphigenia was made in the late 70s before the advent of computer simulation. Could these animal deaths be faked? Or were these animals killed for art ?
