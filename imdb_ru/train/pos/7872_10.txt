The first review, which I saw, said: “What does Madhur Bhandarkar finally want to say?”. If he says something so decisive. <br /> <br /> The best thing about page 3 is that it does not take sides. No propaganda at all. This is a film that covers so many aspects of the problem (I don’t know what I call the “problem” here), and yet, like any mediocre film, it does not offer a solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the film ended almost in the same scenario as it began. <br /> <br /> The film defines so many characters who have completely different priorities and different ideologies, and yet they are all part of a system that is even more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there would be more spoilers ahead. So look if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent times.
