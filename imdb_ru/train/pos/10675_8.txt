I have long wanted to watch this movie, being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines thanks to this role of juvenile. Thank God for Turner Classic, which showed the show last week. I can imagine that after the war there were many problems with children, especially with what happened in the 1950s. Some of the boys are a bit scary. Of course, I would not like to meet them in a well-lit street, the more dark. There were some good ideas about the feelings of the bug, or, as it is called, the firefly.
