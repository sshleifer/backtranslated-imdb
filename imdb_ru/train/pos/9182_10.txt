Those who love the book of Jane Eyre as much as I do (she is my favorite, and I re-read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just too good to be Mr. Rochester, but other than that, he does an amazing job portraying the thoughtful master Thornfield. Zelach Clark may have been too old to play 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I donâ€™t think about the age of the characters. The dialogue from the film is taken almost verbatim from a book that was very clever. Of course, this film may seem a bit long, but this is the only version I have seen that includes part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I would like the people who made this film to be involved in the newer Zeferelli version, as this would help this mess of the film. <br /> <br /> I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell was playing "Aunt Reed"! It is so universal that I did not recognize it. She plays Daisy in "Preservation of Appearance", and also played Mrs Musgrove in "Persuasion" (another great adaptation) in 1995. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: You have a DVD this week, and it's very nice to see the original unedited version. There is much more in the beginning (Young Jane in Gateshead and Lovewood). And in the end, they restored a lot (I always wondered why St. John had a piece of paper when he revealed that he knows who Jane is ... because the part where he pulls it from her picture was edited from US VHS versions!). Rosamund Oliver in this ... she was completely cut from VHS. As far as I can tell, they have not edited any part of Timothy Dalton, so there is nothing new there, but it's great to see the entire mini-series in its entirety after all these years of enjoying VHS. Thank you, BBC (PS ... I would pay more for a special DVD release ... perhaps with some interviews with the stars ... or making the show)
