Blonde and Blonder have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene, and if you want more from the movie, you are completely unreasonable. It seems that in the later era “Carry On”, when the series was no longer a blazing track, but it was even more fun than not, think “Behind” or “England” and you will not be too far from the goal. Pamela and Denise are sparkling, charming and clearly aware that this is not a masterpiece that they do, although you can give it to me in many things that I have been told to like. The maintenance compound is energetic, even if some of them are not particularly good; I can not see a couple of unexpected turns in the film, which is almost forgotten, and something that changes a lot, so just smile. I really think Blond and Blonder are an ace and I hope you hate me for it.
