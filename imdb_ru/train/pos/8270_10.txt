This is an extraordinary film that constantly deceives you. It seems that he is moving toward a cliché at several points, and then something amazing will happen that is truly amazing. It would be too much to say much more, but stick to this film and you will be richly rewarded. William Haynes is absolutely amazing - he is certainly a star deserving to be rediscovered. Gay overtones in his relationship with Jack Pikford is striking - there is even a scene where Haynes rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this subtext subtly and with great depth of emotions, so there are moments that are very exciting. And I never thought that I could participate in a football match the same way as in this film - and I don’t even understand the rules! Also the son of Francis X. Bushman Ralph is excellent as a rival Haynes for a girl (yes, this is not exactly a gay movie). Wonderful quiet classics - a great example of the twenties of commercial cinema with sharpness.
