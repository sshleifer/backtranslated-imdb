I was a young cinematographer in 1979, when the Union of Soviet Cinematographers came to Sofia-Bulgaria and showed Konchalovsky’s premiere of the Siberian Tiara; "Stalker" Tarkosvki and "Autumn Marathon" Danelia'a. I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then I saw the epic “Siberia” for 4 and a half hours and was speechless. Much better than the "1900" Bertolucci. Of course! <br /> <br /> I hope Andron will sometime get to the negative and someday make the “restored version of the director complete”! On the DVD of course! Also, I desperately fought in defense of this Kino against most of my colleagues, who equated a Soviet film with a bad taste! Time is on my side.
