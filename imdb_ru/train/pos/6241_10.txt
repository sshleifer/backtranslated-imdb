At first I had a reaction that many people had with when they saw it: the shots of fat people, sunbathing, etc., were in some ways cheap. OK, so he meets with Diana Arbus. , , no difference. but it was not long before I realized that it was not done in an inhuman way as the images unfold, I felt that the problem was completely the audience: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also films almost everywhere to feel what to watch, people over a certain age behave sexually - this is something indecent, something that should not be shown. If this were all that the film offered, it would be great. however, the story of a woman with an abusive guy and his drunken friend is really amazing, like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible ideas, and thinking that the scene was improvised. this blond guy is a brilliant actor. Finally, I want to contradict those who say that this film is about how pitiful all these people are. the old man who is preparing for a woman who is finally dancing for him is a completely normal character who breaks this form, so do not oversimplify the film by losing sight of it. yes his dog is being killed. This is not a rosy picture of the world, but it is not. completely hopeless. In any case, I was very grateful to the director for making such a beautiful film. I would not say that all the themes were as strong as the strongest ones, but I say that this film basically hits the ass and I highly recommend it. ,,
