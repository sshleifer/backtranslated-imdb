12-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Yevgeny. His feelings are held back by the fact that his family cannot interact with him (or thinks that this is wrong). His ONLY refuge is his grandfather, the only one who seems to have compassion for him. Realism will entice film lovers with “true life”, but will not satisfy those who want action and thrill.
