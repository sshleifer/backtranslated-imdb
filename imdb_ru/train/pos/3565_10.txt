Guys and Dolls is a unique character-based game. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-end player who makes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs money so that he can <br /> <br /> run his regular game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky would not be able to take a single girl with him to Havana, Cuba, and the “doll” he chose was Sarah Brown, who was in charge of the missionary . Skye finally captivates <br /> <br /> Sarah, enough to go with him to Havana. They end up falling in love with each other, but later she blames him for something he did not participate in. Nathan led a missionary game on a missionary night when they were gone. 14-year-old fiance Nathan Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) does not approve of Nathan’s gambling and is trying to prevent him from doing so. However, when the film ends, it all ends in a happy double wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this film are great, no matter who sings. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no singing voice at all, and it’s true that he could be baptized, but it didn’t matter. He did an excellent job with acting (obviously, this is Brando) and played his character very well. I saw several films with Gene Simmons and thought that this film was her weakest, she also could not sing at all. However, the singing consists of Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kay also participated in the original Broadway play "Guys and Dolls." Vivien Blaine had a terrific voice, and she was the perfect Adelaide. If you like a musical, and even if you dislike it, I advise you to watch it.
