Quick and easy, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As some others have already mentioned, I am also not from the south, I donâ€™t really like country music and I never wore a cowboy hat. (I never drove a car with a dead body in my trunk, but I love Goodfellas.) It's just a great movie. Filmed with a 2.35 aspect ratio and beautifully transferred to DVD. (VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 for your enjoyment. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a great love / hate story in Texas with great views. Travolta is fantastic. Next to "Pulp Fiction" is the best that he did. It has been in my top five for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Check it out !!! This is 10 !!!!
