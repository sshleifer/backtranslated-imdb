If you can't enjoy watching chicks, stop right now. However, if you like movies that illustrate complex characters and provide an extraordinary game, read on. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord dies. Her two daughters arrive to be at her bedside. Ann begins to talk about people from her past that her daughters are not aware of, and they wonder if these lost acquaintances are real or imaginary. They understand that these people from their mother’s past are really real. <br /> <br /> The story changes mainly between 1953 and 2000, when Ann saw a glimpse of life in those years. In 1953, Ann met the love of her life and experienced the greatest tragedy of her life. <br /> <br /> One of Ann’s two best friends from college, Leela, is getting married. Ann's best friend is Leela's brother, Buddy. Leela and Buddy are from a wealthy Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer living in Greenwich Village who wants to be a free spirit, but is still bound by many of the conventions of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Soon after Ann arrives to be a maid of honor at Leela's wedding, she meets a man who will become a key character in the life of these three - Harris. He is the adult son of a former family servant who grew up with Leela and Buddy and became a doctor in a small town in New England. Ann immediately falls in love with Harris, which adds to the complication of the fact that Leela has always been in love with Harris and continues to love him. Buddy is also in love with Harris, but, being in 1953, he redirected this homosexual desire of Harris to his good friend Ann, because he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual desire for another man. Buddy outwardly shows his inner disappointment with being an alcoholic and a wise bad guy in the family - much to the chagrin of his very correct and caring parents. <br /> <br /> All these expressions are expressed and suppressed. emotions lead to tragedy - after all, it’s just a chick. <br /> <br /> Currently, Ann’s daughters have moved away from their mother and are suffering from their own life realizations and doubts. Constance seeks emotional exhaustion, trying to maintain herself as an ideal mother and wife. Nina, always feeling worse, can not maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Shuffle all these relationships for fifty years, and you get an intriguing look at society, its values ​​and its impact on the individual. and the actions of the complex people involved. <br /> <br /> All the performances in the Evening are excellent, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this film so, very special. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays Ann in the 1950s, and she does it in a style that clearly shows the intelligent woman of her time, who is in conflict with what she has to do, and not with what she wants to do. Her performance is not so easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann, whose mind moves from the present to the past, to flights of fancy, and, of course, Redgrave copes with all the sterling style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - the real daughter of Redgrave - plays in the film Ann's daughter, Constance. The scenes between this real mother and the daughter playing a fictional mother and daughter are an insightful viewing pleasure. <br /> <br /> Tony Collett plays another daughter Ann, Nina. Nina spends a lot of time in depression and self-pity, not letting out a kind man who loves her as much as her mother and sister. Collett is perfect for a role like this, but I have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable role, no matter what role she plays. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gammer plays Leela of the 1950s and shows us a woman who is even more conflicted with her expected role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, the mother of Gammer, plays modern Leela. What else can be said about Meryl Streep, except that she always gives an insightful and useful presentation. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai, in his DVD supplements, states that he was looking for Glenn Clowes to play the relatively small role of Leela’s mother because he felt that she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the movie. He was right, of course, and Close's performance in this one scene captures that in your memory. In all the other scenes in which Close is Leela's very suitable mother, and you get another show for the treasure. <br /> <br /> There are three more scenes in the film, in combination with the image of Close, described above, which make the whole movie worth watching. On Leela’s wedding day, Ann enters her room and climbs into bed with her friend to discuss Leela’s misgivings about her upcoming wedding with a man whom she clearly does not love. This scene repeats itself fifty years later when Leela comes and crawls into bed with her dying girlfriend Ann to tell about the life they lived in. In this last scene, Strip and Redgrave are fascinating. <br /> <br /> Another memorable scene - at least for me - is when Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us the heartbreaking role of a young man torn by his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is superb. <br /> <br /> Chick Flick? Yes. A special film with an incredible acting, directing and scenery? Definitely. I can not recommend the evening too much.
