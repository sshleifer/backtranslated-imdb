Despite the fact that this topic of preaching as the saving grace of mankind has been slightly proclaimed, it is still a stunning film that anticipates sci-fi blockbusters with special effects that will take another 40 years to appear on a silver screen. It predicts the global chaos of World War II, but broadens the premise, having a conflict of the past 30 years, and then tells an epic story about a man’s struggle from under the rubble into the jungle of space. The action seems wooden and oddly sterile, but it is probably the result of its contrast with the visual effects, which must have been quite exciting during the film’s release, and which are still impressive today. This is a film that no one is interested in the SF genre.
