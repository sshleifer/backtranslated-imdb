The choice to make this movie SNL in the movie was much better thought out than other recent ones. The humor that characterizes a character is not annoying humor, and is also sufficiently motivated to stretch for an hour or two. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, it seemed that sexual content could have been avoided, but it could because the limitations of live television made me not expect it. I guess I thought about the risk of "Leisure Suit Larry" more than the producers ... <br /> <br /> This is definitely not a PG-13 film, which will probably hurt him when he reaches the heights of his more successful predecessors. , but still a better premise and composition than its darker ones. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but I doubt that it will be a hit ... (which is sad, because Tim Meadows is inclined not to make characters that annoy me with such frequency as other SNL graduates)
