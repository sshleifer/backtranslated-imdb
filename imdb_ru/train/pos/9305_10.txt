This is an excellent independent work that is not related to anything before or after. Kruning Brat Pack and the exclusivity of clubs are not my favorite cookies, but in this lawless world they create a tempting atmosphere. The film is filled with our guys, distinctive actors who add differences to this work with winning performances. Dialogue is joy. In fact, this is a new native language. One of the few films that you can watch repeatedly with deep appreciation. <br /> <br /> Among the highlights are the British rudeness of Billy Idol, the spiritual mastery of Ben London, Kyle's tortuosity and an overview of special philosophies.
