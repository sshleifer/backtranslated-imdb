It should be one of the best serial killer films I've ever seen, and it’s from someone who absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs. HBO won the jackpot here. This film is irresistible from first to last. <br /> <br /> There are so many fundamental things in this film that it’s hard to say exactly what it is about. He chronicles a decade-long search for Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives brilliantly discreet work as an inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland is an even more exciting performance as his cynical boss and the only person in the Russian government who wants to help him. Both of their performances - subtle masterpieces - Ri begins to be naive and does not want to compromise, while Sutherland begins to step back and is almost surprised at this situation. Toward the end, Rea is becoming increasingly tired of the world and conquered by the system, while Sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other film I would say that Sutherland's performance stands out from the rest, but here even Geoffrey Duhmann competes with him, like the serial killer himself. DuMann brilliantly creates here a character who inspires sympathy, not hatred, which we think we will discover - he is a monster, but he does not want that, and we understand that he is just as disgusted with what he does . He is tormented, shamed, but angry. <br /> <br /> If you can take an incredibly dark object (and it is * very * disturbing), then you should watch this movie.
