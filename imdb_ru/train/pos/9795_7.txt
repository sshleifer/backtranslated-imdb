I have always said that the Batman animated films were much better than live action movies. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the animated films, but of all, this is the poorest, and it is quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> “The Ghost Mask” will be considered the best, then “The Best in the World”, then “Sub-zero”, then “The Return of the Joker”, and, finally, it is the last. <br /> <br /> In this latest animated film, a mysterious new actress has appeared in Gotham, and Batman intends to find out whether she is a friend or an enemy when she goes in search of revenge. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce contacts the three young women, he begins to investigate them and discovers who the new participant is. <br /> <br /> The tone in this film is extraordinarily light, given that most films are dark and bleak, which is quite disappointing. Most of the time, Bruce behaves strangely, the character of the villains is reused in recent films, and although the action films are exciting, there really is nothing new about them. He also lacks the dramatic influence that other films have, especially the “Sub-Zero” film, which was heavy in drama and character development. <br /> <br /> Everything in the film looks pretty reworked, and the minor characters are charming, but no one really should be cheering for. <br /> <br /> All this time I really enjoyed it, I had a blast, and the identity of the new participant in the fight was amazing, but it was not as exciting as I would hope. <br /> <br /> (** half of ****)
