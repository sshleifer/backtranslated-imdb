It comes out of left field, and really not what you expect. But I love it. The most memorable impressions of the film come from astonishment, if you ask me. If you have not been told about the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... you will have fun. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic, but not so stretching that it is palpable. The special effects appear out of nowhere (seriously, it looks like a strangely dark romantic comedy until they do it - then WOW), and they are great. General cinematography is simple for the eyes, editing and sound of very good quality, and the distorted story unfolds without cliches. Although none of these aspects make it a blockbuster individually, “what the hell?” Factor ONE makes the film a treasure. <br /> <br /> People who shoot this film do not make sense. This is one of those often overlooked films of the 90s that you have never heard of or love so much that you jump at the mention of its name. <br /> <br /> I am in the last group.
