Although this film put Davis at stake because of her brilliantly hard work as an illiterate waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this film is strangely unsatisfactory for me as a whole. The game is really good in all respects. What I cannot understand for my life is how or why Philip, a sensitive, educated young man, would constantly be subjected to insults that this vagabond constantly brings on him: I consider his naive tolerance to be absolutely incredible incredible in certain respects . Yes, I know that he is a sensitive club introvert. But Davis is so poisonous a witch that none of such cultured people will tolerate her relationships or actions and make them believable. Davis is striking in her role: yes, she can dwell on her story from time to time, but this is a very creative image, no matter how you look at it. It is a pity that she did not play gangster malice. Her character would be quite plausible, like a vagabond among people with low living standards!
