Although I really did not feel anything about the character of Lance, and felt that his wife could have been much better with anyone else. It could have been a much stronger movie, if they had spent more time on character development, perhaps with Lance - I would have liked it more. <br /> <br /> However, I have to completely agree with DoyleLuver when they said, “And I will quote Glenn Quinn Ben’s character:“ I’m a star here, that's right, I’m talented! "" If you are watching a movie, just watch it, even when it is in the background ... just the expression on his face, everything is in his eyes, you know exactly what motivates Ben, how he treats comments, even if it’s a peek behind the back character. Great game in an honest movie.
