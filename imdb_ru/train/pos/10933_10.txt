Be careful with this. As soon as you get your gloves, this will change your look at kung fu movies. You will miss the plot of all the kung-fu movies, you will need the character's depth and development, you will crave for mystery and unpredictability, you will need dynamic work with the camera and incredible backgrounds. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects together in one kung fu movie, EXCEPT for five deadly poisons! <br /> <br /> Easily the best Kung Fu movie of all time, Venoms blends a rich plot full of twists and turns with colorful (and developed) characters, as well as some of the best camera work that appeared in the 70s . The success of someone who likes the movie depends on the ability of the audience to determine which character is, and who specializes in what kind of poison. One - Centipede, two - Snake, three - Scorpio, four - Lizard and five - Toad. Each character has its own characteristics, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. This is the catch, we learn with the student character, find out who these different people are. We are in his place (so to speak), and we must choose whom we trust and who do not, just like him. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot, characters, and camera work great, it's also interesting to see what makes it more valuable in my book than almost any other movie of this kind. It is worth a lot of hours to understand everything that is happening. Venoms is a lesson about what Kung Fu can actually do ... just donâ€™t expect many other Kung Fu movies to justify their difficulties.
