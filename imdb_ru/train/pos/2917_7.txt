Although this film is by no means a classic, it is very interesting to me. I saw it about 15 years ago on HBO and loved the movie. He was written by the same guy who wrote and directed Arthur, and although he is not as funny as this film, he shows the potential that Steve Gordon has achieved with Arthur.
