This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being an LDS, I highly recommend this film because you can better understand the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film was not filmed with highly acclaimed actors, it is a wonderful and life-changing film that everyone may like. I saw this film with my family, and I can testify that we all have changed opinion. This film allows people to really understand how hard life was for the prophet, and what difficulties he faced. After I watched this film, there was not a single dry eye in the whole room. Everyone was touched by what they saw, and I was not the way I saw it. I highly recommend this film to everyone.
