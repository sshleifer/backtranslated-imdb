I loved this movie when I was little. Today, at 17, this is one of my favorite cartoons. Beautiful animation and attractive characters - these are two things that appeal to this movie. Although many people may not like some of the songs, most of them are well made and agree with the story. The focus is on Charlie, the fraudulent handsome German Shepard, who at first may seem unattractive to some ... but in the end, you will be interested. <br /> <br /> No film for children. Often it is very dark and scary at times. A treat for Don Bluth fans and animation lovers. But keep the fabric handy. ADGTH will never make me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to movies. Perhaps one of the greatest non-Disney animated films of all time. Together with Watership Down and my neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: a heavenly masterpiece.
