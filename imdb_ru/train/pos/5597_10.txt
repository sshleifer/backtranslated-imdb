Le Locataire (The Tenant) is without a doubt one of the most important horror films ever made. Polanski plays the role of Trelkovsky, a timid clerk living in Paris who responds to an advertisement for an apartment, only to find that the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of an apartment. Trelkovsky is forced to visit her in the hospital, and there he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trelkovsky immediately moves when the previous tenant dies, and, at first, very satisfied, he found such a nice apartment. His happiness will soon be replaced by waves of paranoia, as he is becoming more suspicious of his neighbors, who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the suicide of the previous tenant. This movie is great. Polanski manages to create a surrealistic atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Many bright moments, such as the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers a previous tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall, or a feverish sleep when he wanders into a building. In the bathroom you can find walls covered with hieroglyphs. Sven Nykvist's photo is truly beautiful. "Tenant" - an abandoned stone. It may be difficult to track, but worth it.
