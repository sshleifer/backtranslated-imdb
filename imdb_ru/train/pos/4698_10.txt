Like wine, Johnny Danger is getting better and better every day. This clever, witty, well-played film may well do on its own - but, as a parody of the gangster genre, it is truly outstanding. In fact, this is by far the best film of its kind ... the most ridiculous mock movie parody and even the corresponding period â€” although, admittedly, this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive ones vulgar and boring pseudo-comedies like "Mafia Jane Austen."
