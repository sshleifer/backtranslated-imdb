As a person who was born from a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a prison camp), I come from a unique position. One of them is to deal with various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of World War II on the other. This miniseries cannot delve into every bit of Hitler’s psyche and should give the viewer a general idea of ​​the situation at that time and as well as possible, like Hitler’s mental state. In this series, all is well. Carlisle is very good, like O'Toole, but I would like to get more information about relations with others in the party, because Hitler did nothing on his own. Around him were people who followed him to the letter often without question and, of course, without question later in his murderous career. What happened in the minds of Goebbels, Goering and Hess? It would be helpful to see more of this relationship. But I hope that this will make people explore the subject more. It can also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to remain in power.
