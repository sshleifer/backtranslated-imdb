quote by Nicholas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, Texas: “It's a beautiful film, but the DVD is“ reformatted for television ”, April 8, 2002 - This is a charming and emotional film. On the other hand, the DVD I bought is “reformatted to fit your TV" with comedies in Columbia Tristar. There is no excuse that the film is not presented in widescreen format, except that Hollywood views all films as moronic to do. What a shame. " br /> <br /> What a (criminal!) shame really. However, there is another version. For details, see http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br /> Wonderful performances of the two main actors (King and Dog).
