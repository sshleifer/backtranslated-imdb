If you are looking for a Hollywood action for children with a common bad language and violence, perhaps this is not the film that is worth it. On the other hand, if you are interested in watching a film with your children, in which there are some values, for example, showing the importance of friendship and truth, then this film is worth seeing. Looking at the program guide, this is obviously what millions of other viewers found. Not many low-budget independent films have ever been broadcast in the same way as Mr. Atlas. The film is actually very funny as well as hearty and shows some beautiful places, expertly captured with the sharp eye of the obvious brilliant cinematographer Suki Medanevych. Also, if you are interested in looking at a muscular guy with a beautiful appearance, ladies can get a full eye. Let's support those who make a good children's film by buying their videos and watching their products on TV. enjoy
