This film was excellent. I did not expect this to justify all deceptions, but it did. As with all Bourne films, the action is quick, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two films from the trilogy, you will also like this one. The plot of the film is simple and there are no plot twists that are too unreal. Well, Julia Stiles' character, who appeared in an Italian asylum, was partly contrived, especially after what happened in "Excellence", but it makes sense that she is the only character in "Treadstone" that Born knows who does not want he died, and he could trust the only person leading him in the right direction. The action is controlled by the characters and their reaction to what is happening around them. What I always liked about the Bourne films is that Born can kick his ass, but when he approaches people as good as he does, fighting is a struggle and he takes a lot of damage on them. They never treat the public as idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were solid in their speeches. I believe that Damon could play Born in a dream and received excellent support from Joan Allen, repeating her role in the movie “Excellence”, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this film and trilogy. Although I miss Franca Potente.
