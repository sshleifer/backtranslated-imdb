If you loved the Long Way Round, you will enjoy it almost the same. It is informative, fun, interesting and intense. Charlie shares a screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent operators and too much Russ. Ewan appears several times, but Charlie really does it alone. He is funny, attractive and still a puddle of stress and doubt. Great stuff! <br /> <br /> The series ends in 7 episodes. Like the LWR, the training is almost as interesting as the race. Although they cover all aspects of the race well, a more detailed explanation can be found about trucks and cars that are simply mentioned and are rarely found in races. This is a film about a motorcycle, and anyone on two wheels will love it. <br /> <br /> The series features amazing photos, as well as several interviews from the mouth of people. Clap. There is another very catchy subject, like LWR, but it's not as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the USA, God knows when it will come out, so buy it on Amazon.uk and watch on your computer like me. Oh, and get ready to buy another bike.
