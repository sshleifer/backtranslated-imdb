when I read another comment, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> Firstly, Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli were specially played; good enough ... <br /> <br /> The film is very intelligent and interesting, because there are many international, especially European, actors and actresses in the film, such as Turkey and Russia ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot is basic, and you can guess, but if you are interested in an action, a good game, you will like ... <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the final chapter is not special or interesting, it is as usual and other action movies .. <br /> <br /> Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... And I hope you enjoy it: D
