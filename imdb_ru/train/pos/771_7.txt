I watched a movie with a homophobic friend, my wife and her friend. So I had views from all sides. Mostly, the film made me laugh, there was really no sexual tension, and the only notable actors were Tudor Cyril and Maria Popistas. Yes, I think she played her role well, even if the script was inappropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just didn’t have any difficult roles. I welcome that Puaia is entering the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope that he will be a good actor. <br /> <br /> Although my wife liked the film, and I think that there may have been chords played and for which I did not have an ear. If the film tried to present unusual sexual behavior and its consequences in present-day Romania, it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that girls really are a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why he won all these BAFTA awards. In my book, he was to receive the award “Better lucky the next time.” (Bafta = good luck in Romanian).
