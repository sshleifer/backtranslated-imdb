I'm a pretty old dude, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke, as they were 50-55 years ago, when every taste for a child was fresh. I wish I could somehow put aside some sort of magic locker so that I can try these things today. This magic locker may have even changed the structure of food to explain how I drifted, physically and otherwise, a kind of dynamic chemistry of expectations. For half a century, they would have to adapt a bit, because, you see, I would know that I set them aside. Eating one now would be a celebration of oneself and the past, stories and feelings that would almost make intermediate years an expected reward. <br /> <br /> I did not have enough sense to do this with the original cola. And I couldn't come up with one of these magical psychic lockers ?? not then. But I did something almost as well. In the seventies, I really tuned in to Roman Polanski. Was he a strange and exotic pleasure ?? You know, films smuggled out of the Soviet bloc. Films are so sensitive to beauty that you cry weeks later. The films that make you want to live with Polish women, alone, and then decide that they will be the last to receive it. <br /> <br /> That's what I did. I took what I knew was my favorite film of Polanski, and put it aside. I have not watched it. I put it off until I thought I would be big enough to deserve it. For many years, I tested myself, my ability to surround beauty and delineate it, without occupying it. Probably few Poles worked on it to practice, to earn Chopin. I work to earn femininity when I see it. Trying to pull the insides out of the edges. <br /> <br /> Recently, I achieved a kind of confidence that it was time to pull it out. I already knew that the time had passed when it would have worked optimally, because I had already seen and understood the “9th Gate”. <br /> <br /> If you don’t know this, it’s about an innocent person. rents a room in which the previous tenant (which tells the story) jumped out of the window to die later after visiting this person (played by Polanski). What happens is that time is reset, and he becomes this woman. We are fooled into believing that he is just crazy. But the way we follow him is wrong. He just has flashes, that the world is normal, and that the people around him are not part of the coven that distorts its reality. <br /> <br /> History hardly matters. What matters is how Polanki shapes this thing, both in how it inhabits the eye, which only makes the edges, and in the inhabited body, which consists only of entangled flesh. Two never meet. There is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years. His idea about both inside and out without edges at all ?? except a red wig. <br /> <br /> I don’t know anyone who could do this, this sketch, which remains a sketch, this horror, which remains natural. <br /> <br /> To understand the genius of this, you must know one of the greatest films ever made; "Rear window." The genius of this film is the post-noir idea that the camera shapes the world; that the viewer creates a story. Roman takes this film and turns it inside out. In the back window, the idea was that the on-screen viewer (Jimmy Stewart) was an anchor, and everything else was fiction woven as we watched. Here, on the screen, the resident of the apartment is the director. We know that. We know that everything we see is true, because he is a storyteller. We know that it is true that bodies change identity, times change, that causality is plastic. We know that the storyteller will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in constant horror, on the edge that he imputes, but never shows us and does not allow us to imagine. <br /> <br /> Ted Assessment - 4 of 3: Every experienced person should experience this.
