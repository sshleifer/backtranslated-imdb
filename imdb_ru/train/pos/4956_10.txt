This film is really real and random. Such films are really hard to find in the heaps of films now in Hollywood. I enjoy watching this movie, I bought it a DVD on Tuesday this week and watched it 4 times. I like Spanish Paz with an accent, he is just very cute. And her game with Morgana is so funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My taste of the film may be very different from others, but I must say that I really like this film, idle time is the best! <br /> <I learned something more about life from this film (well, or at least from the life of the USA) ... life is really random ... Sometimes, when you meet someone, they pass by your life and become your friends by coincidence, and you do not spend so much time with them, maybe just some time, but you enjoy this “time” with them, and then you and they will never meet again, but time spent by you together is truly unforgettable. Just remember these moments as grateful and pleasant memories ... <br /> <br /> This film may be cheap for the price, but its values ​​are not cheap at all. I rarely can learn anything from movies, but this is an exception.
