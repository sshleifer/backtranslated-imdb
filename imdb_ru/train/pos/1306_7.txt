An unusually straightforward actor, played by actors and filmed by a director who clearly took the material seriously. Imperfect, as you would expect from a film that was clearly shot with a limited budget, but the drama involves one of those films that, when it repeats itself to nausea on Cinemax 2 or More Max or whatever they call it, you end up watching 40-minute blocks when you have to go to work. Along the W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", a reminder that Winsky is a far more talented director than many of his fellow low-budget brothers who have a real ability to walk in the movie genre when he is actually interested in the material (i.e., don't worry about watching any of his Shannon Tweed movies with 3 or 4 after the title!) Actors who have had too little to do recently (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for chrissakes) really put them all in some of their best roles in the years - as for Grieco, he looks right, although his playing is a bit of a note - it is clear that his character must self-destruct throughout the film, but Greco does not quite convey it. I checked IMDB, and I see that the author also wrote “The Massacre of House Sorority 2” and “Dinosaur Island” for the director - both minor classics in their own rights, but obviously Roger Cormon’s “stupid” cinematographic cinematography is more like some from the best biographies of the 70s Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan, which give you an element of exploitation, but at the same time offer drama - a real step forward. Not “Citizen Kane”, but the comic final moments - a bit subversive, but well written, controlled by a character above average straight-in-video. Small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they appear, which is rarely enough (as I was reminded when I tried to live through Albert Pyun's monster called Heat Seeker one evening) - this low-budget material doesn’t look like - But that's another story!)
