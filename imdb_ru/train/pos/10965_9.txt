Little Edie and Big Edie are characters for whom everyone can feel compassion. Although their house was dirty, for some reason this is understandable, given their mental illness. It was written on the bulletin board that "Little Edie has the skills of coping with an eight-year-old child." It reminded me that in the dramatized version of 2009, Big Edie says to Little Edie: “If you’re stuck, it’s only with you!” These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm faith in their opinions and actions. Perhaps, if Little Edie was not so cruel to herself the first time when something did not work out, losing her hair, work and love of all life, she would have done it. This is somehow related to the fact that, I believe, is her mental illness: her inability to control herself in difficult times and see that good times are still ahead. The world will never know what happened if she had not listened to her mother’s prayer: “Go home, Edie! Let me take care of you! ”<br /> <br /> And yet, for obvious reasons, these unsafe women somehow manage to be brilliant, heartbreaking and sweet, even in their extremely dirty house. These women were unusual, and their interaction with each other brings humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional disruptions telling about what might be, or how she wants to leave the house, because she feels like a little girl, there is a strong desire to hug her and tell her that “everything will be okay! "<br /> <br /> Excellent documentary film !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
