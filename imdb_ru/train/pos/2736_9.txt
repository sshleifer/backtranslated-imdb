A unique film ... one of the best of all time. The acting, script, score of Quincy Jones, cinematography, editing, etc. is simply fantastic. As most viewers know, this film is based on a book by Truman Capote about the famous murder of a family of farmers in Kansas (Riots) by a couple of young guys during an erroneous robbery. I have never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> Actors in all areas are solid, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them. Scott Wilson, like Dick Hickok, is awesome. Silly, defiant and devoid of compassion, he meets himself so charming, oily and believable. Robert Blake in the role of Perry Smith is also unusual - alone, and at the same time a bit cool. Who can bring these characteristics into one person and make us buy it? He does, and it is brilliant! The key point of the book is how the intersection of these two completely different sociopathic personalities created a critical mass for committing such a stupid and disgusting crime, and these two actors make it work perfectly. Both had moments in their subsequent career, but these actions are high marks, and this means a period of action. <br /> <br /> The cops are great too. The investigation is led by John Forsyth, but the other three detectives are also great. Unlike modern films, where producers consider it necessary to endow the police with superhuman assets or weaknesses, these are just true flat feet that deal with determination and competence. They seem so real. I have never seen the cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I saw most of the criminal classics going far back. Truly one of a kind in this regard. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER COMES (this film is unique in that you already know what happened, but I warn you to record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and films are interrogations - intellectual fencing matches between policemen and scammers, Mano Mano. This movie presents the best interrogation scenes you have ever seen in a movie. Watch as Dick and Perry try to bluff and slowly unravel, unaware that the police have goods. But the police must deftly prepare their suspects in order to break their alibis and hopefully receive confessions. This is the best acting game you've ever seen. Think of Glengarry Glen Ross without a boat. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and terrible aspects of this true story, the ICB was filmed in the Clutters house itself, and I heard that the Clutters were played by students to give them a real look. It is working. It looks like decent, simple people. This makes the crime so tangible and sad. <br /> <br /> I will stay here. This is not a very nice movie, but it is one of the best films ever made, and so unique, it is a must-see for every movie buff.
