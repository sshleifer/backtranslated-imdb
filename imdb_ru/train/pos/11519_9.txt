The only reason I did not give these 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus, additional materials, etc. However, if you ever had a dream to do something with your life, this film is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream, do not let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most life-affirming films I've ever seen. And magical. The game is gorgeous, the plot serves the purpose, and the initial sequence is fantastic. This is one of those films, which previously had a "cult" status. I recommended this movie to all my friends. Some love it, some can't finish it. Whenever I think or feel that something is impossible, I think about the role of Alan Arkin in this film. Of course, he would like to make more films.
