It's on my top list of all time favorite movies! This is a fantastic and insightful movie. Historically it was interesting and pleasant to watch! I thought that the game from Emily Blunt was fantastic, and Rupert Friend - fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen for Albert. The costumes were gorgeous, and the setting and scenes, such as the opera house, were amazing and detailed. I just loved it, all of it! I liked scenes from childhood in which she mocked John Conroy. And where her mother says she has to go upstairs with an adult. Once again the writers did it! They created this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> This deserves the reward they received.
