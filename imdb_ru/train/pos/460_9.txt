This is a wonderful new crime series that unites three old British television fans (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alan Armstrong) when retired detectives returned to help sort out old affairs under the guidance of a young career focused on Amanda Redman. Three bizarre, irritable old policemen make up a brilliant team, using the methods of detecting twenty-year-olds in the police, which has since gone a long way - sometimes effectively, and sometimes - to the dismay of its senior officers. Three are depicted sympathetically, warts and all. There are magnificent comic scenes, and some very touching, as each of the three must come to terms with the aging and legacy of the past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first series of six parts (we are promised another series next year), each of the characters has developed. The widower James Bolam cannot accept the untimely death of his wife. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to accept his role as a grandfather. And even the obsessed Alan Armstrong helps his new friends fight the demons of his past and continue to take medicine! While Amanda Redman has to deal with a too familiar conflict between life and career. The plots were interesting, although they depended heavily on the wonders of DNA testing. But it was the interaction of the four best British actors that made the series impermissible.
