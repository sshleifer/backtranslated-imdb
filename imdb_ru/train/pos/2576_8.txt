I belong to the “Christopher Reeve generation,” it’s fair to say that he was still the best actor to play Superman, but that doesn’t stop me from enjoying other actors in this role, and George Reeves makes a pretty good bet to beat Chris from the top, although barely fails. This does not prevent me from enjoying this film, there is a lot of it in it. It has everything a film needs, a story with a beginning, middle and end, plus all these parts are written with the mind. The film is sharp both in terms of acting and plot, something like a film noir, but with tights. This is a fascinating and meaningful story; it is a film with a not-too-preaching message. I am still amazed that it was filmed in 12 days, about the glorious days of Hollywood, when we didn’t have to wait 5 years to see if the film went to hell of development ... em "Sholem, best known for speed and efficiency. It never allows technological constraints to slow it down; in fact, some creative things were made to create the effect of flight, including installing the camera on the boom on a truck, high shooting and fast motion to make it look like we see it from the point of view Superman, as well as several close-ups of George in the process, and a long shot of an animated Superman. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an extra feature in the first season of the George Reeves television series. A DVD deserving of separate ownership, including the film as its original whole, iced up on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give Blood Today God Bless!
