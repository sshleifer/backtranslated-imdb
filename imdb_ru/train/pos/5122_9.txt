Number 3 in the trilogy of young John Travolta's blockbusters. He dances in a disco, rock'n'roll and country music. He heads to Houston to find work and love. Gilly is the hot spot, and this is the time of the mechanical bull. To keep up, I rode a bull at a club in Nashville. I recently saw this almost forgotten film on TV and remembered how good it was and how good was 1980. That year I wore a black cowboy hat just like Travolta. Debra Winger was in her prime. She looks amazing in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem to be the perfect match, even if they are a trailer. They broke up just because it was so nice to get together again. Urban Cowboy has a great soundtrack. We hear Lyin 'Eyes from The Eagles and Lookin' For Love by Johnny Lee.
