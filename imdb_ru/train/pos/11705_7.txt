Obviously, there was no huge budget for this film, which definitely hampered the production. But the story and the final were so cruel that they compensated a lot. I mean the cruel level of Dow Dow and other (wonderful) Chinese films. I first saw this when I was 14, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything ...
