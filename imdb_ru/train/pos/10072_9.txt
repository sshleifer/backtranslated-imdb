An unexpected pleasure, because I have not heard anything about this film. <br /> <br /> I’m ashamed because it requires a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully humane story with a social message is wonderfully told, although admittedly predictable in its resolution. Solid principles acted. Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating on gray, reflecting the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My recent foray into the Chinese film (“Shower, the Way Home, Not One Less”) was exciting, and I hope to continue studying. China and its people - an amazing canvas for filmmakers. The King of Masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in a recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
