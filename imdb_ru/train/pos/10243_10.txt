it's great, I liked it because I love dinosaurs, they are the biggest animals, but I liked the show because it was not copied from another show and was original, it has a good storyline and is great for young children (if they like dinosaurs) i.e., I also have a few falls, it’s not that big, because dinosaurs look a bit mutated, so I had to have but 7, but it's a little late now that 4 more lines is great for although fantasy show warning that it could spoil It’s for you, so if you don’t want it to be spoiled, don’t read on plz at the end, it’s pretty weird, because all they have to do is get the hell, I forgot that it was so, HBM I think this is not a spoiler, so never mind, I loved it and his opinion and sorry for any missing words, if any
