This movie is great! This film is beautiful! Finally, a film in which Muslims are depicted as PEOPLE, there are no stereotypes here. This film is based on history, action and, above all, its theme, the theme of cultural approval and discovery. They may seem cliché, but this is not the case, at least in this film. The perspective of the Great Mosque of Mecca is absolutely amazing, and viewers are given an idea of ​​the side of the Muslim world that has rarely been shown in the West. Here people are caring, supportive, devout, tolerant and loyal to each other. What a long-awaited and belated departure from the usual negative images of Arabs. A great movie.
