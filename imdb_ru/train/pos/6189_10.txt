Who would have thought - Hal Hartley creates a cinematic consequence for Siriana, while maintaining its own distinctive corporate style. The merger is very exciting. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a film about Hale Hartley for about ten years, so I approached him with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties amazed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialogue. Earlier films by the director included vivid characters that offered detailed life observations — often in the Long Island area, in New York or in New York itself — which were unusual and insightful. <br /> <br /> My first warning follows from the description of this film as “spy thriller”. To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to combine his well-established style and focus on creating a very original drama of international intrigue. It works more than you can imagine. Hartley film preserves the dialogue and character of the character, which are its trademarks, along with an exceptional cinematic style. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is very appropriate, given the current situation in the world and the state of war, which was caused by dark elements on all sides. Hartley brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of mention in the same breath with Siriana. Verily, he enters his own. The cast perfectly interprets the vision and style of Hartley. Parker Posey fans will see her in full bloom here, still with us, more mature and gorgeous than before.
