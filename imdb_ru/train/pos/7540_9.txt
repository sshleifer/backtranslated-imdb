I really liked this movie. I've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, and this film just underlines this. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family, which is moving up the social chain thanks to the success of her husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. She moves to a completely white area where people are friendly, but a little awkward to her. The various events that take place during the film cause SOME laughs, but mostly attract other emotions. This film is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give him a strong 8/10. I highly recommend you catch it on TV or rent it soon.
