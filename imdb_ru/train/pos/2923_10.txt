Eddie Murphy really made me laugh at my ass on this HBO comedy show. I like his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Crumden from Just Married, Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. Goony Goo Goo is fun too. I first saw it when it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard that I almost fell off the chair. I still think it is very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on "Saturday Night Live", made me laugh so hard, he is one of the best people coming out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Delirious" - his best performance on stage next to "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I give the "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 thumbs and 10/10 stars.
