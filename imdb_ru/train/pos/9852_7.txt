Not a single day passes without a newly released computer cartoon, so we now have a chance to see more than just nice effects. After watching the Ice Age, I felt that it did not affect me as much as some other films of this genre. <br /> <br /> But that’s because now I’m a big guy and I’m sure it’s a very nice movie for children (maybe up to 14). The story is pretty simple, and the “actors” are funny in a nice way, without any rough or complex humor. Even “evil” is a cute, fluffy big cat with these funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was for me a slight disappointment (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way), but a great thing for children. And besides some fights, no one dies (even when a mammoth stomps it several times), which created a cartoon feeling. <br /> <br /> Computer animation is good, but nothing special, except for some really good scenes of animated sensations, when you want to stroll through a beautiful picture or comic book pages. [However, this means that you have to work a lot!] <br /> <br /> There were some jokes that made me smile - I agree, the creators tried to satisfy these adults - but they are difficult to notice and (in my opinion) better gone unnoticed because it does not fit into the story. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good film, but rather in the Disney cliche “the ideal world and the fluffy animals for children.” If you do not hate cute animals that do funny things, look at least once.
