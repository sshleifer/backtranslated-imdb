Tell me what you will about Schmalz. One charm of this film is that it is not pro-American. The moral is that some Americans are called for lofty goals and how they have stood out. It is inspiring because it’s about people of a noble purpose. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelli (mother and brother Bette Davis). As Fanny says: “We were shocked by magnolias.” <br /> <br /> In today's political climate, led by the president, who shamelessly lied to us and used September 11 to uncover the worst characteristics of people, we dropped to the level of September 11 killers in search of bloodthirsty revenge. Mr. Bush cannot be blamed for all this - after all, we allowed him to lead us in this direction and even re-elected him after exposing his lies. Now, with good reason, we Americans are insulted all over the world. <br /> <br /> Today we are watching this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany was not caused by a lack of German character, but a lack of people, which allows us to rationalize everything that justifies our immoral and repulsive actions . I do not compare George Bush to Adolf Hitler. But I point out how a leader can infuriate us from terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism in order to do disgusting things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the blackmailer who will do everything that needs to be done for his own approval, no matter how immoral, most of all looks like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who buried their heads so deep in the sand that they could not even be bothered to vote. br /> <br /> A film like “The Clock on the Rhine” reminds us of who we once sought to be - a force to improve humanity - and that we have it to strive again to high goals. <br /> <br /> Jeff
