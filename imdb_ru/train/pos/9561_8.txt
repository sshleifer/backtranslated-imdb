“Ranma ½” is my favorite anime from Rumiko Takahashi. A woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, which is not only a comedy, but also a fighter. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenage boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of the arrangement of both fathers who are good friends and have been trained together for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is the youngest and most cruel. Tendo's sister: Kasumi is the oldest and very cute, and Nabiki is the middle, and she likes to win money, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane fight all the time, especially because both have very bad temper and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl, when he is poured with cold water and his father becomes a panda, many new ones appear. characters and situations. They also discover the cause of the transformation: during the battle, Ranma and his father fell into the damn river. But not only they had such a fate ... br /> <br /> If you watched “Ranma 1/2” and you liked it, I would recommend you “Inuyasha” and “Maison Ikkoku”, two other good creations from the hands Rumiko
