After some difficulty, Johnny Hume arrives at his sick uncle's ranch to take over daily operations, only to find out that the old man was killed by his beautiful gold digger's wife and the woman's wicked brother. <br /> <br /> Good performance, pleasant performance from Mark Damon and fresh action scenarios combine to make this entertaining, if not exceptionally deep, complementary to the average in the spaghetti-western genre. <br /> <br /> Rosalba Neri's star is one of the hottest European babies ever to decorate the screen. Here she is absolutely perfect as a cold-blooded user (and abuser) of weak men. <br /> <br /> Damon and Neri appeared together in at least one other film - Devil's Wedding Night, a pretty good horror movie that is of particular interest to those of you who want to see what is under Rosalba's dresses. .
