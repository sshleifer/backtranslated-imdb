As a native of Bolton, this film has an obvious attraction for me. Pictures from the site are amazing and show that Bolton is very much in transition - there are a number of scenes of sheer indecision, but this shows that the city is being restored - and the idea that the old should give way to the new is in the heart of this the movie. The slightly erroneous James Mason leads a pleasant ensemble in the story of the bustle around herring, which develops into a full-blown conflict between generations, and then into a rather bold decision. Although I’m too young to remember it completely, the little things in Lancashire’s life in the 60s are all here: Friday's cashing, songs around the piano, the Sunday constitution, good neighborliness, the awe of courtship, the mass importance of self-esteem, and I was glad to see Noton's funniest lines from the play remained intact. There is no doubt that this film should be available on DVD - it is well thought out, and most of the performances are well implemented.
