Although I do not consider myself a big fan of fairytale films, Stardust intrigued me when I saw Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was going to see her as Velma von Tassl's domineering hair lacquer). Boy, she is so convincingly evil here, like a witch, especially with her ugly makeup at the beginning and at the end! Robert De Niro is also great as a pirate captain who has to hide “in the closet” to protect his “reputation”! Almost all actors, such as Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others, work fine here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there are also the stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magovan, especially when we first meet with her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is good at playing Tristan, and he looked just like his father, Dunstan, being a young man, that I thought he was in the early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments compared this to “The Bride Princess”, and although I see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB you always knew that it was just an imaginary story told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you see and hear could happen even with all the gaiety that happens everywhere. Therefore, on this note, I highly recommend Stardust.
