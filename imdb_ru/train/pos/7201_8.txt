Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep her head above the water after her ideas run out I can say that it was not enough, as it seems, when you look at the picture. Everyone has their own plans. A good little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances of all.
