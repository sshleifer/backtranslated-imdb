Soylent Green is a classic. I was waiting for someone to do it again. These days they seem to remake the science fiction classic (i.e. War of the Worlds), and I hope some director / producer will remake Soylent Green. With today's computer animation and technology, it can be a great picture. Dystopian movies may not be so contrived. The human race multiplies like a roach without any outside influence to limit it. We, as humans, have the opportunity to put cybos on the reproduction of smaller species, if they get out of control, but there is nothing that could control the reproduction of people except us. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc., the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish. The classical Malthusian economy claims that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and grow .... it is indecent.
