From the first scene aboard a crowded train, where a ruthless pickpocket works (RICHARD WIDMARK), stealing from a female wallet (GIN PETERS), “Pickup on South Street” is inexorably fascinating to watch. In part, this is because the acting skills are equally strong from the entire cast, the b / w photo is clear and adds sharpness to the story and characters, and also because director Samuel Fuller puts him in one league with such important figures as John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Houston. In fact, he has the same urgency as the Houston film about a robbery that goes wrong, but the winnings are not so strong. <br /> <br /> JIN PETERS is superb, like a girl with hard hair, whom Widmark describes as "crazy a lot." She gives a lot of energy and sex appeal to her role as a not very smart woman carrying microfilm in her boyfriend’s purse (RICHARD KILI), which the FBI already knows about. They follow her trail when theft occurs. <br /> <br /> TELMA RITTER adds realism to his portrait of a woman named Moe, who buys and sells anything to make a profit, and ultimately pays for her with her. a life. She is especially touching in her last scene with Keely. <br /> <br /> This scene is guaranteed to hold your attention for an hour and twenty minutes. Good noir from Fox and notable performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
