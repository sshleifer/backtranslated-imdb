Distortion is a film that took me by surprise. A sort of multi-layered drama, which tells about a person writing a play about his life experience happening to him at this moment. To be shorter, he feels that his wife is cheating on him, so he hires a private eye to spy on him. His wife does not suspect that this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this play also have a few people who are thinking up their sleeves, fooling around with each other and, let's say, with unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. Everything ends with a climax in the theater with all the actors present, and the predictable (but not quite) happens. <br /> <br /> The director of the play really moves along with the cast of characters and edits it in a way that makes you pay attention, in fact it’s a funny movie that I didn’t mind watching and would recommend people to watch.
