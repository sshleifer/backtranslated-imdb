In this film, the year 2022 is very similar to the seventies. At first it is funny, but soon the viewer realizes how much this decadent futuristic world is very different, despite its appearance, how many things that we take for granted can become inaccessible. <br /> <br /> Characters often interact in a special way without tact, manners or respect. I believe that this is intentional, not bad action. In the end, who witnessed social changes in the 60s and 70s, it can be assumed that by 2022 the inhabitants of the overcrowded city will behave like this. <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t like most of the militants, except the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. The plot is not too polished. But great scenes and ideas, such as Sol's death, then, like the rioters and dead bodies, "furniture," outweigh the shortcomings of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
