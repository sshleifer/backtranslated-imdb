“Der Todesking” - the second full-length feature film by Jörg Batgeraight (the first was the notorious “Necromantic”) does not have a central character or characters, but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide. Divided into days of the week, it consists of a series of sets, each of which demonstrates the self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, production values ​​are low, and this is in the way, but in many ways, Der Todesking is extremely effective. It makes you think that it is sometimes more important than pure entertainment. Unlike other works by Buttgereit, this is not very scary, but there are some unpleasant images, such as the castration scene on Tuesday’s episode, the decaying corpse and various suicide acts. The last (Sunday) episode is so depressing and full of pain! - just amazing if you want my opinion. 10 out of 10 - check out this postmodern shock! The restlessness of art in its purest form!
