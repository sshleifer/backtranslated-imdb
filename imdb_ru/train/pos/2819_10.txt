This movie is disgusting! and I liked it! “Dragon Lord” (Jackie Chan) and his cowboy buddy made the movie fun, informative, and just plain silly. A film is a rare mixture of the struggle between good and evil and (somehow) miracles and fun that grow. Long Shao E conducts the viewer through the daily activities of the young “dragon master” (so named because he is the son of a rich family) and the “cowboys”, which include the implementation of clever, thoughtful ways to avoid learning (with the help of the whole family, including the mentor) competing in rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to win the affection of a local girl by competing in “football” (you will know what I mean), and the list goes on. Somehow, they are in the midst of battle to save a lot of valuable antiques and the lives of several people. <br /> <br /> The film has some serious moments. But they do not oppress, but rather inspire. The playfulness of boys is not lost in this exchange, but is actually used against evil. What I really liked about this film is how it ends. Not a typical confrontation (which in itself was awesome), but well, you will see. Let me just say that it truly reflects the spirit of the film. <br /> <br /> Stupid, witty, informative and nostalgic. a great movie.
