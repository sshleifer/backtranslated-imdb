Amazing rentals at a local video store, I was happy to find a media satire worthy of challenging Oliver Stone’s Born Killers. And almost as alarming. I think it was good with my viewing at the end of 2004, when the Republican machine did its magic on most of America’s crowded television shows. The question arises: “Are we really manipulative?” <br /> <br /> This definitely distorted my view. It also provoked a broader theological issue - the story of Christ. Can word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something exploitative, when television gives rise to the Messiah? Could the story of Christ have been exaggerated? Could this be completely fabricated? This is what the film covers extremely astutely.
