I think the reason for all the self-assured diarrhea in this film is that most people believe that Sharon Stone is around 50 and she is undressing, playing sexually. No one cared when Golden Girls sat around eating a cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but seeing someone after menopause get digital pleasure while driving, I think this is too much for some. Let's face it, she looks good, she is several years hotter than my mother, who is the same age! This is not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first time, but from the beginning of the century, everything that film audiences expect is a cinematic experience that will affect your soul. As such, he never claims to be. This erotic thriller, which is both erotic and exciting, and is a continuation of the brilliant character that we all love to hate. This is Catherine Trammell's character who helped give way to this sequel. Fans of the first film want to see more of this ice queen. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and artistic direction was lush and extravagant, and I most certainly wanted to move to Britain. The score is amazing too. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the characters outplayed, but there is a wonderful work by David Morrissey, who is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> The script is that the script is almost the same as in the first film, only a psychiatrist is connected instead of the psycho. As well as the criminal decision of the MPAA to make the film trim more, which deprives it of the lustful pleasure that the story is known for. <br /> <br /> At least it's interesting and fun to watch this, and these are the only intentions of the film. So, if you have a quarrel with Mizz Stone, maybe you should WATCH the film and draw your own conclusions before spewing your projectile vomit?
