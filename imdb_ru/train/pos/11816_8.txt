It was very funny! I have never read these comics about Chester Gould, but I donâ€™t have to know them. Perhaps there were some jokes inside that I did not understand, but what the eye does not see, the heart cannot grieve. This is such an ironic, colorful film, and the actors are in a good mood. The setting is similar to the setting of Batman movies, but not so dark and gray. Well, the story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not self-evident) and a more or less surprising ending. <br /> <br /> With this movie you can play an interesting game if you watch it with friends. Do not look at the beginning of the credits, and then look who of them finds out faster than anyone who of them are famous actors!
