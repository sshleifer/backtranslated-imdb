Eddie Izzard is nothing more than a comedic genius, and this is Eddie at his best. His material is extremely witty and fun, and his delivery is one of the best ever seen on stage. Instead of insulting the intelligence of the audience, he relies on it to extract humor from his preferences in the wardrobe, Hitler, landings on the moon and the British. With so many memorable laughs, it is impossible not to repeat some of his lines. Forever more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered as one of the funniest lines ever put on hold. Every super comedy fan should see "Dress to Kill." By far, the best British humorist I've ever seen, Eddie Izzard, fought for success on the live stage. However, his lack of commercial success in the cinema should not indicate how truly talented he is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure that, fortunately, is reflected in the home video, and it can and should be enjoyed again and again.
