I liked this episode. It's so great that all 5 of them come together and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode, because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) play a major role in it !!! I just hope that Clark joins the Justice League and we can follow this group of heroes around the world !! =) It was really exciting and interested in the audience because of what will happen next. I think that Chloe should also join the team as a Watchtower, which would be such a great job for her, besides the Daily Planet, because she doesn't have super powers. In addition, I want to find out what types of items Lex is going to use for 33.1, I'm wondering what other types of abilities other people in the world have !!!
