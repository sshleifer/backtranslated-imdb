One of my favorite films over the years was The Last Action Hero; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarzenegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt politician; so now I can not play in any film in which he could participate. <br /> <br /> “The Adventures of Jake Speed” actually play with themes similar to those in “The Last ... Hero”; so I was pleased to find it on DVD so that I could play these themes so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "plot inside the plot" associated with white slavery during the civil war in an African country, it is not a militant. The plot, which contains the “plot inside the plot,” actually concerns the question that the film is not going to decide: is Jake Speed ​​really a real person who helps the heroine save his sister from a white slave trader? ; or is he actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine somehow entered the universe, which really exists only in a series of novels about pulp)? I believe that this is not all that is clearly defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are well aware of this. Thus, the film becomes a presentation of what viewers may want from an “adventure story” from such a fictional universe. This is actually a rich topic, the potential severity of which is highlighted by the amiable and restrained sense of humor of the film. <br /> <br /> The film has weaknesses - first of all it is cinematography, because of which the film looks like a TV. show. And from time to time there is a failure. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters, and I like the adventure in which they live, even if they are stupid. And I just find the amazing idea that this adventure takes place in a novel. <br /> <br /> Suitable for multiple views - a good show!
