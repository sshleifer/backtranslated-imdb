What an amazingly funny and original show. The cast, starting with the hysterical Julia Brown (Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun), is just perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who always argues with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant WOK-DON "T RUN). I laughed more during this show than any I've ever seen (including Newhart - one of my favorite shows of all time) If you like movies such as Naked Guns and Airplane, you'll love this show! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing herself. Cleaners, Tammy finds an image of Cindy Williams in her coat. Image of then Cindy Williams performs an elusive act with bowling pins upside down. It's amazing to see that an actress like Cindy Williams can play like that. Opera soap, like so many unexpected turns, in a short time. It will be released on DVD with many bonus special features. The funniest series I have ever seen !!!!
