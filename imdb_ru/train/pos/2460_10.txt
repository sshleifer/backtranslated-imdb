Hamlet, of course, my favorite of all the works of Shakespeare. Branau is a damn actor. His image of it was just awesome. His monologues were breathtaking. While the film interests me rarely, however, I was absorbed in this particular work. I recommend this to anyone both a fan of Shakespeare and those who are not. This is all that the modern world is looking for in its films: murder, betrayal and deception. Not to knock out a version of Mel Gibson, but Branaus affects all the work. It leaves no stone unturned. When you finish the movie, you will feel that you are reading the play yourself. Um, as you say "two thumbs up."
