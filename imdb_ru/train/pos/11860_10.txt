This film has it all. This is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (performed by Al Pacino) is one of thousands who got a chance to choose their fate in America. This cinematic, but at the same time extremely accurate depiction of the “Empire of drugs” of Miamis is amazing. Brian DePalma does an amazing job directing this picture, so much so that the viewer becomes involved both in the storyline and in each character in the cast. The presence of Tony's characters is so believable and convincing that Brian DePalma reveals the raw talent shown by Stephen Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, sister of Tony), Robert Loggia (Frank, boss Tony) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Robert Loggia (Frank, boss Tony) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Robert T.) and Michelle Pfeiffer ( Frank's wife). I enjoyed watching this movie every minute, and I still watch it every week. In this year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime film, for example, I believe that in another 20 years, people will refer to this film in amazing quantities. I believe that other crime films are so dramatic that it is a shock to the system.
