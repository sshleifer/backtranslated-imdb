I rented this film from Netflix for two reasons - I was in a mood because I thought it would be a silly science fiction story from the 50s, and because this is the first feature film about Superman. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I was fully occupied and very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The pilot oil well penetrated six miles into the ground and was closed by the sponsor. Lois and Clark come for the scoop, but are disappointed that the deepest of the wells ever drilled will no longer work. A day later, strange events at the well make the story more suitable for Superman than for Clark Kent. Radioactive moles seem to have invaded from their home six miles deep around the earth’s core. <br /> <br /> Supermen and moles are a simplified but well-thought-out example of social realism. Released in 1951, starring the main actor who served in World War II, the moral of this story seems to be that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as everyone else. In order to convey this thought to the house, as usual, in the spirit of Superman, Reeves even blames a trotter-vigilante, hunting for people-moles, for the fact that at some point he was a "Nazi." <br /> <br /> Even in the 1950s, the science underlying this film does not exist. Six miles of drilling through the continental crust would not even penetrate the upper mantle, not to mention the “hollow center of the earth,” which, in any case, does not exist. Forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a comic about the golden age. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit uneven. Although the Molemen are interesting, a bit creepy and well depicted, there are a few scenes of Korman-Esquire who spend too much time, unnecessarily showing us their strange behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. By today's standards, the costume is bad enough to be fair, but for its time, the special effects and costumes of this film were pretty good. Cinematography is also usually very good, and the game is much better than one would expect. I was especially impressed by Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
