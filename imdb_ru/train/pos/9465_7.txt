Steve Carell is shooting again in a light romantic film about choice, family and pressure. Judging by the plot and the cover of the film, I expected a frank comedy, a lot of laughter and unreal elements, but I think I was wrong. Of course, there was some kind of comedy in the film, but it seemed like a much easier drama to me, and Steve Carell again gave a great idea. The film itself is really dedicated to true observations, and it was a strong element that I found. But the final was a bit hasty and predictable. Overall, the cinematography was great, the acting was great, and the message it delivered was obvious, but still very important. However, it came to an old, flat and predictable end. I would consider that at the end of the film different choices will be made (maybe even bad ones), this film will get better publicity. Still a funny movie.
