I saw the last five or ten minutes of this film in 1998 or 1999, one night when I was surfing before going to bed, and I really liked what I saw. Since then I have been searching, looking through TV lists, looking through DVD / VHS racks in stores, but I didnâ€™t find a copy until recently when I found out that some online stores sold it. Then, as a world-class procrastinator, I still did not order it. Finally, I found a copy of the DVD at Circuit City while visiting Portland, Oregon, a few weeks ago. Then it took me about a month after I returned home before I sat down and watched it. <br /> <br /> What do I think about the film? Good. Not as good as I remembered and what I hoped for, but still it cost 9.99 dollars, which cost me. After watching the entire film, I rate it as 7/10 with the potential to become 8/10. Then I will have to be less sleepy and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding in order to catch the dialogue.
