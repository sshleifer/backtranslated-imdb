It reminded me of Spinal Tap, on a more serious level. This is a story about the reunion of the group, but not everything is harmonious between them. I was especially impressed with the performance of Bill Nyei in the role of Ray. You felt sorry for him, but he had some eeriness in him. This is a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band becoming wrinkled, old and pretentious.
