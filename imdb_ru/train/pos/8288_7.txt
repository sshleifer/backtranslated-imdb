A good continuation of the murder in a small town. In this film, Cash and his cop friend are looking for a sticky conspiracy involving a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch, as well as family failures and their strange helpers. As in the original, the viewer is waiting for a pleasant little mystery with the characteristic sights and sounds of pre-war America. Go look.
