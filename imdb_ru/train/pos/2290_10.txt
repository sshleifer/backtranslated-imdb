Since Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast of Champions" slides into cinemas with a little pomp and big mockery, this makes me remember 1996, when Keith Gordon's "Mother's Night" came out. Now, despite all the talk that Kurt Vonnegut is “invulnerable,” it is surprising that he has received two excellent cinematographic films (the other is The Fifth Slaughterhouse). Mother's Night is certainly one of the most underrated films of the decade, and I can't understand why. It's great! He remains almost completely faithful to the book of Vonnegut (without being unnatural or overly literary) and adds to it purely cinematic poetry. How many screen versions of any authoring work can claim this? Vonnegut himself even adds a cameo to the end of the film, and can you ask for better approval than this? This is not only a beautiful film, it is a beautifully played, written and directing film, and it is one of my five best American films of the 1990s. This is a sad, inspired, surrealistic masterpiece that should not be neglected. I sincerely urge everyone to see "Mother's Night" - you do not even need to get acquainted with the work of Vonnegut in order to fully appreciate it (as the Slaughterhouse 5 sometimes does). This is a powerful, impressive piece of cinema.
