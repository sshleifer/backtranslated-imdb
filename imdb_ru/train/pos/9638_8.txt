This film was more of a transition to adulthood for one gay, and how he should deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister is in pain, his older sister is taking it to some extent. The relationship looks good with his boyfriend / exhooker, and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy revolves around him and says that it really means nothing. Our young gay goes crazy and falls into the trash and eventually leaves, leaving his new lover and starting over. We stay with him, starting first and watching, not participating, in happiness. So maybe in the future everything will be better for him. The ending was kind of depressing, but the whole movie was completely realistic, and therefore I will let this present finale slip in with high marks.
