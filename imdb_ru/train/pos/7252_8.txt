I saw this film before joining the British army. I went through basic training, at first difficult, and then much easier. My time was spent in the midst of disasters in Northern Ireland and the Cold War. There were times when I wondered what I had gotten involved for a while, because learning always took over, and you always responded instinctively. Voice-over is used to show what soldiers are thinking, although I would add breathing and heart rate, as in certain situations it seems to be knocking on your ear drums. A few years later I was in Canada for a family meeting. My aunt, who lives in the USA and lectures in Columbus Uni, Ohio, gave a report on the influence of the British army in Northern Ireland. She spent some time there exploring. Although she was very anti-English. She gave me a bee line and condemned me for being a British soldier. My only answer is to watch the movie "The Long Day Dies." This is the closest thing a civilian can understand why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right at the end.
