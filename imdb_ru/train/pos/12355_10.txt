I can understand those who do not like this film, due to lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is not a geisha, but the tenants of a brothel, and one who does not know the difference will not understand half of the film, and, of course, not the end. This is a complete work about the lives and needs of women in this era. Everything is important, and, of course, the way they dress, in the whole film means more than words. To those who thought it was a boring movie about geishas, ​​I suggest you read a little about this society before drawing a conclusion that is so untrue. This work of Kurosawa is life, and I am sure that the director understands the silent meaning of the play of Kurosawa for the right intellectual range.
