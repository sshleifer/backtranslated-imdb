I highly recommend this movie. Bladerunner-esquire, located in Paris in 2054, is for the most part the script for a classic film noir: a lady in danger, a sister trying to find her, an honest cop fighting with everyone. Fortunately, it avoids stereotyping and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting, innovative visual effects. The film may remind you of Sin City in appearance, but it looks even sharper, more graphic, which seemed to me really convincing. Each frame, each sequence looks as if it could be taken from the table of an experienced graphic designer. In terms of history and artistic creativity, you can find nods dating back to the nineteenth forties (or even earlier with a classic view of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and films such as Casablanca, as well as a look into a bleak future where our destinies are controlled by corporations. Sorry, you need to watch this movie.
