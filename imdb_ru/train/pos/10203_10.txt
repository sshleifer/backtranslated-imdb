I love movies and own comics, comics are different from movies, but still I would give them: 10 out of 10. It was awesome. If the films have become more awesome. I would like to have her children. And I am a woman. Read the comics, you will not regret it. Yes, in this film since Brian P. died, the artist died for her, we have not achieved such good artistic work. I mean seriously, don't get me wrong, these people did great, but different versions for different people. As they say, different beats for different people. Any guy who doesn't go crazy about her is insane, or dislikes women, or you know, just planning madly. If I could count on my fingers how in love and how many times I read comics, I would probably run out of fingers, but there are always fingers.
