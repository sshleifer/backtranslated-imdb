An American in Paris is a showcase for Gene Kelly. Watch Gene sing, act and dance his way through Paris in any number of situations. Some are purely majestic, others are purely maize. One can imagine what Kelly was made of when he made this film just a year before "Singin 'In The Rain". He is definitely one of the greatest people of all time. It is interesting to look at the parallels between these two films, especially in the characters of Kelly, the only main difference is that one of them is in Paris and the other is in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Some say that the acting of Leslie Caron was less than pure. Perhaps Sid Charisse, who was originally intended for this role, could have coped better, but Caron is quite plausible in this role and has chemistry with Kelly. The short role of Oscar Levant in this film gave him exactly what he needed, someone who does not look like Gene Kelly. Filling a role as an ordinary person is not an easy task, but the Levant performed it with the same class as any other leader. <br /> <br /> All songs and dances are perfect. Even too long a ballet at the end of the film makes the film better than without it. Seeing that there really wasn't a lot of screen time to make such love relationships believable, Minnelli used this sequence to create the impression that you spent four hours with them. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> I would rate this movie with Singin ', as it is very similar to the story and the song. Singin 'is unlikely to get approval because of Debbie Reynolds' boosted performance. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars
