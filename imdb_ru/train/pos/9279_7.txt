Comedy-drama Jafar Panahi "Offside" tells about some women trying to enter the sports arena in Tehran, in which women are prohibited. The official reason: a lot of foul language, and football players show their legs. But, of course, this is really sexism. So, much of the film consists of soft comic relief, as women try to ask men serious questions about why women are forbidden to go to the stadium, and one woman even came up with her own scheme to challenge men. <br /> As I understand it, all Jafar Panahi films (including this one) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the overthrow of the CIA Prime Minister in 1953 and the subsequent support of the brutal Shah gave Ayatollah Khomeini the justification for using his narrow interpretation of the Quran to create a chauvinistic society act cowboy and tighten censorship. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a neat look at people who come up with ways to challenge the system. Not a very good movie, but worth seeing. Considering that all the films of Jafar Panahi are prohibited, I wonder how he can shoot them.
