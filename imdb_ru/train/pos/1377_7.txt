In the areas where they cover this beautiful film, bright years are ahead of the “Innocence” of 2004, which gave the impression of a roaring eye and breathing hard, looking around at young girls. Here, the effect is much more realistic and actually penetrates the heads of the three main characters, when they wade through adolescence penetrated by traps. The three unknown principals give me very confident ideas, such, in fact, that can be so natural that it will be difficult for them to reproduce this quality of play in other films, so I will not be too surprised if they have not heard from again. It would be nice if it could run away from Art Houses and into Multiplexes, where there is only an external possibility that he could “speak” with a crowd of chewing gum, which he is not aimed at.
