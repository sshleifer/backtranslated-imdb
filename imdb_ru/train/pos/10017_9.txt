I really loved this movie! I have nothing to do with all the other comments I read about it. I was ecstatic every second! <br /> <br /> I found an exciting story, an intense game and the exact direction. I literally jumped every time the phone rang near the end of the movie. Despite the fact that there was nothing “scary” in the story itself, I was completely in awe of the whole film - until the end of my evening. <br /> <br /> I discovered that so many perfect choices were made ... the cast, the script, the little bits of humor. There were so many moments when the film could have been a thrill, but this did not happen, and for me it put this film above many mediocre thrillers that came out recently ... and for the last number of the year.
