For those who were interested to find out exactly how humanity turned out to be enclosed in large red pods that make me crave a pomegranate, there is a duet of shorts from the “Second Renaissance”. I'm not quite sure why they are divided into two parts, especially since they are marked as one on DVD (and these shorts are viewed in any other format than DVD?), But they are informative, even if they have several spaces. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this first part from the second part and the rest of the animation are the parallels between the uprising of robots and civil rights. The graphic respect for slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves is mixed with verbal references to the March of a Million people and God's complex of humanity. In fact, the "shorts" are never mentioned in these shorts, but are replaced with the "image of the person himself." <br /> <br /> With regard to the shorts in the collection, the “Second Revival: Part I” is certainly the most effective in identifying emotions. This is a sad and disturbing look at the potential of humanity to become “the architect of its own destruction.” Some of them may be rejected by some of the concepts that this short program pulls directly from previously created science fiction, but again, this is basically what most of the “Matrix” series did, and it became the driving force of its success. <Br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
