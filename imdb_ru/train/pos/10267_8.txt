Much has been written about the "Game House" Mamet; Most of this is good. I decided to go back to the film to find out how he stood for 17 years, and I was surprised how much I enjoyed watching it again. The success and longevity of the film is probably largely due to the two main components that are always funny on the film; good story and good scam. Mamet manages to bring his characteristic capriciousness and obvious history into the film, at the same time deceiving us, the audience and the brand. He then explains the art of cunning, only to do it again, and so on. D. All the while building a story. "House of Games", now free on cable, is worth a look for beginners and have a good time for Mamet fans. (B +)
