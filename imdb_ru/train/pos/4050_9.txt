Anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless fool who should stick to car chase films and romantic comedies. This film is exciting and does not have a boring moment. What for? Because it consists mainly of an intellectual dialogue between real people at the moment of crisis and details their efforts to overcome this crisis. I repeat - sensible dialogue! This is what characterizes almost all of Romer's films, and that is why many people dislike them. They prefer action. Well, let them spend the rest of their lives watching the militants, while those of us who have taste and discrimination will continue to look for similar films. <br /> <br /> Romer was always accused of "talkativeness." Well, he is, but for me it is a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was also talkative. Is there a more enjoyable game than Hamlet? Whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values, it is imperative to discuss these ideas and values, and this is largely what this film is about. Aristocracy and noble birth against egalitarianism; dedication to old friends, which is subjected to the final test, when this friend chooses what we consider to be the wrong way; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save this life, even if the person possessing this life is not so good or even contemptible. (Has anyone ever heard of Dostoevsky or "Crime and Punishment?") This is the essence of this whole film. <br /> <br /> Two roles in this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles, Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as her second language, is especially brilliant. Do yourself a favor and watch this exciting movie. This may be the last movie of this screen wizard.
