This show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows that have ever been on television. I mean that acting is great, suspense, drama, comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: the plane crashed on the island. The characters are great, and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us what a great actor he is, Josh Holloway is so cool, Jorge Garcia is cheerful, I could go on and on. In addition, the unexpected plot twists, the history of the characters, music, which is located at the end of each episode. JJ Abrams proved once again that he is a great writer and producer. I mean, this is better than Alias, and I loved Alias. Anyone who does not watch this series must buy a DVD and watch it, because they lack something great. This show may be the best show in the history of television!
