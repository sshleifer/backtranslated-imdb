I went into this film without knowing anything about it, and ended up really enjoying it. He lacked authenticity and credibility. Some of the things that the characters said and did were completely strange, and many scenarios seemed to be advertisements (perhaps typical of Woody Allen? Sorry for my ignorance), but for the entire audience. in the theater laughed so hard. It's not even a joke in the film as such, but in the film itself. Acting reminded me of Seinfeld's acting skills, when he tries not to laugh at his jokes - they are commonplace, but if you donâ€™t take the film too seriously, you really appreciate the humor of the actors, not the characters. If you are looking for a random movie and you like Woody Allen, I definitely recommend it!
