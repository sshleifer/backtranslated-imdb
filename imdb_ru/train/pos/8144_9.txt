Having seen both Fear of a Black Hat and This Spinal Cord, I can honestly state that, despite the fact that both films are similar, they really should see. In Fear there will be many times that will lead you into hysterics. No wonder why both films have such a huge fan. Fear will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you need it, but the only way to fully enjoy this film is to get it for yourself.
