I have been enjoying the Crime and Crime series for a long time. Catherine Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, a female detective, is pretty tough and seems a bit bitter in the “Criminal Intention” series. Look at her other side in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film shows the amazing soft side of this talented actress, and if you're a fan of Criminality, this film is a binge of acting, and you get damn good yarn for family adversity in the south. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like the role of Albert Finnis in this film because he performed such a convincing acting job as a senior guy from the Southern region who has a stubborn, intolerant and unacceptable for change. He reminds me of so many men from my youth, and the image is divine, but you will probably find it difficult to love him in this film. <br /> <br /> Catherine Erbe can easily fall in love with this film, and therefore I recommend it as 10 stars for criminal intentions, law enforcement fans.
