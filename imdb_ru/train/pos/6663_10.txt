This film tells about a dysfunctional family, and not just about a dysfunctional family. This is a family of the father of our people (India), although the film is mainly devoted to the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal Gandhi. This shows how Mahatma was supposed to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to get close, Mahatma found himself between them. This is a beautifully made movie. Akshay Khanna has established himself as the best actor. He expressed emotions very naturally. Darshan Jarivalla, who mostly acts as a Place-Gurukant Desai lawyer in Guru, beautifully portrayed Gandhi (like a real Man, unlike Ben Kingsley, who made him look like God) Shefali Shah, the girl from Monsoon's Wedding, also did a really good job. show how Kasturba Gandhi was torn between father and son. This film is touching, like its soundtrack Raghupati Raghava, sung in a unique manner. I saw this film only 3 hours ago (it was released in Dubai the day before — the 2nd), and when the film ended, there was “Pin Drop Silence”, and, leaving the Theater, no one pushed another (Can Do you imagine us Indians are not pushing?) NOT ONE! There was a Sacred Silence ...
