Sandler is amazing again ... I've already become a Sandler fan. This film is the saddest story of Sandler. His expression is fantastic. I cried more while watching the click, but there are some similar points. Considering the value of a family before losing it, and saying “I love you” are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It is difficult, it is real ... and in fact there is a real possessor of this success, Binder. I do not think that another director could convey these emotions in this way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also awesome ... Cheadle has been one of my favorites since the days of Crash. Do not expect laughter or a special positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the realities of life, do not miss this movie.
