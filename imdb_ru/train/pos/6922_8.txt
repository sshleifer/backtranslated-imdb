The picture is well narrated and directed by the magnificent director Anthony Mann, who made a rich western classic: River Bend, Far Country, Laramie's Man, Naked Spur, Tin Star. Of course, all the essential Western elements are present in this film, so the Red Indians attack, raid the criminals, the final standoff. Fascinating cinematography by favorite photographer Greta Garbo Willian Daniels. James Stewart discovered a new type of salary, a percentage of box office, which will mimic the back of other great Hollywood stars. Although the argument is an adaptation of the novel “Big Gun” by Stuart L. Lake and screenwriter Borden Chase, it is also based on real events, because on July 4, 1876 a competition of shots took place in Dodge City and the winner was awarded the Winchester model 73 1873 with the ability to shoot 17 rounds of 44/40 caliber in seconds.
