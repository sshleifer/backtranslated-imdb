I saw this movie today, and I have to say that it was much better than I expected it to be about a couple of hours before watching it. Personally, I had some prejudice because of the language, but it completely changed my idea. The film was in most cases surprisingly good with actors and actresses. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to achieve it. It really touched me and, like a movie based on real events, convinced me. A new school, a psycho-director and a young man who meets a new teacher are a little different than others and about the struggle for things, even if it seems that they do not work. He showed how little things can make a difference in many things, and how a difference can sometimes cause difficult situations. I also think that the choice of actors was a success. It really seemed to me that you were the person who watched these episodes as an outsider when they occurred. Before I ruin this movie with praise, I must admit that there were some things and situations that did not look and did not look realistic ... like the one where the headmaster beat Fritz aka. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the film. He was really badly beaten, but the only thing that caused him was that his nose was bleeding when he compared it with the first blow at the beginning, when Fritz had stitches ... well, I think every film has its drawbacks ... I must say that if I ever find this DVD from the store somewhere, then I will certainly take it with me.
