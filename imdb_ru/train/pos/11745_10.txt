If you have a chance to see this movie, watch it. it is rather shocking and really makes you think about many important issues, but it is not didactic. in my opinion, this is a work of art ... beautifully shot, beautiful music of many styles, a typically impressive level of acting that can be expected from BBC Drama. Natalie Press (called "Natalie Press") is convincing in her role as a depressed teenager, exploited by a male classmate. Celia Imri has the wonderful encouraging quality that gives the sometimes unnerving stability of the action and the comfort of the viewer in the realization that someone is really “normal”, but the real star, as always, is Timothy Spall - undoubtedly one of the greatest actors. our time !
