Let me clarify one thing - for the most part, the mentality of those who lead the show in Hollywood, frankly, * * * * * * * * * * * comic book pages. What for? Well, let's take the typical Hollywood scenario of an executive board meeting to illustrate it? .. <br /> <br /> Executive Director No. 1 “Hey, these days you can find a lot of dollars that can be found in superhero movies.” <br /> <br /> Manager No. 2 “Okay, let's do it in a hurry! ?? We'll make a happy hat dive and pick a superhero at random to start a movie! (There is a failure, and the name of the famous superhero is pulled out) <br /> <br /> Manager No. 1 “Great! And who can we play in this role? <br /> <br /> Executive Director No. 2 “Who is the big box office at the moment?” <br /> <br /> Executive Director No. 1 “* The name of the major actor * will be this week”. <br /> <br /> Head number 2 'But does he really fit the role? I mean, he doesn’t look like a hero at all. <br /> <br /> Manager No. 1 'Who cares! He is a big name; In any case, we will make a film with him. <br /> <br /> Head number 2 'You are absolutely right! And besides, we will fill the entire film so much that are full of brilliant special effects to appease the idiotic masses, so that no one will ever doubt it! “<br /> <br /> The above script clearly illustrates one of the reasons why I usually Hate most modern superhero films. The whole style, no substance and just pretentious casting of cult roles. Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule; when does hollywood get it right ?? accept the casting of the original (and yet easily the best!) superman; Christopher Reeve and, most recently, Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movie. <br /> <br /> But let us return to the general negative features that Hollywood demonstrates today ?? .. Wouldn't it be great if our studio Heads had to ALWAYS choose actors who actually fit the roles? Well, in this far from ideal world, one director does it, believe it or not, with actors based on their true similarity to their comic book colleagues. His name is Sandy Collor. Unfortunately (but, as a rule,) Hollywood has not yet allowed Collora to shoot a full-length film, but fortunately for us, he gave us tantalizing glimpses of what the final result will look like in the form of two (for now) famous Super hero short features. . One is the superb Batman: Dead End, and the other is this fake trailer for a completely fictional movie called The Best Worlds. <br /> <br /> Well, let's not put up with our words here ?? it's just awesome! <br /> <br /> Casting winner Mr. Universe and the male model, Michael O'Hirn (who looked just as amazing, but completely useless for an impassive barbarian) makes for the ideal choice to play the iconic man of steel. In fact, from the point of view of physical similarity, of course, there has never been a closer approach to a comic character. <br /> <br /> To this is added Clark Bartram, who has just returned from his magnificent image of The Dark Knight in Batman: Dead. End; Again, another extremely sensible piece of casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If it was truly a full-length movie! Hollywood studio executives ?? take into account! This is how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a final note, I am again intrigued by the extremely fragmented reaction that this short film has aroused in fans. Tellingly, the most acute and violent negative reactions against him clearly come again (as in the case of Batman: Dead End) from a younger, less cinematically experienced audience; a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive utterances and the liberal use of basic diction. Such a regrettable state of closed thinking is indeed a sad phenomenon, although our aforementioned studio leaders in Hollywood will no doubt receive immense satisfaction. After all, these same misguided people are probably exactly the same CGI-dependent popcorn idiots who enjoy most of the shit that Hollywood produces because of the flood these days.
