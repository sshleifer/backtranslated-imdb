It was a great movie with a good cast, they all hit all the cylinders. And when Diane Keaton is at his best, well, it doesn't get any better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, who was always underestimated, was even better. He must be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is related to one aspect of the script. None of the characters ever admitted that the dead daughter was not always a good person. And was not her mother, who played Keaton. At some point, she breaks the promise she made to one character, without revealing that he was sleeping. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said that the film had a “political agenda”. This is a strange thing to say. There was no politics in this film.
