It was one of the best films about the war that Iâ€™ve seen, because it focuses more on characters than on war. All the actors do an excellent job with their task, and since most of them are relatively unknown, everything seems more believable. Video recording from the camera is great, as well as for synchronization and editing. This film will really reach you and make the audience take care of the characters.
