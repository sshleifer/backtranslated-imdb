In Brooklyn a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their rival volunteer fire brigades leads to Brodieâ€™s famous bet that he can jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be familiar to many people through the parody of "Bugs Bunny", "Bowery Bugs", 1949. <br /> <br /> This generally very pleasant film would probably have been more widely available if it were not for the notorious and disturbing scene in which some residents of apartment buildings in China participate - a temporary capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes , giving the film a great historical interest, in my opinion.
