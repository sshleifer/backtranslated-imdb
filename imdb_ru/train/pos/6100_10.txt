This is a really funny (and sexy) movie - it's not just stupid, but it plays great. This is a movie in which the characters are so interesting that you feel connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival, and I often laughed out loud with everyone, and was also excited about some of the more serious parts of the film. This is a unique film about two doctors, and I donâ€™t want to give anything away, but there are some powerful and very funny scenes, plus the dialogue is great. Wood Harris has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoya Saldana, and Brian White and Mia are also fun and sexy in their roles. If you have a chance to see it - go - you will not be disappointed. It is worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves an award.
