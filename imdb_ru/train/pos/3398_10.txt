I saw Soylent Green in 1973, when it was first released, and maybe eight more times over the years on TV or video. It has always been one of my favorite science fiction and / or Charlton Heston films. <br /> <br /> A retrospective of Charlton Hestonâ€™s twelve films was recently shown at the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles. I flew in from another state to watch six films in two days. Soilent Green looked great on a large Egyptian screen with a completely new print. The film was fantastic, from its original editing to homecoming, to the gorgeous finale. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a police officer who lives in a world where a dog eats a dog, with few natural resources left and there is no understanding how to do this. There used to be a world, and Eddie Robinson, as a man who remembers the past, is both gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry is beautiful together. The film also looks much better on a gorgeous 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and the cinema, the writing, the music used and everything that works with it works. The film is also very powerful in its dark and very possible view of the future. Just think how the population of the planet grew, tropical forests disappeared, resources were consumed, the effect of greenhouse gases has been deteriorating since 1973. I just wonder why this movie has not played in cinemas all these years. His reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> When it comes to reputation, people often say that Charlton Heston is not a great actor. Seeing him in El Sid, Soilent Green, The Warlord, Omega, Willa Penny and Major Dundee, I am sure that he is one of our best actors. Of course, he shot about a dozen other great films, and for those who are not indifferent, you know what it is. <br /> <br />
