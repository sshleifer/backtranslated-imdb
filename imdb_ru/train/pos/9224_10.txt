This film is visually stunning. Who cares whether she can act or not. Each scene is a work of art created and captured by John Derek. Places, scenery and costumes function perfectly to convey what can be found in a love story consisting of beauty, youth and wealth. In a sense, I would like to see this film as a tribute to the story of John and Bo Derek. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as father, mentor, lover and his image of a man, a man lost in a bygone era when men were men. Some of us find value in strength and leadership, wrapped in confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence, restraint and security. Yes, they no longer make men like that! But how often do you find women who are made like Beau Derek?
