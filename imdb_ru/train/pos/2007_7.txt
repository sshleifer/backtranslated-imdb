My personal opinion is that this film did not have a real storyline with the vampires of the first John Carpenter, but I donâ€™t care, I LOVED IT. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this film. He really pissed me off by believing that he was the kind of person whom you would never have thought he was a famous ROCKSTAR. There was something bad about this movie. Like the storyline, there must have been more to the movie. There should have been a film that followed the plot line of the film, and they should have had the same main characters in all three vampire films. I really liked the clothes people wore and the decor they choose in Mexico. I liked how it was old Mexico, not New Mexico. with earthen houses and old-fashioned churches. I was a little embarrassed by the vampires and how they could walk in the churches, but it was great that they did not follow the rules of the vampires of Dracula.
