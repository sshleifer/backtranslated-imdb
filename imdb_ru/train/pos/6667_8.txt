OK. There are people who should not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Do not watch it if you do not like satire or black humor. 2) I do not like if you were offended by "The Watchmen_". 3) Do not watch it if you want a serious film about superheroes. <br /> <br /> The rest, run, do not go to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's bizarre, it's a delightful set of all the bad superhero stamps, known to man. The occasional foray into the humor of high humor does not spoil the laid-back fun of Jinan Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azariah, as well as a couple of fun small details of Jeffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (It's nice to see Louise Lasser get a job too.) I was laughing all the time. Absolutely frivolous, somewhat strange, but good.
