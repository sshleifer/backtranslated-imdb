This cartoon was strange, but in fact the story had a little more depth and emotion than other cartoons. We have a girl in the camp with low self-esteem and almost no other friends, except brother and sister, who are just as unhappy as she. She reaches the lowest point, and when the opportunity arises, she literally makes a pact with a demon that looks like the devil. I found that this film is very believable for life, and just when things could not be worse, the girl sees what she did, she feels remorse, and then changes, and then she helps this dark, mystical being to understand the human qualities of love . The twins also improve by helping the little bears, and then they have a sense of self-worth. A very positive message for children, although some elements of the film were strange, it was and still is a rather pleasant film. Stephen Bishop's music (Tootsie song) made the film even better
