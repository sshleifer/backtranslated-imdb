All Dogs Go To Heaven ranks with the Watership Down for films about scary kids. Both were dark and rather sinister, but at the same time the most exciting experience a child could have. It was one of my favorite movies in childhood. I was in love with Charlie, and at the tender age of about five or six, I admit ... I was in love with a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells a dark story about attractive cadet Charlie and his criminal itch partner. The story begins with the fact that Charlie escapes from death row and goes to the nearest club to play gambling. Of course, in childhood I did not understand the concept of this film. I liked the songs and the animation, but when I got older, I start to wonder why this movie didn't disturb me when I was a kid. He deals with quite adult themes - gambling, murder, hell and jail, but in the world of cute Disney movies, this is something every child should watch once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some crazy scene with a transvestite crocodile, and the scenes of hell scare me more now when I was small, but it delivers such a sharp message that parents should not ignore!
