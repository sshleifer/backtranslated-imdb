One thing is certain ... you should not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and tells about a character who has to live with a sin that he cannot cope with. You are most likely being told a story, rather than the usual blunt explanation, so you wonder what is going on. In the end, the points connect, and the views make sense. All the characters were fine, and Wil Smith spent another good day at the office. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that you need to ask a lot of moral questions, but if you just accept and buy into his agony, then it will be easier to accept what he decided to do. Whether you agree or disagree does not matter. The journey you go on is quite interesting, if not exciting. <br /> <br /> A pretty good movie that, unfortunately, in the end leaves you a little sad. I would recommend this movie if you like where you need to think, not just watch the explosions and fights.
