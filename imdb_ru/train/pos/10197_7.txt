Well, it was a long year, and I began to review the final 2004 film. Panagoy Sa Suba (Zov River) ranked second at the recent Manila Film Festival. As expected, at the box office it was not as good as it was too tricky for ordinary moviegoers, especially since the MMFF is the season when many families go to watch movies. <br /> <br /> It was very intriguing to see a film on the screen that was not in Filipino or English. I thought that Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and as a director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as a major star and was able to express the wide range of emotions that were required for the film. Young actress Rebecca Lusterio also performed well. She did a great job portraying Bikkay, Duroy's younger sister. I hope to see it in many other film projects in the future, perhaps, going deep into other genres. I think the fact that this film was in its local dialect really helped her. <br /> <br /> Some shots from the camera in the film were made very well. The scenery was awesome, although I feel that if less effort would look completely different. <br /> <br /> In terms of plot, I feel that the authors could delve into the lives of smaller characters in the film. I certainly will not rave about the history of this film.
