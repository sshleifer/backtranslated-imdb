Fay Grim, tangled, furious and implausible, struggles to cope, but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with her. She is simultaneously touching, funny, sly. Actors cast also pledge. <br /> <br /> I won't even try to tell you about the plot. It features characters from Henry the Fool from Hartley and talks about international espionage. <br /> <br /> The film works well if you continue along with it, realizing that this is so. in a sense, completely ridiculous. It becomes more and more ridiculous when you go forward. (I was not tempted to turn off the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim demands an adventurer who wants to do something that is not a cookie. In the end, he offers something that is beyond description.
