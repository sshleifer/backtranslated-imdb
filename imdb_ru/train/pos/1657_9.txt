Puerto Rico, which boasts a small but powerful film company, brings this multi-layered history of corruption due to the ongoing drug cartel, which starts in South America, makes a pit stop on Commonwealth Island, and then goes north to North America.

They speak Spanish with English subtitles. This film, rated “R” by the MPAA, contains outbursts of vulgar speech, brief flashes of nudity, content for adults and violence, some of which are rather sinister.
