In a small town in Montana, two brothers are growing up. One of them is Norman (Craig Schaeffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Rev. Macklin, and they are growing up with his religion-related lessons and fly fishing lessons. In this film, fly fishing represents a bit of life. <br /> <br /> The story is good and holds your attention, although there are times when you need to work a little. Perhaps there are such moments in the film, because in reality this is not about the events that take place, but about the message. Although some things happen. Norman is going to study in Dartmouth. After six years, he comes back and contacts a cute girl named Jesse (Emily Lloyd), and he is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a reporter and is known as a "fishing reporter". He is famous, and he seems to have a wonderful life, but he drinks too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well shot, he has a good score, and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this film is cinematography. The mountains, forests and river look very beautiful. If the film was made only for these things, it was good enough to watch. Fortunately, this is not all.
