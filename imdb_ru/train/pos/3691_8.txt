The whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts. No problems. This film presents a number of the most creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast. The segments are created around the same theme “Love in Paris”, but the similarity ends there. In fact, given that the approach to the theme of all these different directors takes many forms, it is surprising that we can even feel that we are still watching the same film. No great effort was made to turn it into a single whole. This buffet has so many wonderful ingredients that I'm glad no one tried to put them all in one dish.
