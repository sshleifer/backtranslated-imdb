What would you say about a man who was going to get married and had a bachelor party with some of his closest friends in a Hawaiian bar? Everything went smoothly until he removes his “bachelor hat.” What would you say about how he talked to one of the impressive dancers, and then slept with her? What would you say if this girl were a cousin of his finances? New minimum, right? Well, Paul Coleman, who is ridiculously played by Jason Lee, brings this experience of nauseous blur and a new minimum. I have to say that this is one of his good main roles. However, I believe that his role in Vanilla Sky was better fulfilled. <br /> <br /> In his finances by the name of Karen, the agitated actress Selma Blair plays, and the heroine Karen, Becky, is played by the cute and talented Julia Stiles. Returning to where we left off, now Paul has to solve one emerging problem before the other. He gets sick, he has to deal with certain people, and he has to play his games of lies with stealth, otherwise any member of each family could get P.O'ed, including one of his relatives who did not have "feces". for 14 days. * Vomiting * All this leads to a long-awaited wedding with one merry scene before she remembers all the hell that Paul and his brother had to go through. <br /> <br /> In general, Guy's thing is pretty funny and great. Sometimes it may seem that the story is not going anywhere, and you are tired of the scenes here and there, but this is a mixed film. And if you're a Canadian and one of the fans of the comedy series Brett Butt CTV Corner Gas, you would recognize the small role of Fred Evanyuik, the same person who plays the hankering Hank in the series. This film is fine. This is another feather in Lee's hat (however, it is still empty). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Alison A.
