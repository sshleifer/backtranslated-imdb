I read a book in 5th grade, and a few years later I saw a movie. There are several differences: <br /> <br /> 1. Billy originally intended to eat 15 worms in 15 days, and not 10 worms in one day by 19:00. <br /> <br /> 2. Billy is supposed to get 30 dollars after he ate all the worms. In the film, after Billy ate all the worms, Joe had to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe is supposed to fake some worms, but he doesn't do that in the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the changes, this film is still popular with children.
