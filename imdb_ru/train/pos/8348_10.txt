Around 1986, one night I saw this film on TV. I was 6 years old. It was like my occasional viewing of the terrible “Don't Look Now” finale in 1987. I went to Venice on vacation next year in quiet horror, hoping that my parents would not know that I was watching this! <br /> <br /> If my parents knew that I was watching Les Valseuses when I was a child, would I mind? I would probably even now avoid this topic with my father, and my mother probably did not approve of the afterlife. I don't know if they will want to see it anyway. From stalking and capturing a woman in a tenement house in the first scene to crawling on mountain roads with open, full eyes, I’m never sure if this film is an insensitive piece of rubbish that ignores the sexual revolution or whether it is a sexual liberation film to see you it comes that you will never be so offended by yourself. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a violence. He has a cruel idea of ​​sex, almost no declaration of love. Even sucking a small child turns into a greedy sexual act of exploitation. But the script is very erotic and (God, I'm so British) awakens! Do they suck her breasts for her own good? This is exploitation. So why do I get wood? <br /> <br /> Do the guys go in search of an experienced elderly woman, find the former fraudster, the mother's figure? I dont know. It ends in a really terrible suicide. I told this to my friend J.B. Nelson, who has the insides of the Holocaust cannibals, and he set off! There is no motherly love for this film, quite the opposite. Injury to where the boys started. Why do they shoot a girl in the leg? Why does she come back to them? Do women need to be punished so that they learn from men what is right? <br /> <br /> I think of two films, one of which I would never see, and the other makes me want a not so harsh world. Swept up / Madonna, that the heap of madness doesn’t figure out, has never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes a man’s slave, and perhaps her madonna says that everyone respects the boyfriend Richie, I’m so furious that I can not use punctuation! Once in America / God Leone, why does noodles do it? Destroys the path to joy, we followed him throughout his life. So close to finally finding love with Deborah. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There are no rapes in Les Valseuses, but plenty of sex and nudity of both sexes are abundant. Very honest, without titling. No fantasy rags, no perfect Hollywood smooth movements. Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness, jealousy and deceit to call it a sexual comedy. Forget about shooting a naked hairdresser in the leg, because she will come back, and you will hook her to your ex-lover's vengeful son, and she will learn to cum from him. <br /> <br /> Two things I hate are rape movies and prison films. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God, no one wants to watch it now! This is a brilliant movie!
