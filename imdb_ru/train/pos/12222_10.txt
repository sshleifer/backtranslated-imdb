I thought this movie was superbly prepared, it confused me and my cousin, who watched it with me. To be honest, I think the younger Kevin Dillon was hot. hahahaha ... but I also thought that the girl was stupid to go with the cop, and it was wrong that he said to her before his death: "I was inside you." I think this is what she gets for what she did with him, and how he is going to tell her that she is too young, when he never cared how many years were other girls. Now I donâ€™t think I could trust such a cop myself. but, to be honest, it was quite obvious that it was him, even if he wanted to become a cop, I would still be suspicious anyway. And it was funny when she splashed his eyes at the store. hahahahaha she was still stupid that she herself went to the warehouse again, and the policeman who died, HELLO !! this is called a backup. Sometimes these movies drive me crazy when people act silly and do stupid things. But this is what I think about the film.
