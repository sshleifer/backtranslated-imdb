Although in this film I played the role of Hodges Sheriff, I still managed to jump in several places and believe me that it was not so easy for me. You can say that I am biased towards the film, and, yes, I agree, but I did not see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and was extremely pleased. I'm not a fan of horror films per se, but I love old B films and black and white sci-fi movies. This film will make you “think” that you know when something is about to happen, then it’s not, then it’s happening. This will keep you completely off balance. I would advise to first see the film, and then the director's notes and special features. He is so well written, shot and filmed, and I can personally tell you that working with this actor and film crew was very pleasant. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Lawrence’s future projects.
