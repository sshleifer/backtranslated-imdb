Not having seen the two previous ones in the trilogy of films about Borne, I was a little reluctant to watch the Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was a very exciting experience, and I didn’t have a problem with incomprehension. what happened because the first two films were not seen. Every part of the story was easy to understand, and I fell in love with the Bourne Ultimatum before it reached the interval! I don’t think I’ve ever watched such a sophisticated and exciting movie, especially an action movie. Since I usually shy away from action movies and thrillers, this was good news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most exciting films, it draws your attention from the first second to the last minute before the release of the captions. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was just fantastic in the role of Jason Bourne. I heard a lot about his great performances in Borne 1 + 2, and now this fabulous actor has another one that you can add to your list. I look forward to seeing more of his films in the future. <br /> <br /> The stunts were done with style — each was brilliantly done, and I was just shocked by the impressive effect of this film. Well done.
