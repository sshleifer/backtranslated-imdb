Although this is not the best Anime I've ever seen, but I liked Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I never read comics, I just saw it in the video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was fine, I felt the 80s anime, and this is what made me think. Why everyone else hates it for me. <br /> <br /> Character development was fine. I like the way they led the transition from Hope to the Lady of Death. for those who do not like it, obviously did not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how this happens, and she used his words. <br /> <br /> Kremtor was a good mentor / soldier for her. his dark style was perfect for this kind of films. <br /> <br /> I think that everyone who suffered from this need to look at it again and reconsider. because all the people beat it you can say about all your favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
