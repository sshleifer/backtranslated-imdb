OK. Who brought the cheese. I like it. During its launch it became a phenomenon. Anorexic Twins have become popular. Bob Saghet began to earn money (instead of his really ridiculous opposition). And people knew who Dave Cooler was. This is when life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was funny and always brought home a good lesson. And in this I am different from the norm: I liked the past few seasons. Like Home Improvement, as children grow older, much more can be done with the script. That's why I dare say ... It could have gone much later than it was. But anyway. I gave him 8/10 because of his helpful, funny plot lines and because of Bob Saget!
