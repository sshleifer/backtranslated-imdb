"Let's Bowl" started on local television in the twin cities. It happened late at night, something you might stumble upon while surfing the canal after your 7th Hamm's bottle. <br /> <br /> Even an advertisement was made on the spot, featuring Wally at Grumpy's bar, with a microphone and nervously stuttering - Aah ... to you, Steve Sedal. I don't know why, but it always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> A bowling contest was organized under the cover of a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to comments and clips. Sedal was playing straight, balanced by Rich W. Kronfeld's quirky and jolly Wally Hotvedt. Highlights included such segments as “How to properly dispose of an old bowling ball” (throw them into the lake) and “Dating tips”, where the duet “meets” with a couple of prostitutes, and Wally ends with a bitter complaint: “I could have done it myself ! <br /> <br /> In another episode - what the duo did on the weekend - showed Steve in a beer-littered shack, digging it out of the fridge, while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor Falls, wearing a tight-fitting pale blue blazer and large headphones. Fun! <br /> <br /> Wally's amazing comments on the “League Bowlers” and on his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various schisms also stood out. <br /> <br /> Comedy Central picked up the Come Bowl and it had good moments, but the network never knew what to do with it, holding it in prime time and emphasizing "competition" in bowling, which never was the purpose of the show. Permanent commercials interrupted the stream, and the side characters (Ernie, Pig, Butch, etc.) were more distracting than anything else. It all seemed rushed and forced. Even Jon Stewart spoke with “Let's Bowl” on the daily show - (not enough stupid things, jokes, jokes?) - with a disgraceful attitude to the show, which deserved much better. <br /> <br /> How often are we going to do the Let's Bowl? Come to the world of modern television, mixed comedy genius and total crap? There is “complete nonsense” in the networks, but it's sad to watch them kill such a dark, strange, funny little gem like Let's Bowl. <br /> <br /> Here they hope they release it on DVD.
