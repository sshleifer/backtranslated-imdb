I just saw this film today with my children (son, 10 years old and daughter, 4,5) at the 3rd annual film festival with Roger Ebert. After the film, children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director Tian-Min Wu. He (through a translator) told several stories about his life and making a film. <br /> <br /> In addition, both of my children really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to rephrase many subtitles for my daughter, but most of the film doesn’t visually require an explanation. <br /> <br /> I don’t give anything, but the bottom line is that this movie is MUCH better than 95% of Hollywood crap (especially children's films) there <br /> <br /> Greetings. <br /> <br /> ps There is a “real” / original King of Masks that can / can make 12 masks at a time. The actor in the film studied and learned to make up to 4 masks at a time (then they reduced and changed to 4 new masks).
