If it was an American film, I would rate it at 7: we saw it before. Being this Argentine film and being Argentine myself, I would like to give him 10 points, because this is the quality that I hoped for, not expected. Its superb quality is amazing, given all the restrictions imposed by the Third World ... <br /> <br /> I can’t forget the scene when Diaz makes Silvestein’s fiance admit you know what I mean if you saw a movie. I think this is the key moment of the film, perhaps not surprising, but still original. That's when the real action begins. <br /> <br /> Before watching a movie, I always try to collect some previous information. Being a mainstream, satirical, commercial, I press "Play" and make a suspension of reality and logic, I would say that it is best to enjoy such films. It is impossible to discuss the credibility of the entire plot, but it is definitely plausible. As for me, I could not stop laughing at every joke and commentary - "sos malo" ("you mean") ... put in the mouth of Diaz, the greatest. <br /> <br /> I’m pretty tired of watching Peretti’s "calculated" movies. I know that he is a great actor, but sometimes I feel that his roles are unfairly opaque, the role of Louis in this matter. I don’t really like Argentinian television, so I haven’t seen a lot of work with Luka, but it’s obvious that he’s a great performer. His physical role, his views, his meaningful attitude in this film made me fall in love with his work. I think his role should be improved, just so that he shows us how great he can be! <br /> <br /> I do not know whether Siphon plans to make a sequel or not. I know that he will not do this if he follows the rule that “the second parts have never been good,” so if he does this, I will definitely go and see. And I hope that in the future we will take into account the opportunity to give Peretti’s colleagues the same chances of developing their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great performances and lots of laughter!
