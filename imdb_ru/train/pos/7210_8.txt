New York playwright Michael Kane (as Sydney Bruhl) is 46 years old, and he is quickly fading away; As the film opens, Mr. Kane’s last play falls on Broadway. The TV people make fun of Kane, and he gets drunk. Passing by Long Island Railroad, he lands Kane at Montauk, not at his residence in East Hampton. Finally, arriving home, Kane is comforted by the tightly dressed wife of Dian Cannon (like Myra), who unfortunately suffers from heart disease. There, Kane and Miss Cannon are discussing a new play called The Death Trap, written by young Christopher Reeve (like Clifford Cliff Anderson), one of Kane's former students. The couple believes that the death trap of Mr. Reeve is a hit necessary for the revival of Kane's career. <br /> <br /> "The trap is set for the wickedly ridiculous who will do it." <br /> <br /> Directed by Sydie Lumet, Ira Levin’s long-running Broadway hit doesn’t go too far from her stage origin. The cast is pleasant, and the plot twists are still exciting. One thing that did not work (for me) was the completion of the curtain bell; Of course, they played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; the performances do not work, but looking back, the greeting that Reeve gives to Kane at the East Hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling “Hi.” This place is not exactly East Hampton, but the windmill and the pond look the same. And a very adorable love scene is shockingly cool. But the play was so good that "even a talented director could not spoil it." And Mr. Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (03/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Diane Cannon, Irene Worth
