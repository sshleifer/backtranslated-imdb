BLIMEY. One of the greatest films I've ever seen, ever seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely loved him! Before the opening credits were made, I was glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is a sci-fi thriller - And the edge of your place is Whodunnit. Incredible. <br /> <br /> I wish it never ended. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is an unambiguous role. Anyone could play it. Chief actor Jeremy Northram was the perfect guy. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie who loved war games, sneakers and track out. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06. Walt D to LV
