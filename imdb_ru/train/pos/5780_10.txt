Maxx is a deep psychological introspective, slightly disguised as a strange story about superheroes. Julie Winters is a “freelance social worker” in an unnamed, dirty, crime-ridden city, and she and everyone she knows has many problems to deal with. Is Maxx her friend and client, a street bum who thinks he is a superhero in costumes - or vice versa? <br /> <br /> Maxx should not be overlooked for a work of art, the story itself or the excellent voice acting - especially the delightfully polite departed Barry Stigler, the stunningly angry voice acting of the main villain, Mr. Deceased. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see it, do not miss it.
