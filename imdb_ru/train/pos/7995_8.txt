Here is a tough story about the “get the bad guys” revenge, in which the main role was played by the relentless and rude Denzel Washington. He has three personalities here: a modest, now drunk, a former drunk mercenary, then a loving person like his father, a little girl, and then a cruel maniac, looking for answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> A story about Washington hired as a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico, where children are abducted regularly (at least according to the film). He becomes attached to the child the child wins. The actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington pursues the guilty and spares no one. Beware: this film is not for squeamish. <br /> <br /> This is a stylish movie, good and bad. I liked it, but many people found him too insane for their tastes, as camera work could have caused you a headache. I thought that this corresponded to a tense storyline and was exciting to watch, but this (shaky camera) is not for every taste. <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, there is always an interesting Christopher Walken, in the uncharacteristic restrained role and a number of other good actors. <br /> <br /> The film indulges the basic emotions of all of us, but it works.
