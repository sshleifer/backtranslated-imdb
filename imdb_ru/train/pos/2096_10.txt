With the advent of IMDb, this missed movie can now find an interested audience. What for? Because users who search for a two-time winner of the Oscar Glenda Jackson can find the Return of the Soldier among her works. So can those who check the winner of Oscar Julie Christie. Fans of Ann-Margret can give a name to the clique, as well as those who are looking into the career of the great Alan Bates. Not to mention the extra bonus of the film with the participation of heavyweights Ian Holm and Frank Finlay. Any film with so many celebrities is rewarded by IMDb, given all the cross-references that occur here. So why doesn't this movie go on DVD? Do producers really not understand that the database of films on the Internet is a marketing gift for such a film? And the Return of the Soldier is definitely a gem awaiting its discovery. Get with it, folks.
