In my opinion, this is absolutely Disney's romantic masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (the voice of Lucille La Verne) was really diabolical. You will need to watch a movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housework, Cinderella (the voice of Ilan Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. For me, the landscape was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I finish, I would like to say that everyone who participated in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to anyone who has not seen it yet. You have a good time, so go to the video store, rent or buy it, relax with a friend and see
