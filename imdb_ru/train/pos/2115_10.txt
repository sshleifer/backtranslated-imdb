After watching the movie "You Received Mail" and disappointment, I decided to watch the original film that inspired me to this movie, "Shop around the corner." I was amazed by this movie. This is a real gem and from this moment one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is so beautiful, the story is so beautiful that if you have not seen it, I want to encourage you to watch it today. I donâ€™t mind rework, and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one, but this time I have to admit that You Got Mail is a poor adaptation of this classic. Do not miss, go to your video store and rent a store around the corner today!
