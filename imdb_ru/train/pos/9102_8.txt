I saw this film at the 18th Haifa Film Festival, and it’s one of the best I’ve seen this year. Watching it on the big screen (and I mean BIG, not one of those television screens found in most cinemas) with an excellent sound system always improves the cinematic experience, because the movie captures your eyes and ears and draws you into the story in the picture. <br /> <br /> The film presents a set of characters that are loosely connected. Their stories intersected at certain points, and a lot of plot lines reminded me a lot of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films. But the real hero of the film is obviously the city of Madrid, which provides the background for the entire film. It contains the characters, contains the sidewalks and the roads along which they follow, and sets the background atmosphere for all the events, all in beautifully shot scenes. <br /> <br /> The film returns again and again to certain topics (shoes for example), and in essence Salazar makes his metaphors more and more understandable for the viewer as the movie moves. It combines views of the city with frames of characters and elegantly combines the feeling of a scene with a background. Many talented actors help him to portray a variety of characters. One fine example is the scene in which Juakin first leads Anita across the street. It may not work on a small screen, but on a big screen it easily gives me goosebumps. <br /> <br /> The message about the film is very positive, and, accordingly, the film is sometimes easy and fun. The music in the film is usually popular, with several instrumental pieces (I hope one day to put my hand on the soundtrack, although I seriously doubt it). <br /> <br /> All together, I came out of this film with a sensational feeling, and I'm not so impressed (you have to take my word for it). For this and more, I give this film a solid 8/10.
