Reading all the comments is very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of a true artist who painted pictures to show good times. I understand that all belong to j.j. as an artist in the family, but there was a real family in which there is a real artist, and he has not yet received any recognition in this presentation. So, if you do not mind, if someone can give the name of a real artist, I would also like to say to him “well done work”. I know that this is a spectacle for actors of GOOD TIME, but do not you agree that he also touched the hearts of all of us? I would like to know if he is still painting or he is still alive. I would like some of his works to be exhibited at my home.
