The number of times I have had tears in my eyes while watching a movie is not enough. And only once did I really cry, and just then I saw this film. There are several shots in this film, but I really don't care. I cry, even when I write it, and it has been quite a long time since I saw it. This is beautiful, and all production values ​​are good, but what is really important is a simple and wonderful message. We all know this in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. Only when we love, are we really alive. I know how sentimentally I sound, and I promise that usually I am not. I'm pretty cynical. This film has aroused in me a stronger feeling of sadness and happiness than in any other film, and it will probably always be the first film that I recommend to others to see.
