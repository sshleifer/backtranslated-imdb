My mother and I were returning home from a trip to the northeast (mostly to Massachusetts), when we decided to go a little bit to the film festival in Boston. I do not really understand the movie, so I thought that it might be a bit informative. The first film we saw was this one, RIMO-DEPARTMENT. I don't know about you, but I thought it was great! I am from Texas, and where I come from, we donâ€™t see too many films, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mom insisted that it be too cruel, but she said that I didn't know much about what she was saying, but it was a great picture. I was shocked by the sequence of the fight, they were great. Besides, I'm a big fan when the good guys win, so I was excited when the ladies of Romeo killed all the bad guys. It was a real shine. I'm not sure when this will be released on video, but if you have a chance, you should check it out. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. The word is for the wise, although it is rather cruel and contains many abusive words, so you may not want your children to watch. It is more for adults.
