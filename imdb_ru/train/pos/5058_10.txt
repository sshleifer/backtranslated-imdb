There should be more films about our Native Americans. I especially think that using real Native Americans would be right. I know that this Archie Belani, played by Pierce Brosnan, did an excellent job with the image of this character, since I was an Englishman. But I suggest Hollywood to put more American Indians on the role and never use anyone else again. The people of Siu have been put aside for too long. Their poverty is a shame for our country. I firmly believe that our country must return the Black Hills of Sioux. We ask Israel to return their lands to the Arabs, but we are not making any effort to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
