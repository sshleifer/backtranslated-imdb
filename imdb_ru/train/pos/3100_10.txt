By the end of the first hour, my jaw comfortably pressed against my legs. The film never, and I mean never, lets go in action. It may be a mild action, but it is an action. Once again, every cast member is perfect. The explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were workable, and the battles were incredible. Matt Damon will always be Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> All I really have to say is that every Born film is getting better, and this is no exception. Action, rates, plot. How they do it, I will never know. I applaud the man who wrote the screens for each of these films. Because if he hadn’t done such a great job with the first film, we wouldn’t have that to talk about. <br /> <br /> So don’t go to watch it in cinemas, watch it in cinemas if it's still where you live, but if not, then December 11 Born comes to your home!
