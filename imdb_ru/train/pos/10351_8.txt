When the Chamberlain family sets up camp near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her child pulled out of his tent because of the dingo, and then begins a test that no one should experience. It seems that the public or the press does not believe in the history of the dingo, and all this turns into a circus. Lindy does not help in cases because she will not play with the jury or in the courtroom, she is only herself and she is a toughie, therefore, of course, everyone thinks that she is guilty because there is evidence that has not yet reached up light Sam Neal is superb as Michael Chamberlain, the Seventh Day Adventist pastor, who doubts his faith and, possibly, his wife. Itâ€™s good (or bad) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid in other places as in the States, because the Australian public does not believe this story, and the media only fan the flames. In the end, Lindy was found guilty and sent to prison for hard work, but after years the missing evidence is revealed, and she is released, but only after the life of the family has been largely destroyed. A heartbreaking story, very well done, a little long, but worthy of attention. 8 out of 10.
