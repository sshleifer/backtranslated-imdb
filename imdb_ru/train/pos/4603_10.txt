There is one detail that is not very common in Jackie Chan films, but which is present here. It is very tough and serious atmosphere, although there are funny elements. Jackie is formidable and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is being attacked, and only then he resists (in the usual calm order), but he is the one who can go and start a confusion. His manner of defeating an evil guy with glasses is amazing. Every time he goes "crack!" I also especially like the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and beats the villains who opposed his girlfriend. This is one of the best blitzkriegs on the screen. In addition, the whole scene was shot against the background of some action movie painted on the wall (it also looks like a poster "worker" from our Soviet era) and left on several lines in Russian (I noticed it completely by accident). It looks amazing (and nostalgic for the Russian people). I also like it when the windows break into the movies. There is a lot of it all. It's pretty amazing to watch the characters fall / jump / run / drive through all kinds of glasses. <br /> <br /> All three movies are great. I was preparing to look at the quality of the slide, but I saw the perfect trilogy with meaning and incredible stunts (and not only the character Jackie Chan appears in all three films â€” it is also excellent and maintains continuity). <Br /> <br /> I would like to describe each film in a few words: No. 1 - great (in all aspects - this is one exciting story from the very beginning to the very end) and funny (many scenes are funny); No. 2 - raging (Jackie is really buzzing here) and painful (Jackie is tortured); No. 3 is incredible (the woman who fights with Jackie is incredible) and pompous (should I mention a lot of weapons and explosions?). <br /> <br /> As for the rest - many others have mentioned. <br /> <br /> This is a trilogy that can be watched over and over (at least I). His place in the top 10 among the militants and comedic decorations. Finally, it was released in Russia on DVD (the second film has the best options - Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
