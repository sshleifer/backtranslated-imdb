Absolutely brilliant. Powerful and memorable. The most convincing documentary series about the war. His tone contrasts sharply with the often reckless attitude toward World War II, as demonstrated by the media. Instead of screaming about the horror of war, he lets Sir Lawrence Olivier's quiet voice recede into the background of true images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, frightened citizens and soldiers, broken people, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, suffering innocents. Most of all, it really brings home what humanity is capable of when all the normal rules of "politeness" are removed. In a man in a true natural state there is something distinctly Hobbes, he will return to a more atrocious form capable of committing crimes that will shock and captivate 60 years later. Perhaps there may be a continuation of the series entitled “A Century in War,” for the twentieth century was indeed a century of horror. I feel that, ironically, of great importance, an event occurred that led to the death of 50 million people in order to create such a convincing and excellent show like this one.
