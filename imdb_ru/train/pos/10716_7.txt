I watch this on Star World's overseas network, which buys American and Canadian TV shows that last one or two seasons, such as The Jane Show. I thought about how many female main comedy shows I actually can watch myself, there is Lucy, the Sorceress, I dream of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes blank, I can't think of any of others, all women play a secondary role, and do not play a leading role. So for me, The Jane Show is in pretty good company. One thing I was just thinking about. I watched a few things done in Canada, and I never remember that something was filmed in the usual series that shows SNOW! It's all done in mid-summer, lol! Of course, this is a great place to live with the climate in the summer, but you would THINK that in the winter they will show a bit of Canada, as this is also a part of their lifestyle. I mean SCTV, “Just for Laughter” comes to mind as two comedy shows that have been going on in Canada for a long time, and very little or nothing is filmed by the presence of snow, although they both shoot a lot on the street. I got distracted, but it seems like I laugh at Jane and her obviously liberal methods of accusing racism towards her neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his madness, I found him on a par with the British TV series called “IT crowd” (I think) office comedy with a female lead. Not by any means the best comedy, but for a guy to say that he can watch him alone, that says something. If I were with my wife, she would like it very much, as it concerns office sex and the like, so couples may like couples. 7 out of 10.
