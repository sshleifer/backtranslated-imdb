The arrival of the world famous conductor of unexpected events and events in a small village. Some people are threatened by the way he manages the church choir, and how people in it are gradually changing. This film is heartfelt and makes you leave the cinema with a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. This is about identifying the best people, and Kay Pollack wrote a great script based on the ideas with which he became so famous. The actors are outstanding, Michael Nyquist, whom we knew before, but Frida Hallgren was for me a new and charming acquaintance. She has the brightest face that leaves no one indifferent. Per Moberg plays the role of Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is also terrible. One can only wish that one day he was invited to play a good guy, so that we can see if he can handle this character as well. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you indifferent. If you haven't seen it yet, do it today!
