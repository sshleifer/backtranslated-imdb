This movie is incredible. If you have a chance, take a look. Although a warning, you will cry. I do, every time I see it, and I own it and have watched it many times. The performances are outstanding. This concerns darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. According to my English teacher, this film made me look at the world differently. Also, if you saw it, pay attention to the interesting use of shadows and light. The home room is a phenomenal film, and I rate it for 10 seconds - for real - because of the great game, the stunning storyline, and the heartbreaking dialogue. Very stressful, very touching. Does not give answers to all questions, but gives a lot of good comments about humanity
