My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be “Drunken Master” (1978), followed by this 1985 film “Police Story”. In this film, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-policeman who ravages the notorious criminal lord and his gang, and then is assigned to protect this man's girlfriend (Bridget Lin) so that she can provide evidence of the state. As a continuation of the story, the gangster sends his thugs to send Lin, but Chan takes matters into his fists and legs, keeping Maggie Cheung's girlfriend in awe. Like the Drunken Master, there are many proprietary stunts and stunning martial arts / choreography of militants that Chang was famous for, which culminated in the royal battle in a crowded mall. In the role of director, Chan perfectly copes with the task, demonstrating a charismatic and funny performance that underlines the action. Despite the lightness of the drunken master's general humor, in the depths of his heart “Police Story” is just a police story, a rough police thriller that will often be copied in subsequent years. <br /> <br /> 10/10
