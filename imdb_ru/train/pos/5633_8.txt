Farrah Fawcett is gorgeous in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape from the clutches of a potential rapist. Well done to Farrah for being nominated for Best Actress in the Golden Globe. <br /> <br /> When her rapist Joe (badly played by James Rousseau) enters her house, which she shares with her two roommates (who conveniently left!), Marjorie must meet the frightening demands of Joe. It makes some disturbing and shocking images! <br /> <br /> When her roommates get home, they are amazed (at least) by the actions of Marjorie and the great game Alfre Woodard, who is desperately trying to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police, the film becomes even more cool . <br /> <br /> I find Diane Scarwid rather annoying, but when Joe finally confesses that he came here to kill them all. This makes the film a very emotional part of the drama. <br /> <br /> In general, “Extremities” is a brilliantly thought out and well-played film, and I must have watched it hundreds of times! Well done for all participants.
