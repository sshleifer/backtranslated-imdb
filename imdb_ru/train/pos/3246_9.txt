I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago, and I could not help but laugh. Everything in this film seemed to click: storyline, characters, setting. As for the film, I would not call it a big film, but what it was supposed to be fantastic. It understands the meaning. The cast is perhaps as good as any other comedy film. Corben Berson, Fred Gwynn, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neill are hilarious. For those who have not seen this, I will give you a brief overview: the four criminals met in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from a friend about a bank robbery. However, when their friend was arrested by two policemen who were chasing him from New Jersey, they try to find out what is happening, and all hell fails. This film is a really great comedy with banking capers, and it looks like the version of Eleven Oceans for the poor, with only four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana, not in Las Vegas. In general, if you want to laugh, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie.
