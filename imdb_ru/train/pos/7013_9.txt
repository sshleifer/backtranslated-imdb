"Seven Pounds" presents Will Smith's exciting performance and story that pulls you in the hearts more than a rock guitarist in the middle of a solo. He passes by the director’s previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a film that I also loved. Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino because some of his films may go unnoticed if the actor attached to the project is not so high-class. <br /> <br /> It’s a pity that I understood Will Smith’s scheme early, I connected two and two when he calls his suicide in the first scene and scene when Rosario Dawson’s character is presented as an incurable heart - <br /> <br However, I still think that the screenwriter / director made the right choice by putting the flyleafs (the flyleaves are the first and last scenes) so this is the source of urgency and tension in the film, gradually learning exactly how a person can be brought to this final sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see how the relationship between The characters of Smith and Dawson are flourishing and developing, always knowing in their hearts that they are preparing these unfortunate two. <br /> <br /> One of my friends with whom I saw the film thought that the character Smith could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when he is present in the presence of his seven elect, but in other cases, he could be sharp and scary, and when he was alone he was in full weight from his position too much for him, and he completely broke down. This is a fairly versatile presentation. <br /> <br /> Finally, I cannot fail to mention the reconstruction of the crash scene, which was really amazing from the point of view of cinematography in combination with music. Put it on your list.
