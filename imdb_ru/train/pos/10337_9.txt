This film was very funny, I would like to own it for my vintage collection of the 1970s film, which should be seen again, I know this set of characters, these are the people I have met for many years and which encourage me to look for this comedy Unfortunately, it has never been recorded on DVD or VHS. Redd Fox is always a comedy clown, Pearl Bailey is great as a witty and sassy wife, Norman is a son with a secret, not sure if he will have a future if he comes out, Dennis Dugan is a crazy funny person. Miss Dobson is a prostitute with a soul and a little conscience. Love, passion, strange family ties, this film is preparing to return for an encore, a comedy of situations in which events are mixed, as it can and should find its use as a remake. I think that finding the actors would be extremely difficult, maybe impossible, except Jerry Seinfeld, who plays the role of Dennis Dugan, marks a couple of Seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to Norman, so this is what you were is certainly impossible, because it is impossible to reform the pretended friend and the unfaithfulness of the parent. This film was a wild taxi driver advice, remind me of an episode in which Kramer takes his lawyer's advice over his lawyer. (episode from Seinfeld) Parents have a moment when the jaw drops, fun over fun, This is a cry, bring me back.
