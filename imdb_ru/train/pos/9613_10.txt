Difficult to describe Bug in words, this is one of those films that you really need to see to understand. It follows a narration that is smoother and more interesting than anything I've seen lately in a Hollywood release. Since his characters react differently to the chain of events, and events dictate different ways of following characters, the audience is just an observer. An almost assertive narrative stream of thoughts to thought, the very spontaneity of the script will make you stick to the screen, looking forward to see how it all works in the end. As for the thematic elements ... there is a certain sequence in the film, which goes from melancholy to bright and beautiful, and then to the tragic - all for about a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. This is reminiscent of why an independent film is perhaps the brightest star in the film industry right now. Perhaps with a lot of Bug quality films, people will start to notice.
