I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70s, when I was only 16, when I watched another movie. Oh!!!! how excited i am and my best friend. we could not wait a month or so until it came. I saw this film 17 times this year in the theater. I love, love, love it. Chris is perfect for the movie. He is defiant and somewhat trashy, but at the same time shy and unsure with Babs, and I am so pleased to watch him again. When they sing evergreens in the studio, and he calls in his hoarse voice, so different from the perfect notes that she heard, but I always thought that this was one of the best scenes in the film. The way he looks at her, and he is so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress as before. I even had a long sweater and a cap that was the same as hers. it came on tv on time, and i got my daughters to watch it, they were teenagers, and they liked it. Maybe it’s just that I got so into this at the age when everything was extreme, I don’t know. The ending is always in my tears even today.
