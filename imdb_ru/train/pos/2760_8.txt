Everyone we meet influences our thinking, changes our images, a little bit of this person rubs against us. “Eighth Day” raises this topic (compare “Rainmaker”). In this film, Harry (Daniel Othey), a businessman expert in sales psychology, meets Georges (Pascal Duken), a child with Down syndrome, who is on the run. The winning performances of both actors give this film the main force. The initial sequence is excellent when Georges tells his theory about the creation of the world, and in the final scene we find that God created on the eighth day. There are a few moments in history that upset Harry very much. For example, Georges, who is completely free, requires a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. This is the scene where you laugh through tears. I liked the scene when a group with Down syndrome on a trip to the Art Gallery is saved by bus and crashes into the amusement park Paradis. The most humorous of all the embarrassment is the scene where Harry and Georges drive horses on the highway and, looking back, Georges gives the driver a crude salute. But there are some tender scenes, especially the impressive use of close-ups - hands feel the sun, wind and rain, hands rise, hands stretch and shrink in love and friendship. This is a real movie that touches the heart. There are very touching scenes in which Georges suggests Natalie, where Georges presses Harry's head on his hands, where Georges continues to call his dear mother, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh ... I felt that the film had a profound message that life was beautiful the presence of grass (did you know that she was crying when you cut it?), the trees above her head, the song of birds, small insects are all wonders of nature. They are all there to enjoy, if we just relax (like Harry and Georges), look around us and listen ...... A wonderful movie.
