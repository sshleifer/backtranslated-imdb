I did not expect the powerful filmmaking of "Girlfight". This is indie; low-budget, without eminent actors, a newbie director. I heard that it was good, but not so good. <br /> <br /> While in the modern, ethnic, working class of Brooklyn, Karin Kusama did an extraordinary job of capturing everyday urban struggles. Hispanic. Diana, the main character, is seething with anger and lashing out at her peers from high school, getting into trouble with the school and her friends. She is brought up by her single father, who seems to love her and her brother, but uses a strict sex-based double standard on his children. The father’s double standard is illustrated by the fact that Brother Tini takes boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied such classes. On instructions to the gym to meet with Tiny, Diana is keen on boxing. Tini doesn't like boxing, so he and Diana change places; he gets money from dad and then gives them to Diana so that they can take lessons for him. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a well-being film, as Diana grows up and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy, and solves some very serious questions head on. There is no giggling, “everything that can go right, goes right,” resolution a la “Beat the Beckham.” The reality and the attendant personal problems are too great to solve the problems, but, in my opinion, “Girlfight” is a better and more pleasant film for him.
