This is one of the best movies of the 80s in my collection, which I think about all the time. <br /> <br /> “The Running Man” is one of the best and most varied films of Arnold to this day, and when I first saw “The Running Man”, I was so excited to see such a film. I just love all the fights, and this is really a special movie. He also has Jesse Ventura, legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Japhet Cotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosalez Jr., who always seem to love death in their films because he was killed in films such as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and among others. All fans of Arnold should love this film from the very beginning to the end, because its action is filled with stars, and one of the best for today is Arnold!
