I think many people simply wrote it off as another of Tom Cruise’s strange films (“Magnolia”, “Eyes Wide Shut”), but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own movie. Many people said it was strange; it was not It was different and confusing, but not strange. Strange it is Stanley Kubrick or Paulie Shore. Great is the Truman Show. Confuses the Matrix or the Game. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Ames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's the thing. This is where the so-called “weirdness” appeared, which distracted critics. If they had bothered to “open [their] eyes” like the original Spanish film of 1997, they would see it. And if there are not enough reasons for this, look at the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to establish "feeling" - that notorious element that is not found in many films. With songs like The Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys playing in the dramatic and emotional climax of the film, it creates an unusual, but amazingly “right” feeling. An amazing film with his script, music, acting and images, unfortunately, Vanilla Sky, a superficial film that is criticized for looking smart. Excellent: A +
