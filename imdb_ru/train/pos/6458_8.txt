Beautiful film, deeply affecting the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This film was almost perfect, and, seeing that nothing in this world can really be perfect, this is very good. The only insignificant thing that I subjectively object to is the placement of personnel at some points in the middle of the story. The acting is also very good, and all the actors easily become the best actors in high-profile films. The actual manual seems to have been well thought out, and the script must have been awesome. There are some truly breathtaking moments of omen and a rather magnificent continuous circular composition of the story. <br /> <br /> The moment in the film, when the main character achieves the fact that the feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending really shiny yarn.
