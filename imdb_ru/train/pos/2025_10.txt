Anna Brontes' epic novel "Residential House" should be studied and read in schools, libraries and living rooms of people. This is a fantastic story telling the "real" truth about alcoholism and broken marriages, and mothers are fighting to keep their son from staying away from her cruel husband. These are so similar today's stories that we see and hear, and I believe that people can learn a lot by reading this book. Based on the possible true experience that the author received in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, it is an excellent version of the book and is really very exciting. I am sure that Anna herself would be pleased with how this was done. <br /> <br /> Great game and great locations.
