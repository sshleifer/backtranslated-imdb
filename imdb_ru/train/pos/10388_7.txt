I'm a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard television show. And I really liked this movie. I liked it here much more than with other summer blockbusters. <br /> <br /> It's funny to hear people swear at this movie with such excuses as “lame plot” and “it's so much tougher than the show”. Does anyone remember the rudeness of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy pokes fun at incest, and Bo says Luke probably had half the children in the orphanage. The only reason for which it was cleared is that it was changed to an earlier time interval. <br /> <br /> As for the plot? It was Duke’s perfect plot. In fact, as a remake, it probably remains more truthful to the source material than any television show that has gone to the big screen. <br /> <br /> Although Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are NOT ONLY like their small screen versions, they do an excellent job and work very well together. I was not too keen on Boss Hogg. And I would like a little more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the film, Roscoe is a bit ... scary. <br /> <br /> Who didn't have a smile on his face when General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the Hazzard country roads? <br /> Guys, allow yourself to enjoy the film, which is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikini and car chases, you will not regret it. This is just a great dumb movie!
