As a biopic, “The Lady with Red Hair” (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco turned Mrs. Leslie Carter’s notorious divorce into a star of the international scene) is certainly not in collusion with another Warner's biopic about a similar vintage, “Yankee Doodle Dandy” (what is this?), But “Lady” is a nice movie in itself - and it shares quite a few similarities with Cagney’s classic. <br /> <br /> Like “Yankee Doodle Dandy”, “The Lady with Red Hair” is full of the old flavor of show business. (Among other things, both films show the hostel’s delightful theatrical sequences, as well as the inevitable scenes that take place behind the scenes and in the theater management offices.) In addition, in The Lady, as in Kohan’s biographical film, the auxiliary act is composed of familiar and favorite actors. of that time, all doing first-class work, for which we remember them. <br /> <br /> Is it necessary to add that, like “Yankee Doodle Dandy”, “Lady with red hair” does not allow the truth to interfere with telling a good story? But, as well as “Dandy”, “Lady” succeeds - great! - to convey the essence of his great personality to the hero of show business giant. Everyone knows that Cagney forever imprinted Kohan in his brilliant and affectionate image in “Yankee Doodle Dandy” - but few moviegoers realize that Claude Reins did a similar service to David Belasco in “The Lady with Red Hair” - and did it in a manner that equal to kegni. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco perfectly reflects the galvanic individuality of this legendary showman in all his great glory. The rain gives an incredibly pleasant, superbly observable and surprisingly realistic presentation that a man on Broadway once called the "Wizard." Watching Claude Rains in action (looking at each frame as if he is having a great time!) In Lady with Red Hair is to see David Belasco come to life in the film, as if he can't wait to shake things up on the main thing. trunk again. <br /> <br />
