Sometimes you have to look back to go ahead. The 60s did just that. We need to remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> A great mix by Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to be nominated and win 60 best mixers of the year. <br /> <br /> The best mini-series of all time. <br /> <br /> Thanks Ursula <br /> <br />
