Last night, I was on a cracker bag preview before previewing Disney's Holes. I do not know who decided to show it, but I am very glad that they did. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot of Australia in the early 80s, seen by the eyes of a child. The "conversations" between Eddie and her brother were fun and, as in the rest of the film, so loyal to life. Each shot caused a feeling of nostalgia, reminding me of my own childhood (being the same age as the director might help a little), and the sound reinforced this feeling. I only hope that I will see Cracker Bag again.
