********* Ten out of ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that this was done for a television movie. Just the phrase “made from TV” makes me shudder. Production figures for TV films created are almost always significantly lower than production figures for professional film studios. However, this version of "The Christmas Carol" was supposed to be released in theaters, because it is so good. This is my personal favorite from all the films “Christmas Carol”, because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are a few minor glitches on the screen with two ghosts who visit Scrooge, but there is no film in which there would be at least a couple of errors. <br /> <br /> Scott turns the star performance in the role of Scrooge, it is a pleasure to watch him. In fact, I can not remember a single performance in this film, which is not worth applauding. Suit, shooting and winter background fascinate. The music is very nice and warms the heart. Add to this a solid direction, impeccable cinematography and the correct script; Here we have something that will one day be considered a festive classic. It really wasn't long enough to be a classic, but mark my words, one day it will be soon. This film has become an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning of Christmas: love, dedication and giving. In a selfish, greedy world, my family and I can get lost in the “Christmas Carol” starring George Scott.
