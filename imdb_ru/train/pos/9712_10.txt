In another review, this troupe compared something between Monty Python and Twin Peaks. Another review outlines the differences between comedy, which we enjoy uncritically, and black comedy, which is also worth considering. <br /> <br /> Look at all this, all three series. In the end, all the characters are connected, and the puzzle pieces fall into place just like the Douglas Adams novel. Details and subtleties stun. Carefully postmodern. Evil is ridiculous and strikingly tragic. Not for kids. Not for those who have thin skin or who lack objectivity. Food for thought. Immediately literal, imaginative and surreal in anxious relationship. The blackest comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> And perhaps the most wonderful thing I've ever seen.
