This film tells about the life of a person who grew up in worse circumstances, but, unlike many people, actually grew up to become a respectable person. Moreover, it is a true story. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher is so innocent, and yet he is hurt only because he is not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same woman for ten years, and he never fooled around with women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol, or any other things that are very popular in the places where he grew up. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing more to say about this movie, it’s great. The only rating I can give is 10/10.
