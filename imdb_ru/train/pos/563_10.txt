The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (except for a few days, during which Mann worked on Night Passage before parting with the star under less than friendly circumstances), The Far Country disproves his main view to propose another portrait embittered man reluctantly to his redemption, fighting with him at every turn. This time, he is a livestock driver, whose reaction to labor problems — the challenge of troubled cowsheds at a shootout at the end of the journey — leads his cattle to be confiscated by robbed judge John McIntyre of the school of law and order Roy Bean. Having stolen them and crossing the Canadian border, he soon finds himself unwittingly embroiled in a growing conflict between prospectors and the judge, when he cheats or kills them from his demands ... <br /> <br /> Although this is not so big a surprise Stewart turns in the end, he is surprisingly stale beasts along the way, even using his desire to just be alone, to justify, without warning the group of scouts about the impending avalanche, when he has a chance, because this is not his problem, For most of the film me I expect him and McIntyre to have only the breadth of his hair, which the judge immediately recognizes, reveling in the spirit of a soul mate, even though he ingeniously plans to lynch him. In many ways, citizens who believe in him probably also recognize this - despite their calls for his dead and buried better nature, there is an unspoken admission that the only person who can resist the judge is someone almost as bad , How is he. <br /> <br /> As usual with Mann, there is an exclusive use of places with high terrain, although this time the final bout takes place out of the blue, and the film is almost perfectly filmed with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (although Corinne Calvert's young romantic interests deviate from annoying). Unfortunately, the excellent cinematic picture of the Canadian Rockies is not much different from the explicitly expressed DVD, and as an additional only theatrical trailer.
