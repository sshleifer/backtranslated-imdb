I cannot believe that I am only now seeing this film — I think, perhaps, I thought it was another slave abuse film, and I avoided Root for the same reason — just as I had not yet seen the List Schindler does not want to be "entertained" by the pain of other people, no matter how authentic or informative it must be. <br /> <br /> So I think that the main thing that I noticed in The Color Purple is that it’s not that black people are mistreated with white people. Blacks were well able to rape their own daughters or give them up for their “husbands” to be considered slaves. It was painful to look at it, but in the end, everyone bought himself, and the game was phenomenal! I could not believe that the character of Oprah was playing at 35! And I adore Whoopi to begin with - she was awesome. I am so glad that I felt lousy yesterday, and The Color Purple worked on Showtime.
