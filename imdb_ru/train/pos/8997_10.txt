I have seen this movie several times. I think that one of the funniest things is to just watch the reaction of different types of people who come to see it. <br /> <br /> Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. Many older Japanese men and women go to this film because they think it will be a samurai film with honest kindness, with lots of fencing and medieval Japanese dialogue. As soon as the two main characters start discussing horror films, inserting curses almost randomly into their sentences, the old people leave, as a rule, with disgust. <br /> <br /> Type 2: FILMS OF FILMS. These people think that due to the fact that the film bears the label “Independent”, it will automatically become a burden of difficult-to-see, overly emotional nonsense, which may or may not be in English. And yet they see it anyway, just to glorify it later, so that people think that they are smart and cultural. They are really waiting for a surprise when they see this movie. As soon as blood begins to flow because of anime-inspired sword battles or when a villain from the top casually pins the dog with a crossbow during a telephone conversation, these people will be so alarmed that they will come out. Some will stay to see "how bad it will be," and then they will be delighted with what a terrible movie it was for their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: PEOPLE Waiting to SEE LIVE ACTION. OR MATRIX-AS SPECIAL EFFECTS. Sorry guys, martial arts are pretty strong in the film, but director Yamasato doesn't really have that kind of budget. <br /> <br /> Type 4: PEOPLE WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS. These are people who really like the movie. Regardless of whether they heard about the Samurai Blood, chose it by chance or stumbled in the wrong theater in an alcohol mist, these are people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the film for what it is: This film was not created in order to enlighten or provoke deep spiritual reflections, he had in mind (if you can borrow a line of dialogue from the film) in order to “really kick ass.” And this is what he does. <br /> <br /> So depending on what type of people you are, you can or cannot enjoy this movie; However, if you value the film for what it is, and you can enjoy the excess of blood and acting, then watch this film and be sure to bring your friends.
