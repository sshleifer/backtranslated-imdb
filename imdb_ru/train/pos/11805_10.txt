Fragglerock is excellent in that Schindler's List was excellent. Great watches for kids and adults of all genders. Big noses can be seen as hints of phallic symbols, just like Kh.R. Puff N. Stef hinted at marijuana smoking. Your kids will love this movie. I enjoyed it very much like a child. My father showed me this film in childhood. He also enjoyed it and indicated that exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. Although at that time I had no idea what it was. The film is comedic and adventure. The storyline is stupid and fun. I and you will enjoy it together.
