This is a story about Shin-e, who moves to Milyang from Seoul with her young son, Jun, to start over after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here, and she opens a piano school, but she also has ambitions to own land for the insurance money she received from death. If this is what the film is about, then it would probably be like a Hollywood film when she fell in love with some local guy and was happy with her son in their new home. But this is not Hollywood. Her son is abducted and killed, ostensibly because it is known that she has money from the settlement. The process of grief, trying to move on, trying to clear your conscience from guilt - everything is done perfectly, and the leading actress is gorgeous. The only warning, and I must say that this is a depressing film. You need to know what's going on. You want Shin-e to go through her grief and find some happiness. Again, this is not Hollywood, this is Korea, and in Korean cinema, especially in drama, they do not break through. Life is what happens to you. Great acting, but sometimes hard to watch a movie because of what is happening. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do it.
