This is primarily a film about tiptoe, this is a romantic comedy. Between them there is a fair balance. There are some pretty cute battle scenes in this particular movie, I don't think any wires were used, or if they were, they wouldn't be frank. This is not a very complicated film, so it’s easy for the brain, you don’t need to analyze anything to get a deeper meaning, it’s quite simple, good chemistry between presenters and fun hours. I would have liked if they had unleashed the full potential of the girl’s appearance only once, because she can be surprisingly sweet, but throughout the entire film they keep her in a rather restrained way. I would watch it again ... with a girl.
