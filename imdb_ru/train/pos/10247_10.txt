This film is banned in almost every foreign country that I can think of. The Japanese (?) That are shot in this film should have been desperate to look for work, or we are just friends. Here's a scoop: <br /> <br /> Three thugs torture a hell of a helpless woman, they use all sorts of things to end up killing her, they burn her, kick her, spin in her chair (more than 200 times!), They use sound torture (forcing her to listen to a static sound for more than 20 hours! It sounds not so bad at all, but it CAN make you go insane). They throw guts into her (probably from an animal) while she knocks it out, and she gets excited when she wakes up. And who can forget the grand finest THE BIGGEST TORTURE THROUGH THE EYES THAT I EVER saw is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to scare people and make them sick! As I said, purely underground. Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror or alien smell. If you are not very, I strongly recommend that you read the series before watching! From the point of view of blood, shock and creativity, he gets 10, but the storyline and the like - 1. Underground classics ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is 8/10 <br />
