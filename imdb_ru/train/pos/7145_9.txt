In this film there was a great ensemble of adult actors, as well as young actors who will be in the cinema for a long time, if there is justice. Directing and editing were great. I can see the book from which it was adapted, it must have been great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, John Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were just awesome! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but it was fun when they were on the screen. The children in the camp could not be better. (as I said, I liked it!)
