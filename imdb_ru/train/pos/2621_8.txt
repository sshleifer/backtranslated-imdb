Disney did it again. It's brilliant how Timone and Pumba come to life again to tell us how they met and to help Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and watch it again and again. This shows how Timone lived with his family and other meerkats before heading to find the home of his dreams and adventures. Then he meets Pumba and everything changes. Together, they are looking for a home that Timon wants, and they are constantly failing, which is funny, because Timon is becoming more and more crazy. Then Simba appears, and we see more of his childhood than in the previous two films. You already know the rest.
