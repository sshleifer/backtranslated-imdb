The French brothers Naudet did what no one else did; they had a video camera on the day this tragedy occurred. They were in building number 2, when you could see the paper fall, people fall to the ground, jumping from that height. <br /> <br /> I mean that until the moment when both buildings collapsed, they ran, their Camera was still working, when white dust covered them, they found the doorway of the store and got inside, but all the frames are real, and I think they did a fantastic job to capture them for us. <br /> <br /> Ten Stars go to the Naudett brothers who shot this extraordinary film, which I watch every 9/11, so I will never forget what this country went through. I believe that if I remember correctly, this shows the first death of a fireman priest when he was carried to the church and to his honorary funeral.
