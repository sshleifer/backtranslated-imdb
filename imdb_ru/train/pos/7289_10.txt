It was one of the first CREEPY films I've ever seen ... I was then about 5 years old. It scared me GOOD! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to look like a monster ... and my mother was very upset. She had to clear my eye with alcohol, and the next day my eye smelled like DOUBLE Mint! NOW IT IS A FILM! Hi, for this time it was a great movie. The head sitting on the tabletop was as real as it was then. And if your 5 is very scary! Children today are spoiled with special effects that show too much and do not leave ANYTHING to your imagination. Your mind can imagine things more terrible than special effects! (IMO)
