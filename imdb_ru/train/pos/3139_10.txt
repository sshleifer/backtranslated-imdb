There are many types of reunion meetings. One type is when old actors are taken out of mothballs and recreate characters that they have not played for twenty or thirty years. They have mixed results. "Returning to Mayberry," despite some stupidity, was fine; “Return to the Green Acrus” as feasible (Eddie Albert used the word for the script, which I will not repeat here, but he and the film stink); “Salvation from Gilligan Island” filled the necessary gap in the story about the shoots, although the show itself was stupid even from the point of view of “Gilligan Island”. In most cases, the scenarios are weak; sometimes stupidity appears in the scripts, which is too knowing ?? and in comedies for characters it is almost always fatal to know that they are funny. Presents new characters that do not match the mix. Basically, these reunion shows are rather weak. The second kind of show "reunion" is a view in which the actors put their past aside, but sit idle, telling stories, recalling, interspersing the memories from the show. Then there are films based on shows that are rarely good; and films based on the history of the show (“Brady Bunch” happened and that, and another with different results). <br /> <br /> “Returning to Batcave” uses almost all of the above, from a surprisingly perverse point of view, which makes him the best of the reunion ideas, and raised the bar for others. <br /> <br /> Adam West and Burt Ward both summoned the original Batmobile to a show. While they are there, the car is stolen. <br /> <br /> Adam West from the movie is a crazy man. He called Jerry, his butler, Alfred. He opens the bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and discovers a hidden pole to go down to the garage. He is obsessed with being a crime fighter, although in reality he is just a washed actor. When a Batmobile is stolen, he not only believes that his duty as a crime fighter is to return him, but also drags him and does not want Burt Ward to become his assistant. <br /> <br /> The chase is mostly chatty, with memories of the West and Ward. about old days. It is broken by "memories" with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. Modern scenes and “memories” already have a foolish lack of reality that the show supports. There are also running jokes that show that West is able to play a trick on himself: in Ward’s book about his time at the show, he frankly spoke about West’s libido, and also about the fact that he is a joker (West makes Ward pay for everything they need , on tips and travel by bus). The clues they follow, the characters they meet (even in the memories), are consistent with the mentality of the old series, and there are several flaws, including fist fights with written sound effects. <br /> <br /> The thing is, very funny and made with a big scale. There are also cameos by Julia Newmar (it looks like she had too many facelifts) and Frank Gorshin, reminding us why he is such an admirer. Gorshin will become Riddler when Jim Carey, his apparent successor, has long been forgotten. The film evolves to a rather obvious, but funny climax. <br /> <br /> This show is a model for a reunion show ?? unfortunately, few can match the pattern. In this show, the actors outplayed their old characters; young actors play a movie about making a show; West and Ward actors recall; and a modern film with the real Adam West playing the mad Adam West. It has everything. If you liked the old show, it's a cork on the bottle.
