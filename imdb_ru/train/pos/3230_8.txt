Well, the Soldier is not as deep and significant as Blade Runner or a budget as big as Terminator 2, but overall I found it quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in the character did not speak and made moments practically without emotion when his humanity was breaking through more and more sharply. I found his depiction of limited emotional development more touching than Arnie in T-movies (and before I get the comments, I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was a human, but the premise put forward by both films was the same). <Br /> <br /> So for the film itself, a sensible American / British cast will be able to reveal this little story. I’m not quite sure if Gary Buzzy and his two substitute were villains or goodies, so he couldn’t decide if I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic, neither bewildered by peace-loving / gullible / cowardly garbage that was destroyed on the march, nor by a group of subversive aggressive terrorists who are paranoid about foreigners and each other. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good, and unlike other comments, I don’t think that it will have a negative impact on his career (unlike, perhaps, “Escape from Los Angeles” - such unstable permanent sequels creatures!). Shaun Pertwee was really proud of his late father, continuing the noble sci-fi line of families. And the rest of the cast helped reveal this pathetic group of people who got the most out of a bad situation and not too bad. <br /> <br /> If you see this on your television schedule, I would recommend giving it a chance. , I do not think you will be disappointed.
