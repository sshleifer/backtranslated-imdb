And this someone is me. And not only me, as I see here, on IMDb or when leaving the theater. Why do people love it? This is obvious: by now everyone knows zombies (at least, horror fans by heart, and the rest - through rethinking the film "Dawn of the Dead" or the film "Resident Evil", etc.) <br /> <br /> Or, at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... until this movie appeared. And you will see zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror film, although it contains scenes of violence, but rather a comedy. Satire, to be exact. And it never runs out! That is why I rated it so highly. Wisely, it’s unbelievable, the acting is great, and there are no (obvious) mistakes in the script ... quite the opposite: it’s a gem, and if you're a little interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you do not like them, look! Because it is a great (comedic) movie!
