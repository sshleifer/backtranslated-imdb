I could not disagree with the rating that was given to this film, and I believe that this is an example of how close the majority of viewers around the world are. In fact ... did you forget that Kino was a kind of art before some of the magnates tried to make it just entertainment? This film is not entertainment, at least, not such a light entertainment, as in such films as "Titanic" or "Gladiator". He has a style, he is different, it is shocking ... That's why most of you hate him so much: because he is not trying to please you. This is just a story, very strange, I admit, but in the end, only a strange story. This is not a great story, not even an excellent work in the cinema, but I believe that the 7-star rating is only for the courage of both the author and the director to shoot the plot, which was not created to appeal to viewers, and thus sell billions of copies and making great studios even richer. This film for me is a European feature film made in the USA, and everyone who participates in its creation deserves respect. Be it for courage, or to be for a unique sense of humor.
