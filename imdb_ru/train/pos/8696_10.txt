One of the unsung pearls of the 1980s, "Scenes", includes an incredible satire and outstanding performances by Arnetia Walker (how did she not get a bunch of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. This is a wonderful group war and people in these classes. The letter is funny and the characters, although not subtle, are nuances. And, excuse me, but the Asian gangs (if you can name one Japanese guy who extorted one of the other characters as a “gang”) were not replaced by “sociological value”, as follows from another review. The value here lies in what the film makes a joke of and how it does it. I found it creative, funny and original.
