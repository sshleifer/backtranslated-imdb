First things first! This is not an action movie, although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it with American sports films! Where a team of very bad players succeeds in unthinkable, winning a game or tournament beyond expectations In this case, this is not about football or baseball, but about taekwondo! In the beginning, these street thugs seem useless! But soon we will find out that they do not want to be bandits and are really trying to achieve something in life! Nice to see them fighting and training! I was surprised how funny this movie was! From start to finish, you'll laugh at your pants! Young Korean actors are very convincing! Go see this wonderful movie "Feel good"!
