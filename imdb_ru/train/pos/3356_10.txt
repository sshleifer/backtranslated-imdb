Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched “C'eravamo tanto amati” on a summer night: we liked it, but we didn’t like it, because we loved “Special Day”. I believe that Ettore Scola is undervalued: we often forget to remember him, perhaps because his recent films were disappointing. So, last night my mother and I sat on the sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. The writing, directing, cinematography, score and staging were sober and precise, but I liked the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni most of all. They are both great actors and starring Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fanatical fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for huge families. Gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. They spend together a special day, that special day of 1938, when Hitler came to Rome to visit Mussolini. I do not want to spoil the plot: go and see this movie!
