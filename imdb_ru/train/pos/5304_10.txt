Pecker is a funny, but at the same time funny film about a small town in Baltimore, the daily routine of which is broken by a young photographer Pecker, who shoots "real things." No beautiful models, no great men, just hard to live. This wonderful film makes fun of the plasticity of the urban art chain. There is one particular scene when a homeless woman shopping at Mom Peckerâ€™s charity store buys the same coat as one of the art lovers Whitney for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This suggests that no matter what money you have, you do not always have a taste. And again, John Waters sends you into an endless spiral of laughter and unbridled reality. You can have your own major Hollywood films with special effects and celebrity mountains, but you can give me Pecker or Hairspray (another great John Waters film) on top of Titanic or Godzilla any time !!
