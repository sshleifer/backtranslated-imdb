"I just wanted to see you laughing under the Purple Rain." This is a great movie. He should have been reevaluated to PG-13. But in any case, the first film of the prince and the greatest. Continued sucks. But I have not seen for many years, this is what I can remember about it. The kid (prince) must cope with the victory over the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), keeping his group together (the Revolution as themselves) and tension in his family. But his rival (The Time as as) destroys his life. As Morris (himself) tries to steal Apollonia from the Kid. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry, and if you like it, buy it.
