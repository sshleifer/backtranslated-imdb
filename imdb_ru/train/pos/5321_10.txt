This film really surprised me. At first I had doubts about this, but the film was getting better and better by the minute. <br /> <br /> This may not be for an audience looking for action, but for those who love a clear portrait of a very strange criminal, a man, a lover and a husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is really not for you. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes difficult to follow the storyline, but in the end I think that everything has become better. The ending was unexpected, since you were almost fooled, thinking it would end differently. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think it was good. It will not qualify for an Oscar for long, but it at least caught my attention. Gil Bellouz's portrait of a prison man is not always perfect, but very interesting. The portrait of Sean Parks inmate Silvon Clinics is magnificent and extremely strong. On the other hand, I think that I will put a portrait of Mark Esai Morales. <br /> <br /> Listen to my advice and watch this film, either you will like it or you will not like it!
