This film came and went to the cinema. Because of the nature of this, you can see why it was not well accepted. It was unfairly subjected to panning due to its subject matter more than the actual film itself. “Higher education” is not impressive, but it was a good film in which they tried to talk about the topic of fear in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Story / story: Higher education is mainly centered around Malik (played by Omar Epps), the Star of the naive track, which has to deal with insufficient speed, and the stern professor (played by Lawrence Fishburne). He is friends with Fudge (Ice Cube), as well as with a gorgeous lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they have to deal with some skinheads on campus. Remy (Michael Rapaport game) is a bewildered child who ends up making friends with some local skinheads on campus. As soon as they impose their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are. <br /> <br /> Opinion: higher education is not without flaws: character development is poor, good, speeches by Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the leader of skinheads (whose name I forgot), Basta Rhymes does not fit into this film at all. In addition, the women who became gay after the violence by the men were clichés before this film, so you know, I didn’t like this part of the film with Kristi Swanson. Other than that, this film was not half bad. Laurence Fishburn was good as Professor Phipps (although I could do without an accent), Fudge was the best representative of the Ice Cube, and Michael Rapaport was good, like a lost Remy. In general, it was one of John Singleton's best films, and this is one of the reasons why I frowned at the garbage that he is now releasing. Cinema needs more movies, such as Higher Learning, Missingippi Burning and American History X, as well as fewer movies, such as Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very meaningless remake. Shaft. "
