This film is actually relevant even today, given the threat of bioterrorism and the threat of super-bugs, the West Nile virus and SARS. As in the thriller, the voltage is quite strong. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than helpful in their roles. Inner scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a good interface to the main story. The actor in this film who left his mark the most is Jack Palance. Its clearly defined features and seemingly laid-back exterior always provide an opportunity to reveal a mean and cruel person under the surface. The chase scene through the packaging plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
