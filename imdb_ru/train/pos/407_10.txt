Oh my gosh ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This film sends you on an amazing trip and does not let go until the last blow on your face is over. This is a movie for Stormriders fans and the like. The legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I didn’t like some things, they used a lot of coasters. I wanted to see how a real person fights, but, oh well ... a few small disappointments, and I didn’t like it very much until I looked at it again, when you understand it more, it completely kicks A **! I urge everyone who ever wanted to watch a real Asian movie, watch this movie. I rate this film as one of my highest. Go and see him when he comes out in America !!!
