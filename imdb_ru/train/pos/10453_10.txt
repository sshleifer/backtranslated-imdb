Traveling by train in Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States of America, and Celine returns to Paris. <br /> <br /> “Till the Sunrise” is one of my favorite romances, truly one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. This is a low-budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julia Delpy is perfect, and the dialogues are stunning. The direction is amazing, conveying the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I just finished my review number 1000 in IMDb, and I chose “Before Sunrise” for this significant number, because this is a very special film for me. I can not understand why this film was not nominated for an Oscar with such a great script, directing and performances. Yesterday I probably watched this film for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Antes do Amanhecer” (“Before Dawn”)
