but just as interesting and random! Love it or hate it, but don't expect a sophisticated conspiracy or biting nail. Think of it as Seinfeld, but without repeating and repeating wacky characters (well ... for now; I have a feeling that I will develop favorites over the course of the season). <br /> <br /> “Comfort Being” is not for weak humor - it is meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort from your brain. That's why this show embodies everything I need in the program when I return home from work in the evening: a superficial conversation in the background with the right amount of “cute” characters for me, so that I can enjoy when I end up lifting my eyes from the computer to see what I’m missing. <br /> <br /> Funnier than in most of today's comedy shows, calmer than NASCAR tonight. Just The right mix of dead air and returns. I can't wait for the next one.
