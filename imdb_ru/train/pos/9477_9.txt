This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. <br /> <br /> In the end, they are talked about, but is there a chance for something to change in this situation? <br /> <br /> Originally filmed in Shanghai in 1948 and completely free of propaganda, the film introduces the Dai family. There is still weight in the story that surrounds the family. The story usually has weight in Chinese literature and serious films. <br /> <br /> A young couple - Liyang, a disabled person and his wife Yuwen live in a once great family complex, which is partially destroyed. <br /> <Bright contrast - younger sister Liyana, who cannot remember the past of the family, but perceives everything in a completely natural way. Her spirit is as bright as the other two. <br /> <br /> An unexpected visitor comes to this seemingly stable world ... <br /> <br /> As a result, I felt sad - but definitely an excellent film.
