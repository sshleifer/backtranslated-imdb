Great movie, enough laughter and action for any audience. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who posted this film decided to call Woody Allen incestuous and not comment on the film, here I am. /> <br /> The film is about the unlikely duet, Johansson and Allen, as they follow the advice given by the ghost of a recently deceased English reporter. Their search leads them to the killer's house, and ultimately to a somewhat tragic end. But don't let the plot fool you, the movie is really fun, and the acting is great. <br /> <br /> It seems that when directors reach a certain age, they really do everything right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to be doing one of the most creative works in their careers. In addition, watching the film in the Pact cinema, you can simply say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for his return. At that second, when he walked on the screen, the audience caught fire. There is something in this man, and he really shines in the Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check out, the trip is worth it.
