This film is so complex that you can give it to any description and still shoot with it. you have an uncertain, restless and charming main character (played by Jean-Pierre Leo), who is trapped between two (no, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral characteristics in endless monologues, we see how he creates his magic around the three women he loves. this may be a prerequisite for a film about a bird filled with harsh, cold, uninteresting comments. Yet director Jean Yustach manages to keep him fresh, ironic and witty. being such a long film, one cannot help but burst out laughing when, after 2 hours of polite speech, Jean-Pierre Leo suddenly shouts on the phone, recalling the stupid line from the film. Such situations are purely cinematic in nature and cannot be fully restored in the commentary. and no one can restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of Francoise Lebrun at the end of the film. 3 and a half hours and worth every minute.
