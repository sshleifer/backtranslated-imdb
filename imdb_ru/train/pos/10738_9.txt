SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC. French cinematographers who are in New York to film NYFDâ€™s actions are faced with this event and make the most of it. Until 9/11, nothing really happens, which gives the film an even more horrible script. On the day of the attacks, this looks like another boring day at work, but this will soon change. When one of the filmmakers sets off with firefighters, he takes down the first crashed plane, this is the only video of the first strike. He travels with firemen to the WTC and enters the building. When a second plane crashes, people realize that this is not an accident. In the next period of time, we see firefighters planning to save as many people as possible while we hear the sound of blows, the sounds of people who jumped off the tower and fell to the ground, this is the most exhausting moment in the documentary. Then the tower collapses, and our French friend must run for his life, you hear his breath like a madman when he runs out of the building. When a huge sandstorm hits over him and the screen goes black, he is very lucky to survive, and now he can shoot the empty streets in the center of New York. Since this documentary has so much historical material and since the movie was supposed to be something completely different, this documentary will probably remain in the memory of all. I saw the attacks live at home because I had noon, so this makes it even more realistic to watch. 10/10
