This fascinating tale of love, jealousy, and intergenerational revenge was even more enjoyable to watch on DVD years after the PBS broadcast, with a clearer picture and clearer sound. My only doubts are that there are some incredible moments in the story, and that some of the strong Manchester accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, even missing a word here and there will not spoil the fun: the main actors are ideally. Robson Green gives a mysterious smile, ruthless temperament and athletic physical form of his role as a young surgeon who hopelessly falls in love with his chief's wife in the hospital, where he just started working. Francesca Annis is one of the brightest 50-year-old women you can imagine; her game competes with her beauty. (The love scenes between these two show better than words how little the difference in age matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is clearly drawn and perfectly drawn. The combination of meaningful dialogue and passionate excess makes this a delightful mini-series. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you cannot be morally improved by watching "Reckless" - but you will get a lot of pleasure. (The sequel, which is part of a set of DVDs, is a wild, but at the same time satisfying two-hour junction. You donâ€™t want to skip it if you liked what it was before.)
