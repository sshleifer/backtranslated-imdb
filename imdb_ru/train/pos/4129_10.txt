This is a culinary show contest, Americanized. This will not be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I could care less about cooking, but this show is just fun to watch ... From the intensity that the chef puts in the dishes to the dumb chair. Really good way to spend time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show for guests such as Mark Ecko being judges ... But ... Fur. It is interesting enough to see, and, as a rule, the winner deserves a prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and I'm bitter John Besh is not a new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
