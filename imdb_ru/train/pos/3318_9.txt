Very nice movie with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park. Being a fan of baseball and frivolous cinema, for me it was a real excuse. Lots of laughter and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real ballgamers and real references to Bosox's past failures. And how pleasant was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme, not tolerating the excessive, self-serving, self-serving Kevin Costner trying to make believers from a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did an excellent job being a young loving couple suffering from Jones 'Jones' Jimmy Bosoks. It was a bit strange and outside of left field, but there really are Sox fans who are so fanatical and live their lives through the fate of their favorite team. The film went at a fast pace, and the final, although predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of many other popular films, without being too pretentious. <br /> <br /> Willy Garsonâ€™s return to the screen was also pleasant. I miss the ever-popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex & the City. He is always funny, even when he speaks or speaks very little. <br /> <br /> So buy yourself two drawers for the seats, popcorn and get ready for a pleasant pastime. "Fever" - the winner.
