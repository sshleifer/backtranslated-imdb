Of the three remakes of the novel by W. Somerset Mohen, this one is the best, and not especially because John Cromwell brought it to the film. The film is worth seeing because of a breakthrough in the play by Bette Davis, who, like Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry that she is a star. Finally, her fight with Jack Warner and his studio paid off like a king. <br /> <br /> Mildred dominates the film from the start. We understand from the very beginning that Mildred does not care about Philip and will never care. She does not hide her contempt for such a kind soul that fell in love with the wrong woman. He will be humiliated again by Mildred, and again, as she does not hide who she really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, besides being disabled, is a weak person. When he tries to cling to Mildred, she rejects him. It is when Mildred returns to him, when she is weak and defeated, that he approaches this occasion, overcoming his own dependence on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his masculinity. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives Mildred a fantastic image. It was one of her best roles, and she ran off with it. Her aversion to the good Philip is clear from the very beginning of their relationship. When she tells him that she washes her mouth after he kisses her, this is one of the most powerful moments in the film. Leslie Howard underestimates Philip and makes him seem even weaker than he is. Francis Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen starring. <br /> <br /> This is a Bette Davis show, and don't forget about it!
