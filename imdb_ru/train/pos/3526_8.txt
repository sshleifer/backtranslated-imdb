Phantom Lady (1944) Director: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after a nasty fight and parting with his wife, looks to drown his sadness at the local watering. There, he spies on a woman in a similar emotional state and, looking for some communication, asks her to perform at the club in order to divert their attention from their problems. She agrees, but only on the condition that they keep their names to themselves. Of course, when Scott returns home, he finds the police waiting there for questioning. His wife was murdered. Where were you at 8 pm, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) asks? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only he does not know the name of the woman. And the bartender remembers Scott, but not the woman. Just like a taxi driver. Neither the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) at the club. Even a dancer in a club that Scott apparently caught looking at a woman (they were both wearing the same hat) did not recognize that there was someone with him. Something happens, but whatever it is, Scott is helpless in defending at the trial and sentenced to death for the murder of his wife (according to the most fragile "evidence" in the history of the Hollywood trials). His faithful secretary, Kansas (Ella Raines), who was later joined by sympathetic inspector Burgess, will have to find out the real killer before the execution of Scott. <br /> <br /> The Ghost Lady is built on themes that are almost intrusive in the work of Woolrich. For example, a schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and Human Leopard. In addition, there is a character who becomes mentally unbalanced by the death of a lover or spouse, which can be found in Rendezvous in Black and Bride in Black. This can make the viewer feel as if he is treading on a well-worn ground. But in the right hands feverish plots, pathetic dialogue, inconsistencies in the narration - all this is irrelevant. Fortunately, the Phantom Lady was guided by strong hands. <br /> <br /> This is the first noir of Siodmak. He would continue to distinguish himself as one of, if not, outstanding practitioners of style (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he is randomly connected to the cinematographer Woody Brodell (they will be reunited at Christmas and "The Killers"). The camera made a great story. In one picture, the character’s mental state deteriorates when he sits in front of a three-sided mirror, suggesting several personalities. The same character, who is an artist, has a self-portrait of Van Gogh with a bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredl are really doing in The Phantom Lady actually creates the impression of a noir. Released very early in 1944, it's all here; wet sidewalk, bags of atmosphere and horror, sharply contrasting black and white images, wildly expressionistic versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott in prison), discordant rays of light, etc. This is an amazing picture. <br /> <br /> Franc Ton aside, the cast, as well as the subject and relative inexperience of the director (and, apparently, the budget), imply the ambition of the film “B”. I thought Ton was a little hammy. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not so much, and in some scenes he looks pretty weak. Ella Raines is mostly good (and pretty pretty). Her “sex scene” with Elisha Cook Jr. is so insane that you need to believe it. Another outstanding scene is when Kansas follows the bartender to interrogate him. This is similar to the chase scene, as she unerringly tracks him through the streets with a stop at the metro station. There is really good stress. <br /> <br /> *** of 4
