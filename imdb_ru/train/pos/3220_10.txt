The soldier may not have an academic acting or Lucas special effects, but he definitely does it for me. I will not tell you what it is about, I am sure that you have already read the summary. This is a great doomed movie about future action and science fiction movies. Kurt Russell does not speak much, he usually has a creepy or drone expression on his face, but it fits the character. There are great scenes of fighting and action; some scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood makes you believe that we should avoid our normal life. I have not seen Soldier 2, but this one is one of my favorites. I was lucky to have a wife who is digging films about guys; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who loves movies about cool guys and science fiction.
