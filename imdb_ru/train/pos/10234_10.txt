<br /> <br /> “Burning Paradise” is a combination of the actions of the neo-Shaw brothers and Ringo Lama's urban cynicism. When someone watches a movie, they may feel that the fight scenes are mediocre, but it doesn’t matter, only the attitude and the atmosphere are important. There are both in this great movie! Always trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam gives us the traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hun Shi-Kwan) and puts them in the setting of "The Raiders of the Lost Ark." However, these are not lighthearted comedian incarnations, which you can see in the movie Jet Li. Instead, these guys fight to the death with brutal results. What makes the film even better is that anyone can die at any time, and there are no obstacles. It is a pity that they do not make such films more often.
