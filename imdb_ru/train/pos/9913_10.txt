In addition to the fact that this is a very funny film, I can add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. This kind, fun-loving woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were keen to get her money. This woman was lonely after the death of her husband. He made her an offer in the theater, which was going to demolish. To prevent this, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid that she was throwing out "her" money, and decided to take action. The actors of the characters in this film were also a big plus. I would give almost everything to have a copy of this film in my video library, but so far it has not been released. Sad.
