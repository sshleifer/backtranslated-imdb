I have seen this movie on Comedy Central several times. This movie was pretty good. This is an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is going to marry King Okhtar, so that the US can get a military base there for a balance of power in the Middle East. A few good jokes, including Sunnygate. I also just liked the final theme. It gave me a big political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
