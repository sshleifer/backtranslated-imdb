From the mind of Robert Bloch, the famous "Psycho", in this anthological film Amicus appeared four stories about monstrous horror, which, although not as funny or scary as I would like, still provides some decent genre entertainment. <br /> <br /> This is due to the incredible skepticism of a detective from Scotland Yard (John Bennett), who is investigating the disappearance of an outstanding actor; He was informed that this incident is connected with several other houses in which they all took place, and our film is off and running. <br /> <br /> “The method of murder” has author Charles Hillier (always a delightful Denholm Elliott) pursuing his latest fictional creation, which seems to come to life. There are some good surrealistic and rather tense moments in this sequence, and it is crowned with a rather amusing revelation and a denouement. <br /> <br /> Waxworks plays the horror icon of Peter Cushing in the role of former stockbroker Philip Grayson, who along with old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) becomes an obsessive image of a beautiful woman found in a creepy wax museum. The most effective in this episode is the sequence of dreams, although as always it is great to watch Cushing. The final shots presented to us in this story are quite shocking. <br /> <br /> In Sweet Sweets there is another favorite horror star, Christopher Lee, in the role of John Reed, who does not belong to the charming puppeteer child. Jane (Chloe Franks) with too much kindness, and it's up to the new companion / tutor Anne Norton (Nairi Don Porter) to find out why. The mystery of this particular episode is solved perfectly; filmmakers wisely do not upset their hands, so this is a real shock when we get the full truth about this unhappy family. "Dying" moments are especially terrible. <br /> <br /> “The Cloak” is the most outspoken comedy of four; John Pertwee, one of the many actors who played the role of Dr. Who over the years, is very cheerful, like a vain, temperamental star of a horror film (in fact, he is the highlight of this story), who, furious about the lack of quality in his latest low-budget film , goes out and buys his own raincoat. Said cloak has strange abilities that I do not dare to disclose here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as a companion to Pertwees; One of the great examples of humor here is a skillful blow taken by none other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The final story ends in a predictable, but still effective way, as Detective Inspector Holloway learns that he should take all the warnings given to him more seriously. <br /> <br /> Emphasized by Michael Dress’s unusual, startling, and creepy notes, “The House That Dropped Blood” is an entertaining mixture of stories; although I do not get as much pleasure from this as, say, "Tales from the Crypt", it is still very fun. Able directed by Peter Duffelle, he slowly but surely moves to every horrific conclusion of his and is certainly a good movie of his type. <br /> <br /> 7/10
