It looks like this film is polarizing us. You either love it or hate it. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment (s), which says that you just have to "feel" it. <br /> <br /> In addition, at the beginning of the film Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend paints a picture of Monet, an impressionist artist. Monet's style is to paint in small strokes, so that a close picture looks like a mess, but from a distance you can tell what kind of object it is. Cruz mentions that the picture has a "vanilla sky." I think this is a clue for the movie fan. This film looks like a picture of the Impressionists. This is an impressionistic film! And not by chance the name of the film refers to this picture. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. It requires more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around, and no, you will not always be sure what is happening. But in the end everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You need to concentrate on this movie, but I think people make a mistake of concentrating too much on it. After it ends, when you have to think about it. If you try to understand how it unfolds, you will stun yourself. Just let it happen ... "go" with it ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the performances at the highest level and thought that they were incredibly unique, wildly creative and fascinating. <br /> <br /> But I will not criticize the intellect of those of you who did not like it. It appeals to a specific taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, suggestive, evocative, spiritual films, then watch them. If you prefer something lighter, skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you really like what I have described, then you will certainly like it.
