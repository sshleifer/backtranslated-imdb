This show is clever, colorful, dark, but fun, fashionable and yet somehow clean. The cast, including the awesome rotation of special guests (i.e. Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is electric. It has murder, romance, family and zombies, without any cartoon ... Somehow. You really communicate with these characters. The whole production is an incredible magical act that left me, something like a skeptic, if I say so, completely absorbed and returning for more every Wednesday night. I just reread it, and it sounds like someone paid me to write it. It really is so good. I had just heard a rumor that it was being canceled, so I thought that I would send a flash of goodwill. This is one of those performances that takes place under the radar, because network suits cannot figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a huge favor if you haven't done it yet, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. OK, so one more thing. This show is clever. This means that every creative critic / “writer” in Hollywood inserts a stick so that you know before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with a speech like “I could write it” to absolutely no one in their lonely renovated room in a Hollywood hotel . In other words: the Internet. This is a common interest / anonymous site. Before you give your TV hour on Wednesday for repeats of “Dirty Sex Money” or “Next Hot Model” or something else that these “critics” do not comment on the Internet, give to my favorite show. It's fun. Good, simple fun.
