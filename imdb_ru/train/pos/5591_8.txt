The alternative name “Ecstasy” is “Symphony of Love”; a title that properly describes the mood and feel of the movie. “Ecstasy” is an early talker, and could well have become a classic film if it were released in the era of silent cinema. This film is a visual delight, and it is intentionally made at a pace so that the viewer can enjoy his sensual lyrical quality, which is presented in an artistic style. The director's style is distinctly European. The subject and approach to sexuality were much more complex than what was produced in Hollywood at the time. Consider the US censorship code in the 1930s, which pretty much summarizes it. Hedy Lamarr, one of the greatest beauties of all time, was the perfect choice for this “Symphony of Love”.
