This film for television is brilliant. This is perhaps the best and favorite role of BAFTA winner John Tou (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). The widowed man Tom Oakley (the Thaw) lived in the same village for a while since his wife and son died, and now he has been landed with the evacuee named William Buck (Nick Robinson). When he recognizes this child, he begins to develop friendship. While William's mom (Annabel Apsion) does not want to return it. When Tom begins to worry about William not contacting him, he goes to London to find him. In the end, Willim gets his home with a loving family (or dad). Filmed during World War II, this is a great movie. He was nominated for a BAFTA Lew Grade Award and received the National Television Award for the most popular drama. John Taya was number 3 in 50 of the greatest television stars. Fine!
