Writing something genuine and truthful is a difficult task. Knowing how to shoot it and put it together without making it trivial is even better. The movie Ishay Setton is one of those in which you can learn about Life in all its simplicity and beauty. I was touched by the Great Bad Swimming, and now I will promote it as much as I can. It's just a shame that I can't show something to my friends (you know, for example, a DVD), because speaking is good ... but it's better to give something to see. No one can go to festivals to discover pearls, and this film is really worth it to put up! Many thanks to the staff of this masterpiece, and I am waiting for its spread.
