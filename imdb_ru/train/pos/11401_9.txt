An American in Paris was, in many ways, the ultimate mixture of art and a Hollywood musical. Created at the height of MGM’s power as a musical powerhouse, the film presents memorable music by Gershvinov, who is rightly called the equivalent of a 20th century Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also in his prime in this film, although it can rightly be argued that this film was just a warm-up to his best work in Singing in the Rain (1952). Two films are in fact closely connected. In addition to the connection with Arthur Fried, the Broadway melody in the film “Rain” owes its existence to an incredible role in American ballet in Paris in this film. Quite possibly, this was the only time the dance number was specifically mentioned in the opening credits of the film. And it deserves to demonstrate the skills of Gene Kelly as a dancer and choreographer to the maximum extent. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film is equally excellent. Leslie Caron, incredibly debuting in the movie, demonstrates maturity, which makes you think she has been in the movie for years. Her opening dance sequence, and then her work on the Ballet, provide some surprisingly sexy moments that could be compared with MGM Musicals only through the work of Sid Charisse in "Singin 'in the Rain" and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is funny, like Kelly's stoic buddy, who gets two of the best moments of the movie: during the final party (which I won't give for those who haven't seen the movie), and one of the most memorable musical numbers of the movie that combines his incredible skills playing the piano with ultramodern (at that time) special effects. <br /> <br /> Georges Gubenthal is less memorable as Kelly's romantic rival, although he gets a few musical moments, and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron's romantic rival. The May-December relationship between character Kelly and character Nina reminded me of the same “husband held” relationship that was seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neil during breakfast with Tiffany. <br /> <br /> There are several elements in the film that made it less satisfactory for me than Singin 'in the Rain. The ballet, although rich and well prepared, does not quite fit the rest of the film. Without giving away the plot, Ballet just happens, without a real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway melody, it has nothing to do with the plot, and in the best musicals the songs always make sense. <br /> <br /> The deterioration of the situation is the end of the film, which occurs immediately after the ballet. Although the finale should not have come as a surprise (after all, this is the MGM musical), I hoped that after the end of the ballet a little more of the film would appear. As if the director Vincente Minnelli felt that he could not follow the ballet with anything else. The film literally left me in trouble. <br /> <br /> In addition to this negativity, an American in Paris is rightfully ranked among the best musicals in Hollywood. He does not quite reach Singin 'in the Rain, but he approaches and remains evidence of Gene Kelly's mastery as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
