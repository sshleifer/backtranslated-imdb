Hit John Van Druten from Broadway is presented on screen with the maximum star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern witch who seduces a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart can get the highest score, but it is Kim Novak who stole the show as one of the most attractive witches who ever created a spell on the screen of the movie. In fact, leadership in the couple is one of the film’s few weaknesses: the gray-haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role, and although it’s easy to understand why he’s falling in love with Novak so much, it’s a little more difficult to understand what she finds attractive about him because they seem inappropriate in character and appearance. (One of the funny vanities of this story is that witches and sorcerers are portrayed as beatniks and bohemians of Greenwich Village.) It is curious that the Stewart Novak couple will cause much more heat in “Vertigo” released in the same year as this film, but then Vertigo was a fascinating story with unclear expectations, and the advantage of director Alfred Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> The comic moments of the film are mainly provided by the star actor, including the young Jack Lemmon (as Kim's warlock) Elsa Lanchester (their dizzying aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) As a stunned writer. Hermione Hingold even appears in a funny cameo as a kind of Great Witch. In this film, there is something to please - wit, romance and a great cast - that is, if you can look away from the charming Miss Novak. I've seen a movie half a dozen times, and I can never.
