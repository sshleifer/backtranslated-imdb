This film was released by Roger Corman, so you know that the directors did not have a lot of money to work with them. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may miss the subtleties in this film due to the very typical “obsessed” marketing approach of the “killer” type, this film has some unique differences. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, played by the obviously talented Justin Priestley, is a complex character. Some people like these films precisely because the violence may seem random, but here the consequences of past abuses (viewed realistically, but with taste) define AMANDA’s psychosis. Surprisingly, Amanda redeems herself at the end with an act of love, where most of these films turn into a typical death battle, and the evil character dies just like the evil at the end, from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> There are some irregularities in this picture, but I have to give it 7 out of 10 stars, considering its reasonableness and, yes, originality compared to the usual one - especially on a budget.
