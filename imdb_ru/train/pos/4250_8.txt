Todd Rohal is a mad genius. “Fist Jones”, his third and most fully realized short film, has an unusual sense of humor and will leave some scratches on his head. The essence of the film at heart, and he almost certainly does not agree with me about this, and that is how an ordinary Joe gains confidence to live a life with a little inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. Short circuits periodically make rounds on the festival trail, so watch your eyes and catch them if you can - you'll be glad you did. It's fun. And see Todd's other short films that appear here and there from time to time: “Single Spaced” and “Slug 660”.
