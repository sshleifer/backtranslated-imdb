Well, you take O.J. Simpson, as a completely American soldier, turned into an American bus driver, who decides to save his passengers on his own, only if no one else is going, and Arte Johnson plays an absolutely direct guide role, who does not know what to do, but doesn’t I don’t want to admit that they have problems and combine them with Lorenzo Lamas, since one of the three bad boys the children face is going to kidnap the heiress and leave a bunch of people on the bus to die at the dessert, and you need to vovat, plot twists and lots of drama. Everyone was good, but the vision of the Lama as the worst of the bad guys really struck me. He was too believable as a domineering bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress, but also to rape women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him. This was evident long before he raised his image of a good guy. And believe me, 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans that you really don't want to miss!
