I also saw it after its release in 1956, and since then I was struck by his last scene. If this is the answer to “Noon”, then this is a good and appropriate answer. The notion that, as this line says: “The city unites,” is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of “Half a Day.” In this topic, “Concho” is the phenomenal predecessor of one of my all-time favorites of the “Magnificent Seven”. Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing views, especially the transformation of Sinatra from the intimidating younger brother to the liberation of the city savior. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family members with whom I have for many years caused my affection for this film will be able to experience it for themselves.
