There are some great battle scenes in this movie. Now it’s true that the game is a bit rude. But if I wanted to watch a movie based on acting skills, I would watch a movie Cheesy Like American Beauty. But if you want to watch a movie with real martial arts and amazing stunts, WITHOUT the use of wires and flights, then flew into the air, like many other films that already kill the matrix. Then watch it. Now it’s true that the two main stars in the series, where Rangers are shown in childhood, and another cast of this series plays an important role in this film. But hey, fighting scenes are enough for Jet Li to find his pants. And tricks are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit, throw and admire.
