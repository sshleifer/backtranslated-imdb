I received this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I really expected it when it arrived. My worst fears were teasing and also ... well, do you know what all the screaming fans were talking about? GACKTnHYDE = how I love? Something like that? Scary is it. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly watchable, even if during the filming and music he had the feeling that someone was going to play a couple of nuns every two scenes, and the play on the part of Gackt was pretty good. Hyde, being Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic character of a friend / gang member who could hardly have surprised anyone who saw him on stage. He is one of my two main claims to the film itself. But the rest of the actors (including the child actors in the debut scene) were very good at what they did - in most cases they were fired at and screamed. But my second problem was very minor related to the disease. It seemed to me that it was too disturbing and terrible - as in any scene where someone is shot, they either fall, they are really sincerely dead, or lie there swaying for a long time. But Shaw just ... takes pictures, repeatedly, overturns, bubbles a lot while he speaks, and makes Hyde cry. In general, if you are a fan of any of the actors or just a fan of the j-movie, this is definitely worth a look.
