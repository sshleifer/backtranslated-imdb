I watched this movie in a very strange way - I included it on my Netflix list and could not remember why (except for this I knew that Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it). Since the film has no opening credits, I don’t even remember who shot it. <br /> <br /> When my wife and I watched it, I turned to her after about 45 minutes and said, “You know, I continue to want to decide that I hate this film, but something about this simply will not allow I stop watching him. "Then in the middle of the movie there are about half a dozen scenes that really care about the actors. <br /> <br /> Only after the end credits rolled out did I realize that this was Sydney Lumet. The film. And I thought - wow. I'm surprised that Lumet took what was really dirty, petty little story about really mean, breaking but this is evidence of his talent that I got so carried away when I didn’t even realize that it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really, really good in this film. How terribly good. Put it against Capote, and I would say that Oscar should be used instead of this film. <br /> <br /> I also highly recommend the narrative feature in which Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talk about making the film - this is interesting. and educational, with Hawk playing a student aspiring to learn at the feet of the master. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors - constantly kiss their asses !! <br /> <br /> There are many cruel melodramatic films that are empty numbers when all is said and done. And in this film there is an element of the fact that the actors fill the air with sulfuric explosions of emotions, and when the smoke clears, nothing remains. Nothing resonates at a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet gave us the “Network” and “Twelve Angry People” - films, each of which is in its own way elevated to the highest echelons of the cinema. <br /> <br /> This film is not on that level. But there is something that lingers. And perhaps this is enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment about comments - if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of comments, behind and con - is a pretty good indication that something is happening to this movie special.
