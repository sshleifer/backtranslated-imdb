This film, which begins with an interesting debut of two hot blondes in the back of a moving vehicle without a driver, has a rather bizarre personality. The composition of seven people (although one girl is not hanging around, which is regrettable because the death toll is already so small as it is), everything is very hot, since our story is centered around teenagers' parties in the desert (a strange but effective choice of ), followed by a spooky man in black gloves and jeans, who drives a black truck. This precedes many slips inspired by vehicles to the present (“Trip”, “Joy Trip”, “Jeepers Creepers”), where the killer vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. The killer himself is rather creepy, and we find solace in the extremely pretty heroine in Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all blacks, while our benevolent heroine wears all white clothes as scarce and paved as it can be) . Director Bill Crane does some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on the screen, and the actors try their best. There is enough blood in a low body to please fans of blood, and enough T & A from a couple of girls to please T & A fans. In general, this film is greatly underestimated and is widely used in the world of film slashers, since it is rarely seen on video. Highly recommended.
