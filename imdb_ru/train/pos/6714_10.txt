Why did I like the show before the last episode? Because of real talent, Melissa Joan Hart and her supporting cast demonstrated that spirit, comedy, lighthearted humor, and deep thoughts can really coexist. What I liked most was the fact that I could come home after a hard day’s work and smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to see how this magic man was so happy helping others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was, in my opinion, a hero ... even though she was not as vulnerable as we are ... she had strengths, desires and commands at her fingertip could be used for good or evil, which can exist only in many of our representations. Most of what we see, have, know about ourselves, or even desire ... can be used both good and bad, and how we decide to define it determines the person we are. <br /> <br /> She traveled around the world and other areas, bearing in mind these permanent and unshakable ideas ... to learn, to live, to laugh and to love. She always learned how to improve her skills for the benefit of everyone around her; She made mistakes when she lived life, going through different paths of growth, as she, her aunts and Salem (an underestimated, but imperfect hero) succeeded to demonstrate that even through mistakes you can still be noble, gifted remarkably. <br /> <br /> She also showed a lot of selfless, educative and loving actions as she walked her own way. If this is not a sufficient reason for 10 stars in this war-torn world, where people are so hostile to each other, not understanding how differences are a spice of life, and not a reason to kill ... then I don’t know what, This show is undoubtedly it was a trip to a better world, as well as an inspiration to become better, and a gift designed to part with a smile on our chops ... I heard from the doctor all that I mentioned above. leads to a healthy "heart" ... and isn't that what we all need? :)
