In fact, this is one of those films that you should give 7.5. The fact; as already mentioned, it is very fun. Wonderfully atmospheric. Asuky really looks like he is off the hook, but this is a great car for him, just like Mr. Porter is for Will Hay. If you like old dark movies and trains, then this is definitely for you. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, this is the film you want to see again and again. He is friendly and charming in a charming way with all the nostalgic references that made an excellent military fare. "Strange" groups of characters just play with each other, as in many other typical wartime British movies. It would be great to see this film if it were recorded in the studio Ealing. It is a pity that the original 1931 was not preserved
