Brilliant! My wife and I joined the sprawling line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people. She is a young girl, he is an exhausted westerner. The film embraced every bone in our body. There are no graphic scenes or anything that is difficult to watch - this is the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the stomach. The film is beautifully shot. Among other things, we liked the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Rudeness Tui Ngoyen (I can not believe that this is her first acting job) and the performance of Ron Livingstone stayed with me for a couple of days. Highly recommended.
