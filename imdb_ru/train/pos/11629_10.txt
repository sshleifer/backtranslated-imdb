Red Eye is an exciting film by the creator of Freddie Croiger Wes Craven. Wes Craven portrays the story of an ordinary hotel worker at Lisa. After attending her grandmother's funeral, she decides to go on a red-eye journey. While waiting, she meets this man named Jack Rippner, (how is it fffrreeaakkyy?), And they become friends. Oddly enough, both are sitting right next to each other on this plane. Then this is when the horror begins. This film is exciting and for the faint of heart people who don’t like exciting horror movies, well, let's say it’s possible that they can wet their pants. This is a great example of bone roll production. Wes Craven has done well with this film. He chose suitable actors, such as Rachel McAdams, a smart, sexy girl who knows what she is doing and is careful about everything when she is in the film. Killian Murphy, a terrible and terrifying actor who can cool your bones in his amazing game, being a bad character in this film, and his face can really widen your eyes. Wes Craven did a great job and I hope he makes more of these films.
