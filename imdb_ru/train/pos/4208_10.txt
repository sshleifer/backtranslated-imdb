From time to time this film is released, about which no one has ever heard, and it was shot in a very short time with very little money and resources, but everyone went crazy and turned out to be surprisingly great. It also happened in the 50s with a few small films that few have ever heard of. There are really some unknown wonderful little gems from the 50s that are worth digging out. Panic on the Streets is another film like this that comes to mind. Both films are not similar to the usual genre films of their time, and also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised how much I liked this movie. It was really a film that got better and better as it developed. As in all "old" films, it usually starts slowly, but as soon as you get into the plot, and its characters really enjoy this film. <br /> <br /> The film is really a great story with espionage, although the film does not start like that. It begins like this typical crime thriller with a touch of noir. But “Pickup on South Street” is not exactly a movie by numbers, so pretty soon it starts to act at its own discretion. This ensures that the film remains awesome, but above all, really refreshing to watch. <br /> <br /> I also really liked the characters in this movie. None of them are really good guys, and they are all their faults and weaknesses. Really humane. This is also a particularly great performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-deserved Oscar nomination. This is truly one of the greatest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even with a fairly obvious low budget, it’s just one great, original, special little film that deserves to be watched by others. ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
