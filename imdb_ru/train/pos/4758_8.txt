After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have fallen in a frozen forest, two policemen found evidence that the event really happened, and, apparently, one Martian had left the scene. They drive up to a nearby Hi-Way Caf√© and discover that the bus has stopped and seven passengers are awaiting the opening of a snow-covered bridge. However, the driver says that he had only six passengers when he parked the bus. During the interrogation of travelers in the diner, strange things happen with turning on and off the light and turning the player on and off. When the passengers are released, and the bus follows his journey, one passenger returns to the diner and reveals the plot of the invasion of Earth. <br /> <br /> - A real Martian, please stand up? is one of the best episodes of this great series. The intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogues, funny characters and situations, and an amazing and completely unexpected story at the very end. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "About Marciano" ("Martian")
