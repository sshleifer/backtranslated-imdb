Children between the ages of 7 and 14 got such a huge way out of this film that we gave a copy to all the other children on our birth list this year. They all liked it! Children from 2 to 7 years of age watch it repeatedly and often, and we enjoy watching it with them. <br /> <br /> Rarely does the film entertain children for so long and offer laughter for adults, too. Most like it more than the first. <br /> <br /> A high-quality production and an excellent cast, led by Christopher Schoerman as an excellent George - sporty, energetic and quite trustworthy, with attractive innocence and a special ability to take a tree in the face - is well supported by inimitable Christina Pickles as an evil mother-in-law Thomas Haden Cherk as an evil rival and everyone else. It's fun.
