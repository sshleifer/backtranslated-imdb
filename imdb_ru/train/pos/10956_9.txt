For those who think that this is purely humor and immaturity, you are really meaningless. Despite the fact that the show contains its share of little jokes, it also contains a lot of satirical materials and makes fun of social problems, racial barriers, cliches, stereotypes, etc. To get it, you just need a little more to read some of its materials. <br /> <br /> What I also like is that not everything is a highlight. For those who expect a formulated joke, such as Friends (I LOVE friends, for your information), you will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humor, which is more realistic. We do not walk in this world and witty highlights for all of the above, which is in most comedies. Instead, Sarah Silverman’s program makes it more realistic in that sense. <br /> <br /> So don’t take it as meaningless humor, because it’s so much more than that.
