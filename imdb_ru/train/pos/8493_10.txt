This is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I first saw this film when it came out. I just recently saw this movie again, and it still keeps my memory of him. Many of the films that we watched when we were younger do not seem to stand up when we watch them later in life. The film is in fact an excellent example of the 1980s, such as films made then. Keaton at his best, all the actors actually did a very good job, and Ron Howard was very good at allowing the plot to promote the movie, forcing it instead. The pace of the film is fast, with a few slower points, and watching the cars of the 80s is too funny. Having been since the 80s, I loved seeing the ugly pacemaker again. The film is an excellent film for all fans of comedy and the 80s.
