I was very surprised by this movie. I was touched by the lives that Paulie touched on his way to find his "Mary", the little girl from whom he was separated. Humor was also very good, and it didn't hurt the story, as I thought it would probably do. In fact, I expected that Paulie wants a cracker to hurt this film, but even this was done in a very humorous scene that becomes very touching when Paulie is at a press conference in a research lab. So, if you want to watch a good movie “an animal that speaks,” watch this movie much better than Dr. Dolittl, in my opinion. Paulie also has an unexpected turn at the end, which is also very well done.
