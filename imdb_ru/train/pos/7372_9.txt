“This is not a love song” - a brilliant example of the chase genre, which, according to many, is of fundamental importance. The love between the two main characters can be more than fraternal. I believe that Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see it. <br /> <br /> I really feel that this is portrayed in scenes such as the episode of the hit and the writing of the letter. Heaton shows great affinity for Spike. With an intense expression on his face and the way he diligently writes the name Spike at the top of his letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed when looking at external reviews was that when the movie was scheduled, the reviewer did not seem to fully understand the movie, as they did not even mention the possibility of Heaton to have sexual feelings for Spike . I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers did not recognize this when they use phrases such as: “Who is the Heaton? What does he do with a mentally retarded person like Spike? ”This man, however, may have hit the nail on the head with his remark. Spike shows noticeable signs of AD, although I don’t think this person understood this, as he seems to use the word “retard” as a derogatory term. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. Although it is not for the faint of heart. The film is based solely on the characters, after filming until the very end between the two antiheroes, almost nothing happens. If you are not used to watching such deep, sandy films, stay away.
