Director Otto Preminger reunites with his stars Laura Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready-to-rumble film Noir: Where the Pavement ends. This film is complemented by a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected twists, an intelligent dialogue and a pleasant look with great camera movements and dark and sandy noir lighting. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark Dixon, partly a gangster and partly a policeman who has the reputation of being too strong with criminals. After one incident sees Dixon looking for suspects and answers, he becomes much more involved than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is great in her role - tough and sharp, Andrews Dixon is ready to knock everyone and everything off their feet if they stand on his side. He is the perfect film noir antihero - he is not very good all the time, but we still cheer for him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in his role, being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. Perhaps the role of Tierney is not too large, but it certainly goes beyond what others can do with this role, knocking out all the spectators with their kind smile, gentle manner and flickering in the eyes. The supporting cast is also not so bad - Carl Malden is the most memorable, acting as Lieutenant Thomas and acting as a good assistant. "Where the sidewalk ends" is not Laura, but this is a great film noir, filled with wonderful characters, history and a picture.
