I do not know what the previous reviewer watched, but I think that this is reviews, personal taste. There was no depth in this film, a very deep film, a lot of emotions and affects. Undermines of hidden love due to subordination to social convictions, taboos of times and classes, racial relations that are not in a very good state of equality, guilt, longing, hatred, confusion, very dark emotionally, as I thought, to present this smooth film , not slow, as it was said earlier, to plunge into the flow of the film, emotions will appear, the characters will reveal their shortcomings, their unpleasant insides, excellent and in fact very cruel!
