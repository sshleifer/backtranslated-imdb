Any witness to our justice system - or lack thereof - will find this film truly satisfactory. There were not too many shades of gray in terms of characters or plot. Virtually every character in this film personifies the best and the worst in our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another had to deal with scum, as well as crazy, lively lilies bureaucrats with hand-to-hand fighting, which give them strength in the name of "political correctness." <br /> <br /> Speeches in all directions were convincing. I sympathized with the victim of rape - and at the same time I found out that she was pleased to see how she was wiping out smug, malicious arrogance from the faces of her former attackers. In particular, I found the lady one of the ugliest characters in all the films I saw, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth forever. The lead rapist and psychopath were equally ugly, so it was only fitting that Dirty Harry himself eventually offended him in a loud grotesque way. It was the only continuation of the dirty saga of Harry, equal to the first.
