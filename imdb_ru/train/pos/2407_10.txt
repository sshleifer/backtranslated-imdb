When I first saw this movie, I liked it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (believing in the Bible). I do not agree with the crowd of right-wing supporters. I dropped out of this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In their attempts to seize our government, they do what Judas tried to do. I call it Judas syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not understand this, although Jesus said that his kingdom was not of this world. <br /> <br /> This film definitely showed some of this. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that Jesus enjoyed playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> He was also a magnificent Jesus. <br /> <br /> This is a repeat movie. <br /> <br /> Very nice.
