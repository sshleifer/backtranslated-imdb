I value every shot of this beautiful film. We are talking about ordinary people, of whom we all know, who suffer a little in their lives and have luggage with them. Like all of us. Robert De Niro, Ed Harris and Katie Baker breathe life into their images and everyone is excellent, but Harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real. You could swear that he really is a trucker who drinks, so he will not have to feel anything. Baker, as his sister wore, also has several delicate moments - when De Niro gives her flowers in one scene, it seems that she has never been given flowers before and probably not. Very worth it.
