I enjoyed watching the short film “The Cure”, shot for the first time by director Ryan Japhri. What really impresses me is camera work and music. <br /> <br /> I think that many young cinematographers (since I myself am one of them) would have had a hard time with cinematography when they were just starting to make indie. We see that the result is not exactly what we imagined or below our ambitions. But this film, the young director’s directorial debut, looked very good on the screen. Camera movement, color, lighting, compositing - all this contributes to the plot and emotions of the film. <br /> <br /> And music, as a key element of the language of cinema, also helps a lot. <br /> It is difficult to portray a woman’s heart, her desire, her fear, especially in brief. But still, I have to admit that I am not a fan of w / o (narration), especially when the film is promoted by narration, and not by shots and cuts. My personal feeling for the narrative part is that I think the narrator tried too hard. Thus, the energy pushes the audience away from the emotions of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a small film, well done, I could see the contribution of the director. Way, Ryan! Greetings from China, looking forward to your next one. <br /> <br /> Tim
