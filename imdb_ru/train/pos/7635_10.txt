I have seen this movie many times, and I have to tell you, I enjoyed it every time. This is the film of the top of Belushi, in my opinion. Belushi and Lovits are so cute and recognizable with a simple person that you can not interfere when you start to look. In the film, a wonderful set of stars, some were already big, while others were just starting. It is declared as a good film, and this is exactly what it is. This film teaches you that life is not always so bad. Sometimes you just need to look at things from a different perspective in order to fully appreciate what you already have. When you finish watching, you will appreciate things that you have a lot more, and you will also smile. In my opinion, you can’t ask much more about a movie, not to mention that it’s a funny movie and you’ll never lose interest. A very, very underrated film guys. <br /> <br /> Rating from me: 10 I left !!!
