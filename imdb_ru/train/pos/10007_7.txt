NIGHT SERVICE (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Tony Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Callum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Directed by: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> The Hitchkian-suspension gives Williams an outstanding low-key game. <br /> <br /> What are celebrities and fans? What is paranoia in one person associated with another, and why is it almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the last scenario of a mad fan based on real events, however, Williams plays the role of a talk radio character named Gabriel Nobody who reads stories he wrote over the air and amassed an interesting fan in the form of a young a boy named Pete Logand (Calkin), who submitted a manuscript about the difficulties of his troubled youth to the editor of "Nobody" Ashe (Morton), who gives it to "No one to read" for himself. <br /> <br /> No one is naturally disturbed, but ultimately intrigued by the nightmarish existence of the abduction and sexual abuse of Pete for many years, until finally saved by a nurse named Donna (Collette, performing with excellent characteristics), which the boy accepted, but her correspondence with Nobody shows that Pete is dying of AIDS. Naturally, no one wants to meet with the fans, but suddenly doubts their, possibly insidious ulterior motives, when the seed is planted by his alienated lover Jess (Cannavale), who suddenly leaves his apartment in New York and has no one in an emotional spin. has only now turned into a storm in a glass of water, when he decides to investigate the history of Donna and Pete, discovering some truths that he did not expect. <br /> <br /> Author: Armistead Mopin (who co-wrote the script) with his former lover Terry Anderson and budding film director Stettner) and based on a real story about fans cheating, it turned out that some of Hitchcockâ€™s moments are in full swing like any good old fashioned cauldron. It is helped by the fact that Williams demonstrates an outstanding, restrained performance in the role of a conflicting kind-hearted person who sincerely wants to believe that his number one fan is actually real and loves him (the only thing that escaped his own reality) and has some alarming horrible moments with Creepy Collette, whose only physical trait I will not mention, but emphasize the desperation of her character, which can infuriate you. <br /> <br /> However, the film is exhausted and eventually it becomes a bit repetitive and predictable, despite the fact that Stettner accurately points to cunning and mysteriousness. It pays to listen to your inner voice: be careful what you hope for.
