King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain), who spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it's time to go back to England and become the father of his son. He believes that the parents of his wife took custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with a lot of money for a lawsuit. Alison Didi arrives (played by Elizabeth), whose father is in Africa and is being held by an African tribe to redeem a card that Elisabeth's father sent to her. Elizabeth is looking for Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There is a good set of supporting characters who go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth, and, of course, there are some enemies (Russians) who want a map as well. <br /> <br /> The film keeps your attention to the end. Patrick again plays a rudely handsome noble man who comes to the rescue of a girl in need. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, rude silent good man, anger and strength; In "The Minds of King Solomon," his character smiles several times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze again in a relaxed, lively story in which he does not need to clench his jaw and be so strong. Perhaps a little dancing will help. But this is a good movie for the whole family, and worth it to watch it.
