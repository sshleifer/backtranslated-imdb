Reviewed at the world premiere premiere on September 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> This had an interesting premise, but it seemed that it took too many eWaste frames too long (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc., sent to China in tons, and then sorted and converted in new products for later sale) and other devastation. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers tried to get more Interviews of people to increase the level of the human factor, but often they didnâ€™t allow it due to Chinese censorship. However, what was interesting there. Particularly striking were the pieces of a Shanghai real estate agent who cleaned and strolled around, displaying his luxurious mansion and gardens, touching the scenes of others living in medieval conditions. The first track shot on the 480-meter factory floor was also something special. The scenes of the Three Gorges project were also an addition to the Jia Khanjej films on TIFF (Still Life, Sansia Haoren and the Dong documentary), which were also built around this theme. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Penciere, filmmaker Peter Mettler and director Edward Burtynsky were on stage for Q & A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was recognized as the most key person who helped access locally in China.
