Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega - inappropriate couples who sit in the car and carry out assignments, depending on the needs of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is superbly human, communicates with everyone without exception, while Paz Vega is a nervous cashier behind the “10 items or less” cash line, intimidates customers and misses her. Together they explore, discover and learn from each other. For this, of course, they must be vulnerable, interested in change and have a sense of humor, and both have it all. I would like this film to be realistic, I would like this type of story to occur more often, I would like to not have to go to the cinema to understand that we can really communicate with each other even if we are completely different backgrounds. The message of the film is based on an open heart and makes you think about the possibility of another world in which we meet from there - a world in which the world could be possible.
