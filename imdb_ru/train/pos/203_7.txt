Neil Simon's “Sunny Boys” with Walter Mattau and George Burns in the lead role is a funny comedy about a strange connection with life and its shortness, but the laughter is always bitter to the taste. Seeing Willy Clarke (Mattaw) and Al Lewis (Burns) of two great theater comedians, now reduced to dementia from severe and unceasing old age, you can only feel anger and blue. Willy never gave up and continued to look for work, while Al was tired of the players and retired to the country to his daughter's house. The couple in his old days was truly funny and harmonious, but outside the scene there was an ongoing quarrel and quarrel, and for eleven years after their break they did not speak. Now, if they work, they have to come back together another time to make one of his best old sketches for the series. The meeting is explosive and free from old questions. The script of Neil Simon gives the plot a certain aggressiveness, and melancholy and blue, suppressing many addictions and laughter, made it possible to create a good mix, including thanks to the magnificent couple Walter Matt (Award for the Best Male Role) and George Burns (won the Oscar as the best supporting actor). These two actors are very plausible and real, and their harmony seems almost the same as they really work together all this time and the reality that they do not carry between them. The film is very touching and its all-consuming reality, as the plot narrates, and as the Love-Heat report, connecting two actors, is an absolutely real part of strange, but at the same time usually understandable things in life. My score is 7.
