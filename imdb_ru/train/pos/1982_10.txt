It was my favorite movie when I was a kid, and I participated in the production several times, so it will always remain my favorite musical, and I doubt that anyone will ever be able to reproduce the story of Oliver Twist on the screen, even better than this one did. <br /> <br /> My most beloved “bad guy” should be Oliver Reed in the role of Bill Sykes. He not only scared my life when I watched her when I was 6 years old, but now, as a woman, I can sympathize with the character of Nancy, a bartender / prostitute who helps Oliver to get the life he deserves. <Br /> <br /> Jack Wilde, as a cunning draft deviator, was fantastic, and I don’t think anyone would ever be able to beat him, as street pockets collector and Feigin’s best friend. The music is fantastic, especially the Feigin numbers, I am also very grateful that they did not give Bill Sykes a musical number, it would not have worked if he were such an ominous character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reid did a great job on the sticky end of Nancy, retaining a movie with a G rating, disguising her beating, but giving back enough to show Bill’s violence against her. <br /> <br /> This film is charming and charismatic, like musical singing, as well as the exciting drama that accompanies a young boy who is trying to find his place in life.
