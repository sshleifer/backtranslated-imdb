Revenge is the theme of this thriller of Denzel Washington, which offers its share, chaos, murder and terrible bloodshed. The main elements are the search and destruction of the mission of the bodyguard, since his ward, young Dakota Fanning, was abducted from school, and this was Washington hired to prevent. Places in Mexico City are as chaotic as the storyline moves to its predictable violent conclusion, with plot twists along the way. Washington, a former CIA officer with a drinking problem, gets a good link from a former co-agent who drives the plot plan. Washington and Fanning had excellent chemistry, and after an unpleasant start, the bodyguard and his partner became best friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke make up a good cast for two stars.
