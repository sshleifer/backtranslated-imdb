First, this is a great series, although we have a kind of James Bond effect. I mean, while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, this is chronologically the first adventure of the year 007, Doctor No. (1962) is the second, and in The Golden Eye, the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench is mentioned as new replacement for the man "M", since she could be at the beginning, until Bond became a double 0, except for the fact that she, obviously, is 14 years older? This is more or less a “poetic” license for thrills. We need a little distraction if we want to be entertained. No, the new Star Trek movie does not have the primitive electronics of the original series almost half a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were a fantasy. (now we call them mobile phones), and instead of buttons there were sliding levers. OMG, do you think that in 400 years they would improve Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So, please, let's give the producers some leeway. <br /> <br /> But so that everything is consistent, let's just think about creating Cylons just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If so, where did all the Cylons who inhabited the original land come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous jumps in space. Well, what happened if one of the Cyclone ships that fought with the Caprica fleet was shot at, or there was a sunspot or something else, and one ship loaded with a Cylon-looking man turned out not only to jump through space, but also back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One. They colonized it, found out that they could inhabit it, and ultimately destroyed themselves, but not before they sent the fleeing "motley" in search of the legendary Caprica, only to find an inhabited but deserted planet, which they colonized to become people who eventually invented the Cylons. The time paradox? Of course. What was the first: chicken or the road? What's the difference? It is very interesting!
