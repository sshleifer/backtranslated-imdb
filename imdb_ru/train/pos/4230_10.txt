For fans of Colombo like me, this is an episode of episodes that explains why Colombo was so popular, and how good it really is. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as always), in which plays the witty intellectual crime novelist Abigail Mitchell. It seems Abigail calls his nephew to sign documents that make him his heir. She never survived the death of her niece and is convinced that the husband of her dead niece (Charles Frank) did a dirty business. To tell more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley the tricky role of Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Colombo is in a class by itself. This is a really good TV movie. I recommend it very highly.
