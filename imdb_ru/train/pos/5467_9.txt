In my opinion, this should be one of the best performances of Barbara Stenvik. She was one of the few actors who then and now could say more with one look than with a whole page of dialogue. And I was lucky to see the original and uncensored film with an additional 4 minutes of additional footage. It is a pity that the film is so short. Lily is a young woman holding it together with difficulty and working for her father in his illegal conversation. The only connection with her is her good friend Chico, whom Teresa Harris has played beautifully. Although Chico is an African American (and with a white woman to be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was controversial, because the subject of this film), and Lily is not that they have a special connection. And this is not sexy. Only 2 women were stuck or were embroiled in a situation beyond their control. After the death of her father Lily, and she does not know what she will do, she is told that she can go out and get what she wants. Yes, it is immoral, but this is the whole point of this film. Then "they" had to go and spoil the last few minutes. So, right down to the last few minutes of the movie, this is an excellent movie, and itâ€™s worth seeing. The "lesson" of the film is still as relevant as it was then, and I am sure that in 100 years. Women, it's terrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, pay attention.
