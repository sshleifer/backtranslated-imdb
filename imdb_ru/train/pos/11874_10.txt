Perhaps the best role of al pacino. He plays Tony Montana, a small hood from Cuba, turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with only two things that he has in this world, his eggs and his word, and he does not break for whom. He starts working as a large Cuban dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly climbs up the organization with his long-time friend Manny (Steven Bower). Soon, he looks after the sexy wife of the boss Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees the threat from Tony in his position, he tries to kill Tony, but without success. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great cast, among them F. Murray Abraham as the jumping gangster, another familiar face - Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to knock Tony off and marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as his younger sister Tony. Credits for script Excelent Oliver Stone. This film is one of the brightest moments of Brian Depalma in his long career of ups and downs, you can see that this guy is very talented. The film has a great look at it. Also notice two memorable scenes: one in a trendy restaurant (“Say good night to the bad guy”). the other is the last shooting, where Tony reveals that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 killers who invaded his home. This is definitely one of the most impressive movie endings I've ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime films, this is a must-see. For all others, this is highly recommended. 10/10
