An underestimated addition to Graeme Green's cinematic canon â€” his supposed shortcomings can now be viewed as virtues. The director Shumlin, the theater director, gives his action a brutal rigidity, corresponding to the material, and seemingly inept compositions convincingly show awkwardness. Both the dark thriller and the story of moral rebirth (for a female character! In the thriller of the 40s!) There is an honest hero in the film who becomes crazy and murderous (and possibly pedophilic) brilliantly contributes to shaking a dangerous reality, has one terrible murder, an amazing insight into class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approach to Green's God and an end that will only be happy if you know nothing about history.
