Clint Eastwood has definitely released better films than this one, but this one doesn’t bother him. Dirty Harry attracts everyone's attention, and if someone doesn't want to watch a romantic relationship, there is no reason why you won't like him. He is cool because he is dirty, magnificent, because he kills without thinking, he is perfect, because he gets shot in the heart and the hero, because he doesn’t care. <br /> <br /> From what I have In the films in which Eastwood is filmed, the character of the leading role always captivates the audience. In “White Hunter” - “Black Heart” - he is a crazy director, in “In the line of fire” he is “Old” and “almost”, but “almost” unemployed with his work, that is, he does work for himself, no one worried about his superiors, which almost sends him on vacation. <br /> <br /> This film, designed for the victim of rape, is promising for all viewers of the film “without unnecessary meanings”. The film is nothing that could get away from the central plot. However, what makes it a little worse than Eastwood's best films is that although the character of the lead role captivates with the plot, it’s not like it’s too obvious from the very beginning. This is not a movie that will make you sit still. In addition, too many people are much dirtier than Dirty Harry.
