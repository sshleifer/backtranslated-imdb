- LITTLE SPOILER HERE! - <br /> <br /> When I looked at Creep today, I was surprised that many IMDb users rated this movie as “1”. I wonder: what do people expect from such a film? Do so many people watch a movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> Creep is a horror movie and it's pretty good! This automatically means: he has an absurd story full of holes, outrageous dangers and simple one-sided characters. So why complain about it? Just take the popcorn and the cola, settle down comfortably, and then ... ... enjoy the fear to death! The first 60 minutes, when there is almost nothing but Kate and the lone metro station, are incredibly frightening. In every corner of the screen there is anxiety and anxiety, and you will be twitching only because of the sudden sound of a neon lamp behind you. (In my opinion, the sound engineer did a better job in this film.) <br /> <br /> When Kate meets her pursuer, the quality of the film falls, but it still does not become bad. The second part of the film is not terrible at all, but the effects of blood are well made, and the story is rather well developed. (... if you remember that this is a horror movie that you watch, not a Discovery channel!) So, if you want to make yourself a very, very scary hour. Just watch the first hour of Creep, and then exit the cinema or turn on the TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, right? The bad guy will die, and Kate will remain the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie to the end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to raise anxiety to a new level, do what I did after watching this movie: on a dark night, exit the cinema, go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
