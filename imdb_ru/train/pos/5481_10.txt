For me it was rather a wake-up call, and the realization that the majority of everything we see, hear, read and think about something depends on what we are fed in the media. This is a classic example of highly professional doctors trying to control the masses with the help of controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people who have a constitution on which they were freely bought will not be influenced by the media or any attempts to enter incorrect information. This again shows that in the end the needs of many will actually outweigh the needs of a few. It is also striking that in a country where there is no religious civil war, democracy is not that difficult to implement.
