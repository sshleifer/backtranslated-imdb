I always liked Johnny Concho, and I would like this movie to be released on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Frank in the lead role in the film, he is the brother of the infamous shooter, who is not currently in town. Brother strikes terror in the heart of the city, and Frank takes full advantage of this to intimidate the citizens in safety in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has feelings for him. She is the daughter of store owner Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other armed men arrive, William Conrad and Christopher Dark, and it turns out that Conrad killed Sinatra's brother, and he comes to his city to seize power. They humiliate Sinatra and expel him from the city. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> Night Sinatra turns from punk into a coward and becomes a person looking for some kind of spine. This is a well-played play, almost as good as his nomination for the role of Oscar in the film “The Man with the Golden Hand”. It is a pity, for some reason it was not visible for years. <br /> <br /> Two other notable speeches are Keenan Wynn, a former shooter preacher who has become a preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to face Conrad and Dark. And then there is Conrad in that I consider his role as a career on the screen. He is the villain of incredible evilness, the embodiment of pure evil, walking and talking on a silver screen. <br /> <br /> However, I like the climax in Johnny Concho, an unforgettable experience with Conrad and Darkness. Let's just say, I believe that Johnny Concho was MGM's answer to High Noon and a textbook of what you do when evil leads to the destruction of all laws and orders.
