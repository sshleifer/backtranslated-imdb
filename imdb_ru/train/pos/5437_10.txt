Pandro S. Berman was "in charge of production," but this made him a so-called line producer. But who produced this epic was filmed not in Arizona, but in the California Mojave Desert, where scavengers fled with all the remnants of the “golden temple”, Bandits' huts, the British outpost in Muri, the village of Tantrapur, and so on. What is unforgivable is the absence of an Oscar for better music, although perhaps the Academy did not offer this at the time. A separate theme sounded at different tempos, including a waltz, a march, and a sweet mood. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the demands of the widow Kipling. The actor playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In the first edition of his scene were cut, in accordance with the requirements of Mrs. Kipling. Later they were included and provided a "connection" of Kipling's immortal poem with the script of Ben Hecht. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story was written by a great screenwriter who himself hated the British.
