I had a personal interest in this film. When I was 17 and I just finished school, I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Union of Workers and Carriers Hod. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was told that the next morning I would bring a suitcase with enough clothes, etc. For one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning, the bus was already waiting, and about 20 of us headed south towards San Diego. Below, we stopped at a military base called Camp Callan or Camp Khan. Once we were in bed, we headed north after a few miles to Camp Pendleton, a large naval base. There, on the beach, we began to build what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific base. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, tools for the guns, trenches in sandbags and living quarters. All this was for a very high wage, sometimes “golden time”, which was three times higher than our hourly wage. Our food was also first-class = the main rib at dinner, etc. — which was surprising because it was wartime and it was very difficult to get good meat at home. <br /> <br /> When the work was finished, I was looking forward to the film to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I looked forward to two hours of the film, before my work finally appeared on the screen. Then, no more than three or four minutes (or maybe less) passed when the characters of the film dive, bombarding the base and blowing it up to smithereens. A little disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I liked the film, and since then I have not seen it. I later learned that the film was signed by the government, and Fox was paid on a cost-plus basis, which may explain our extravagant pay and lifestyle there. Bob veverka
