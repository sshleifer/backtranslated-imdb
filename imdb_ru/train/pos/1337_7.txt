......... and you get chori chori chupka chupka. Don't get me wrong, this film is much less explicit (or even not so) than “Pretty Woman”, but it was (was) a new topic for Bollywood. The topic was accepted, but it is far from Jism, Murder and Julie. In truth, the topic is presented very cleanly. But the plot has a number of clichés. The beginning of the film is very cinematic. There are very small holes in the plot. The film begins after Rani has a miscarriage, when you feel like you are watching something different from a regular movie. Otherwise, the entire family sequence was initially overdone. The game could not be better. Salman Khan is sometimes impressive and sometimes fails. Here he gave one of the best performances. In addition, his role is written so well that you applaud every time he solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the film, you most feel her character, but she is overshadowed by Priti Zinta. Priti Zinta - the perfect picture. Of all three, she wins all for her money. It's amazing how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far from your neighbor. This role is one of the reasons why I rate it highly. Auxiliary actors are like the family that you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning for the plot, but I found them tolerant here. The songs are very good. The title track is my favorite of all along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (World View) are two songs that are perfect for the film. Prity’s cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could be cut, while Punjabi number 1 seemed boring, although it had good dances. Otherwise, the film is definitely worth seeing.
