The Best Modesty Film Blaise, which I have seen so far. This is like a good pilot for the show. I even think it is a bit of a “cult”, like with the faint touch of Quentin Tarantino’s magic, or something like that. They caught most of Modesti's character, but I admit that I miss Willie Garvin a bit. Even if I read a lot of comic books and Peter O'Donnell’s books, I’m not disappointed with this film, quite the opposite. Positive surprised by this story about modesty and her childhood. Because of the bad film of 1966, I didn’t give too much credit to my expectations. So, perhaps, I slightly overestimated this film. But if you like comics and other Modesty Blaise stories, you should definitely see it! I can not wait to continue ...
