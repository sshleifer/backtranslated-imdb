I remembered one time when I was a kid, when I watched this movie in the wonderful world of Disney. This film has been in my memory for over 30 years, and I have been looking for it. I would have to say that of all the children's films that I saw at that time, this film showed more than everything, and, seeing it only once, I really hoped that I would see it again. The history and images of this film were recorded in my memory. Until today, I never saw him after that day, in the 70s, in fact, I never remembered the name until I searched it on the Internet today. I loved it and want my children to see it. Anyone know where I can find this?
