Arthur is a rich middle aged child who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says what comes into his head. He loves to show off his wealth and knows that he is a spoiled child. He spends money on people he does not know, and he finds everything ridiculous. Arthur has to marry a high-class girl to inherit a large fortune, but he falls in love with poor waitress Lisa Minnelli (she looks very strange). <br /> <br /> This is a damn funny movie. I watched this film because the very famous Indian film “Sharabi” is based on the character of Arthur. Although “Sharabi” is definitely inspired by “Arthur”, I think these are two different films. "Arthur" is just fun. This is very trite at times. There are so many fantastic liners in the movie. This is not a violent laugh, but there are fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his groom's father and continues to talk about "moose." Duddle Moore probably has funny moments. He is very good with words and body language. I liked the scene where he was telling a sitting couple standing in a hotel about a “small” country, and he continues to talk with husband and wife in two different directions. John Gilgud got an Oscar for this film. I do not know this actor. I don’t think he did a great job, but maybe if I look more at his work, I can agree in the future. The film has flat areas, but not very long. looking forward to see the sequel.
