This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. He has a very good game of Hanks, Newman and all the rest. Definitely the best performance by Jude Law. The cinematography is excellent, the editing is about as good, and includes a great original score that really fits the mood of the movie. Production design is also a factor that makes this film special. I need a lot to defeat the Godfather, but the fantastic cinematic picture wins in this competition. Definitely a nominee for the best photo in my book.
