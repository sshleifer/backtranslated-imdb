Dude, I really love the new DVD that Universal released. I have never seen THE SENTINEL look so good, because over the years I have had to endure shoddy, grainy VHS tapes. Unfortunately, there is nothing superfluous behind the trailer that looks pretty bad for wear. AND AVOID Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It sucks. <br /> <br /> In any case, problem model Alison Parker (Christina Raines) moves into an unwary house from New York, only more than just ghosts. It is also a portal to hell, and the Vatican keeps an old blind priest (John Carradine) to keep an eye on him and to ensure that the devils and archangels do not run away. <br /> <br /> This film involves all the stars performed by long-time actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc., as well as cameos of future stars of the 80s, including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (whose voice was mysteriously superimposed) and Tom Berenger. And you donâ€™t even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to make a double take, when I did not quite understand where I had seen it before. <br /> <br /> Sweet scenes from Alison's blood cutting off her eyes and nose from the rotting corpse of her dead father, who was possessed by the devil. And there is a neat end, where disfigured, deformed people try to pursue Alison to commit suicide, so she will not be the next one to guard the portal. Looks like Alison's hectic past makes her the Vatican a prime candidate for the next guardian. <br /> <br /> Excellent, terrible classic 70s from the director Michael Winner, which can not be missed. I also recommended this for those who want something more creative than the usual stupid slasher and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> -
