1939 is universally recognized as the greatest year in Hollywood history, when more classic films were produced than in any other, and John Ford shot three of the best of them, Stagecoach, Drums Along Iroquois, and this is a great respect for border days. and a young wilderness lawyer who was ultimately destined to save the Union, "Young Mr. Lincoln." <br /> <br /> Due to the fact that the world plunged into the war that America was afraid of, but knew that it would be dragged in, Abraham Lincoln wanted very much in 1939 people were people who faced the same dilemma in their life and won. On Broadway, the award-winning Robert E. Sherwood, who won the many awards “Abe Lincoln in Illinois,” depicting Raymond Massey physically dead, played in crowded houses (this will be filmed in 1940). Carl Sandburg's continuation of his epic biography “Abraham Lincoln: Years of War” was published and quickly became a bestseller. President Roosevelt often mentioned Lincoln in his speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, became the most popular attraction in the city (a fact that Frank Capra used in “Mr. Smith Going to Washington”). /> <br /> All this was not lost to Darryl F. Zanuka, at 20th Century Fox; As soon as he read the screenplay of Lamar Trottie about Lincoln’s early years as a lawyer, he called it a “prestigious” film and appointed John Ford as the director, and Henry Fonda the star. <br /> <br /> The Foundation did not want to play Lincoln; he felt that he could not pay tribute to the "Great Emansipator", and was afraid that bad work would hurt his career. Even taken a makeup test, in which he was stunned by how similar to Lincoln, he did not change his mind. According to the Foundation, John Ford, with whom he had never worked, royally cursed him at their first meeting and explained that he portrays not the Lincoln Legends, but the young lawyer from the country, “Jackanape,” who appears before his first trial. murder case. Humiliated, Fonda assumed the role. (John Ford proposed a different scenario of events, but the result was the same!) Obviously, they found chemistry that worked together, since almost all of their couples gave "classics." <br /> <br /> Unlike Fascinated, exhausted by the melancholy of Lincoln from Abe Lincoln in Illinois, Ford saw the vision of a shy but pleasant young lawyer who easily made friends and missed his mother, who was too young (that led to a connection with the pioneer mother (this becomes an important part of the story). He is insulted by injustice, and he says "common sense" to suppress the violence intertwined with doses of humor. Both productions play on Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; in the Ford version, the couple is really in love and devoted to each other. After her death, Lincoln often visited her grave to share his life with her "spirit" (the theme that Ford continued in "She wore a yellow ribbon"). <br /> <br /> The murder trial is central to the film, and shows the amazing talents of the star and the director. Fonda cleverly portrays Lincoln's inexperience, but sincere faith in justice, softened by compassion, and Ford emphasizes the gulf between the “intellectuals” of the big city (represented by pompous DA Donald Mick and his clever “adviser” Stephen Douglas, played by young Milburn Stone) and Lincoln’s informal, country-bending feeling. With the “ordinary” Ford Ward Bond as the key witness, the process will be both unconventional and exciting. <br /> <br /> With the closure of the film, when Lincoln goes into turbulent distance, and his fate (dissolves in the form of a statue at the Lincoln Memorial), viewers could calm down in the film’s message that, if the reason is fair, good ultimately win. <br /> <br /> “Young Mr. Lincoln” is a truly wonderful film, an amazing year!
