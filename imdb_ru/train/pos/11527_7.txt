Miriam Hopkins - “The Lady with the Red Hair” in this 1940 biopic of Mrs. Leslie Carter, which also starred Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, as well as an excellent group of supporting players, including Lora Hope Cruz and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Raines give great performances. Hopkins was a great actress who really makes us feel Mrs. Carter. The rain is magnificent as a bright, selfish producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the greatest names in the theater. <br /> <br /> Although Mrs. Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, served as an advisor in this film, this is a bad idea of ​​the real life events of Mrs. Carter. True, there was a widely publicized and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly regarded as a scandalous character for this and for becoming an actress. However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no custody. After she broke up with Belasco, she did not return to him and, in fact, began working in vaudeville and actually made several films by the end of her life. She really married Lou, and he became her lead man in many productions. <br /> <br /> The driving force for Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this film is the return of custody of her son, but she finally realizes that in her time away from him, he is completely connected with her father. Also in the film (and I'm not sure if this is true in real life), she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house, which gives the film an additional interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad film, probably not an image of the greatness of Carter or Belasco. One of the most famous moments of Mrs. Carter was in the Heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot curls. Behind the scenes, fans blew her hair when she hung 35 feet above the stage, clutching the center of the bell so that it would not ring. Totally visually.
