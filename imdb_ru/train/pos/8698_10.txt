Saw this movie about his release and appreciated it since. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find casting one of the most interesting aspects of the film). I liked to see dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role, and Wallace Shawn is always a scream. The script is clever, cunning and mocking, making fun of almost all Beverly Hills. He loved the “doctor” Paul Barthel and the servant Ray Sharkey. It was rude and rude, but thank God! If you're not a prude, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. For your information, for those who like to play six degrees, Kevin Bacon, Mary Ravens and Paul Barthel were at Rock & Roll High School, Mary Voronova and Robert Beltran were together at Comet's Night. They were all in Raul's Food.
