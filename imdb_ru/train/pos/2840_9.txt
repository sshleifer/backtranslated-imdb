I just watched the press of this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Not often do I see all of my favorite actors in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the pockets scene, and it was nice to see Rachel Bilson and Hayden together. I think that their chemistry on the camera is a direct result of their sharing behind the scenes. My favorite scene was (surprisingly) a part of Bret Ratner ... Without giving away too much, I just say that there is a surprise that makes you hang ... <br /> <br /> The old couple was really good together, you really got the impression that they spent their whole lives together. <br /> <br /> The “Chris Cooper” and “Ethan Hawk” segments were full of surprises that seem realistic and similar to the events I experienced in a large apple. In general, the film is a great place to date ... especially if you already love the city itself. <br /> <br /> I can’t wait for the next one in Cities of Love.
