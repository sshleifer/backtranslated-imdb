Let's think that people stopped swearing at the original, because this time the original Battlestar series was a masterpiece, even with all the stars, storylines and art. Lorne Green was great in the role of Adama, and Richard Hatch in the role of Apollo, and Dirk Benedict was funny in the role of Starbuck, but, I dare say, not as good as Kathy, as Starback. <br /> <br /> I liked the episode with Pegasus, and “Hello from Earth” is good. John Kalikos was great as Baltar, “War of the Gods”, the best was “Experiment on Terra”, I thought it was a tribute to Heaven can wait, then you had Battlestar women, not to compare them, say, with Trisha which is incredibly beautiful, like number six, but the beauty of Jane Seymour could not be compared to. Not to mention Lohert Spange, since Cassiopeia was fantastic. She had a beauty that the rainbow would be confused. I loved the original as much as the new one. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine that John Calicos was number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for your attention.
