Hello, this small film is especially interesting for an artist, director, musical creator or visual artist, because: <br /> <br /> you can feel and explore Davidâ€™s touch / style directly from a short piece of relative simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic interval between frames, pan and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even as a simple film, this creation is multi-layered. For example, there are some sounds that are buzzing all the time, while others appear (albeit subtly) at certain times to support certain shots. <br /> <br /> You can also see several types of panning: some rise and fall in a gentle reverse direction. There is a diagonal saucepan. The zoom also sometimes moves back and forth. <br /> <br /> Lightning and composition / arrangement of elements in space is, as usual and obvious, the work of the artist / artist. This can be felt even in this crappy room. This means: you can create exquisite art already with the help of simple art of placing appearance and creating a scene. Then come the forsellins of visual elements: digons, parallels, etc. The reduction in the quality of light and color, although without special studies of textures, as in large productions, will also work. This is a kind of a sketch of the artist ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated, but done with an inner feeling, and this feeling gives sensitivity to David, like any real artist.
