This is a sublime work of filmmaking. It only flows at the right pace throughout. Accompanying music is perfect and very pleasant to the ear. Humorous roles are funny and made even more due to the much dismally tragic nature of the film. <br /> <br /> However, despite the large number of comments about the innate tragedy of the storyline, it was not depressing to look at me. I thoroughly enjoyed this way, which I had not experienced for a long time. That is, it is excellent and yet without all the common attributes of modern films, such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> “Danu in real life” lacks anything to be without ordinary vices. It has a fully mature conspiracy that simply does not require, and would indeed be destroyed, by any further adornment. At the same time, the topic is completely adult. In itself, it is a work of art that completely surrounds you, and you do not want anything more than it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that seem a bit Waltonic, but in fact they make sense in the long run, as they contrast with more dysfunctional moments. Rozier gives way to the tragic, which then gives way to the idyllic, which turns into dark, etc. This undulating landscape of emotional cinema creates the perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. The peaks and valleys are soft, but more than sufficient in the pleasure they graft. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie no matter what genre you usually like. Leave aside any prejudice, because it needs to be seen!
