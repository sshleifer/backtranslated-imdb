“The Mouse in the House” is a very classic cartoon by Tom and Jerry, true to his traditions, but with his own jokes. It is hysterical, fun, very interesting and quite funny. The illustrations are also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short story is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house, and he also tries to catch a mouse, because "there will be only one cat in this house in the morning - and this cat catches the mouse." <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are a lot of funny jokes in this cartoon. The most ridiculous thing for me, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees two sleeping lazy cats and sarcastically says: “I am glad that you are enjoying a siesta”, and hopes that they are happy because she is not two cats choking. Another funny gag is when Tom disguises as Mommy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan, and then Butch does the same trick with Tom. Of course, it's even funnier when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears, and both (stupid!) Cats think they see each other disguised as Mammy, and then they both attack her “behind” - lol. Naturally, she is angry, and as soon as she is angry, she has no one to contact. But even Jerry did not win this time, because he also expelled her.
