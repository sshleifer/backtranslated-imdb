First, an explanation of what makes a great movie for me. The excitement of not knowing what comes next will make me enjoy the film the first time I watch it (case study: Twister). There are other things that are well suited for the first viewing, such as a good mood (John Candy in Uncle Buck and Great Nature), a good plot with a good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), a figurative narration (all episodes of Wars ”- George Lucas MAN) and good music (again all the episodes of Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz, The Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in a movie theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters With these words, I represent Cindy Lou Who and Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffrey Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christina Baransky and Josh Ryan Evans. But each scene with Cindy and Grinch is excellent, very funny and / or emotional. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this film and the most compelling reason why a movie is better than a cartoon. Greench has a strong plot, good conflicts and a very good topic (I can't start because I don’t want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was very funny, like Grinch, especially when he talked to Cindy. And the music! Blimey! Great music by James Horner. I liked his choice of instruments and compositions. Very good job, Jim Carrey, I did not know that you know how to sing. Taylor Momsen! Wow Your voice is reason enough to watch the movie at least once. In your solo album “Where Are You a Christmas?” Is your voice really as high as it sounds? Looks like F #? This is an indecent range for a 7-year-old (obscene - at its best). Great job. This is the best performance of a child I've ever heard in a movie (Taylor knocked out von Trapp's children - no small feat!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was wonderful, funny and, surprisingly, very sensitive (it really showed in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's unexpressed expressions (one of the secrets of good acting) is very strong - it really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when she leads a dialogue, she becomes even stronger. <br /> <br /> ****************************** danger: Beware, spoilers ******* ********************************************** *********************************** <br /> Examples: expression when she first sees Grinch . This is a classic quote (“You are the one” and then filled with the Grinch line ”yes yes yes Grinch - after which she is tipped over to the sorter, and then saved by Grinch.” “Thank you for saving“ I ”and the subsequent Grinch answer were also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film is when Cindy invites Grinch to become a festive playmaster. This scene is two great actors who interact best with each other. Speaking with each other, little Taylor Momsen fully supports himself with Jim Carrey in this place. I sincerely hope that we will see Taylor Momsen in many other future films. In general, everything was great in this film (except, perhaps, the feet and nose),
