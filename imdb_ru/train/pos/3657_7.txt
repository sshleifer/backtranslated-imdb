This film is similar to the 1950s version of “Brutti sporchi e cattivi” by Ettore Scola. Less sex and less realism, but a fairy tale with great humanism and warmth. I would not call it a neo-realistic picture. This is very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and probably should be classified as a comedy, although it deals with serious issues (a bit like Chaplin or a comedy from 1930). The typical Italian, however, is very emotional and difficult to resist with the exception of a man with a cold stone. Sentimentalism is a disappointment, although this picture should not have become a realistic drama. This is not a masterpiece, like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But this is an attractive and fun comedy with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
