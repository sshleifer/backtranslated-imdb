Wow, it was a great Italian film "ZOMBIES", filmed by two great directors Lucy Fulci ("ZOMBIES") and Bruno Matti ("HELL OF LIFE DEAD"), Lucio started this film and was sick, so the great Bruno took possession, and it turned out to be surprisingly better than I expected, and it will turn out, so if you saw the "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw the "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and you liked both or one of those, then this is a movie you have to watch, he has excellent ZOMBIES cosmetics, because the beautiful witch ZOMBIES There is a funny flying ZOMBIE head! And the birds "ZOMBIE", which spit out acid on you and turn you into "ZOMBIE" People) but basically they are just poisonous "ZOMBIES", like in the film Bruno Mattie's "HELL OF LIVING DEAD". So if you like Italian films “ZOMBIES” or just films “ZOMBIES” as a whole, watch this film - this is great Italian film “ZOMBIE”!
