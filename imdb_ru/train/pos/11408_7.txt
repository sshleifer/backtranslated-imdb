Etienne Girardot - just an actor - a character that people almost never recognize by name. However, he again plays the coroner - one of the only actors in the films of Philo Vance, who played his role more than once. I have already seen him twice and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air. This film is also a pleasure to watch, because besides Girardot, there are many other great actors on the trip - including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Waltal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is quite an impressive cast, and they undoubtedly made it easier for leading men and women, Edmund Low and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great hero actors are one of the main reasons why I love these old bi-films, While the mystery itself is rarely so amazing, because of the fresh writing and acting skills, films really satisfy. As for this film, Lance is beautifully played by Vance, but, as I said, the mystery itself is just an afterthought with a silly storyline involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can't hypnotize anyone to do something like that - I practice clinical hypnosis, and if I could do something that an evil guy could do in a film, I would do it ! Used car dealers and a few of my old bosses would be obvious targets! <br /> <br /> Overall, although not the best movie of Phil Vance, he was very good, and, unfortunately, Lowe only played this role once. In fact, besides William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series was hampered by a long and long series of actors like Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Heide-White and Warren William (and many others) playing Vance. This is the same problem, which also pursues the series "Bulldog Drummond" - too many different actors play the main character. <br /> <br /> Well, itâ€™s worth seeing and making it exciting, though completely impossible.
