When we started watching this show on cable, I had no idea how much it was dragging on. Even when you hate a character, you hold him back because he is so well developed, you almost understand why he is reacting to frustration, fear, greed or temptation. It is almost as if the viewer was experiencing one of Christopher’s learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why Adriana put up with outrage over Christopher verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just need to read the newspaper to see how many women can really tolerate this behavior. Carmella has a dream home, endless supplies of expensive items, but I am sure that she will refuse her for the sake of a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not. That's why I look. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you watch an episode, you can find what you missed the first five times. We even watch episodes out of order (we watch the first season late at night with ads, but with all languages, A & E with censorship, repetitions in the Movie Network) - whenever they are included, we are in place. Now we are completely spoiled. <br /> <br /> I also love Malapropov. “Albacore around my neck” is my favorite Johnny Boy. When these jewels are included in our family vocabulary, this is a sign that I should get a life. I will do this when the series ends, and I will collect all the DVDs and put this collection into my will.
