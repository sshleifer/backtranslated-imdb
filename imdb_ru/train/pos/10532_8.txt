Make the world go. Take it off my shoulder. Say what you said and make the world go. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in brine, one for waste, and the other for kissing a child. None of them was guilty, but faced with accusations, and their house had to be demolished. The whole World, except their home, is gone. <br /> <br /> It's a little weird, but funny. What would you do if you were alone in the world? Two friends just enjoy each other's company and do what they want. But it seems to be aging quickly. <br /> <br /> Then they begin to improve their lives, hating memories. The sound effects were great. <br /> <br /> In the end, everything became really strange. This film was a product of great imagination, and was written and directed by Vincenzo Natalie with the help of two stars. It just needs to be seen.
