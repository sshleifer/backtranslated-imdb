I just watched as many as 6 episodes on DVD. Acting in everything is great - no questions asked. I must say that for me there was not enough action. There is no real expectation as such, just a lot of first-class characters. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you like slowly and carefully telling a good story, then this is for you. Peter Egan as the protagonist Magnus Pima is great. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the life of a traitor. The man who was supposed to be a loyal member of the British intelligence service, but who was so psychologically damaged by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in everything. As a child, he adored his father, but his father was again and again exposed as a crook and a crook. Pima did not betray for ideology or money, but because he needed to deceive the closest people (wife, son, mentor). Pim is fatally damaged by the influence of his father - he destroyed his moral principles. There is no true love or loyalty. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological stuff and not so many easy moments in the 6-hour series. Very well done, though.
