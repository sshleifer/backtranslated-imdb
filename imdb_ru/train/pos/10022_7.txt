Aro Tolbukhin lighted seven people alive in the Mission in Guatemala in the 1970s. He also stated that he killed 16 more people (he killed pregnant women and then set fire to them). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary film that tells about Aroâ€™s personality in several interviews with people who met him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts. <br /> <br /> Aro Tolbukhin is a serious work, so analytical that it is not at all painful. Such a terrible testimony about how some kind of childhood trauma can turn a person into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
