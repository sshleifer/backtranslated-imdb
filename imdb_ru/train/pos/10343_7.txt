Stars of "Amazing Mr. Williams" Melvin Douglas, who shot five films in 1939, one of which was "Ninochka with Garbo." His colleague was Joan Blondel (Maxine), who also starred in five films this year, three of which they shot together! Douglas - Lieutenant Williams, and he and his associates are presented with a dead body, and they must find out what really happened. The audience will recognize his colleagues - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald McBride, Don Beddo) have always played leadership positions ... senators, bank presidents, policemen. This stranger has a talent for comedy: the police always throw shots at each other, and even Williams and his girlfriend fight each other verbally. A few funny jokes - Williams even takes a man, whom they arrested, on a date with his girlfriend. There are a lot of fun things here, so go through a slow start and wait for more fun things later. I don’t want to give away any spoilers, so you’ll have to catch it in Turner Classic movies. Directed by Alexander Hall, he starred mostly in comedies, and at some point was engaged to Lucy.
