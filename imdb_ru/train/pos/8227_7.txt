An interesting thriller with Paul Winfield as a homicide detective. Paul Winfield was an underestimated actor who took off all of his roles so easily that it was hard to say that the man even played. Perhaps best known among young viewers as the voice / narrator of City Confidential, Winfield ends his career in a so-so film; but, as always, Winfield shines. Pleasure to view. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is healthy, Erika Eliniac, it is pleasant to look at her, but she leaves much to be desired in the acting department. Although, to be honest, this is one of her best works. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a watchable thriller that should not be missed by any Paul Winfield fan. A decent TV movie to help put Paul Winfield into a celluloid paradise. What an actor. He will be bored.
