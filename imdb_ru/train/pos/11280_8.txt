Very interesting entertainment, with the charm of old movies. Tarzan faces the greatest dangers without hesitation if the moment demands it, and we all enjoy his success with him. The most interesting for me is a person without special abilities, who encounters problems and beats them only with human skills (he was an excellent swimmer and an excellent scream)
