“Cry for Freedom” is a film about how far people will go to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first half is an interesting depiction of the unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and editor Don Woods (fanatically played Desel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half is dedicated to Woods, who is looking for answers about Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people prefer the first half of the film, which tells about the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods. It seemed to me that the second half about the work of Don Woods, so that the story of Biko would be heard all over the world, was much more interesting.
