This film is about the journey of discovery tells about the life of one family living in a sleepy island town of British Columbia. Vital and dreamy residents are pleased that they allow them to live around until a young teacher with a new face, with new ideas, comes and brings her life from the mainland. Slowly, their lazy state awakens, the father (and the director of the local school) is looking for excitement, a mother for stability, an eldest daughter for love, and a younger one for power. Although the film is not incredible or innovative, it is quietly pleasant and good for a weary night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt that anyone outside Canada will find it easily accessible.
