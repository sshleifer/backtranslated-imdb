This film is a surprisingly simplified work. Pleasant from beginning to end, it is both sad and at the same time inspiring. The performances from Miranda Otto (oh, how she deserves much more recognition!) And George del Hoya are wonderful and, nevertheless, almost painful to watch, as the two tormented souls begin to understand each other. The supporting staff of the workers in the “Office of the Dead Letters” is beautiful in itself, as is Alice’s long-suffering boy I couldn’t regret. There is one particular scene that I could watch again and again (and I have!), It is such a shame that such films do not receive recognition, and, therefore, bring them to the public for more people. I cried, laughed and sighed. I would recommend this film to everyone.
