Come on people. This film is better than 4. I see it happening ... rich people have done crazy things than this. And it was fun. <br /> <br /> I’m watching a comedy that needs to be entertained, break out for a while from the pressure of the world and don’t have to take anything too seriously. This film is completely suitable for this purpose. I appreciate the film and I’m not going to compare “Surviving Christmas” with “Burning Saddles”. I watched completely dysfunctional people turn into caring, likeable people who can easily live down the street from my house. He will remain on my list of "favorite ..... need to look at the holiday season." If you just want to have fun 90 minutes, take a look.
