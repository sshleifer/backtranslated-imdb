All the people reviewing this film, and probably many professional reviewers, simply don’t understand it. This film was created using matting sequences and artistic techniques, just like the work of the great Czech director Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I’m talking about, I suggest you take any of Zeman’s films, such as Jules Verne’s Fairy World, Baron Munchhausen, Journey to the Beginning of Time, or About the Comet. If you cannot find a movie, then read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If someone looked at Zeman's work and tried to compare it with any other sci-fi film of the time, the audience probably would not have received it either. It is unfair to compare the styles of these filmmakers with the standard technologies of the time, because Zemen and Heins do not count. They have a style that is unique to them and should be evaluated only for their creativity. If you look at this film from the point of view of what you KNOW that he intentionally tried to create under a collage of mate mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterwork. It’s not easy to get a bunch of computer cuts to work. I thought the creatures were pretty good too, also considering how they were made. Hines perfectly played, and I think that his film will not be fairly evaluated for many years. Someone who promoted the film should have warned viewers about what they would see, and not let them blindly go to the theater in anticipation of the usual CG performance. As for the actors, I think that Hines also took a page from the book of Zemen, in which many of the actors of Zemen at first were somewhat indifferent, but became much more attractive as the film and the action continued. I am very pleased to have this film in my library. I will watch it for many years, all three wonderful hours.
