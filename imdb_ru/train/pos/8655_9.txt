“California” is one of my favorite films, and it could easily be called one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very stylish surface, but behind it there are many alarming and honest images of killer maniacs and the terrifying violence they cause to others. One of the strongest aspects of the film is his performances, Brad Pitt is strikingly gorgeous like a psycho-trash-trash named Early. Pitt portrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis also plays well her naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heartbreaking. "California" has a very simple plot that steadily and slowly moves forward for about an hour, but suddenly plunges into a heartbreaking wave of murders when Pitt reveals his psychotic personality. There are many shocking scenes, and all this leads to a climax of a powerhouse that will haunt you for days. “Calyphonia” is a film that really needs to be watched, because it stares at how monstrous a person can be, not just his violence and blood.
