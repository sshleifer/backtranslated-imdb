Let me first get rid of the bad, James Hanlon is absolutely terrible, trying to describe what happened with the newcomers workouts and the events of the day. In fact, he fully contracted other firefighters without any ambition that was natural for their delivery. <br /> <br /> However, this is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes. I am an Englishman from London, but I love New York and have been many times before and after 9/11. This is a second home for me, and I can't help but feel empty as a result of the death of people, as well as the destruction of a part of such an amazingly beautiful city. This is the real deal with firefighters when everything collapses around them. I am so glad that the footage exists to show people how it was that day. It is a pity that they did not use video materials about people jumping out of buildings, because the friends who were there told me that this is such an important part of their memory, it should be included to show future generations how awful it really was. <br /> <br /> By the way, conspiracy theorists can go to hell.
