This film is great in every way. It affects the complexity of love relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The script never comes down to any character, even to the unfortunate Johnny. It also benefits from precise direction, production design, casting, and action. The fact that Cher is so beautiful in the film and more like “Cher” than she has ever been for me surprises me. I watch Moonstruck at least once a year, and I just watched it again on Christmas Eve with my 16 year old twin daughters, and they also liked it. It has something for everyone with a heart, and in the end you will be filled with joy.
