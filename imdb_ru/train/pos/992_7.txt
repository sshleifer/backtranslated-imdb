I had no expectations; I have never heard of Jamie Foxx; all I knew was that there are strong actors in the film. I thought it was very interesting; It was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to interest me. For me, Foxx is the original. David Morse is awesome (although this is not his best role). I thought chase and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well made. I did not expect much, and I was pleasantly surprised.
