As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie like the plague when bad reviews started to appear eight years ago, but I just finished watching this movie and found it a really pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Well, if you are looking for a re-version of the original, you will find a great disappointment, but if you are looking for something completely different, a little bit harsh and political, then this film is for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four years old, working as a teacher in his old comprehensive school, where he is being followed by another teacher, and he had sexual dreams about one of his students. When a student insists on meeting with Gregory, a series of misadventures arise, which include torture, hacking and infiltration, as well as all sorts of unexpected twists and turns that cause me to feel joy and excitement. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something original, then I highly recommend this movie. I only wish more people would go to see it when it was released, and see what it really is.
