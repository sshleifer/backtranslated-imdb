I have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the favorite novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clark are very believable, like Rochester and Jane. I have seen other versions, but none compares to this one. The best for me. I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters. The last time I saw it was in 1984, when I was only 13 years old. I was a bookworm at the time and just read a Charlotte Bronte novel. I was completely fascinated by this show, and I remember that I did not miss any of the episodes. I would like to see it again, because it is so good. :-)
