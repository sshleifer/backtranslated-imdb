This is the most convincing and excellent performance that Robert Taylor ever gave. He even surpasses his remarkable performance in the role of "Johnny Eager", which appeared 14 years after this film. His appearance is still amazing, but now he has maturity, which gives him an advantage in this tough, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) - the last in its class bison hunter who kills, not for money, but for pleasure. A stunning spectacle - his killing wild eyes, not only with buffaloes, but also with people. He is mostly a lonely person who needs people around him, but they do not like him because of his sociopath's behavior. His partner is Sandy Mackenzie (Stuart Granger), who is fed up with the hunt, and she only goes forward because he is a loser in everything else. Along the way, Charlie kills an Indian family and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her to no avail, but sees that Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is sad to watch, so she was tired of hunting, she longs to leave with the girl and her child. Lloyd Nolan, like a drunken skinner, is beautiful with his wise cracks and accordion playing. Russ Tamblyn plays half the breed, trying to fit into the white world. The group is a strange mixture of good and evil, young and old. In the end, Taylor is frightened by a buffalo, like many other hunters before him, and runs away, leaving Sandy with a girl. On his return that night, Sandy leaves with a woman, sending Charlie to the frenzy of murder in search of Sandy and have a girl for herself. The final standoff comes in a snowstorm, and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. This is Taylor's film, and he was a truly underrated actor of that era.
