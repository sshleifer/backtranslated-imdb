Jack Cassidy’s casting as Ken Frankin was pure brilliance. Cassidy personified arrogance, confidence, charm and wit - all with a condescending, wicked grin on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is definitely the best assassin (appearing three times) in the Colombo series. This special (and first) performance is my favorite episode with Colombo, ever. Newcomer Steven Spielberg did an amazing camera job (yes, sometimes the actors had a few shadows from the camera), capturing the nuances and banter from different and intriguing angles between Colombo and Franklin. In addition, the panoramic and dense shots at Big Bear Lake, California (house in the house of Franklin) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this episode yet, then you have to do it yourself - This is a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was very contagious. His death in 1976 at the age of 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic - he must have had his best years. Rest in peace, Jack, you will live forever thanks to your great work.
