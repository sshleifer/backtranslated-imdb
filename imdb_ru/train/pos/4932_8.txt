In Panic on the Streets, Richard Widmark plays a US Navy doctor who rudely interrupted his week with a plague corpse. As policeman Paul Douglas correctly notes, the guy died from two bullets in the chest. This is not the case, they become unwitting partners, trying to find the killers and all who are prone to this disease. <br /> <br /> As stated by any number of people, for some reason, director Elia Kazan did not bother to play small details with someone who sounded like they were from Louisiana. Being in New Orleans, where the story takes place, I can personally confirm this. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because he can be appointed as a naval doctor, but for those who are natives, this does not work. <br /> <br /> But with the plague and news, the secret police of New Orleans, while remaining secret, are launching the underworld of the city into life. The dead guy got off the ship from Europe, and he had connections with the underworld. The wise guy from New Orleans, played by Jack Palance, hurries with a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and begins to pursue a deceased cousin who begins to show symptoms of plague. Palance received rave reviews in the first film where he received the notification. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel. This happened just before Mostel was blacklisted, and at about the same time he began to play tough guys who were really toads. He plays the same role in the Humphrey Bogart film Forced. Unfortunately, I can identify with Mostel in the last scene of the chase, where he and Palance are pursued by Widmark, Douglas and half the police of New Orleans. Weight control challenged Zero, trying to keep up with Palance, and it was something else, because I am now in League Zero, in the health department. <br /> <br /> Kazan continued in the same vein, very little downtime in this film. If it were a little less, it would be an Indiana Jones film. This year, "Panic on the Streets" won an Oscar for the best original script. <br /> <br /> Kazan also made good use of the embankment of New Orleans and the French Quarter. Some of the same shots are later used in On the Quay. In fact, Panic In The Streets are people who do not scream when they really need it, in their own interests. Again, very similar to "On the Embankment." <br /> <br /> “Panic on the streets” makes everyone who is connected with it proud. Now why Elia Kazan could not find decent people from New Orleans in small roles.
