Two years ago I watched “Matador” in the cinema, and I liked everything in this film. Obviously, I was completely under the impression of the magnificent role of Pierce Brosan. Yesterday I filmed this movie again on TV, so I looked at it a little deeper. Now I can safely say that this film is not so special, but you just have to love it because of one person. <br /> <br /> Brosnan raises his assessment, in my opinion, the stunning performance of Julian Noble, a tired hired assassin who has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinner) in Mexico City, a man who was unlucky: his son died in an accident, his work is not very good, and he is not sure that he can save his wife Bean (Hope Davis). br /> <br /> I always liked such films; criminal film with a great touch of humor. Basically, this humor comes from Brosnan when he tells jokes about gnomes with big letters "d" or one of my favorite lines in this film: "I look like a prostitute from Bangkok on Sunday morning after the left city of the Navy." Brosnan says this with his charisma while he drinks his Margarita, as usual. I also like Greg's “typical American face” Kinnear as a loser, very lively, because there are a lot of people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> I therefore recommend that you see perhaps the best role Brosnan has ever had. He will make you smile and admire him at the same time. The Great Brosnan in a not so great film.
