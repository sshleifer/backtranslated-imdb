My super ex-girlfriend is an entertaining movie, no more and no less. <br /> <br /> The story is quiet simple. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) in the subway and contacts her. At the beginning of their relationship, everything seems to be in order, but then Matt finds out that she is a G-Girl. At first it seems really cool for Matt, but it turns out that the G-Girl is very jealous and needy. Therefore, he decides to break up with her and contact his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This is very angry G-Girl, and she begins to avenge her ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> In the movie, I like the best of the scenes where G-Girl takes revenge on Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in a different role, and not her character from the Terrible Film saga. <br /> <br /> I give this film 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who loves a good comedy.
