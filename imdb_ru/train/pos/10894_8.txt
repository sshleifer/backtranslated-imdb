I had some reservations about this film, I thought it would be a regular fare - a film about the Christmas formula. Being in the middle of the heat at the end of June, we decided to do it anyway, maybe we will see some snow. <br /> <br /> This film turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was believable in character, but the real star of this is James Gandofini. He spoke his lines with real wit about him and made a great “dad”. <br /> <br /> If you want to spend a couple of pleasant hours, be sure to check this one out.
