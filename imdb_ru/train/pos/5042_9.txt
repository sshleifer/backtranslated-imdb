The synopsis of this film perfectly explains what to expect. This is a very good thriller. Good shot. It's hard to believe that this was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, although some shots look ONLY like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few shots that look really good and demonstrate true imagination from Paxton. <br /> <br /> This is a serious story with some wonderful twists at the end, some of them, all believable, funny and, most importantly, shaded well enough to make them real twists. <br /> <br /> The child actors in the film also do a great job. Iâ€™m usually wary of starring films with children, because they are too often removed when Nickelodeon rejects, but both of these guys do a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not terrible. It's not very scary. But it is very, very creepy.
