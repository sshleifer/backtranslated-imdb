Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) is a film about "yokai" or traditional Japanese "monsters" from folklore. Alternatively, it is known as the “War of the Big Monsters” or “Ghosts in the Parade”. <br /> <br /> Yokai of the first edition includes a freak-kettle, a kapp-water demon, a living keychain, a woman whose cheeks can grow extremely gigantic. a woman with a second face at the back, a dwarf priest with a huge pumpkin wrist, etc. haunted on Halloween, or "strange show" of previous years, but with only fake freaks. Ghosts, goldfish monsters, and dancing one-headed umbrellas were fabricated to create a “chill” in the hot summer. Fat man and others were recreated with the help of tricks or illusions based on the monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; And if their design for the film is a little simple and playful, it makes them all the more personable because they historically recreated them for the summer cold. <br /> <br /> These pretty cute monsters must fight and destroy the ancient Babylonian demon-vampire, who came to Japan and disguised as a samurai lord. Despite the fact that some of the Japanese phenomena are a bit stupid, and too many costumes are hardly more than masks, even without moving their lips, as they say, it all plays very poker and very charming. It has some beautiful cinematography, most of which would have been provided in a CGI film of the same decade. If you look in the right mood or with the right friends, it is exciting, touching and touching. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous “Lonely Wolf and Cub: White Sky and Hell” (1974) and was a special FX director of the magnificent Daimgin trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is not equal to Majin at its best, but Yokai is, nevertheless, very fun. The first miike film, which is the most child-centered of his family films, with GOZU & IZOO, is consistently more serious, but not too serious for young viewers.
