I am a man not familiar with female films, but this is a really good story. I don't have a personal love for Jane Fonda as an individual, but she does a hell of a good job, while De Niro is his usual superb self. Everything is so well done: acting, directing, visual effects, settings, photography, casting. If you can enjoy the story of real people and true love - this is a winner.
