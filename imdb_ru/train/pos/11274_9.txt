One of the best films about Tarzana is also one of the most exciting (and graphic). <br /> <br /> Gathering about a year after Tarzan, the Monkey, Neil Hamilton's Holt asked a wealthy friend to finance a safari back to an elephant cemetery to collect ivory. His friend arrives, carrying the dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to get Jane back from Tarzan. Before they can leave, Holt finds that his map has been stolen, and becomes an insane attempt to seize a rival expedition. When they finally take the thieves, they find the whole group dead and surround themselves. They have no choice but to break through and soon find that they come out of the pan to the fire. In the end, Tarzan and Jane appear, and everyone leaves for even more adventures. <br /> <br /> The infamous film was severely censored to reduce graphic violence (its graphics even by today's standards. Probably get PG 13) to remove all hints of nudity (there is a scene of a nude swimming with a few minutes Jane, who was completely exposed in the frontal position, was only recently restored. It is understandable to watch the restored version, why this film was cut by 20 minutes during the show on television. In its restored version, this is a very adult film, romantic, touching, filled with action and everything else, what a film should be. This is an amazing movie of almost any standard. Best of all, this is a film that plays well as a separate adventure, you do not need to watch the first film to enjoy it, but also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set in this original film. This is an amazing thing. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. <br /> <br /> If there are any flaws in the film, the film may not have survived. The rear screen is often very obvious, for many monkeys there are gorilla costumes, and some other effects are more bizarre than persuasive. However, at almost any other level, this film is top notch. <br /> <br /> You really have to see this. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and roll up on the couch and just allow yourself to return to a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.
