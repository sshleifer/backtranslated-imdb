Foxes are seriously looking at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s. And unlike teen sex comedies that clouded him (Porky, Fast Times in Regiment High), the film stands up well to the effects of time. <br /> <br /> His topic of adolescent angst is just as relevant today as it was 25 years ago. and Jodie Foster and the scooter Scott Baio (do you remember him?) are led by a wonderful young cast that is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The film tells about four girls from Southern California who live in the gratuitous existence of sex and drugs and are deprived of their parents. Teens spend their days at school and outside, and spend nights at parties, concerts or on the street. Rarely are they at home, because instant gratification is pills, a party or departure. <br /> <br /> But instead of condemning them, the film is sympathetic, blaming absent, impartial adults for making teenagers grow up alone. A charismatic cast can not help but like. <br /> <br /> Opening the film ?? a long and loving pan - sets the tone for the next. We see girls sleeping at dawn among the objects that define teenage girlhood, from Twinkies to a picture of young John Travola, while Donna Summer’s “On the Radio” is shot below. <br /> <br /> From there, the film picks up speed when girls are sent to school and to life. Annie (quickie rocker Cherie Kerry) is a wild kid who lives for the next party or a pill. Deirdre (Candice Straw) - the boy is a crazy drama queen. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) - a shy girl above her head. And Foster is the one who has a plan. It is her job to keep this team together long enough to finish high school, and at the same time keep her divorced and desperate man hunting for his mother (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> This is an almost impossible job, and Foster eventually fails at. <br /> <br /> Despite its age, Foxes are a pleasure to watch. Dated hair, clothes and links to Olympic figure skater Dorothy Hamill did not hurt the film. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply amazing, with breathtaking filtered shots of the LA basin. at dawn, dusk and night. Giorgio Moroder adds an 80s soundtrack featuring people like Donna Summer and Janice Jan. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the film is that the young stars around Foster never flared up, like the actors “Fire St. Elmo” (1985) or Empire Records (1995). "Fox" shows why they should have. But, perhaps, as in bowling for the song Soup "1985", they just hit the wall.
