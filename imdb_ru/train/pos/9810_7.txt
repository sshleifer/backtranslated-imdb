Albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a Class A western, except for one thing: a story that really belongs to class B or C. It was acceptable when the film was made, when people were so happy to see it in western color currently it looks very primitive. However, for people who love old westerns, this is interesting, the original color and sound is very well preserved on the recently released DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good helper, Lon Cheney is, as always, mean, and Randolph Scott is a bit more fun than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque, you expect to see something that will remind you of the city, but the city shown here can be anywhere.
