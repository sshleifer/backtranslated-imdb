My wife and I watched this series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. This is not the “complete” history of the Second World War — no library can hold such a history, but it is the best summary of this history. Lots of details, lots of personal stories and still holds the big picture. <br /> <br /> The narration of Olivier is excellently written and, of course, beautifully given. Interviews are coming from all sides except Russian, because producers were not allowed to talk with many Russians. It is very worth having this full program on DVD. We value our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer did an excellent job, providing photos and action, where there was practically no archive: for example, there are almost no films about convoys and underwater battles, but still the Episode on this subject is very well done.
