Animation always seems to be a fringe. In Japan this may not be the case, but in Europe and, especially, in the USA, the animation has a big bold tag “KIDS”. France is probably one of the most comical liberal countries where classics live, such as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky-Luc, Valereon, etc. (If you have never read them, it’s not too late. There are no age limits , and they do not bear the slander of DC or Marvel. It seems natural to a film like this that pops up in France. This fits my biased image of the French as art-loving, USA-oriented and talented filmmakers. Fortunately, there is also a “dark scanner” to suppress this point of view - it seems that art is largely international. <br /> <br /> In any case, as you might have guessed, the Renaissance is artsy and French. If you are a normal person, it scares you. However, this is not necessary! Under this cool, smooth, shaded at first glance appearance there is a good thriller and a good film as a whole. <br /> <br /> This was one of my fears for this film. It's so easy to turn an exciting animation into a trick, like Sony & C: o do with their Pixar plagiarism. I was expecting a confusing, sometimes boring and not very attractive film, but fortunately I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would still like it for neo-noir, but it was good that it was worth this level as well. NOTE: I saw a French dub, which was fine, as far as I could see. English may be more interesting than with Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> The last word in the animation. It was awesome. Futuristic, well thought out, good cameramanship, smart solutions (for example, Eyes looked very good, which is difficult to do) and so visually stunning that I felt like bursting "It's damn impressive!". On the other hand, I really like the animation, and I appreciate the effort the studio is making, so my verdict is a bit biased. <br /> <br /> A good movie anyway, definitely lives outside of its “trick”.
