Fire And Ice is an animated film made in a fantasy world. The film tells about the village, destroyed by a giant glacier, in which lives an evil ice lord named Necron. The only survivor in the village is a young man named Larn who is going to avenge those who were killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves through the land of fire, and the princess of the country named Tigra is abducted by evil creatures. Larn goes in search of her, as well as in the search and murder of Necron. "Fire and Ice" directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of Fritz The Cat and some films that he himself wrote, for example, the excellent movie Heavy Traffic. I didnâ€™t like Fire and Ice almost as much as the other works of Ralph Bakshi, but I still found the film enjoyable. He had a very good animation in parts, and the story was quite interesting. The only major complaints I have are that I would like the film to have more history, because the story he uses is very thin and not so much in it. I would also like the film to be a little longer, because it lasts less than 80 minutes. However, these are entertaining adventure films, which, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic, are suitable for children 8 years and older. The only pity is that there was no more developed history, and it lasted a little longer than it was.
