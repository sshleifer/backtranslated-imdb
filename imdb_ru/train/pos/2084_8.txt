My main problem with the film is it is too long. In addition, it is very good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is going to get married by agreement. Louise Reiner is a maid who marries Mooney. They live with Father Muni on the farm, and they are all bad. When he finally gets some money to buy more land, a drought begins, and nothing grows. First, everyone goes north so that Mooney is left behind. When they leave and arrive in the city, they discover that they have no work and are in a worse position than before. They even think of selling their youngest daughter as a slave for money, but decide against it. When a group of people begins to rob the city, the military appear and begin to execute people. Paul Muni does a good job, and Louise Rainer won a second Oscar for this film.
