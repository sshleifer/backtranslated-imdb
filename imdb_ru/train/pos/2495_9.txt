A strange, witty and wonderful image of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote something funny, premonitory and sometimes scary! Yes, do not be fooled by the fun melody 2point4 and the playful characters; The show has a dark side, and sometimes can be pretty intimidating. And that's what's so good about the show, it's not just a comedy series, where every character is a two-dimensional comic device (in the case of My Family). Instead, the characters are completely rounded people who show a full rollercoaster of human emotions. Sometimes dark moments such as Bill, apparently followed by a curse, and Ben waking up in a quaint village, are two examples of a show that takes a surreal, dark twist that helps add a little depth. Of course, the show is also incredibly funny and guaranteed to make you smile. It is a pity that Eureka Video stopped releasing this comical gold on DVD.
