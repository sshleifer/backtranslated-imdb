In general, I liked this film, and I would recommend it to fans of indie films. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to point out the similarities between the parts of this film and Nichols 'Closer'. One scene, especially when Adrian Grenier’s character asks Rosario Dawson about her sex life when he was absent, is remarkably similar to the scene in “Closer”, where Clive Owen’s character asks Julia Roberts, although in “Love” she acts with less sharpness and intensity. Also note that “Anna” is the name of the character Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Closer is now based on a play by Patrick Marber, and perhaps this film is largely based on Arthur Schnitzler's Reigen, so I'm not sure how this relationship came about. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
