“The Disciple of Prague” is an early full-length horror drama, or rather, “auto-film” (that is, the author's film). This film is a participant in many movements that tried to give respect to cinema or simply make a profit by adapting literature or theater on the screen. Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using the poem of Alfred de Musset and the story of Edgar Allen Poe, he concentrates on the theme of the double. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the most cinematic of this film is the double exposure effect, in which Paul Wegener appears twice in scenes. At one time, Guido Seber was a master of special effects, but he is not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. Nevertheless, cinema scientist Leon Hunt (printed in Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narration) conducted an interesting analysis of this film, using framing to enhance the theme of twins: the characters are divided into left / right, near / far and frontal. / diagonal framing of characters and frames. Despite this, the film consists mainly of long frames from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. Worse, the lack of editing; there is very little dissection of the scene and the scene is delayed. None of this is unusual for 1913, but at the same time more advanced films have appeared on this subject, including the best parts of Atlantis (August Blom, 1913), Twilight of the Female Soul (Evgeny Bauer, 1913) and short films DW Griffith. <br /> <br /> An expanded universal vocabulary by 1926 will significantly improve the remake. In addition, the remake has a reason for the character of Lyduschka, in addition to being an occasional troublemaker and a viewer surrogate. Here the obsessive Gypsy is hidden, apparently, in an invisible cloak. I know that their world is silent for me, but I suppose that their lips are moving and such that their world will not be silent for them, so how can Lidushka look at other people's shoulders and not be noticed? <br /> <br /> However, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener, who seems to have been the main idea of ​​this film, in addition to the main role, will later play the main role and become co-director of Golem in 1920 - helping to open the supernatural thread in silent cinema even more. . <br /> <br /> (Note: the first version I looked at lasted about an hour (of course, not quite complete) and was in poor condition, people sometimes became discolored, and the like. I'm not sure who I was I've seen DVD Alpha since then, in which there are no shots in the 41st minute in the 41st minute, and there are fewer and very different title cards, but visually it is not so bad. The repetitive results are best muted, though.)
