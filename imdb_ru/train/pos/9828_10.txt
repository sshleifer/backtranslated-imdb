I will be honest with you ... I liked this movie. This is a great film about zombies, which is filled with action, original ideas, good acting, but also the bad effects of zombies. Part IV, titled After Death, is also good. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Horror Fans. Such films should be seen in "Puppet Master", "Living in the Skin", "Bloody Party", "Sleep" Away Camp and other full moon.
