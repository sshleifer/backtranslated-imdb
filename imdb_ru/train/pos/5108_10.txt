This is my favorite movie of all time. When I was alone, it was my movie on Friday night with a pizza and a bottle of wine. I first saw this film with my aunt Brand and sister Checity. I was in grade 2. I fell in love with Travolta, and Sissy was my new best friend. I read a lot of comments about why Bad left Sissy and how Sissy should “learn to act” in marriage. But let's go back and take a look at this for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the film now, not when I was eight years old, is that the relationship between Bada and Sissy turns to the worst because she fools him for being bullied. They fall into a huge battle. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance. Sissy then thinks that two mistakes will make the truth, and Wes asks her if she needs any help. They all act like fools on the dance floor when Bud asks Pam, "when are you going to take me home and rape?" Pam replies: "When you're ready, Cowboy." Then Bad goes home with Pam to his apartment in downtown Houston. Which daddy bought for her with his oil money and "all that means" Bad is the one who changes sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day. Sissy is the one who leaves Bud. Then Bad must prove to Sissy that he is a real "cowboy" and return her. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is my interpretation. Everyone has his own, I'm sure! I like this film. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I got a REAL cowboy! I love him too! :)
