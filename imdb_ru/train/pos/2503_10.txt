I am very picky about the films that I see. I heard about the Moon Child quite by accident. I have been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and a fan of Gackt and Mizer only recently. <br /> <br /> I finally found out that the film is being republished, and took it without a second thought. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as I am to the films, I admit that the fighting scenes can sometimes be somewhat ridiculous ... but they should be like another user suggested, the quintessence of the calm before the storm, quoting Gary Oldman from Leon ... without going into spoilers, the film struck me very much because you understand that the limits of friendship are endless and, as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and the like of Marriage until death separates you. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give performances that demonstrate why they are able to convey such depth to their song, their passion for music takes place on the big screen and in the process. he creates an exemplary film that penetrates the soul and evokes an emotional response. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie for the first time, I realized that it was likely that he would remain in heavy rotation with regard to my collection. I want to encourage anyone who reads this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend in the cinema ... this takes a completely new direction using the classic elements of the Yakuza film and how you can go wrong with the cameo Rio Ishibashi of Takashi Miike, "Listening" and "Suicide Club"? <br /> <br /> Man ... I just can't say enough about this movie, but Iâ€™ll stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
