Something happens to Sondra Pransky when she enters the box of the magician on the stage of the London theater. Little did Sondre know that the spirit of the recently departed journalist Joe Strombell materializes to ask her to investigate the person that someone had told him, on his journey to another dimension, the infamous Tarot killer who was rampant in London. The only problem is that the accused is, apparently, a respectable person from the upper class. <br /> <br /> When Sondra talks about his experience to the Great Splendini, he is Sid Waterman, the wizard is stunned, but decides to go along. These two would have been the invitation of PIS. to the club where Peter Liman goes to swim. Sondra, who pretends to be drowning, attracts the attention of this beautiful woman, who wants to see more of her. <br /> <br /> Of course, the two of them will fall into a variety of funny situations until they get rid of it. Revealed at the end of the film. Little does the real Tarot assassin think that he can fool the determined Sondra, who turns out to be more resourceful than he considered her. <br /> <br /> The result was a great summer movie with a lot of laughter, which is just what you need to get out of the heat at the perfect time in a cool theater. Woody Allen succeeded, and yet, this solar comedy will justify him for past failures. In The Scoop, Mr. Allen pulled himself into the hands of a romantic leader, whipping up his gorgeous leading lady. His trademark gesturing is something this funny person will never get rid of, as it seems to be his trademark. The film has several fun liners that will go over the heads of the audience, which may not be paying attention. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star "Scoop", seems like the perfect foil for Woody Allen. She plays a straightforward role, while Mr. Allen makes her own game, the perfect combination. Both make fun of the whole movie. Mrs. Johansson is a knockout beauty in a red bathing suit, although they are so dressed in most of the costumes she wears on the screen. Hugh Jackman is considered Peter Lyman, a sophisticated man in a city with the right pedigree. He looks good in the film like a man chasing Miss Johansson. Ian McShane plays a dead journalist on Fleet Street on his way to eternity. <br /> <br /> Scoop is a lightweight film for a hot and humid summer thanks to Woody Allen.
