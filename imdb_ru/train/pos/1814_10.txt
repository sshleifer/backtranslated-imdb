All Dogs Go to Heaven, in my opinion, is the best animated film ever made. I'm not a very big fan of animated films, but there’s something in it that makes it better than any other cartoon I've seen. The music is beautiful, as are the performances of Bert Reynolds, the House of Deluxe, and especially Ken Page as King of Gator. “Let's make music together” is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any musical I have seen. This is definitely a must see for people of all ages.
