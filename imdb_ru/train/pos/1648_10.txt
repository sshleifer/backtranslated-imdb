This is one of the best movies ever made. This is a realistic depiction of rural life on the ranch, which was a big part of American history. The settlement is 1906 Wyoming, where life has not changed much since the last century. The film retains your interest without adding Hollywood myths. The whole family can watch this film and be intrigued by what life was like in America when it was mostly a rural nation. With this film you will escape the present and witness everyday life 100 years ago. In a beautiful, picturesque setting, you will see the hard physical work that was required for survival, as well as the constant worries and anxieties of the elements and the pressure of the market that will matter for success or failure. Watch this movie and feel the life that was for most of the history of our country. This movie is worth your time to watch. My only question is why there are no films like this one?
