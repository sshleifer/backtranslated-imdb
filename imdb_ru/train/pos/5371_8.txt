I wrote my first comment on this film almost five years ago. Then the ideas presented in the film still seemed mostly fictional, if they could ever occur at all. Not more. Now politics, society and the media in Running Man really seem very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors that were largely absent in 1987 (the year when the Running Man was released): imagine today: <br /> <br /> Concern as Richard Dawson’s character Damon Killian put it , "Traditional morality." CHECK Entertainment <br /> <br /> in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort on the part of the participants. CHECK cameras <br /> <br /> everywhere. CHECK <br /> <br /> Limited travel by citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system with passports with barcodes (“tickets” in the film) and authorized under the guise of national security. CHECK <br /> <br /> Increased mixing, bordering on incestuous, government and media. CHECK computer graphics <br /> <br /> that are sufficiently advanced to manipulate real frames of the film (for example, “digital matting” of Ben Richards' image on the doubler). CHECK <br /> <br /> Imprisonment of conscious opponents or detractors of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> Ticking the economy widens the gap between the rich and the not very rich; the growing number of peripheral groups responding to a large government tightening loop; civil unrest brewing at or near the surface of almost every significant public event, regardless of its origin or intention. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> Again, maybe this is just a film based on Stephen King's short story. But to be safe, I'm moving to Switzerland.
