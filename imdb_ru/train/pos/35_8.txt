When I saw a carefully thought-out DVD box for this and a terrible statuette of the Red Queen, I was sure that I would be in great disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I liked it. Of course, the confusing nonsense and unforgivable thought that such a difficult outcome must urgently lead to the fact that she can barely read the subtitles, not to mention the absurd explanation. This discord, however, is a dream movie. Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in a beautiful setting, and all this is constantly in motion and accompanied by the wonderful score of Bruno Nicholas. He may not be a Morricone, but in these light details he may be so. Really pleasant with lots of color, lots of sexuality, some bloody murders and minimal police intervention. Super.
