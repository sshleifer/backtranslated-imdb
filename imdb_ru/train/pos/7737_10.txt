If you are a big fan of the author, as I am Jim Thompson, it can be quite clever when their work turns into a film. This is not the case when Scott Fowley wrote “AFTER THE DARK SWEET”. Attractive, sexually charged classic noir, who closely watches and does justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward, perhaps, show the best results in their careers. And always the phenomenal Bruce Dern could even surpass himself by that. Like Thompson’s book, this film creates a dark and surreal world in which passion conquers logic, and a double cross is never at hand. Be sure to look for all fans of the great film noir. **** !!!
