A dentist was made at a time when almost every profession had a psycho. We had crazy cops, ambulance people, secrets, and that was just for starters. The dentist came in surprise late, because visiting the dentist is usually a nightmare for everyone. <br /> <br /> The plot is perverted. The super-clean dentist Dr. Finestone lives beautifully in his magnificent “white house”, he has a beautiful blonde wife and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds are approaching its horizon in the form of a disgusting guy from the IRS (Earl Boin from the Terminator), a dirty pool cleaner who “cleans” his wife, and suddenly all of his teeth seem to have passed a dark filter. He goes mad and begins to nastily care for people's teeth. And you do not want to go on his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna produced stylish horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator, and his first film Society was a good by-product of John Carpenter's “They Live.” The producer of the film Pierre David is known for films like Scanners. Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from Los Angeles and the Major Leagues, but I could dream of him as a psychotherapist. He was really great in his role, and he was kind of a sad person. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and stupid, like Feynstones' wife. Michael Stadwek did not have many lines, but after I saw him with the neighbors of the ladies, I knew my future profession. Ken Fori (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) was a wonderful sight as a cop on a case. Virginia Keene was an innocent teen who was about to become the next Feinstone client. <br /> <br /> Last warning: if you are like me and you have problems with a dentist, then perhaps you should skip this. But if you want to try, than you have to prepare yourself with dark humor and a lot of dirty workouts.
