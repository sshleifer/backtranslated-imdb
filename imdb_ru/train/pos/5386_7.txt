This film played very well in 1932 and probably will not work today, because its style is a bit old-fashioned and invented. However, if you are a kind person like me, who adores old Hollywood films, you will relax a little and you will be able to enjoy what we have - interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The film is in the ward for problematic pregnancies. In this large room there are about half a dozen beds in which women wait to give birth, but doctors are concerned about possible complications (yes, such a room really hurts mothers!). And, as in the episode "Boat of Love" or "Island of Fantasy", each mom has a special story. With so many pretty extreme and crazy stories, you have to stop unbelief. I could have enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Here are a few stories: one of them is related to the father. You do not see mom, but he is a very, very nervous father, and this is included for comic relief. Nevertheless, he was wonderful here - very touching. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden - a sad case. Loretta is sent to the hospital from prison - she apparently killed some terrible guy. You do not know exactly what happened, but you assume that he tried to impose himself on her! However, she was given a 20-year prison term - and her husband is loyal to her and is with her as much as he can. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a terrible person. She has hamster maternal instincts - indeed, a very bad and alcoholic hamster! She is pretty funny and worth seeing for most of the movie. I liked that she drinks from a bottle of hot water filled with gin, and also gets upset when she finds out that she can't make money selling her twins !! At the end of the film she has a typical Hollywood change of heart, which was supposed to be in contact - I found her far-fetched. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who has given birth to an unborn child. Surprisingly, after the words, they return the woman back to the same ward as the women awaiting delivery !!! A crazy woman who you thought lost a child some time ago escapes from a psychiatric ward. She insists that she has a child. Later, she again runs away and actually takes one of the children! <br /> <br /> Most of the stories are bigger than this, but the ones I mentioned are the main ones. As I said, this is a kind of soap opera and very interesting - and rather sad in the case of several stories. The ending, in particular, is heartbreaking and exceptionally well made. There were some particularly good speeches - especially Farrell and Aline McMahon as the head nurse. All in all, a very good movie - and I have no idea why they felt that they had to remake the movie just a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
