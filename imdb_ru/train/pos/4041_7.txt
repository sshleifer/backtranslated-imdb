Tenshu is in prison and sentenced to death. When he is experiencing an electric shock, government officials give him the choice to either be more shocked or to accept some experiments. He chooses an experiment and fits in a large metal chamber with a bad criminal who also survived an electric shock. They can have everything they want in a room (within reason), but they cannot leave. after a few days, the number of meals is reduced to one per day, and the temperature in the room is set to 100. After a few more alarms after some time, they will not be able to fall asleep. One day a “sorceress” will enter their camera (even if it is enchanted part). What's next, I'll let you know. I may be in the minority here, but I liked the build-up, it was intriguing for me. Now, if the payout were twice as low as during the creation, I would rate it much higher. <br /> <br /> My rating: C + <br /> <br /> 2 sets of DVD Media Blaster Extras: Disk 1) Director's cut; Trailers for the films "Versus", "Aragami", "The attack on the gas station" and "The Deadly Criminal Outlaw". 2) Theater cutting; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Taku and Tsutomu Takahashi; Actor and film interview; Manufacturing; Original trailer; and promoters
