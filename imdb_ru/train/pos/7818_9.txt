I think that the context of this story was covered by other authors, so I just wanted to write about the influence of this film on me. <br /> <br /> I first saw this film in its release year around 1987. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see it, for the RE project, I think. We all, of course, were excited because we were on a school trip to the movies! Little did we know that we were going to experience. To this day, I still remember the feelings he aroused in me, and I often remembered how I cried, like most of my friends. I think that at the age we were at, we found it shocking and quietly rightly insulted in our own way. It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti-apartheid Movement that same year. <br /> <br /> I think so. served my purpose in my case.
