I joined IMDb so people know what a great movie it is! Not often you come across a film that moves and is visually cinematic, but modest. You read the plot, so all I want to say is not to watch it, because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity, because this is a typical delusion that people read, instead just appreciate and understand that this is about father and son traveling, getting to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it on before film4 gets to it. It was one of the few films that were nominated for BAFTA as independent and foreign. The beauty of this is that he manages to appeal to anyone, even if you never watch anything with subtitles or just get used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you in sight. The only thing I want is for it to be longer and see what is happening
