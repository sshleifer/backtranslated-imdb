You can try to define the genre of the film Gert de Graaff as an “event of thought” following the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal storyline is a kind of painful search by Bart Clover for that ephemeral substance that makes up the essence of the personality. The script of his new film is formed simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. This film-monologue originated in response to “8 ½” Fellini and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Anxiously playing with real and fictional characters, as well as with the audience, he reveals the bizarre relationship of real and imaginary, paradoxical coexistence in two different galaxies: Guttenberg and McLuene. For some time, we are inclined to support the author of the script, who believes that the cause of all misfortunes are damned stereotypes of mass thinking ("man", "Catholic", "window washer"). And with him we fall into the trap when the creator-creator finally faces an insoluble dilemma: how to exclude from the future film. Bart Clover? Just five minutes before the finals, thanks to the general minor reproaches of the creator’s wife, deeply immersed in the work, we understand that together with the main character we were “set up” again. Indeed, what is the price of art, for the sake of which it is permissible to give up your own name and the daily care of your little daughter? <br /> <br /> So who is he, this Bart? Clover? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone who is obsessed, like Frenhoffer, from Balzac's masterpiece (just like the last scriptwriter eventually erases everything he wrote from the computer’s memory)? Gert de Graaf invites us to answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
