One talked about Nathaniel Hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I believe that the same remark can be approached to the paintings of MacDonald-Eddy. And especially this one. <br /> <br /> He obviously has many characteristics of a failed film: is it a kitsch, does the script sound inconsistent due to censorship ?? Nevertheless, this film has some good moments: good Rogers-Hart music (“I married an angel”, “Tir of Tir of Tira la”), good acting with E. E. Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you don’t like it, you can’t forget about it. This strange film actually leaves a very strong, dreamlike impression, and you will most likely remember it for several days, or maybe weeks. What for? In the thirties and early forties, films did not have the same meaning as today: they, as a dream, were aimed at distracting the public, so that it would forget about the difficult reality. Of all the films of dreams made at that time, this one stands out in particular. <br /> <br /> In short, let's say that the best way to evaluate this film is to watch it without thinking. is it good or bad. To watch it as if you were watching a dream.
