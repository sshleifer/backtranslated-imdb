I like this movie. I am Mexican and was least offended by this. In fact, I think this film should be shown in the police department throughout Mexico. The sad truth is that our police system is as rotten as a 3-month-old corpse. It annoys me to read the news, like murderers, kidnappers and other slimes are released, paying a ridiculous penalty, or live like kings in prison cells. We must have someone like Chrisy, the character of Denzel Washington. The bodyguard became a vengeful vigil. Kidnapping thrives here (at least in big cities). In fact, I would like to see the same fate in the real life of the kidnappers as that of Chrisy, whom he coped with. That would be so wonderful (Sorry, Iâ€™m offended THIS!). MAN ON FIRE is an exciting movie not to be missed. Some of you may find it difficult if you are not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do it ALL the time while watching American films), but the effort is worth it. Part of the editing is a bit fuzzy ... sort of like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant look at the corruption of Mexico). The film begins a little slow, but in the second half its pace increases dramatically. I swear you'll applaud as you watch Denzel Washington send the infidels. His performance is nothing short of great. The ending (without spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you will like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films of the year. "Must own" for the DVD collection! 9 * out of 10
