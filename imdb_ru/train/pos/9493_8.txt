The White Fire does so much for this. With Larry Byrd, similar to Robert Jinty, who heads the attack with incredible hair and super macho mustache, the film takes off over other low-budget actors. The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a puck. When Jinty beats everyone, the movie becomes awesome when the story of diamond intrigue comes into play. Then add Fred Williamson, a bit of a frontal hive, a chainsaw attack and some amazing incest threads ... This click ultimately delivers on all cylinders. If you are looking for some amazing B-Action, then here it is. Now, if I can get this soundtrack.
