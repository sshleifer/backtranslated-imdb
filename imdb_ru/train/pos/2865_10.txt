America personified the feat of being the richest calf country with big ambitions, unlimited potential and a very comfortable economy !! After a big Sunday dinner, why not sit down and watch "Bonanza", IN COLOR !!! This home western is reminiscent of the American tradition that accompanies the complacency of a typical American household in the era when it was considered. The fascinating cinematography of Lake Tahoe symbolized the endless prosperity of the new American culture !! Western films were so popular that Western television shows followed suit! It was a period of time in our country, which yearned for a brief understanding of our country's struggle for survival !! The end result of the trials and tribulations on the Ponderos Ranch, shown in this series, has caused the realization that Americans are currently enjoying the benefits of Cartwright's hard work !! <br /> <br /> The Bonanza television show was popular for many different reasons, mainly due to the fact that in the late fifties and early sixties there was still no separation of two different cultural settings that were ready to surface with our a nation! The unification of ideologies in the United States, which prevailed during the debut of "Bonanza", was a big reason for the success of the show !! In later years, the show "Bonanza" established a strong audience for the television market !! "Bonanza" ohv Tilo camaraderie for an all-American idealist !!
