Dig the ground! I would tell anyone, even if you don’t like it when Metallica sees “some kind of monster,” this is a spine-type documentary about one of the largest groups in the world that behaves like mental children during some kind of breakdown. It is fun and exciting. In the same spirit goes to dig! The film is about two "Portland" groups "Dandy Warhol" and "Slaughter of Brian Johnstown", starting a kind of musical scene in his hometown only for one of the groups to become huge, and the other to fall into the history of music books. From the very beginning, the two groups are pulled in opposite directions only because of their ability to make decisions, good or bad. Filmed in seven years, and sometimes it hurts to see how we see the dandy’s skyrocketing glory (thanks to Vodaphone commercials!) And the spontaneous fall of Jonestown from the instigators of the scene to the arguing imitators. As the groups become more fragmented, the friendship becomes tense and in some moments it enters into disputes and even in fights on stage. All this is half funny, half tragic, and to believe it or not is perverted observation. As I said at the beginning, you can watch the movie Metallica, even if you are not interested in the group. Dig the ground! on the other hand, it is slightly different and more pleasant, and it is much easier to look at if you have an interest in any group. Nevertheless, a good film and more evidence that he is not in a group than promoting a career. Dig the ground! This is a crazy ride on the tails of a rock and roll coat and a great example of the traps and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous.
