After Watergate, several conspiracy films appeared, such as this one, written by the late Adam Kennedy (based on his novel). <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays former Vietnamese veteran Roy Tucker, a loser who is imprisoned. He receives visits from Marvin Tagge (Richard Widmark), who claims to be an organization created to assist unlawfully convicted persons. They offer him freedom, and, despite Tagge’s distrust, he accepts. But he led a cellmate named Spivent (Mickey Rooney). That is why it is difficult to understand, since Spiventa is an annoying little man who makes Tucker crazy about talking about sex all the time, not what you want to hear while in jail. <br /> <br /> Tagge's benefactors kill Spivent before Tucker surprised eyes. Reunited with his wife Ellie (Candice Bergen) and getting a new identity (oddly, he is not trying to change his appearance. Removing these damp mustaches would be the beginning), he calms down, but finds that there is a catch - Tagge wants Tucker to do no less than the assassination of the President of the United States. He refuses, so Tagge kidnapped Ellie ... <br /> <br /> I'll leave a quick review here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest. There are enough holes in the script from the plot so that you want to read the book (this is not bad!). The people that Tagge represents are never revealed. The hints about the murder of JFK are obvious. Despite the findings of the Warren Commission, doubts as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, remain to this day. <br /> <br /> This was the first Stanley Kramer film in recent years, and although it does not exist in Turkey, it lacks power. say, the “Manchurian Candidate” by John Frankenheimer or “The View of Parallax” by Alan J. Pakul. Being a film of the left conspiracy, he seeks to circumvent the subject, rather than deal with it. I myself prefer the right - they are funnier! Domino has an appearance created for T.V. the film, which boasts of what should be the easiest jailbreak in cinema history, not to mention the finale, filmed in Michael Kane's classic movie Get Carter. <br /> <br /> What makes it watchable is Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, who unfortunately passed away at the beginning of this year, is magnificent as the mysterious Tagge, who initially seems to be behind the operation until he, too, is ruthlessly destroyed, starting a chain of deaths designed to remove all traces of evidence as one after another. the perpetrators of this evil conspiracy fall - just like dominoes. Like Tucker, the innocent pawn, Hackman is amazing. You should be surprised, though, why he decided to hide in such an obvious place. In his skin, I would have fled to the other end of the world, somewhere to run away from these fanatics. Hackman and Bergen's love scenes slow down the plot, and it's almost a relief when they catch her. Presumably, the producers also thought so, which explains why it starts with a strange prologue setting forth the entire premise of the film - voiced by British actor Patrick Allen - warning viewers that “they” are there and that “they” want us. Comedian Les Dawson later faked this discovery in his B.B.C. the show "Dawson Watch". <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney had previously worked with Kramer on the film “It's a Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy World.” His scene of "death" here resembles an excerpt from this picture, where the actor looks as if he was stung by a wasp, and not shot. <br /> <br /> Films about conspiracy were made only by the left, but now the right comes into action too. Last year, “Taking Freedom,” an absurd mixture of lies and half-truths about Tony Blair’s government, turned out to be the British response to Reefer Madness. At least Domino had the beautiful Candice Bergen. The best Chris Atkins movie he could offer was Ann Widdecomb! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the Domino Principle was filmed by Sir Lew Grade, the legendary British television magnate in the film Saint, Jesus of Nazareth. and "Muppets". In 1980, he again worked with Adam Kennedy on “Raise The Titanic!”, The failure of which was so great that it destroyed Grade's ambitions to become the new Louis B. Meier. Being somewhat open-minded, I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.
