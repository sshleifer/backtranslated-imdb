This should be one of the best comedies on television at the moment. It takes the sweet-sweet idea of ​​a show revolving around a close family, and turns it into a rather realistic, but funny image of a typical family, which includes quarrels with siblings, brothers-offspring, fathers-protectors and bimbo sisters. I am almost surprised that this is Disney! <br /> <br /> To the credit of "8 simple rules" he knows that this is a comedy, and does not try to become something more. Too many shows (for example, Sister, Sister and Lizzy McGuire) are thought only because their main characters are now teenagers, so they have to tackle social problems and end up losing their humor while being too tough. The “8 simple rules” trap was avoided; it does solve some problems (for example, being a school outcast), but it's fun. In fact, the only time when it really was serious was understandable when he was sensitive to the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think, although John Ritter will be sad to be bored, as he was the cause Shaw left his mark, “8 Simple Rules” can still succeed if it remembers its humor and does not make Kate's father second version of Paul Hennessy.
