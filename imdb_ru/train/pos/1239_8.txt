I think the film was pretty good, add it to my “classic collection” after all this time. I think I saw other posters that reminded some piquant people that it was still just a film. Some of the more esoteric moments may not be "logic", but many religious questions, taken "by faith", are not tested for smell. If you are going to accept any faith to which you are subscribed, you can certainly accept the film. It was just me or someone else who noticed that Dagger Aji-Yi was the same obsessed knife with which Lamont Cranston was so hard to get control of Shadow. There is no mention of this in the trivia section for any movie here (IMDB), but I would put a dollar on a donut, this is the same prop.
