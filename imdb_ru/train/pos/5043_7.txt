A very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. Very dark thriller, which really made, recommended by Stephen King. This is a strong, well-thought-out horror story about a devout, but insane man in Thurman, Texas, who performs suicidal after receiving God's order to destroy the demons who are trying to control humanity. A couple of plot twists and a terrible ending make for your money. You really don't see much of the violence, but still enough to double the belly. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays a perverted person called the Assassin of the Hand of God. Matthew McConaughey is just as impressive as the eldest son of a madman who tells this story to an FBI agent in Dallas (Powers Bute). Booth, as always, is solid and flawless. Suspended white fist! Highly recommended.
