While Spiderwoman's Kiss appointed Raul Julia to political prisoners in an unknown Latin American country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country. In particular, the dictator suddenly falls dead, so Julia replaces the president with a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfus), shooting a film in the country. From there, Dreyfus must figure out how to be a dictator, constantly balancing him with his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into a comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" copes well with this. No matter what they do in this film, they cope. It just shows why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era, and what we lost when Raoul Julia died. Definitely worth a look. Also starring Sonya Braga (who starred with Raul Julia in TKOTSW), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is hot.
