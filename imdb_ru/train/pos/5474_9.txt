On July 10, 2005, the National Art Gallery demonstrated the long-lost original version of this film. She recovers the vital scenes shot by the censors after the release. The character of the shoemaker, the moral good-natured man in the original censorship of 1933, is presented here as a follower of the philosopher Nice and urges her to use men to scrape her way to the top. In addition, the banal ending of the original, which I assume is in current versions of VHS, has been eliminated, and the ending has been restored to its original form. A wonderful film of seduction and power. We hope that this film will be re-released on DVD, so that everyone can appreciate its excellent qualities. Look for it.
