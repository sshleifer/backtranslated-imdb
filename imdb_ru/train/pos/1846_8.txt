When I first read the plot of this drama, I assumed that it would be like “Sex and the City”, but this drama is not at all like that. The stories of the characters seem more real, and you understand the situation more. The idea of ​​drama is similar: four 30 women lead us through friendship and relationships with problems and struggles along the way. Kathy, the therapist, a dark and thoughtful character with whom you find it difficult to communicate, and she is Trudy's best friend, widows. The character of Trudy warms the heart, as you may face the difficulties she faces, as well as the fact that she is the only mother of four. Jessica is very party girl and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a pleasant character and is closest to newly married Shiobhan, who, although he loves her husband completely, cannot take her eyes off her colleague. Everywhere, drama is an amazing addiction, and if the BBC continues to film the show, it can work well. This is not similar to other female dramas, such as “Sex and the City” or “Desperate Housewives”. This, if played correctly, can become the next cold foot. Plus, the male role is also not bad before the eyes.
