Old people show ???? I am 15 years old, and I’ve been watching a show since I’m 12, recording it every day on my Sky + box from Hallmark and BBC 1. I would really like them not to cancel it, they didn’t even say goodbye. But what an adventure, all these episodes, I think I saw them all, and no one comes to mind that I did not like and did not like. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the BBC is constantly exchanging diagnoses for Murder and “The Murder She Wrote” - never looked at him and didn’t intend to. In any case, his characters in “Diagnoses Murder” are so deep that the chemistry between the actors is amazing. It was a really sad day when they canceled this show ........
