I'm tired of people who rate movies by their “historical authenticity.” THIS CINEMA PEOPLE !! Writers and directors should contribute to the story! There are a number of films that are not entirely accurate in history ... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: American Legend, The Last of the Mohicans ... all fantastic films that have been slightly inaccurate historically. If you want some great actors to do what they do best, then I advise you to watch this movie and not worry about the credibility of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the film, the plot and one of the greatest actors of our time.
