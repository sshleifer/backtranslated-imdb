Being a transplanted resident of New York, I might be more critical in monitoring the city hall. But I have to say that even before I started the story itself, I was fascinated by the shooting of the locations and the political atmosphere of New York, created by director Harold Becker. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a link to the Woarner Restaurant. in Brooklyn, where political boss Frank Anselmo loves to eat. When I lived in New York in 1996, there was or was a Worner restaurant on Remsen Street in the center of Brooklyn. In fact, this was particularly favored by political people in the town, although they had a couple of other parties. <br /> Not surprisingly, because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pilegi, who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere well, and he knows exactly how the two worlds intersect, as in this film. <br /> <br /> Detective performed by Nestor Serrano goes to an informal meeting with Mafia boss Anthony Francios and everything happens and three people die, including an innocent 6-year-old boy whose father took him to school. The story unfolds, and in the end it reached the city hall itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays mayor John Pappas, and John Cusack his deputy, mayor of Louisiana, in which there is a tradition of self-proclaimed corruption. He is an outsider here, and trying to control the damage, Cusack finds more than he expected, <br /> <br /> Danny Eiello plays the Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo, and for those of you who are not from New York, his character is based about the late President Queens Donald Mans, who was also shot down by scandal. He is very similar to those Brooklyn politicians I knew in those days whose friendship with organized crime and the services provided to them helped Aiello. <br /> <br /> City Hall was a farewell film for Anthony Franzioza, one of them. of the most underrated and undervalued talents ever on screen. No one is watching anyone else when he is. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino's best moment is when he takes over the proceedings at the funeral of a killed little child and turns him into a political triumph for himself. He has a difficult part, he is a decent enough person, but he is passionate about the corruption that is required to rise in a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple, the mayorâ€™s office is highly recommended.
