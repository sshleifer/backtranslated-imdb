Original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how the sequel would work, given that they did not use any of the original characters. I was very surprised at how this ended. As a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with some exceptions. Despite the fact that this film was not great, the author succeeded in preserving the main themes and knowledge about vampires from the first measure. Jon Bon Jovi was originally a flaw, but he turned out to be a half decent Killer. I doubt that anyone could beat James Wood's performance in the first, though ... if you donâ€™t bring Buffy! <br /> <br /> In general, it was a decent watch, and I would watch it again. <Br /> <br /> I have two questions left, however ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a murderer? I think we just have to leave it to the imagination.
