This film is one of my favorites of all time. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gung Dean. Drama, action, adventure and comedy - all in one. The final battle scene, to this day and today, makes me chill, and the final always leaves me in tears. If you have not seen, I highly recommend it.
