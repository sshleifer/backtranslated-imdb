I would not say that this is a bad film; in fact, this is quite typical for a film that was produced by the “poor” studios at the time. Filmed for the Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in his role as a few mad doctor-scientist, disguised as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and his henchmen have an unpleasant habit of stealing young brides and, after their death, inject Bela’s wife a serum taken from their bodies to preserve her youth. Lugosi has more than coped with the task of creating this pleasant film, however, the film suffers from an ultra-wooden game with the stars Luana Walters and Tristram the Sepulcher. The coffin (a good name for a guy in a horror movie) is especially bad in this case. I have seen him in numerous films and TV shows, and he is always the same; tough, wooden and completely unconvincing. Miss Walters is only slightly better, but she lacks acting talent to make her role believable. Nevertheless, the viewer can enjoy the great game of Lugosi, playing another vile scheme, which only will be thwarted at the end! Despite the bad game of some, “The Corpse Disappears” is a pleasant film for everyone.
