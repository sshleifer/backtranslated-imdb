My mother took me with her to watch this film, and I dream to watch it every year, like all my other Christmas pets. Most of all I remember the stupid Devil and Santa watching through his telescope. I waited and looked through the T.V. every year thereafter to see when it will be shown. I usually find it playing on a Saturday afternoon. I found the film in English only, which extracted something special from the film and really wanted to find a copy of it in Spanish. I think this film is dear to my heart and has never suffered from nightmares, as others might suggest. Yes, this is another Santa Claus film, and this is what makes it special and unique. I can't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children when I explain my favorite parts and memories to them !!
