I think this is a good movie; I think this is a very Romanian film through the scenery and the atmosphere; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is the result, not the goal); I think it is very natural; I think it is humane; I think it was interesting; I think that the actors never made me think ... inappropriate actors (they are not Sean Konnori and others), nor is the film a blockbuster, they look like a film ... an ordinary person who can act ...; I think the film has reached its intention; I think it made me feel things (or feel them again :)); I think that I am not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... what I know.
