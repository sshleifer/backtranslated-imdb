Who would have thought that Andy Griffith’s Helen Crump (Aneta Corso) had a film about Steve McQueen in her past? But this is only one of several strange and surprising things in the movie about teenagers-combat creatures of the 1950s, which can best be described as “Rebel Without a Cause” and “God Knows What From Space.” The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who will soon decide that “Steve” sounds less decent), a good boy, wild enough to be interesting; A very helpful, but understanding girl is the aforementioned Aneta Corso. It was bad enough when their date was interrupted by teenage hot crooks, but they are much more confused when they are confronted with a gelatinous, “What is it” man who descends to earth on his own hot meteor - and begins to eat left. But will an adult believe them? Of course not, that they know, they are just children! <br /> <br /> The movie is a tiny fool in its best tiny movie. The actors take the rather pretentious scenario very seriously, with each other’s many spiritual eyes, and the “adult” cast probably says “Children!” The very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film is its creation, which is well thought out, well executed, and often manages to generate an amazing degree of tension. And although they are obviously cheap (look at these miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a pretty well-made film - and this good catchy theme song is added for good measure. A crowd of more than 40 (including me) will enjoy the film as nostalgia, but this will not prevent them from thundering right along with the younger set in its 1950s sensitivity from whole milk and white bread, and the film will be an excellent choice for a family movie evening. or for more sophisticated "adults only". Make a lot of jelly cubes for a snack at the movies! Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
