Since I saw it for the first time, “Piedras” is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures that I really could see again and again. The magnificent script depicts the life of a group of women (all of them are somehow connected) with a deep understanding and sensuality. Ramon Salazar made an impressive film in his directorial debut, and established himself as an effective acting director. <br /> <br /> Not that all the performances were great. Among all the leading women, they range from medium (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the applause should be directed to newcomer Monica Server, who convincingly plays backward daughter Antonia San Juan. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as a girl’s nurse, and there are lovely little turns from Andres Gertrudiks, Geli Albaladejo and the director Ramon Salazar himself. <br /> <br /> “Piedras” is beautifully written and filmed, when Watching it, I was so moved that I could not stop thinking about it for several days. I highly recommend it.
