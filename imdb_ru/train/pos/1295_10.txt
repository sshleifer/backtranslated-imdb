The book on which this film is based was excellent; it took some time to deal with the unconventional style of Welbeck, but as soon as I understood the mood of the written, I completely plunged into the sad world of the author. In fact, no other book has affected me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing â€” it clarified my personal struggles and made it harder to accept the futility of my own struggles. The ideas of Elbeck are masterfully captured by Harel, and the apathy and indifference of the hero to the world that rejected him are beautifully depicted. This is a film that shows modern society for a humble man in all his horror. We hope that in the future everything will change, but for now we have to accept the rat race, as shown in this film. It is probably better that Harel or Welbeck not create a brilliant work like this. One is enough for any man.
