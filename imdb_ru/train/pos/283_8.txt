“Days” is a typical family drama with a small catch - you have to treat your character's emotions in all possible ways in order to truly appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [Possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the series] <br /> <br /> It is obvious that for everyone who watched the show, the story is the world of Cooper Day, the average child in the family. He records his days with his family and hopes one day to become a rich and famous writer through his observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a beautiful sister, and a genius younger brother. The first episode, which will sound a little silly since John Scott Shepard created this situation - both the sister and the mother become pregnant. This is the first situation in which the writer falls. Then the father quits his job in a law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The middle child gets into a fight with a sister's boyfriend. It is all in the work of the day. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I dont know. It's a little silly, but I like it. At first I thought that the camera work was fiery, but then I got used to it and began to like her. I liked quiet conversations in dark light. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low budget style. I liked the game. I admire the story. Then I discovered that I want the second season of The Days. I slowly became a fan of this, since the transfer of 6 episodes on ABC came to an end. This is a really good show, and it is not at all like OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope the fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can be related to Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper, or even Nate, you will love this show. Lot.
