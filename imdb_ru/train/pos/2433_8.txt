I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic cartoon "Ghost of a Friendly Casper." I thought it was an early incident, since Casper didn’t look * right *, just like Porky Pig doesn’t look * right * in old cartoons of the 1930s. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> In any case, this episode from the afterlife of a friendly ghost concerns his girlfriend with a young fox Todd, whom he calls Ferdi. I remember being happy to see that Casper has a friend, because those who watched cartoons do not know that most people run away from him, shouting “Ghost!” <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdi will have fun together, until someone else appears ... I don't want to leave you with a half-spoiler, but the cartoon only lasts seven minutes, so you can't be too ambiguous. In addition, anyone who reads a brief review of the IMDb cartoon can conclude what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> The final is a bit heartbreaking. Actually, this is probably the saddest thing I've ever felt when watching a cartoon. But this only means that it touched me, which probably explains why I decided to write a commentary on this particular cartoon, and not very many others. Or, damn it, the fact that I actually remember this cartoon is related to its emotional impact on me - since then I have not seen it. But the cartoon ends on a raised note, and I was glad to see Casper and Ferdi happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second place after the cartoon Warner Bros. "Peace on Earth" is the biggest thing I've ever been touched by an animated short film.
