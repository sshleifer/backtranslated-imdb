Beautifully filmed, well-played, intense script of an unknown film. Had me at the edge of my seat. I really liked the lead actress, and I thought the villain was very well made. Not so much to chew on here in the sense of the topic, but if you just sit in your seat, turn off your brain, see how the fantastic camera works, and enjoy the story, you will have a great time. The plot is well thought out, and ordinary movie buffs will probably know more or less what to expect in about ten minutes. But that didn't bother me, since I liked watching it unfold. In the old days, they might not have focused so much on two characters, and there were some tempting moments when I hoped they would allow some other people to have a few lines. But these people were probably right to keep the film so tightly focused. The plot quite early grabbed my throat and never let go. Do not think too much during or after the movie. as i'm not sure that it makes a lot of sense. Just sit down and enjoy.
