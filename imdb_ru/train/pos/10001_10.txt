The brilliant actor Lesley Ann Warren. The best dramatic tramp lady I've ever seen, and love scenes in a stock of clothing are second to none. Corn on the face is a classic, as good as everything in Blazing Saddles. Taking lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a defector, selling his boss and dishonest, attorney Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently: “I am a lawyer,” he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from Larry Sanders' later show, is also fantastic here, like a mad millionaire who wants to destroy the ghetto. His character is more evil than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where the homeless are invading the demolition site is a classic for all time. Look for the scene of the legs and two big diggers fighting (one bleeding out). This film gets better every time I see it (which is quite often).
