I love this film. This is a great film that combines English and Indian culture with feminist-type problems, such as girls who want to play sports that were previously intended only for men. This shows the struggle of both Indians who want to go beyond their cultural barriers, and women who want to go beyond the gender constraints that exist in sports, especially in England at that time. I feel that the cultural struggle is more stressed than other issues. <br /> <br /> Unlike any other commentary, I donâ€™t think this film is something like Dirty Dancing or any other similar film. This step is loved by many people, men and women, young and old.
