The famous conductor decides, after a heart attack, to return to the village where he was born to live a quiet life. There he comes in Dutch with a local church choir that will change his life. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this film yesterday, I had no expectations; I like to watch foreign films that are not English, and I have already seen a couple of Swedish films in my life, but this one has so far been the best. <br /> <br /> How to start? In my opinion, this film is a jewel, thanks to many things, one of which is an outstanding acting game. Michael Nyquist is beautiful as the thoughtful, almost shy and devoted conductor Daniel Dareus. The beautiful Frida Hallgren fascinates with her sweet smile and subtle play. All members of the choir are well developed, interesting characters with their own history. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story, a beautiful story about music, love, pain, memories, death, a man who devoted his life to music, and who tries to create a peaceful existence in the village where he was born, trying to reconcile with the past and with how his life was before that time. Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedes are outstanding filmmakers. Go see what I think is a film that makes you think about life and love, and in a sense it is comforting.
