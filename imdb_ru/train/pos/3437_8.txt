Some genre films need to dress up. This one was an exception. Taken by itself, this is a stripped-down version of a horror movie. With minimal special effects, it can be a kind of psychological research, with a simple but existential topic - who gets on the bus and why? This is not a very good film, but because there is little invented in it, the story works. Subtle and all about character interactions. In fact, there is one trick in the opening scenes, but perhaps it was placed there to simply set the tone for things to come. I really appreciate the balance of male and female energy and do not recommend this story to anyone who is interested in something more than people who respond to physical and psychological problems. You will love the film if you feel sympathy, appreciate the need for adventure in your life and ask yourself: “What would I do in this situation?”
