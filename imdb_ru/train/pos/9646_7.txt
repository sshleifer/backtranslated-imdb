Of course, there are emotions between the two main characters when they explore their relationship - one of them is based on physical attraction from the very beginning. In addition, in the inner workings of the Mathieu family there are emotions associated with the problems of his mother, and how this affects their relationships. But the problem is that many things remain unanswered (if only I am not too dumb to understand them). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the parting of the boys? At first, backwards, it is a bit difficult between the present and the past. It seems that the main reason for the rental of this film is to enjoy homoerotic vicarious sensations or naked men. But, like a love story or a study of character, it is insufficient and unsatisfactory.
