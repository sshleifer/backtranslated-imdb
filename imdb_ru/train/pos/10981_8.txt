Hey, now, truly, TheatreX, found this when digging into a video at a flea market, almost in a new condition, and reading the back of the box, I saw that it was a kind of "cult strike", so of course he came home with me. <br /> <br /> What a weird movie. Aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this crumbling 28-room house on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and live in the same house as raccoons, cats, fleas (ay!) And who knows what else. One day Suffolk Co. was everywhere to live in the mud, and Jackie herself came to fix it. In any case, this is one strange couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Eddie (daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings and gives a little towards the camera, which rarely makes sense. Big Edie (mother, 79 years old) obviously loves to run naked, and although we do get clues about how this might look, fortunately, it was tasteful (?) To such an extent that we, fortunately , spared from this. These women talk, talk and talk mostly about the past, and it makes little sense except for them. They live in absolute dirt, the cats go about their business anywhere ("Look, this cat goes to the bathroom for my portrait!"), And one bedroom seems to be their center of activity. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice, it reminds me very much of my late aunt, who was from that part of the country and had an emphasis on lawn Gayland. In one scene, Little Edie puts on a flea repellent, fine, you can see all the cats scratching all the time, so the place should be infected. The box calls these two women “eccentric,” and I must say that in this case it’s just a euphemism for “killed by their pumpkins,” but this film is not without moments when you really feel something for them. It is equally creepy, sad and disgusting, but I could not stop watching as I began. This is not my "normal" type of film, but I found it somewhat interesting. It will not be for everyone, though, guaranteed.
