The third and final issue of the "Hunzo-razor" is the most specific of all. "Training" even ends during the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details the investigation of Hanzo Shark, conducted on the orders of blind monks. He also makes a historical commentary on the proud refusal of old Japan from the introduction of Western technologies. While Hanzo's first film was just a fun and bloody journey with a bit of connection with his plot, Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold manages to connect everything, and eventually it all comes back home. Definitely a perfect ending. Oh yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and a lot of useless blood and violence (after all, it's * Hanzo-razor).
