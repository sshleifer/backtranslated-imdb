This is one of the unusual cases when the film and the novel on which it is based are great. Perhaps this is because Gorris takes Nabokov's original ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is the point of view on Luzhin, who is more worthy of him than on Nabokov. <br /> <br /> The only thing I donâ€™t like in the film is the influence of Valentinov on the fate of Luzhin. I can not imagine that Nabokov created such a person as Valentinov, and had a great influence on the argument of the novel.
