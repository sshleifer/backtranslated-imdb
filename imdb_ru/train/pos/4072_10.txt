The name Hayao Miyazaki became famous with Spitied Away, but what is often overlooked is the director’s first effort. Who remembers that Spielberg directed the duel, or did George Lucas lead the THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this film - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the late 80s, and what struck me was the visual pomp of the design and animation. Therefore, when I found a copy in a famous store for 9 pounds, I could not resist, but bought it. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the film do not coincide with my memory of it (so funny is the memory). <br /> <br /> Watching this movie with all of the knowledge gained about the artists ’portfolio is how very similar to Jean 'Mobius' Giraud some of the works of art are. I can only suggest some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), his adventure really begins - the search for Laputa - a reference to the missed part of Jonathan Swift in Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne, this is the main film, “Harassment is good against bad,” and in the last part the characters end up in Lapute. <br /> <br /> This is the strongest part in my memory - the “pastoral” environmental aspect of Laputa has returned to nature - many robots covered with moss under a giant tree. This, in my opinion, the main point of the film is the view of the surface of Laputa, in contrast to the mechanized underground. <br /> <br /> Although this is the dichotomy of this film - to show that even technology cannot conquer nature - the irony of the last robot caring for the garden and the animals. The end of the movie "Silent Running" is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> This is incredibly stylish, I would not even say “smoothly” - very beautiful and organic, with a huge amount of detail in buildings, on airships, and the design and appearance of almost everything. <br /> <br /> Mizaki is a true master of this type of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and cherish it.
