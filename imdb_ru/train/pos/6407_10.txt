I went to this film at the cast of the actors and the film crew, because my friend, the producer of the film, invited me. Forget what you saw in commercials, forget what you heard, watch this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised by this. In the world of "Grinch", "Charlie's Angels", "6th day, unbreakable," comes out a film that is worth your hard-earned dollars! Great scenes, great cinematography and the cast you want to eat with all your heart. I found this to be one of the most organized films of the year, and for good reason. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar. If you could give an Oscar to everyone who participates as a package, it would be a film.
