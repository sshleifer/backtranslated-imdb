This is my favorite of the old cartoons of Tom and Jerry of the early 40s. The original version from Mammy Two Shoes is presented in the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set (the first disc) and features beautifully detailed animations of early cartoons. The gags on this are not all Avery crazy style, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who ever went to bed late, watching scary movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to an eerie radio show, and Jerry decides to play a few tricks to scare him. The nine lives gag here is well made, and I donâ€™t know how many times I tried to create a vacuum and a sheet that were scary when I was a kid. When the owner Tom woke up the noise - Mom was NOT a maid, it was HIS house - she got one surprise, with a lot of laughter. Prepare the pause button, it's worth it!
