My Take: A funny look at the Lion King, posing as a sequel. Surprisingly funny. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is another fun video worth theater work. I don’t understand why Disney released it right on the video, and theatrically releases trashy films such as Chicken and Returning to Neverland. These films are best viewed in video stores (in the “new release” area), rather than seeing their theater posters outside cinemas. <br /> <br /> This film is only a parody of the first film (although the events in Simba's Pride have not yet occurred), from the point of view of Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumba (voiced by Ernie Sabella). We see them laughing at the events in the first movie. The original voices from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their voicing roles from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give funny comedic relief when Mother of Timon and nasty uncle. /> <br /> So isn't it fun? Maybe not now, but see for yourself. The fact that it is not so serious in its plot makes it more pleasant. This is similar to MST3000 with Timon and Pumba. <br /> <br /> Video Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
