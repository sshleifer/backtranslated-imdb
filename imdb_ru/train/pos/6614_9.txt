I read that it is not very good, that this story is not reliable, that Volkman feels that he somehow failed. <br /> <br /> I disagree. First, it is well executed. Volckman succeeds in not only trying out new techniques, but also focusing on what to think about: will the value of life reduce immortality? The big question ... <br /> <br /> I see that he is struggling to create a feeling, and he does not compromise. This is to be welcomed. I am sure that this was an interesting exercise for building characters in this form. I have seen artists reduce shape to a minimum in order to create the intensity of the moment. I identify this film with this. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is much more interesting than Richard Linklater’s roto-review, and the Volkman story is more important than Linklater’s later stories about wasted lives on drugs. Old news. Everyone knows this, but no one does anything. The Renaissance can offer something new, something new, something to think about. And there are many more stories with lots of holes that are much better. <br /> <br /> Great, Volkman. Really good job.
