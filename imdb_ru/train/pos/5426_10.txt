It's about time Gunga Din is released on DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I watched this beautiful film, but I never get tired of it. The main actors worked so well together. Victor McLaughlan (Sergeant McChesney), Cary Grant (Sergeant Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Sergeant Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I just can't survive their exploits in India. Your first look at the "Sergeants Three", when you see how they fight with other soldiers on the so-called treasure map. Three sergeants go on an expedition to find out what happened to the line of communication, and they get into an almost deserted city - or so they think. <br /> <br /> They are doing the necessary repairs and will soon find a few "residents" hiding. Soon after they were attacked by a group of madmen, and they barely fled back to base. <br /> <br /> Later they are sent to another mission, which gives Sergeant Catter a chance to go in search of Gold with Dean. They find the golden temple and fall into the trap of evil Kali supporters. Dean is sent for help, and Cutter is captured. Soon McChesney and Ballentin arrive with Dean, and they are too captured. <br /> <br /> In the face of the killing, they helplessly watch their regiment come to save them. The villains are watching and are going to make a surprise attack when the wounded Dean climbs on the golden dome and blows on his forge, which then warns the British about the ambush. In this case, Dina was shot. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attack the evil and soon defeat them. In the end, Dean was honored because he became an honorary corporal in the British army.
