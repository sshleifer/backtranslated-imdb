This movie is great. I found it very interesting. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty cool. The acting was also great, as were the costumes, the staging, the photography, the direction and the script. <br /> <br /> A very happy family on vacation is in the wilderness after they hit a deer. Then the huntsman appears and is very angry and outraged that one of the deer's horns is broken. Then he begins to stalk the family, and strange things start happening to them. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It's worth it. Glory to the actors, film crew and directors. Two thumbs up!
