Another one for the crowd of Babes & Bullets. This story is much sharper than any other musical I’ve seen: the guns hide the missing parts of the females and put each of them into the other in such a way that it approaches the intellectual comment than we might expect from the locale. More effective than the modern "drama". It is difficult to identify with a woman who holds a gun in his pants - due to lack of space. Very nice if you take into account the context. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that 90% of surprises give a gun on his feet, this film also tells how greed surpasses all other considerations in the life of a yakuz group pursuing a goal. a woman who holds a hidden gun / rocket launcher on her leg (hence there are no group showers or thongs). Hidden projectile, which is pulled out from behind the main characters back, apparently from nowhere, in miike Dead or Alive (1999)), the Torch created by the hero near the end of the original film “Tom” (2000), or the heartbreaking flamethrower scene in Sunny Gats Blue (1992) - all this testifies to the almost third world Cantinflas-Esquire influence in modern Japanese cinema, which I find it difficult to explain, but I cannot complain. <br /> <br /> You will not see the quality films of this entity, made in Hollywood. cheap shit they pump out for cheap thrills, almost ridiculous This is a real movie, and despite the fact that it is great in its entirety, the finale is a brilliant, if not sloppy, plagiarism of some of the pictures of Sergio Leon with guns there, where feet should be, and definitely appropriate!
