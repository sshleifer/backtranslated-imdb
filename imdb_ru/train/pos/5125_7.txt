I called the bar, expecting it to be a hot beer on a hot day in Texas, but I was pleasantly surprised. After suffering because of the “Nonsense of Saturday night,” I had no desire to see the remake in some southern Texas animal farm ... and I did not. John Revolt was good as a jealous countryman, Scott Glenn was good at being a former gangster, and Debra Winger was, as always, delighted. * I love this woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this is from a guy who can't stand the sound of country music]. A very funny movie.
