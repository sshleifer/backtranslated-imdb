I never bothered to watch this movie in cinemas, although I remember hearing that name again and again. I finally watched it this week and what a delight. For some reason, I expected it would not be very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stuck with him, and then I was completely embroiled. I read a lot of other user comments, and it impressed me how many people are talking about her fight in the ring, but what was surprising in Diana was that she was a real fighter in life. All she needs to do is find her place, where she will be, who she is, and the ring helps her get there. Very intelligent story, and I am amazed that this is the first time for Michelle Rodriguez - what a wonderful job she has done. Adrian and her coach were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit rude, but in any case does not matter. The story, the will and the actions completely outweigh any shortcomings (which usually go with indie-filmmaking in any case). The irresistible image of a girl who is triumphant over her circumstances, and K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
