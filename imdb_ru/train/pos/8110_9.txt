Amazing effects for the movie of this time. A textbook on the futility of war and how war itself becomes a teacher. <br /> <br /> What is surprising about this film is that it became public and is available on archive.org. No charge, no registration required. Watch it in one go and you'll be on the move. <br /> <br /> I plan to share this film with as many people as possible, whom I have never heard of before, and I am a fan of science fiction. <br /> I would like to see how others react to this film. <br /> <br /> Watch it. <br /> <br /> Rate it. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think.
