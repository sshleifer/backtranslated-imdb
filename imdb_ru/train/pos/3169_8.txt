I rented it a few years ago, there was only VHS in the video store. Directly to the video, everything went on as usual (you know where the same fonts and color schemes of successful films are used on the covers of the boxes). I did not know what to expect, except what was printed. The first thing I thought while watching was, “What the hell is wrong with the sound?” - Obviously, there was no duplication of dialogue. The words echoed, so I stopped chewing on what I should have paid closer attention to - note that there is no Shakespeare here! Just talk. The story is quite simple, the boy meets a girl, etc. What struck me was the fact that the people in the film seemed not caricatures written in history, but rather non-actors, temporarily divorced from their real work (uniforms) included) . At the same time, you begin to feel that the director is pursuing, and then you see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people are harming their rank and file using vulgarity, this could not hurt marketing. This was something honest. I thought if they had a bigger budget, it would be better, and I’m sure they looked at it every day, but they did it and they did it. I felt that this was the independence of filmmaking. .. Ha! .. it's funny!
