As a man who never condescended Adam Sandler from the point of view of talent, as is done with him and many such comic actors like him, I entered into "Reign over Me", expecting a good film, not only because of his presence in the film , but also because I thought it looked very good overall. Even the one who already thought that Sandler can create a spectacular dramatic performance writes here, and I was surprised at how fantastic it is in it. He will make you cry, especially in his deliberately unexpected and unexpected monologue. What is surprising in his role is that it’s hard to say this character that we saw before. We saw a lot of emotionally injured characters, a lot of mentally retarded people, a lot of singles, a lot of passionate, selfish artists, but Charlie Fineman Sandler is not one of them. He may have a taste of each of them in some way, but his character is really unpredictable and completely individual. He is glad that the audience is emotionally attracted to them and in every way is pulled up by someone whose problems, thinking and provocations are completely different from the majority of such characters as he. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle offers an interesting performance on a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most normal person in the world, so much so that you can hardly find many of the same characters as his, or at least those who are played the way he plays Alan Johnson, whose name can even be found on the conveyor. The head is great because it is funny, funny, intelligent and stupid, like many normal people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is inhabited by actors and actresses who barely had time to do something in smaller, but rather colorful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is an overly sophisticated middle-class wife, Donald Sutherland is an impatient but surprising judge, and Robert Klein is Sandler's insensitive father-in-law. <br /> <br /> Mike Binder’s script is quite brilliant because he says something quite deep in the wonders of communication in all its manifestations. It is much more subtle than, say, Babel, and has an ideal much closer to home. <br /> <br /> The camera is interested only in the reality of its images, and not in its simple style. This film struck me as a sort of return to the 1970s kitchen sink style. The cinematography was grainy and loose, but that is its beauty. It was not about bringing us to the camera itself, but about the brilliance that would have diluted her stories. <br /> <br /> The music that plays the main role in the film, and its name is very powerful. At the very beginning, you feel that you need another soundtrack for the film “About Schmidt” or “Little Miss Sunshine”, but you soon realize that something more is waiting for you. In fact, the film is filled with a variety of music that stimulates many of the most emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> “Reign Over Me” is an important statement not only for the society, but also for the film itself. This suggests that even the director Blancman can work wonders.
