To stop the deportation of his homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem is that Stella herself is a lesbian. They live differently when, one night after Albertâ€™s birthday, they fall into bed and then in love. Later in the film after falling in love, Stella suspects Albert of fraud and appears at work late at night after closing. What she finds will leave the viewer dazed. This is a great film, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good at their roles that it is surprising that they did not get the best recognition for their work here. Very controversial after its release in 1978, a film with an "R" rating has now become "PG" in this much more liberal time. <br /> <br /> A recently released DVD disc contains the "Making Of" segment. It says that the movie is based on a true story, so viewers who say that the movie is not "real" are wrong. Each person is different, and different people fall in love for different reasons - these are the problems that are explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved!
