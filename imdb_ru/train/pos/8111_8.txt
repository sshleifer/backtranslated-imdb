“Forthcoming deeds” is a truly classic piece of speculative fiction; and an essay about the destructive nature of war and the horrors of progress. This gives surprisingly accurate descriptions of the war, which was to follow several years later, but regrettably naive in its utopian ideals. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwick and Ralph Richardson make up an excellent composition, although the drama plays more like a stage work than a movie. There are grand, albeit somewhat unnatural speeches, often pronounced as if the actor were trying to get to the back of the theater. However, there are some deep words. Is technology a savior of mankind or a tool for its destruction? A film is a visual feast if you can break away from the age of effects. Of course, Hollywood today is more sophisticated, but rarely so resourceful. For the creative imagination, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space guns, gyros and secret organizations of savior scientists. It contains all the ideas of a science fiction adventure, but instead uses attributes for philosophical exercises. <br /> <br /> Things and Metropolis were the hallmarks of Neolithic Hollywood sci-fi movies. They are operatic in size and visually inspiring. Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas are still evolving. There is a mastery with more heart and emotion than a modern movie made on a computer. These films are products of artisans, not industrialists.
