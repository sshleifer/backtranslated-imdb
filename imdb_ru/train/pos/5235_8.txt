The plot does not begin to describe the film: a person is writing a film, more precisely, * this * film. This is completely self-referring to the moment when you think that it will roll itself off like a black hole. The writer writes something, and it happens, or something happens, and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> This is very philosophical, like “The Awakening of Life,” but more Zen-oriented and, in my opinion, much better in my opinion. At some point, people are interviewed "on the street," and then you see how the pictures of these people are taken, and then you discover that their answers are scripted as someone continues to pronounce her lines. Here are beautiful landscapes and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope he will be released on DVD so that I can watch it more closely.
