"What would you do?" This is a question that will remain in your head for several weeks after viewing the emotional Brockdown Palace. It will also be interesting to you whether Alice (Danes) spoke the truth or not - a question that remains unresolved, and rightly so. This is a particularly well made and beautifully made film. Although it is slow from time to time, its tempo reflects the storyline - but in many films you will find yourself on the edge of your place; wanting to know what happens next. The finale will also leave you in imagination as leading characters who are brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Speech by Bill Pullman is also commendable.
