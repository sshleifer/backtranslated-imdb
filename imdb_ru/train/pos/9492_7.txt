This film was enjoyable, but for the wrong reasons. Coordination of the sequence of actions is ridiculous and makes the film have some funny moments of hitting with a stick. Robert Jinty and Fred Williamson, near the end, there is an unforgettable scene where Williamson says to Jinty: “Of course, you go around buddy!”. I liked this film only for Jinty and Williamson, but not for the plot, which must have been written on the back of the napkin in four lines, and the rest were most likely added. A film with more than 30 parts has a credit list of only 10 or so. It seems strange that no one has any merit in the film, maybe they had some idea of ​​what the finished product would look like. There is only one thing in this film: it is rather cruel, so three times with Fred Williamson and Robert Jinty make the film worth seeing.
