In the beginning, this is from England, so, of course, I had a 98% chance that it would be a smart and very good movie. I have never heard of this movie before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself, “Oh! Here is the female version of My left foot. I was right, but I was also wrong. Wrong, because the two films are very different. “My left foot” is a film similar to John Ford, and this film is similar to Chaplin (not because it's funny, but to Chaplin in that wonderful melodrama feeling that causes tears in his eyes.) with a crippled man, and he did it with a great sense of reality. Here, very beautiful Bonham-Carter did the same, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very clever. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the greatest female roles of the 1990s with Emily Lloyd in Breaking the Waves. Gee! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful cinema eyes since Jobina Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michelle Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a real talent, as seen from many other films. See this one, you will not regret it! And very good work Brana too!
