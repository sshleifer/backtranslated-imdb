Although I am not the biggest fan of martial arts films based on wire mesh, when the film is aimed at fantasy rather than fight, I get much more pleasure from it, and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastic scenes and crazy flights. fraud. Ching Siu Tung created here a charming delicacy with excellent performance and incredible beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Chung plays the hero of the tax collector, who spends the night in the haunted temple and enjoys the stunning spirit of the fox and the stupid Taoist. The performance of Cheungs is filled with naive, but worthy charm, and Wu Ma pleasantly surprises him as a Taoist monk who demonstrates some sword playing and even gets a musical number. Perhaps the best of all is Joey Wang, like the spirit of a fox, truly admired to watch with every movement and gesture seductively seductive. The film contains elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, which are all mixed in a constantly interesting package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and managing choreography, provides some neat, thrilling thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows, and terribly fascinating foggy forest colors, giving each forest scene a surprisingly enchanting atmosphere. Also noteworthy are the complex hairstyles and the gorgeous flowing clothes of female characters, with, if Iâ€™m not mistaken, Joey Wan's sporty hair, trimmed like the ears of a fox, with an amazing touch. Although the film has relatively little action and sometimes, perhaps, stupid pop songs, which may have been badly advised, this is great entertainment, with excellent characters and plot, even a strange neat arc, almost constant stock of visual delicacies and a rich dreamy atmosphere, ethereal treasure.
