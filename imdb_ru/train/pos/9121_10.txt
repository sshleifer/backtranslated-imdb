SPOILERS CONTAINING TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION. <br /> <br /> Twenty years later, starting in 1984, this film says a lot about the future of the Prince in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that sums up Prince’s musical outlet for the last 10 years is great: if you took the two best songs from his last 10 albums, you would have one fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene sounds like this. The prince escapes to his dressing room after performing one song, and the club owner enters the dressing room so the prince seriously talks about his fall from grace in the 90s and releases albums that only the most fanatical fans can tolerate. support his artistry. <br /> <br /> Club owner: “You do not pack them as before. The only person who digs your music is yourself! ”<br /> <br /> Ghost, yes! What about the musical underscore, which makes the prince even more angry when he hits Apollonia on the ground in two separate scenes! It made me chill because it's not the only scene where women have mistreated in this film. <br /> <br /> I'm all in a comedy sparring between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, because these two stole every scene they were in. But what was funny about throwing a woman in the trash? It was just nasty! Another unpleasant moment was the chalk painted on the floor by the prince’s father, thoughtfully provided by the Minniapolis police, which caused the prince to become even more crazy !! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an entertaining movie, as the soundtrack of Prince’s songs increases its value by 110%. But on the other hand, the film gives us another theory about Prince and his music, as the film tells us that Prince’s biggest song in the film was written by Wendy, Liza and the Princes' wife, who beat the musical father! <br /> <br /> Are the Prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that the prince stole all his best songs from his father, having found from his fathers musical sheets of written songs? Maybe that's why the prince began to run out of steam in the 90s, because he ran out of ideas from his fathers ??? ... hmmm .....
