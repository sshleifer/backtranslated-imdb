I read most of the comments posted here, and all I can say is that most of these posters have serious problems in life. This show, unlike most game shows, was hilarious. Mr. Shatner, whose diamond in ALL, what he does, again became a hit show. He truly playful personality shines like a beacon, wherever he goes. He's funny and makes you smile, and that's exactly what the show does. The dancers and questions, the round fashion they represent, only add to the appeal of the show. And although a lot of money is at stake, it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists in most game shows does NOT exist here. Several people who posted messages complained about how much time was spent on the dancers and chose questions, and so on. For example, the Millionaire does not spend so much time. All I can say is that most of you missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have fun and enjoy yourself. There is something for everyone. Addictions to test your knowledge, lollipops (dancers), suspense, Mr. Shatner's wonderful funny personality ... well, if it doesnâ€™t elevate the mood, guys, then I feel sorry for you; and if this is not enough, you can get rich! I really miss the show. Of ALL the game shows that have ever been held, and, honestly, I HATE game shows, this is what I really liked and really miss. The only other game show I ever liked was the Match Game.
