This delicate, beautifully processed production plunged deep into my bitter sweetness. Disrespectful students, an angry bus driver and teacher personalities represent a subconscious dispute when the story unfolds. All adult characters seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, their every opinion is so believable and well known. When a key incident occurs on the bus, we are sent around a circle of points of view. The trip organizers all the time control the babble of teenage energy. Mr. Harvey has a lot of pain in everything. He reminds me of war-damaged teachers I didnâ€™t understand when I was an irreverent student. <br /> <br /> Ridian Brooke and the producers deserve a lot of recognition for this well-built British film. Acting impeccably, with relevant scenes, it should be widely available, but it seems that the right opportunity was not provided.
