When you see the DVD cover, you are convinced that this is some kind of stupid class B cheap stuff, a film made for someone’s thousand dollars in the backyard. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is a quality material and really good. This is a comedy and smart. It is also very touching in places with a good place of kindness. The performance is very good (it looks great), the actors are known, the direction of the film and the production is great. This is amazing. Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Carrie-Anne Moss, playing against the “type”, amazing like “Helen Robinson”, a wife like June Cleaver; Billy Connolly is great as the gruff, kind-hearted zombie "Fido"; Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") - a cry from a neighbor with a sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy", and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (excellent) are also excellent, K'Sun Ray in his youth "Timmy Robinson," should not be missed out of sight, either. In fact, he probably has more lines in the film than anyone else. <br /> <br /> If I explain the story, it will sound so stupid that few of you will see it. You just need to take a word for the people who liked it, and it was a very pleasant surprise for you. You need a dark sense of humor, though; assessment of the absurd.
