The end of the era was released here in the States in the spring of 2002, with "Rookie", a lively Disney action film who seemed to be "the best for life !!!!!" In fact, the story began in West Texas, as evidenced by the area code found on the signpost there. He was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high-end baseball team that he decided to become a professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: It was so great !!! !! It was a very good sports film, the Mighty Ducks trilogy. It also led moviegoers through Texas, from somewhere between Panhandle and El Paso, right down to Metroplex (where I live). I can say, because I recognize this stadium (it was Ballpark in Arlington; now it is Field of Americvest)! It was nice to see that the “golden age” of Disney ends here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Disney’s golden age <br /> <br /> 1920s Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> “It all started with a mouse ... and ended with a baseball. ” (sobs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
