Reading a review from another user, saying that this is a terrible game, I could not stay idle and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is excellent, from news clips (with two real people, full of humor and confidence!), to the story, I find it very good! I only complain that the enemies begin to flash when they die, until they disappear; and some unpleasant situations in the LEILA VR missions when riding a bike, here and there ... <br /> <br /> Besides, this is a great game, with a great story, good graphics, great characters, a great soundtrack ... I recommend it! Of course! It may be a little old, but still enjoyable! At least on the Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version should be the same.
