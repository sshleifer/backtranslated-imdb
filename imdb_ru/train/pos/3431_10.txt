It’s just the best Estonian film I've ever seen, although Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi made it. Tallin Pimeduses is a fascinating thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, the national wealth belonging to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a kind of summary of the conditions of many countries of Eastern Europe at that time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union fell apart, and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now conditions can be better in most of these countries. But in the early 1990s, many of these new countries had to fight corruption and organized crime, which the Soviet era left to them. (And many of them still do ... at least at some level ...) Tallinn Pimeduses are a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Yarvet (possibly the most famous Estonian actor, playing Snaut in Tarkovsky’s Solaris), playing the old gangster, who gradually gets tired of his lifestyle. But the most amazing performance comes from Monica Meger, a child actor who plays Terrier, a boy in his early teens, whose presence in the plot is very important. (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb credit list !!!) w <br /> <br /> There are not so many films in the world that could be both entertaining and artistic. But Tallinn Pimedus does it. Unfortunately, the other Jarvi-Laturi films are far from this kind of achievement. His first "Cottia Payne" was too artificial, and his last "History made at night" was just a strange mess.
