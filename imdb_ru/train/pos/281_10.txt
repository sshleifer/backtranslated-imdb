This game was really great and quite challenging. He has a great creepy storyline, and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all horror fans, and it is very exciting from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I would like more weapons, but it's just me. <br /> <br /> A really great game for RPG and Shoot'em'up fans. <br /> <br />>
