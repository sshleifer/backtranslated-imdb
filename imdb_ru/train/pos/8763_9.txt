This film is cold, true. Often we think, “Oh, this will not happen to me.” But it can. The smuggling of drugs is a lot of money, and often people unknowingly (or cheat) smuggle. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who, like them, only wanted an exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare. People need to know that such events are not incredible or exaggerated - this is a serious problem in modern society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to mature viewers because of the insight needed to truly appreciate the movie. It is very emotional and rude. Worth seeing and will definitely remain in your memory.
