Now most people don't watch classic films like this one. Most friends watch movies only from the 90s to the present. This is kind of stingy. <br /> <br /> Most of these old films are masterpieces unique in their own way. Just because when these films were still thought and made, then the ideas were fresh. Now people are straining only to come up with new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the movies. For real fans of classic horror. It is for you. The film is based on an investigator from Scotland Yard who is investigating the disappearance of the film actor, and runs into three other strange cases of former residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I won't talk anymore because I ruin the film more than I already have. But it's a terrific movie for all ages. And do not mind watching it again!
