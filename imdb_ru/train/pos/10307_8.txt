I really don't know what people are against this film, but he is definitely one of my favorites. This is not a sermon, it is not based on morality, it should not be controversial. It is just God. Any possible God, regardless of religion. And this is really fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is usually stuck on the bright side of the news, who is desperately trying to prove to himself (more or less himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job at anchor. This engine is what slowly drives away his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the last straws are performed, he does not quickly laugh, but screams in front of God, who, in turn, gives Bruce his strength. Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he is guilty of helping others, where he then continues to lose sight of his strength. Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground. <br /> <br /> Okay, that was quite long. But as a plot, it works well. The step-by-step manner in which we encounter the challenges of being God is much better than clustering his problems and is able to hide pretty well. <br /> <br /> As you probably know, having heard about it. Firstly, in the film, Kerry plays a completely impeccable acting role (and this, fortunately, he), and also controls and gives the atmosphere scene by scene. Whether they admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Kerry. Without it, humor would have turned over, since humor was half executed. And humor is very good in the first place. But without Kerry, it would be like the imitation of "This is a wonderful life." <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is gorgeous and, whatever one may say, cannot be the only excuse for the third act. At least you don't think so when you see her. She gives you a spiritual insight and makes you forget that you are watching a movie, she and Kerry are very much like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The film feels ggooooodd (see Movie to understand), a very good feeling, approaches the idea properly and better than expected, and in general should never be called a slap in the face to save Kerry's career ( that is not going anywhere).
