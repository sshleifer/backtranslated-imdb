Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York, thinking that he will make a living by being a herd. He gets there and quickly discovers that it will not be easy - he passes one humiliating experience after another. At the end of his rope, he connects to the crippled, sloppy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive, get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, exciting, but fascinating film. Directed by John Shelsinger draws a very dirty portrait of New York and its inhabitants. Thus, it is outdated - the city may have been so bad in 1969, but by now it has already been significantly cleared. He also uses every trick of the camera in the book â€” the color becomes black and white; trip sleep sequences; blink ahead; flashback (especially involving rape); shock cuts; weird sound effects ... you name it. It keeps you disoriented and not in the center of attention - but I could not stop looking. <br /> <br /> Not a lot of history - mainly it concerns the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an assumption that they may have been lovers (something like the final picture shows). This is just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in the cold, brutal urban jungle. <br /> <br /> Initially, it was the X rating in 1969. The only reason is that the MPAA did not think that parents would like their children to see it. However, it was a great success among high school students (then X had no one under 17). It was also the only X rated film that ever won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Hoffman and Voight were in acting awards, as was (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles, who was in the picture in total (maybe) 5 minutes! It was eventually downgraded to R (unabridged) when it was reprinted in 1980. <br /> <br /> Also in this film was a great song "Everybody's Talkin ', which became a hit." br /> <br /> A great movie --- but very dark. I give 10 points. I do not see it on commercial television - it is cut into ribbons and incomprehensible.
