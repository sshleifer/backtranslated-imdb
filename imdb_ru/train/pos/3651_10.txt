Pandora's Watch is one of the best thrillers you’ve ever read, and it’s one of the best thrillers you’ve ever seen. The extremely precise adaptation of the novel by John J. Nance, who had a terribly real scenario in the novel, is made even more here. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it is made for television, it is first-class entertainment. The cast is great and is so well suited to the heroes of the novel that one might think that they are reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson comes out of the shadow of MacGyvera and shows the best results in his career. Jane Livs perfectly copes with the role of assistant ambassador in a role that proves that she can be a wonderful dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is gorgeous, like Dr. Sanders, and despite the fact that the character in the book is human, she works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and other supporting actors are top notch and correspond to their new counterparts in their letter. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are changes in history (including minor changes). at the end) but these changes are for the better in comparison with the novel. The plot is realistic, and I really want to believe in the way it is presented, which makes it the best film about shooting aircraft since the original movie from the airport. Production figures are high, and although special effects may look as good as a decade ago, they work fine. The sets are excellent, especially at the CIA and in the Oval Office, showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time on this work. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if you first look at it and read it, and then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both, and you will not regret that you have lost four hours on this film, and no matter how much time it takes to read the novel. It makes you hold your breath.
