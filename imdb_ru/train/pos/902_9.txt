I thought that this film is really very good, because in modern Indian cinemas all you see is skin, music and bad behavior ... in this film you can see some traditions, ethnicity and at least some decency ... although some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? that's what Indian cinema is! after watching this movie, at least you don’t have a headache from all loud overpriced music or any kind of violence, it’s just true, it teaches about love and, of course, cares about the person you love throughout life. I think it was an amazing film ... Children can watch it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that was deep for India before ... until all these rap hits, mini skirts and skin shows have become part of it .
