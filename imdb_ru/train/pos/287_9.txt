We liked the movie. I am the mother of two little men. I like to watch movies, which I can watch with them, where men have integrity and character. Move, where money is not the most important thing. And the family is eternal, and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that we have not seen the Davis family anymore. But because of everything that I loved, it left me with the same feeling as the others: "Please do not stop." We both want the actors not to change. New actors have become a good substitute. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son also loved this movie. asked me to go and buy them all. He is a film critic, so tell him that it tells me something. The family should see this step, buy it for friends. Help return the time values. We will read books now that we are connected. I really hope to see more. Be blessed with a happy move.
