My 2-year-old likes the Doodlebops show, it seems to hold his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, bright with basic colors and everything. There is not much educational content from which the target audience can benefit, but each of them seems to have a theme, and they try to teach children to share and respect, as well as other basics, so I like it. It is well manufactured with high production values. But this is really just an ordinary show, like most TV shows these days. We do not buy into the corner of the goods, and our son wears all Dooblebop. I do not think that we would spend money on a concert if they ever come to the city. A visit to a zoo or science center is a much better experience for all participants, and, in my opinion, it is better to spend money.
