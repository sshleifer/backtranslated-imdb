I waited some time to publish a review of this documentary, because when I first saw it more than 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> From a documentary point of view, I found it to be a damn good documentary. He did what he intended to do, showed me what I had no idea about, and interested me in this world that I was researching. I did not know anything about the world of Drag, and to learn about them and the "Balls" was just impressive for me. These people were so talented in what they do and how they do it, for competition. Curious people, complainants (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat that the Dragon Queen was wearing was not a man's coat!), Jealous, it's all like in any other competition. HOW EVERY OTHER COMPETITION I LIKE It seemed to me, it was a question. <br /> <br /> The older transvestite talked about how “balls” were “used” to compare with newer transvestites who changed balls and made more categories of competitions - even those who watched, knowing that the future of the Balls would change even more when they are ready to go along the runway. It was interesting to hear that some competitors lived on the street two minutes before the ball, but came to the competition, it was so important for them! Then there were sad stories, stories about who from the "home" and "home mom" revealed the best and brightest in the competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now, adding that after 10 years of watching this film, I experienced the so-called “Madonna” hobby. I noticed several familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her “Vogue” phase and rightfully so. If it were not for these people, Madonna would not have a Vogue phase, I know that now. The loan must be provided if the loan is DUE. Makes me think, if someone from mainstream America watched this documentary, he would know that he is not as mainstream as they think.
