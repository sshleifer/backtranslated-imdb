These are the first 10 out of 10 that I gave to any film. What made this movie so good for me? Permanent action - there are no slow parts, great game, clever writing. I also liked the style of filming, where shakiness and different angles made you feel like part of the scene. Finally, I see a fighter who does not try to please all segments of society (i.e., there is no compulsory romance). <br /> <br /> I liked the first two Born films, but I liked this one. <br /> <br /> Warning - after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving!
