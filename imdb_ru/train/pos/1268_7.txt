Just Cause shoots some of the best parts of the three films: Cape of Fear, Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes them together to create a good movie thriller. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a professor of liberal law, married to former assistant district attorney Kate Capshaw and is a crusader against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby De buttonhole Connery at the conference and persuades him to satisfy his grandson's call. He sits on death row for killing a young girl. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural district of Florida, he faces a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne, who is about as ruthless in uncovering his crime as Orson Welles was in Touch of Evil. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery canceled the verdict with the evidence that he revealed, he feels pretty good. At this point, the film takes a decisive turn from Touching Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that, to put it mildly, not everything is as it seems. The cast is evenly transformed into some good performances. Special mention should be made of Ed Harris, who plays Hannibal Lecter as a serial killer on death row with Underwood. He will make your skin crawl, and he will force Connery to rethink some of those comfortable liberal prerequisites on which he based his convictions. Many recognized liberals, whom I know, began to think very differently when they became victims of crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, the opposite is true. Many law enforcement conservatives, if they ever interfere with the wrong end of the criminal justice system, want to make sure that all his rights are guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not the end, but a process that never ends for the whole society. I believe that Just Cause has a moral that could be that.
