The most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people. Presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart. A rare combination in which the sequel surpasses the prequel in telling stories and intensity of emotions. and the pain of separation. the joy of what you see the most beloved, has no equal, and all can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julia found the eternal characters so simple that they give the film a clear joy and love of viewing. Be sure to watch the movie for all people who believe in true love. certainly the most romantic (at least one of them) movie of all time.
