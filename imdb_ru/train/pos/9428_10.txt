One of my favorite movies today begins as an adventure on the wild side of a four-member team from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living on the Chulavasse River before it turned into a lake arose from Lewis Bert Reynold, who unknowingly drowns his boys in their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film looks more like an action movie, the second half takes the viewer to a completely different story when our people have to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. Very bad ways. At the end of the film, everyone will be forced to deal with the scars of what should have been just a weekend on the river, but turned into a struggle for survival. The film (with the exception of some rather obvious nonsense) is very well shot and perfectly filmed in the paradise of nature, which captures your breath. The photo is also great. Voith, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty show very well how a single event can destroy four different lives in different ways associated with only the same error.
