I can't blame the movie because it works. The film has enough noir elements to consider it a noir movie, but I think it is only in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing sinister in this work, and it is here that the noir elements fail. Of course, the disease can be considered ominous, but I find it difficult to see. The film hints at a darker side: Blacks may be human traffickers, New Orleans police are too willing to arrest a reporter, the ghost of the plague hangs over all the people in the film ... but these are really only hints. <br /> <br /> There are no attempts to question Reed’s motivation, as it has to do with Marlowe or Spade, and no attempt is made to attract people to Blackie, which would make him even more contemptuous if human trafficking was played out. <br /> <br /> In the end, due to lack of depth, the film failed. <br /> <br /> The plot is decent, the acting skills are good, the script and direction are great ... but there’s nothing to do this film to which you have to come back again and again. It is worth seeing once, maybe twice, if you do not remember it many years ago, and then remove.
