I saw it in a posh cinema, where the public is usually white, educated and urban. There were a lot of African Americans at the show, which I attended, and this made the difference in audience reaction between the two groups of wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. In general, white people were afraid to laugh or nervously laugh at funny bits - and there are a lot of them! - because they will “laugh at blacks,” while Black was also silent, because many could not laugh at themselves in front of the white ones. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, being Asian (and therefore belonging to no group), had a great time considering this satire of rap culture and its ego / attributes / values ​​/ pseudophilosophy. Actor talent is talented and copes with the role of characters. The songs are too funny to believe in them. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best pseudo-documentary films, including The Mighty Wind.
