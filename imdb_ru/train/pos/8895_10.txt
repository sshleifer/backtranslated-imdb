I accidentally saw this film on TV and could not leave it ... It is a really great film that makes people learn about the history of America during the Vietnam War, the time of flower power, the fight against racism ... This illustrates the conflict of generations, political views , a race that happened in the 60s ... I was born in 1980, so I didnâ€™t know all this before ... In France, US history is not a priority, and this film really taught me many facts! By the way, I think all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can watch this movie more than 1 time per day !! It's really great .... what a pity that it appeared only on television and not in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
