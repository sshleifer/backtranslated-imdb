This film opened with poor performances in the first few weeks. Then Mina Kumari died, and she just led the crowds. Songs on the All India Radio, especially Inhi LogoN ne, sounded so often that I was tired of them then, despite the recognition of their beauty! <br /> <br /> Yes, it took all these years. This happened because the marriage was very unhappy, and Kamal Amrohi also hardly found the money to make the film; Looking at luxury suites and costumes is not surprising !! Mina Kumari is not only aging and falling ill, but listening attentively to the voice of Lata. Inhi logoN ne has a younger voice, while songs that have been re-recorded, for example, Chalo dildar chalo, show a clear development. I would just like someone to find the songs of Gulam Mohammed, which were not included in the film, because of a change in fashion that required fewer, though few songs, and publish them. Lata in a recent interview (2007) rated Gulama Mohammed as one of the best composers she had ever worked with, except for Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Notice also that you hardly see the actors in the songs of Chalo dildar, very unusual. From the middle distance, Raj Kumar takes only a short shot, and you only see the back of the alleged Mina Kumari. Kamal Amrohi made virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and the moon. In any other film, in this song there would be close ups of both. <br /> <br /> As for the fact that this is the best film in history, I would allow myself to disagree. This means that you missed a lot of Indian cinema, without any specific order, such films as Barsaat (old), Devdas (older versions), Bandini, Do Bigha Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan, Pyasa, Kagaz ke Phool, Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam, Kabulivallah, Abhiman, Guide, Sujata, Bombay, Ka Babu, Daag, Pariniet (old), Umrao Jaan, etc Aah, Junnu, Anand, Mera Naam Joker: the list is really endless! <br /> <br /> So enjoy Packesa, but do not miss any of the above ...,
