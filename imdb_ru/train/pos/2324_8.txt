When I watched this movie, I began to feel nostalgic. When I grew up as a child in the countryside, I felt as if I was a child again! Swimming pond (it is called a “tank” in central Texas), running around the countryside, like a wild free spirit Through the pain we experience in life ... life goes on, and there can be forgiveness.
