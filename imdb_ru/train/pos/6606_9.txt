It's time for Hollywood to sit down and notice! If the actors are mockingly, all you have to do is attract the animators who worked on this little miracle. Renaissance is probably the first animated film that makes you forget that you don’t see people. Although the voice overs (Craig, McCormack, Price, and so on. D.) are some of the best I've ever heard, but even then the emotions depicted in “cartoons” are confusing. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not very new, but the use of light and shadows makes the film a living picture. Ironically, this technical magic makes you forget that this is a really very good movie. The pace and development of the plot are amazing, and the dialogues are clear. <br /> <br /> Plot: The disappearance of a high-ranking employee of the mega-corporation reveals the history of deception and corruption with the hero with a cold heart at the head. I can’t say anything without giving it all away ... except that although the film keeps you on the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you silent. <br /> <br /> We must look ... even for adults who grin at the "cartoons"
