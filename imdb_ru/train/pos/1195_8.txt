I saw this movie about twenty years ago at the end of the show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought that Taylor was underestimated as an actor, as most critics considered him a strong, almost boring lead man, and women just loved to watch his films because of his appearance. This film, however, proved how interesting an actor he could be. During his long career he lacked such roles. This is his best performance. He is absolutely believable in a truly villainous role. From what I read, he was a very hardworking and frivolous guy in real life and never fought enough for such kind of roles. He just did what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could perform more diverse and complex roles. Another thing I remember about this movie is how annoying the character of Lloyd Nolan was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really annoyed me. The last scene of the movie stuck with me throughout all these years. This movie is definitely worth seeing.
