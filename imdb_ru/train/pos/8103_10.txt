it was the most expensive movie when it was shot. Sir Alexander Korda and H. G. Wells were concerned about his poor grades - for good reason. it was and remains far ahead of its time. In addition to the seemingly bad direction, it is possible, while editing, at the very beginning, the work is moving towards a stunning completion. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether she plays the role of Sir Ralph Richardson's boss, or even better, the role of Sir his wife Cedric, as an opponent of space flight, plays the main role of Raymond Massey in “John Kabale” - all this is stunning. <br /> <br /> Scene with mr. An incomparable set of Korda, a little girl running out onto an absolutely “never-suitable” scene, commenting: “Life is becoming more and more beautiful”? it quickly brings tears to any parent / grandparent. it is not a film for young people - if only it is not “experienced”, but rather one who has seen the “horror” he faces. <br /> <br /> Of course, the “skydiver” looks abnormal - while the use of the “magnetic cannon”, now called the “mass driver”, can be considered as ridiculous, compared to the missiles - to give Sir Korda a break - Mr. Wells made this choice. and at +/- 8 million dollars this film went beyond the framework of the “super budget” - so he concentrated on what he is capable of. <br /> <br /> The true power of this “Greatest Movie” lies in “John.” The last statement of Kabbalah about human destiny - his friend "Passworthy" doubts the wisdom of space travel, saying: "We are such small animals." John Kabbalah’s correct answer (paraphrased): “Yes, small animals, and if this is all we are, we must live and die as such.” they stand under a large astronomical telescope. he runs his hand across the night sky. “Nevertheless, we can have the whole Universe, or nothing.” - then enters the final chorus --- “What will it be?” - this is not “Star Wars”, “Blade Runner” --- everything, that you can consider “Great” - this is the “Real Thing”. <br /> <br /> I remind you of Stephen Hawking’s most recent appeal to his latest Medal of Honor: “Humanity must leave Earth or die.” ”- the very essence of this work - I love“ standard entertainment ”- but this“ relic ”offers much more to a wise viewer. 'What will it be?' to be in the proper "mood" - whatever it takes - it will capture the spirit - I am the "guarantor" - in general, for humanity? the most significant of the movies. <br /> <br /> From the moment of publication, I note that many have commented on the poor “quality of the media” of the “surviving” examples. in the 80s, I developed a “patented” painting process that required a “clean” original. This led me to Michael Korda, who, unfortunately, noted that everything was gone - so we should enjoy what remains - “sad, but right?”
