He is trying to be the epic adventure of the century. And with actors like Sho Sho Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rees Davis, this is really the perfect B-adventure of all time. In fact, this is a rather fun, exciting adventure that, even with its flaws, captures your interest. It must have been the biggest movie for those who shot it. Even if it is made in the 90s, it does not look modern. It's more like an old movie about Errol Flynn. Big adventure films are again a big thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as in old movies. This, on the other hand, just has a real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think this is a good adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want a song theme.
