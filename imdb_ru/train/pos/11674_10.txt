The planning episodes were a bit boring, but when they reached the desert it was quite interesting to watch. The reason I call this the most realistic reality show is that, to my surprise, Charlie dropped out of the race relatively early. When his hands hurt, I expected the usual stress and then a miraculous correction, but instead he actually left the race. Probably the most disturbing moment in the show is when Max was stuck in the desert almost without water and food! The ending was great and I was very happy to see that at least one team did it. In general, not as big as the Long Way Round, but certainly an interesting watch, as you can look into the most difficult race in the world.
