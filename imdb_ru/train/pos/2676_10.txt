Every day we can watch a lot of movies, soaps ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. Great movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realist director. For me, there are two films that everyone should see: the first one is Pacula? "The Choice of Sophie" with Meryl Streep. The second is "The Journey of Hope." As humans, we must learn about humility, about loving others, accepting another civilization, a different way of life. We must also fight racism and fashim. We must avoid condemnation, criticism; we must love only our satellite Earth. This wonderful film helps us to achieve John (Lennon) of his dreams: imagine that all people live in the world. These two films are hard to see: watch them, but it will probably hurt you, but better. A great movie, great actors, a terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also a better understanding of others. Enjoy it.
