I watched Dick Tracy for many years, and as a result, it became a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout my childhood, and I saw him quite often. Seeing it now, for an adult, this is still a very good film - dark, satirical, and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing that can be said is an Oscar nomination that Pacino received, except that he is rarely discussed and doesn’t cause much fuss when he came out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is too top, but with a good effect, as he clearly has a lot of pleasure. Beatty is great in the role of Dick Tracy, and behind the camera you can capture the atmosphere of a comic book about noir better than any other film, perhaps I have ever seen. Just looking at one scene from the movie is breathtaking. Lighting, velvet and smog / smoke combine to create a great effect. <br /> <br /> There are some really funny cameos, including Dustin Hoffman in the role of “Mumbles”, and I don’t think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting skills — even the obligatory children's character is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> In general, a really good film that has been misunderstood for many years since its release, and is incredibly undervalued from just 5.7. / 10 average IMDb. Critic reviews are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com), and seeing the film again makes it easy to understand why this is a great example of how to convey the essence of comics, from style to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars
