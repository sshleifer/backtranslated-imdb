ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young, emotionally concerned US Navy sailor. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him understand that his problems are related to his children's upbringing. <br /> <br /> Get ready to shed a tear or two. The film can defrost the coldest heart. I liked the story, which turns from something so horrible that happens to someone, to a positive ending. ANTWONE FISHER - a powerful film, the main thing about forgiveness. Other important questions that make you think about are child abuse, adoption and fostering. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner Denzel Washington did an impressive job in his directorial debut. There were many scenes that I enjoyed watching. They included the beginning (dreams of a little boy, see giant-sized pancakes!) And the end (dreams turned into reality), which nicely tied the story together. <br /> <br /> Another great scene occurred when the doctor called Antwon to look for his family in order to find answers to his questions about his family, who left him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when the young man finally ran into his mother and her reaction to him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All the actors are well presented their roles. <br /> <br /> In addition to his leadership responsibilities, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won the Oscar award and succeeded in all of his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this film. <br /> <br /> The actor, Derek Luke, demonstrated why he was so good at playing Antwone Fisher. He portrayed a very real and heartbreaking work. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant, who played Cheryl, Antwon's love interest, resembled a sunbeam on the screen. Chemistry flowed well between romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played the role of Mrs. Tate, a disgusting character, deserves special mention. <br /> <br /> Although we only see her for a few minutes later, the actress who played Fisher's mother stood out. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
