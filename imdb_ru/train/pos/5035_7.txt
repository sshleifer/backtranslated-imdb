McConaughey is terrified / thriller? I should have seen it. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashback mode, and this applies to the rest of a normal and happy family of three, which is experiencing a very strange situation. I can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you will be at least surprised. <br /> <br /> All the major players are very good. Bill Paxton did an excellent job guiding these children, and his play is great. McConaughey is flawless and perfectly fits all requirements <br /> <br /> This movie makes you wonder. Dad is crazy? Is there any god Are there demons? How far would you go to fix it wrong. And what is "right" anyway? I still think. <br /> <br /> And so I recommend Frailty. 7/10, and this is one of those films that deserves and rewards for the second or even the third viewing.
