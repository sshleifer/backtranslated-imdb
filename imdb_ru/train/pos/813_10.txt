After “The Empire Strikes Back,” “Return of the Jedi” is my second favorite movie in the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tatooine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is secretly engaged in the construction of a new space station, similar to the previous Death Star. If this station remains fully built, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star, and they need to kill many of their commanders in order for the project to be completed on schedule. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's palace to send a message from Luke Jabba, where Luke pretends to negotiate the life of Khan. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not agree to negotiate, as he uses Han Solo as decoration for his palace. (Khan is still frozen in carbon) Lando is hidden as a guard for Jabba, and Chewbacca is also given to Jabba by an award hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Hana alone and makes him stay in human form again, we see that this is actually Princess Leia in disguise. The problem is that Jabba recognizes Leia’s plan and considers her to be his slave, and Hana is thrown into Chewbacca’s cell. <br /> <br /> Luke comes as a Jedi Knight to save his friends. When he first tries to kill Jabba, he gets into the camera of the monster Jabba (Bantu), but easily kills her. Jabba is angry and decides to quit Hana, Chewbacca and Luke Sarlakka, a large creature from the desert that remains for 1000 years, digesting his “food”. Luke, Khan, and Chewie again succeed, and even Bob Fett dies when Khan accidentally throws him into Sarlacca's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and chases Han, Luke and Chui, as well as c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Luke is safe again, Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi, as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since he is already 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda tells Luke that he does not need to train anymore, but in order to really be a Jedi, he must fight Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's father, and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In the last moments, Yoda asks Luke to recall his advice on tempting the dark side and pass his knowledge of the Jedi to other people on Luke. When Yoda dies, Obi-Wan's spirit comes to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side of Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he became more of a machine than a man, as he became a Sith. Luke is still concerned about the murder of his own father and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and talks about the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated from childhood. He gives his last advice to Luke, saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Emperor tells Vader that he must give him Luke when he appears, as Luke is stronger than before, and both of them need to join forces to bring Luke to the dark side. <br /> <br /> Now we will have one of the best battles in the Star Wars series. when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new Space Station, “Death Star 2”, Luke will meet with Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Khan and Chui must turn off the “Death Stars 2” force field, with the help of EWOKS. (little creatures that look like little bears) <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the most exciting star wars of all!
