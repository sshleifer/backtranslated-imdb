This is a great show! I had a US history teacher in high school who was very much like that. There are many “facts” in the story that are not entirely true, and Mr. Wool very well points to them, which is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Mr Vul teaches a class of cinematographers, but students of historians and even the general public will appreciate the clever way he reveals some very famous mistakes in world history and will try to impress them with his brain of his students. The use of live actors performing “parodies” is also very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this series to anyone interested in the story that they learned in childhood, upside down.
