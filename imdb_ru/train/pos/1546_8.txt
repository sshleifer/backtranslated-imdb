I saw this film once or almost the year it was released 36 years ago (1969). Although now I can only remember a few of these, I long to see it again. Parts that I remember, fair or not, include mustard gas in the trenches and Susie Kendall as a German spy, offering some sex services in the back of a truck to get military information from him. The musical accompaniment was especially memorable, and in the Gone with the Wind league, emotions began to stir, and I would like to hear it again. There must be some kind of commercial or author's reason why this film is not available. Does anyone know why? I doubt that this is somehow related to the lack of quality or interest.
