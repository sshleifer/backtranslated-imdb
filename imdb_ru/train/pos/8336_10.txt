This film tells the story of a novel between Albert Einstein's niece and a gas station employee. To bring them together, Einstein agrees to help Ed (Tim Robbins of the Hudsucker Proxy) learn to act smarter. This is impressive Katherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstien goes too far, and Ed is considered a genius. Fun comes. Do not miss. Taken in Mercer County, New Jersey, at Princeton University, at Lawrenceville Preparatory School (a doubling for Princeton University), and at the beautiful old gas station in Hopewell.
