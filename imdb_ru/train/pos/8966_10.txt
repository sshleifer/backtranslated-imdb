This is a wonderful film from which the 1950s look beautiful and stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and irresistible as a modern witch, one leg of which is in Manhattan and the other in infinity. All auxiliary performances are awesome, from Jack Lemmon when sheâ€™s bothering Nikki, to Ernie Kovac, as the author of Magic in Mexico, working on Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester, who was a bit clumsy, and also the witch Aunt Quiney. And there is also a cat - I have no idea how many witches (besides me) called the cat Pyuaket, but they offer a million. James Stewart looks out of place, but only to the extent that his character is not in himself in this strange world of magic and witchcraft. Fine. And it has a perfect romantic happy ending, in which we believe, because the films of this year of manufacture have those happy endings. Gillian and Shep certainly have as many chances to be happy as Rose and Charlie Allnat in The Queen of Africa (another great movie)
