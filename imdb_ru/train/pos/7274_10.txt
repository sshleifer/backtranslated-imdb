No Strings Attached is one of the best performances of Carlos Mencia to date. Mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial problems. Nevertheless, he does more than in this speech, which was held in San Francisco. In general, the material of Mencia not only makes you laugh, but also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today. <br /> <br /> In this watch play, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinions about the Passion of Christ Mel Gibson and the controversy he faced a woman as to whether Jesus influenced him, and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally retarded Mencia even discusses whether you should have the right to speak and joke. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which often causes him problems with critics. For example, he goes far (and recognizes this) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he most likely is doing in heaven. <br /> <br /> The main message of Mencia in all his speeches is that we all have a voice, and that we must use this voice to say what we feel, and not be afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have the right to free speech and that we should use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you like this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, his show on Comedy Central.
