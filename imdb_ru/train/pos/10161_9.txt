I took a flyer to rent this movie, but I must say that it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, actors, director, photography, high production costs, etc. Proves that Eva Longoria Parker is a cut above all bad actors like Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who rob and call it acting skills. Who would have thought that? <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in this class on their own and should try to advance in projects like Over Her Dead Body. Lake Bell is great too, and I see it for the first time. And finally, Paul Rudd starts acting in a really good film, not in smaller films. <br /> <br /> Such a film never gets from close men. This is very bad. As noted by other IMDb observers, there is nothing boorish about this gem - no hacker letters, no actions. <br /> <br /> And his description of contemporary Los Angeles and California as a whole makes each scene bright, beautiful, clean and outstanding in every respect in all respects. Never had the movie made LA look so good. Oh, what a little talent and a lot of care can do for the film. <br /> <br /> I will not divulge the plot, but as a long-time and angry atheist, I was ready to put it off and don’t believe it and buy into a supernatural subject to enjoy wonderful and carefree entertainment. It reminds me very much of the old Topper films, which were also very pleasant. <br /> <br /> This film shows popular but otherwise battered films, such as Ghost, for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap festivals they are. We already know that social taste is strongly inclined towards mediocrity. However, some of us praise our praise for the really worthy ones. <br /> <br /> If you liked other gems such as “Into the Night” with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, “Blind Date” with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, “American Dreamer” with JoBet Williams “Most likely” with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher MacDonald and Sybil Sheppard, “Making Mr. Right” with John Malkovich, etc., you will like it. <br /> <br /> Great job everywhere (even if it's hard to believe that the straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years). But even this plot device does not detract from the film. overall superiority.
