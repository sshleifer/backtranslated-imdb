Atlantis is probably the best Disney movie I've seen in recent years. It has a great action scene, magic, intellectual and written script. Atlantis regains the magic of Disney classics such as The Lion King or Aladdin. Seeing this, I am sure that this year the season of summer blockbusters will be excellent. <br /> <br /> I recommend to all of you: â€œAtlantis: A Lost Empire is like an inspiration. <br /> <9 out of 10
