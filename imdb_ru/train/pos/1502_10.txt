The late, great Robert Bloch (by PSYCHO, for those of you who didn't pay attention to it) wrote the horror script, and it was absolutely one of the scariest films I've ever seen in my childhood. (I had to walk around Miles to watch a movie, and I usually left the theater when it was dark; when I watched a horror movie, it was always unnerving, but especially when it was as good as this.) When I was able to see it a few years ago on a videotape (which should always be the last resort), I was surprised at how well she stood. Take the test of terror: look at night, alone, and then tell me that it is not scary ...
