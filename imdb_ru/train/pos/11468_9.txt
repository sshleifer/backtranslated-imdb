I am genuinely surprised by how little was done in the film about the Columbine Massacre. There is no major documentary, very mysterious. Fortunately, we have the talent of Ben Coccio, who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Santa, who played the ELEPHANT equally well. Two different views of the event, which unite the idea that the true cause of the slaughter will always be a mystery, that something ultimately confuses and does not know what the motivation of two murderers is, and what actually led them to carry it on. fantasy into a terrible reality. ZERO DAY, presumably made up of videos made by shooters and found after the event, is absolutely breathtaking. Even if you know where he is going, you still hope that he will not “go there” ... and the tension in the last minutes of the film is painful. The film is stunning from top to bottom, from director to script (not very improvised, although it looks very spontaneous) for the two main actors, as well as for auxiliary players. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that bothered me. Ok, so we can't understand why the arrows did what they did, but surely one of the participants was their anger. However, these guys don't really seem angry. They may say some things to show what they are, but in fact they did not convince me that there was SOMETHING in them that made them kill innocent people. But it still leaves me with a sense of "why ???" this director Kochio wants me to have. In any case, remove or buy this film, it will sneak up on you and stay with you for a long time. The guys from BLAIR WITCH could only WISH the success that these guys had in creating a fake documentary.
