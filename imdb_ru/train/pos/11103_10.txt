The “Godfather” of television, but apart from his recognized and gangster characters, they do not resemble each other. Tony Soprano is forced to turn to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families - in the same family he is a loving father, but not so perfect a husband, and in another family he is a ruthless sage. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony’s problems are actually related to his mother, Livia, who is suspected of borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly called the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand are not so recognized for their equally talented actions as a psychiatrist and mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are welcome for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from the E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and he is pretty convincing and memorable. Chianese, the only recurring actor who actually appeared in the film “The Godfather”, plays Uncle Tony and his sworn enemy. Many fans also liked the characters played by Pastor, Ventimiglia, Kuratola, Failure, Pantoliano, Guba, Skoroy and Bushemi. Tony's children are “fine,” but not remarkable (with the exception of Ailer’s stunning performance in the third episode of the Second Coming); Siriko and Shirrip are unconvincing and excessive, but the show is too strong to restrain him. Even if the show lasts more than six seasons, it is no longer a boring or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
