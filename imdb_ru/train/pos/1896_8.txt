Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. My good friend, who worked on the film as an extra and helped with the horses during the stable, just recently passed away. If you look quickly, you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background, while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are talking. Frank was an equestrian champion and would miss everyone who knew him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really knew Arthur Bach from real life. He was not as rich as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life, mostly in childhood. His parents tightly controlled his wallets, but his rent and utilities were paid in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. Most of his time he spent in a state of intoxication from various spirits and a public spectacle, as Dudley Moore does. <br /> <br /> Arthur’s surprise is why someone will worry about his wealth. But this is the other half of the equation. My friend was the most charming person when you met him. In fact, it was almost compelling to be charming. He could not buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the seller. He spent his life being the perfect guest at a party. The term “pod”, which was widely used in the 19th century, will apply to it. <br /> <br /> And this is what Dudley Moore is, the pod. Unlike my friend, Moore has to remove John Gilgud after him. This is full employment, as we see, demonstrated in Arthur. My friend also never found Lisa Minnelli, Lisa Minnelli in fact, because he was gay. However, Moore portrays Arthur Bach as deadly accurate and so real to me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, a 20th-century waster, is forced to marry another child from a trust fund in Jill Eikenberry. Since he will not make a living, the threat of being cut off is quite real. He has only the butler Hobson, played by John Gilgud, and the chauffeur Bitterman, played by Ted Post, to vent his troubles. We all should have such problems. <br /> <br /> John Gilgud definitely worked better in his nearly 100-year-old life than in Arthur’s film, and in fact Gilgud is better known for his stage performances. However, 1981 was a year of sentiment during the time of the Oscars. The Academy awarded Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn an Oscar for the film “At the Golden Pond” and Gilgud as the best supporting actress, mainly for life-long work. This man was amazing, still in his craft almost to the end. <br /> <br /> So Frank Graham, who worked in the film, and Jackie Weiss, the real Arthur, dedicated this review.
