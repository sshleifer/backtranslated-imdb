House of Games is a wonderful film on several levels. This is a great mystery and shocking thriller. He is gifted with amazing performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montagna, as well as a strong and strong supporting players, and he represents Ricky Jay, an outstanding card-based extraordinary figure, prestige player and historian of magic. In his dialogue, written by David Mamet, it says, as if in a manner, and gives the film (in which reality is often questioned) an additional dimension of unreality. <br /> <br /> At first glance, “The House of Games” is a convincing look at the unknown world of fraudsters and fraudsters, which is diametrically different from “Sting”, which was played only for the sake of glamor and fun. At this level, he is doing well. <br /> <br /> However, you cannot escape the exam on a deeper level of a woman's odyssey from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self-realization. The only film I know, in which the theme of the emergence of personal power in a woman is considered as a worthy way, is the underestimated ordinary Benjamin. This extremely enjoyable film unfortunately dispels its focus by switching between several themes and using Goldie Hawn's excellent work to chase after a little laugh. House Games adheres to its business. As Poe once said about a good short story, he steadily leads to his conclusion. <br /> <br /> There is another series of films about women, embodied by Thelma and Louise, a large commercial money company with the Sneaky theme that women are doomed if they recognize their inner virtues. What nonsense. <br /> <br /> As usual, you really should see this movie in a movie theater. This should be natural for film festivals. If you have such an opportunity, assign it to the participant nearest you. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of the House of Games and handed it over to my 23-year-old daughter. Better she sees it on TV than she does not see at all.
