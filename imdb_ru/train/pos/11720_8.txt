I did not expect much, and, frankly, I did not like this film for the first time, but I watched it again and realized that it was cool. Of course, this is a movie with one joke, but this is a funny joke. <br /> <br /> Someone wrote that it could be better written, and it could be. I think this film had the potential to be excessive, My cousin Winnie. But with a master of horror instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, this is a missed opportunity. With a little more writing, it can become a classic. Children are undervalued, there is no reason why they should become attached to Elvira. Besides the obvious reasons. It would be great to see their relationship flourish. I know that this is a comedy, but there are some minor differences that separate good films from brilliant ones. <br /> <br /> Elvira herself is always cheerful and attractive. Not to mention coquetry. Every time she smiles, so do you. It's hard to beat a movie when the main character is so charming. And this is really her charm, do not let her look deceptive, making you think that she is kind of sour. Well, she is. But she is good. The man you allow to look after your children. I would not let her cook for them, though ... I would recommend to try. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> She is more than just a great chest. She is also an incredible pair of legs.
