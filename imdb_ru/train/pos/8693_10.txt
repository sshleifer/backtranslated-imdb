I was quite young when it appeared in the USA, but I recorded it from television and watched it again and again until I remembered it all. To this day, I still find myself quoting this. The show itself was fun and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra to Sylvestre Stallone and Mr. T. The voices were great and sounded like the characters they portrayed. The dolls were also well made, albeit a bit creepy. I was surprised to find out quite recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor from Red Dwarf, a show that I also really like. As another person wrote in a comment earlier, I was also taken away from this great show by a “friend” who borrowed it and never returned it. I’m sure there would be enough demand for this show to guarantee the release of the DVD, but I don’t think enough people have heard of it. Well, okay, maybe I will try e-bay ...
