Very few films have influenced American culture like Urban Cowboy. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost in its class, because when you switch channels at 3:00 in the morning, you just can't take your eyes off ... my top three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but that's not the point. I remember how the Urban Cowboy visited theaters and everywhere, on every corner the honktonki were open, the men wore cowboy hats with their idlers, and if you didn’t know how to take two steps, you were considered a social moron! Personally, I think this is a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Who could. In fact, he is also believable. The soundtrack is awesome. It’s a pity that Charlene Tilton, known on television from Dallas, ruined Johnny Lee’s career because this guy was just awesome. The show's thief here is Scott Glenn as the crazy cowboy of a former rogue. And I have nothing against the more sophisticated former cowboys, half as such, but I was always jealous of what I consider the greatest power line of all time .... "Damn in S * # t!" Like Clint, make my day ". And watching him slapping Sissy is the closest thing I’ll see in my fantasy Julia Roberts, so ... As I said, it's beautiful. 9/10
