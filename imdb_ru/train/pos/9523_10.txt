I loved this movie! I am a real fan of Tom Hanks, and I was always impressed with all his work. Of his most dramatic roles, such as "Outcast", "Green Mile", "Saving Private Ryan", "Forrest Gump", "Apollo 13" and "Philadelphia". On his funny roles, such as "Their own league", Turner and Hooch, "Catch Me If You Can", "Lady Killers", "Big" and, of course, "Toy Story". But in this film, Hanks is not the only great actor who lights up the screen. Tyler Hechlin, a rising star who shows great promise in Hollywood colleagues as Hanks son and gives nothing but excellent performance. He is certainly the one who follows his career, I believe that he will do great things. Paul Newman, as always, demonstrates a brilliant performance on the screen. He is truly a legend. We can not forget people who did not have such large roles in the film, but who helped make it great. Beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Lee, who will play in the film “Bastard from Carolina and the lonely white woman”, whom I will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the film and does an excellent job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the film. He does such a wonderful job with such a small role, and, like his roles in Lemony Snicketts, Sweet November, and I Dreamed of Africa, he plays well.
