“60s” is a great movie (I saw it all in one night) about the hippie movement in the late 60s. Although the title would suggest that the first 5 years of the 60s are not very important in this film. <br /> <br /> The film’s protagonist is Michael, a political activist who campaigns against the Vietnam War in the United States. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). He returns from the war and turns into "Tom Cruise, born on the fourth of July," and then in the hippie. His dad is a guy opposed to the Vietnam War (what a surprise !!). Michael Kate's sister gets pregnant from a rock artist, runs away from home and leaves for San Francisco in the summer of love. The ending is very bad (the father becomes a liberal, and everyone is happy), but I missed it from my vote (the rest of the film is very good!). <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are pretty good, and the soundtrack for the film is just great. All the major events of the sixties in the film, such as the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, as well as major hippie protests, the summer of love and Woodstock! Look at the wavy gravy "Woodstock Speaker" (what we mean by breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid officer at a festival in Woodstock! <br /> <br /> In the end, the 60s is a great film about a beautiful decade! 10/10
