Bonanza had a great cast of great actors. Lorne Green, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams (as a cousin who led to several episodes in 1964 to replace Adam when he left the series). The cast had chemistry, and they seemed to genuinely love each other. It made many of their weakest stories much better than they should have. It also turned many of their best stories into great western drama. <br /> <br /> As in any series in which more than thirty episodes were filmed in each season, there are also weak ones. However, in most cases there was an interesting story in each episode, some kind of conflict and a solution that usually did not include violence. While Bonanza was western, the shootout was never the main attraction. While I'm a fan of Arrow and Wanted: Dead or Alive; these shows usually ended with a shootout. Firefights were the way Westerns resolved every conflict, and Bonanza was very different in that she tried to achieve a peaceful settlement and harmony, not murder. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza there are several interesting episodes in which there are many skirmishes. These episodes are different from other episodes, but they are pretty good in themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, he was replaced by Guy Williams. Williams played the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay for another year, and so Williams was removed from the series when he left to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams remained throughout Bonanza, one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965, when Pernell Whitaker left the show. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, when Pernell Whitaker TV series quit, the stories focused more on comedy and weird events. Whitaker often played heavy in many episodes, and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play a good baby, and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was a kind and wise patriarch of the family, this did not leave too much room for shootings. <br /> <br /> At one point, they hired a ranch named Candy (David Canary), who became their fourth member of the cast, but Candy never participated in any skirmishes, and he was almost the older version of Little Joe. For a year or two, they also forced Ben to take another lost cousin (Jamie, who is played by the unforgettable Mitch Vogel), who was a teenager, who usually had some problems with someone. <br /> <br /> Apparently adding a teenager, the studio sought to attract young viewers. It also gave authors the opportunity to write episodes about teenage issues, alcohol, crime, etc. Such preaching episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment’s mass media to the countercultural movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law enforcement television, although Hawaii is 5-0, F.B.I. and many other shows also attempted to jump on the bandwagon, releasing television shows featuring irresponsible adolescents causing harm, lawlessness and crime. <br /> <br /> Adding a teenager to the cast made the Cartwrights more likely to show and solve problems, but these episodes seem very far-fetched and not very good overall. After Dan Blocker died, the series was lame for another year or so before it was canceled. Last season was pretty bad, because Little Joe was there, tracking his wife’s killers, and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe usually drank or otherwise remembered how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was she was killed. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I’ve ever seen the last episode of the series, and I’m wondering if they ever officially completed it in some way. By last year, only Ben (Lorne Green) really lived on Ponderos, since Adam departed (and never returned as a guest), and Hoss died, and Little Joe left after his wife (in the series) was killed by drifters. <br /> <br /> In general, the era of 1959-1965 is the best of this series. When Adam left, he gradually decreased. Most shows before 1970 are also pretty good. By 1970, the series struggled to be fashionable and relevant, and he lost a lot of his western flavor. The addition of Candy and teen also weakened the overall quality of the show, and Hossa's death (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western episode ever made, and out of 465 episodes that were filmed, at least one hundred of them is a great western drama! This is a pretty good record. Even the worst in Bonanza is better than in many other TV shows.
