I received it a few weeks ago and love it! It is modern, light, but filled with the true complexities of life. These are questions and answers, like other films of Eytan Fox. This is my favorite, along with Jossi and Jagger. This image is much larger, everywhere, than only those bubbles in which we can live. You don't need to be a Jew or a homosexual to enjoy it - I'm not, but the film goes straight to the top ten of my best films. At first it seems pure entertainment, but makes you wonder. The relationships we have to live with are superficial, meaningful, deep, fatal, as you call it. You do not know what will happen, and you do not know exactly where this story is going when you watch it for the first time. Worth watching several times. Fox films contain great bonus material - great music video and “creation” (including an explanation of the title, an interview with Lior Ashknazi, who plays himself in the film, and Arabs who have doubts about the Israeli lifestyle).
