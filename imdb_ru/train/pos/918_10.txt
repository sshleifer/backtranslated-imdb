If anyone is interested in receiving a copy of this film, please read the bottom of this description: The first CBS TV show on November 30, 2003, specifically for John's Christmas Search TV, is a continuation of the previous year City Without Christmas, repeating Peter Falk as universal guardian angel max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a small town divorced nurse whose depression ... due to the fact that the hospital she serves may be forced to close because of a $ 100,000 debt that is briefly taken when she notices a photo newspapers made by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Qubitt). The picture shows an act of courage committed by the brother of the fireman Noah Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left the city 25 years ago and has not been seen since. Hank would like to quietly slip back into the city without explanation or fanfare, but this is not possible when Noah publishes a $ 50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as “John of Christmas.” And there is something very, very curious in this photo: it also depicts a Santa Claus suit, which seemingly floats in the air without a passenger. This elusive “Santa” is, of course, the angelic Max, who occasionally pops up throughout history in different guises to solve problems, distribute advice, tie free subject threads - and even share a musical duet with talented daughter Kathleen. Socorro (Jennifer Pisana). <br /> <br /> INTERESTED TO HAVE A COPY: WRITE ME HERE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
