This is not a love song. <br /> <br /> My summary of this movie will be “Excellent”. <br /> <br /> Probably, the general public won't like it? it is the <br /> <br /> movie that forces you to participate. You observe, think and ask questions. <br /> <br /> Comparisons can be made using Deliverance (Theme / Theme) and, possibly, <br /> <br /> with The Blair Witch Project for a general style of filming. <Br /> <br /> However, this film is unique compared to both. <br /> <br /> Cinematic effects (solarization, freeze, blur, etc.) <br /> <br /> have been seen before, but they are used most often. effectively in this film <br /> <br /> to reinforce the plot’s natural tension. <br /> <br /> Acting untreated, threateningly and completely believable. <br /> <br /> This theme is a film about friendship; the title really gives <br /> <br /> a game. This is probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced or will really want. <br /> <br /> This is a love song.
