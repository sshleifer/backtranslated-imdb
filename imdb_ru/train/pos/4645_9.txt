This film is very interesting. I saw it twice, and it seems that Glover hit his head with a fingernail with what he says he wants to achieve. For example, I can say about the outrage that the director clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate fuss, which is an onslaught in each of our media centers, and about things that we, as a culture, should not “think” because of control over corporate media The indignation that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is clear both in its intuitive aggressiveness and beautifully in its poetic power. I'm glad I watched this movie, and it’s even clearer that Glover conceived something interesting with the second part of what will be a trilogy. It's good! ALL PERFECTLY. See also. People who consider this film "thoughtless" or "pretentious" really miss the boat. These are smart movies. If you can see it with his live performance, which he performs earlier with his books, this is also very annoying. The way you enter his mindset is really something. You will have experience!
