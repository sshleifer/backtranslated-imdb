In this first episode of “Friends,” we are introduced to the six main characters of the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Baffei, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and, ultimately, Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discover that Rachel Rich girl, who was Monica's girlfriend from school, left her fiance Barry at the altar, as she found herself not in love with him. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent of her father, receiving a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other hand, discovered that his wife was a lesbian and lost her because of Susan, her partner (We see him moving to a new apartment during an episode) <br /> < br /> In this episode, Monica understands (and ultimately sleeps) with Paul the "wine guy" who gave her a reason to be powerless since he divorced his wife. But in fact, he was just deceiving her. <br /> <br /> PS: I’m just brushing off Joey and Chandler's hairstyles this first season! =
