The characters of Somerset Maugham come to life in the "Human Slavery" of the RKO; but the film is too skeletal version of the novel, and Bette Davis stellar performance absorbs all the energy. Otherwise, this is the story of Leslie Howard (as Philip Carey); he dreams of becoming an artist, but he is told that he has no talent for art. As the movie progresses, Mr. Howard is trying to become a doctor. His efforts seem to point to some bad advices regarding art; Despite the success in medicine, his picture seemed easier - also pay attention to the symbolism of his disability, the “club” (explained in the film). <br /> <br /> On the way (right now, in this version), Howard falls in love with waitress Davis (like Mildred Rogers). Davis "Mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in an exciting speech when she says to Howard, among other things, that she had to "wipe my mouth!" After kissing him. Howard also plays well, but the story cannot explain his long-lasting charm and love for Davis; so their performances are in vain. <br /> <br /> However, the film is for acting, including some good players. Characteristic Bette Davis was known for inspiring the campaign “to enter” in the “Best Actress” award in 1934. For the record, she took third place. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - “It happened one night” <br /> <br /> 2. Norma Shearer - “Barrett Wimpole Street” <br /> <br /> 3 Bette Davis - “On Human Slavery” <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - “One Night of Love” <br /> <br /> ******* Human Slavery (06.28.34) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
