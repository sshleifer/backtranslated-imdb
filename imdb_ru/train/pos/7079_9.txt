I really liked it - I'm a big fan of films that confuse you and leave you many questions and ideas for discussion, and this was a star example. But then Terry Gilliam is always good at it (well, almost always. Let's just forget about Jabberwock and the Grimm Brothers, right?). <br /> <br /> I especially liked how he dealt with the theme of time travel. and the avoidance of paradoxes — how events of the past and the future intertwined and fed each other. <br /> <br /> It was really aesthetically well done - the artistic direction was really great, and I would like me to be able to see it on the big screen. Future scenes were in many respects similar to Brazil, and even current scenes were often truly visually appealing. <br /> <br /> But the most striking thing about this was that two actors took part in them, which I usually don’t really like, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both gave amazing performances here. Especially Pitt - I saw one or two films to the point that made me realize that he really can act (contrary to what I originally thought), but this one really surpassed them. I actually found that I was asking my friends at one moment: “Are you sure this is Brad Pitt?” This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (although, admittedly, it doesn’t say too much).
