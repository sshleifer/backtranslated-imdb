I think The Sopranos is an amazing show because of all the supporting characters in it. I bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest. At the moment in all 42 episodes the best of them is, of course, episode No. 3 “Denial”, “Anger”, “Acceptance”. This episode tells about my most beloved character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Philone. He was killed for having stolen the wrong truck and accidentally killed the truck driver. Brendan was awesome because he was one of the few characters who opposed Tony and his gang. In the end, he got a shot in the eye while taking a bath, and this is my favorite scene in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Philone for me # 1 And my second favorite character was Matthew Bevilacqua, who was killed after trying to kill Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Kiska shoot him in Huckleburn Park after they caught him and tortured him. My number 3 favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed immediately after the murder of Christopher. And finally, my favorite character number 4 is Chuckie Signore, one of Uncle Junior's minions. He was killed in Tony's boat. All amazing characters are dead. This is the only bad thing about soprano. All the cool guys are always killed. Do you know what would be great to change in soprano? They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell, and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Pauly because they need revenge. Brendan Philone must strike back !!!!!!!!! one
