If you were born around the time this film was finished and I had a liberal / open-minded household that I had, I’m sure that you first got to know how to go to see your parents in the early 80s dirty movies or very dirty movies. You know, not 100% pornographic but an alchemical mixture of real drama and pornography, or that you would penetrate their collection and priests in a plastic rectangular representation of such a film in a big Dookie machine called VHS. You were supposed to be very quiet and similar to ninjas, but who still had slight heart failure when, due to the fear of being detected, there was a huge pop noise when you press buttons like a tablet. Be that as it may, such films were sent to the depths of your consciousness, awaiting and awaiting reunification with such visual "art." Needless to say, this film fits into the above description for "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but perhaps because I am desensitized, I am more concerned about the subtleties. Did the creator tell us about deeper levels of human flesh and / or what could be considered true abominations, interracial relationships, bed frame masturbation, voyeurism, or could it be despair over social status, including murder, pedophilia / homosexuality or repressed sexual nature of elite women in 18th century France? Who can say, but despite the fact that Mr. Borovitsk’s taste for bright, rough sexuality is the “norm” for his work, I would say that this film really speaks to the viewer at a deeper level concerning cattle flesh. After I learned this, the story became much more interesting, with the exception of the dizzying value of shock, and therefore it is worth checking out.
