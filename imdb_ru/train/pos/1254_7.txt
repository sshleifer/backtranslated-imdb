Ed Harris's work in this film meets his usual quality standards, that is, he steals the screen from everyone with whom he shares it, and this includes the formidable Sean Connery. The film, more than sanctimonious, comes to life only in scenes where a lawyer interrogates Harris for another convict. This is a breathtaking, artistic control workshop. <br /> <br /> All the other actors are experts, and Connery is as reliable as Fishburne, but the story itself does not make itself felt. The plot is largely dependent on the premise that a black prisoner will always be subjected to ill-treatment and coercion by white law enforcement officers. It is an engine that keeps a story, right or wrong, and makes you feel a little cheated at the end. <br /> <br /> Still, worth a look to see Harris in action.
