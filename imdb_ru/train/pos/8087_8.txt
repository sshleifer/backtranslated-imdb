It looks like there are only two types of reviews on the web. Those who hate it and curse the name of Ralph Bakshi, and they love it and call it a brilliant business. I tend to be in the middle. I have to agree with most of the criticisms of this film (for example, the brutal cutting of the story, poorly rotoscoped characters, acting, etc.). But despite this, I still love this movie. Rotoscopying (when done correctly) adds an eerie dimension, like a character, and the final battle scene at the end of the movie is fantastic. Surreal scenes, when the chasers chase Frodo, stylish and well executed, and the music ... magic. Unfortunately, a bad movie is overweight, but if you can force yourself to ignore them, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> (Without a doubt, I will be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing it back, well, thatâ€™s life)
