Dina Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Reed - "Three Smart Girls" in this universal film of 1936, which introduces Dinn Durbin to the audience of the film. Ray Milland, Misha Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady also take part in it. This is a cute story about three young women who now live in Switzerland with their divorced mother and hear that their father (Winninger) is getting married again. Not seeing him for 10 years and knowing that their mother still loves him, they board the ship to America with the help of a housekeeper / nanny who decided to stop the wedding. Realizing that the alleged, called “Precious” (Barns) is nothing more than a gold miner, assisted by her mother (Brady), they organize her acquaintance with a rich graph. It is arranged by their father’s accountant (the king). The man he chooses is a full-time drunkard (Auer), but the girls take him for actual wealth (Milland). What a mess. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing film, not cloying and not too cloying, with some good performances, especially Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are beautiful and all do a good job. The emphasis, of course, is on the young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a well-trained singer. In fact, her voice in her youth is much more even than in adulthood - she has no problems with high notes, as she did later, because she weighed too much in the middle voice. She sings the adorable "Il Bacio" at the police station. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable things in the film is to see the father played by Charles Winninger, and not look for his children until he sees them. and recognize them. Barnes, as a gold digger, is not so young, but the mother of the girls looks up there, so the conclusion was probably that the elderly man was looking for his youth with a young, more charming woman. In fact, he finds the boy he sought in his daughters. <br /> <br /> “Universal” gives Durbin a big cluster of stars - she has the last frame in the film. Ray Milland was still paying his dues at this point, and probably even for film fans it would be a surprise how young and attractive he is. <br /> <br /> Very exciting and, of course, this led to the continuation and great success. Glory to Dinah.
