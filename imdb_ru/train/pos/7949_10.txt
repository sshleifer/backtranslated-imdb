SPOILERS WARNING <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: “An Incredible Journey” is an important film from my life, because it is the first film I remember when I saw the movie of my hometown as a 4-year scam. This story is based on the novel by Sheila Bernford and is the reason why it is impossible to write it off as a brainless clone of Lassie. <br /> <br /> Main story: two dogs and a cat live happily in the Siver Family, when a new husband of a mother of three children gets a job in the city, and they have to temporarily move to inner San Francisco, while the animals are sent to a ranch, to live a couple of months. The ties between animals and the children they watch are especially strong, and the golden retriever Shadow and the Himalayan cat Sacy, like children, are heartbroken, although the young and careless American bulldog, known as Chance, is a bit less worried and somewhat cynical (partly from - for his offscreen explanation, explaining that he was thrown as a puppy, put in an animal shelter and bought in the family), although his growth as a character during the story provides most of the important storytelling. <br /> <br /> Three pets leave the ranch and head for the wide and dangerous wilderness (by the way, fantastic wilderness), driven by the shadow instincts. On the way, they encounter several dangers, hoping to get home, and the family and ranchers suddenly begin to worry about the disappearance of animals. There are funny moments all over, a great dialogue between these three animals and funny lines (see memorable quotes), and a touching friendship that grows between the main characters during story-telling, alternating moments of sadness (such as when Sassi’s arrogance, when she tries to cross the river without getting wet, makes her fall into the river and wash off the waterfall, leaving a moment of loss, which is deeply felt by the audience). <br /> <br /> For some reason I do not see that the addition of the salvation of a girl lost in the desert adds to the story and the journey they make. Somehow it seems a bit unnecessary as part of the story. <br /> <br /> The end raises the stakes higher when the shadow falls into a hole at the railway station and, having injured his leg, hardly gets out and gives up, exhausted, followed by a chance to convince him to get out, telling him how he important for him and how he pushed them so far that it was not so easy for him to throw everything away. <br /> <br /> The fact that this scene (brilliantly filmed) is not completed leaves ambiguity that continues in the final scene when Chance and Sassi return home, but the Shadows are nowhere to be seen. Then, when everything seems lost, he slowly appears and reunites with his family. Conclusion Chance at the end speaks of the friendships that have developed between him and his comrades in the journey, and the realization that the house is actually from his long journey there leaves a wonderful epilogue to demonstrate how his character has grown, but also what the other two have. Wait a second, I think I'll cry ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I did not read the book of Sheila Bernford, so I do not pretend that I know the difference between a book and a film a lie. But this is a film that the whole family can watch, and although children will like talking animals, older viewers will understand the storyline better (as I discovered when I watched the movie again after a few years without even seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in the cinema, and I believe that if you have not seen it yet, then go and get it! <br /> <br /> And please avoid continuing (see My Review for Homeward Bound II!)
