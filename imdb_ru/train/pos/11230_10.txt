Hidden Frontier has been discussed and covered in several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and providing an example of unity that was Gene Roddenberry's mission. Their attention to homosexuality, depression, war, and the adoption of different races is at or above that of other TV shows and track movies. Production value began as less and changeable, but over 7 production seasons the action improved, the stories became more complex, and the visual graphics became smoother and more impressive. In the first episode of season 6, "Countermeasures", one of the largest space battles in the history of Trek takes place. The ships are well represented, and space battles are impressive and exciting. The real thrust to Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but the people, the interaction and growth of the characters. There are also nods to other Trek series and movies with places and characters that we all know. I recommend any Trek fan to check the Countermeasures, and you'll be hooked!
