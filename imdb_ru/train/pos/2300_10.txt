There are so many great elements in this movie! Reese Witherspoon's debut performance is amazing, of course, but also her chemistry with Jason London. The rating is wonderful, fresh and clean. James Newton Howard enhances the quality of any film he makes ten times. He also seems to be able to make films about the lost days of youth, do not forget to catch his points for the recent Peter Pan and the haunting gothic music of The Village. I first saw this film for about 13 or 14 years, and now Iâ€™m not just crying in the final, I shed a tear or two because of nostalgia. Show this film to your daughters. This will eventually become a movie of comfort for life.
