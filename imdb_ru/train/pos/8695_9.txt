Long ago, I watched this movie from the middle of the cable. I was in love with Maria Moronova then. I saw her again at Raul's meal. I was convinced that she was the hottest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> I may be biased in this film 9 out of 10. This is the only film that I have on the original tape.
