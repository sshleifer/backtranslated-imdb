This film is one of the few Indian films that will never disappear over time, and at the same time its appeal to spells will never diminish, even when Indian cinema turns into an abyss of artificially created pop culture, while training-oriented extras are accepted for enhance pt stylized songs for movies. <br /> <br /> Cinema speaks of the excellent skills of Joseph Verching, which emphasize the monumental and cinematic effect of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Gone were the days of excellent cinema, when each scene had to be cut and repeated many times before finishing, while careful attention was paid to creating and editing scenes. Some of his poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional tension, such as the case when Mina Kumari refuses to say "YES" as an endorsement for Nick ("Marriage Relationship") and goes down the slope while he is berserk in his injured madness. At the moment, Raj Kumar follows her, and the strong wind blew the Kumari by the wind on Kumar's feet ........ <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi will always remember with golden words in the annals of Indian cinema history for trying to complete this film is in record 12 years. He had to manage the filming of some vital songs without close-ups of Mina, because Mina Kumari, the lady in the lead role, was mortally ill and fought for her life in early 1971.
