Claire Denis returns to his theme of estranged fathers, men who resolutely follow their own bliss, not paying attention to the emotional losses in their family, but while Nenette and Bony from the earlier film live in the narrow world of Marseille, our study Louis Trebora in The Intruder takes us from a remote place along the French-Swiss border halfway around the world, to Korea and Tahiti. Again the film begins in the middle of the stream, when Louis, who is over sixty, has to cope with a sick heart, trying to maintain a high level of physical fitness. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence, since his cabin is a place of regular smuggling and shooting. Louis sleeps with a big knife under the pillow with rifles nearby. Denis is not in a hurry to promote the action, and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the border, including his son Sidney (Gregoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and a bunch of mustaches) who rejects him as "Madman": shown as a devoted father of two children. There are many short scenes that seem to be unrelated, give the impression of Louis and his environment. Ms. Godard’s camera work is exciting. The controlling metaphor is a heart transplant of Louis, for whom he travels to Korea, and then to Tahiti to find another son, who was not found, and where Louis's new heart rejects him just as Sydus rejected the old one. We are accustomed to the short scenes in the film of Denis, which are inexplicable: Neneta Riding on Boney feeds with a spoon; the drive of the shot Boni’s father, and then the shortest images of Boni with a gunshot wound to the head; the scene of Louis in the morgue with a corpse with a scar from the transplant, but with the body of Sidney. The consequence of the last two is rejection, real or imagined by the father, killing something indefinable in the son.
