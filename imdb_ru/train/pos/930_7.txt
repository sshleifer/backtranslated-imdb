I am sure that most people already know this story - the mean Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by three spirits (Ghosts of the past, the present and the upcoming Christmas) who illuminate part of their lives in the hope of saving their soul and changing its ways. The classic story of Dickens in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a favorite holiday favorite. <br /> <br /> While I was growing up, I watched the 1951 version with Alastair Sims in the lead role, and I believe that he is the defining Scrooge, I was impressed with this version, which was released when I was in high school . George S. Scott plays a convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors who play ghosts are pretty scary and formidable. David Warner is also a good Bob Crunch. <br /> <br /> This version is perfectly filmed and uses more modern shooting styles (for the 1980s), which make it more pleasant for my children than the black and white version of 1951. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy adaptation of the story, which I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
