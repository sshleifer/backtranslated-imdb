A very good film about martial arts, and Jet Li is the best, since the master himself is Bruce Lee. Lee is excellent as a discreet librarian / cop who saves time and time again. He has a presence and appearance that is attractive and believable like a kung fu king that you donâ€™t associate with. Francoise Yip is simply beautiful in the original mixed race, which is unique because of its mixed heritage, it is innocent and the Fads are all at the same time that I found unforgettable. The villain, a man with glasses and long hair, was also very good, but I can't find his name in the credits, can someone help me with this? Thank ! Enjoy Hak hap or Black Mask, in any language it is good fun!
