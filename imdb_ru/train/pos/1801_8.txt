I saw this film when it was first released in 1989. Then I liked him and still like him. But now I understand that this is a rather “grown-up” film with a G rating. This is especially true for death and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and House Deluxe work great together, and the singing voice of Reynolds is suitable for a landfill. There are some good songs, from optimistic (“Let's Make Music Together”) to frankly emotional (“Home to My Heart”). I found the plot to be good, although it does deviate once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie - one of the saddest in the animation. The film is worth experiencing.
