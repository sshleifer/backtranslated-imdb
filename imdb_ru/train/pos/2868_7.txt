First of all, I have to say that I am Portuguese, and I don’t usually spend my time watching Portuguese films, perhaps once a year or not even a single one ... <br /> <br /> ... And the reason in fact, the almost generalized idea between the Portuguese that the national paintings are terrible, very close to the worst ever made! However, in the last decade I start to be surprised when we remember the funny 40s, when “Leão da Estrela” and “Costa do Castelo” were among the best in their world, with films like “Pulsação Zero” or "Sorte Nula", as directed by Fernando Fragata, as well as with some actors and general music. <br /> <br /> This film is also good, not the type, because this is not a real comedy; in fact, this is a formal drama, a female drama, in which there are several unexpected funny pieces that cause humorous characters or funny things that happen to them, for example, a hypothetical journey to the Caribbean only to be laid. <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us several times; the actors are fine, the seats are regular, like the score; but the truth is that it all makes sense, then we can consider it a good effort for national cinema, which seems to start from the ashes like a phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese film, of course, you can choose the best option, but it is still one to be measured.
