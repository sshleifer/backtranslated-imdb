A very close and sharp description of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of a special 18-year-old boy who for the first time feels his cheerful love for another boy on vacation with a part of his family. <br /> <br /> I liked this film because of its extremely clear and surrogate narration, with all these “close-ups of sound” and quiet moments that were full of intense mood. <br /> <br />
