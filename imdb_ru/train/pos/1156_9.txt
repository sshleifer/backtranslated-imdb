A few years ago, I watched soap on TV. So I was interested in learning about this film, and I was so rewarded for having found it. This is a marvelous parody of soap, with jealousy, the usual insecurity of the actors, and all sorts of excesses. But most of all, there is a terrific cast and incredible script. How did someone get all these first-class actors to play in such a stupid movie? And how did this little film make the authors write perfect lines? I have never heard anyone talk about this film or even admit that I heard about it, but itâ€™s amazing and I highly recommend it. Sometimes I put it on while doing the house cleaning and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing, and fully enjoying it all beautiful. Congratulations to everyone who did this.
