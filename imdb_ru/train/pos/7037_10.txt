This is a brilliant political satire. It is no wonder why this was largely ignored in the United States: it exposes our murderous foreign policy to what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good film of this era, “Vacation,” was also completely rejected simply because it showed, exactly, that the USA is a military machine intended to torture, kill and maim civilians in its desire for complete world domination. <br /> <br /> A clever plot, a good game, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei, anyone?) And some fun scenes should have made this movie a hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are involved in massacres.
