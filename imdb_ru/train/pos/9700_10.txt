Somehow this film can be invigorating, bittersweet and soulful at the same time. Stars such as Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) enliven the tale. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate, agitated life with the most innocent eyes that one can imagine: a bird. <br /> <br /> Paulie begins her life as a little parrot, presented to a little girl (also played by Holly Eisenberg, also known as Pepsi girl) with speech disorders. While she is learning to speak correctly, Paulie too. However, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything said. The father of the military does not like a bird, so he is sent to a pawnshop and bought by an aging artist Ivy. She teaches his manners, etc., while traveling around the country to find the owner of Poly. The film continues with a few twists and turns of fate, until Paulie finds himself in the laboratory, where he is ultimately hidden in the basement, and is found by a Russian keeper, who was touched by the story of a bird. the plot corresponds to a simple metaphorical theme: language is a gift and a curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A wonderful blend of flute, digital base and horns makes the film a real ecstasy. Wide camera angles and breathtaking landscapes brighten the story even more. And, as a last point, puppets are plausible. (Unlike Star Wars, where Yoda resembles Muppet) This film is one of my favorite films, with the additional remark that my wonderful parrot of four years old has recently died. In general, I give this movie **** of four stars, two thumbs and a big hug.
