Well, it's definitely not like anything else, directed by Lynch. No supernatural things, no violence, profanity. However, this is a wonderful movie. This is a bit slow, but perhaps it was intentional, because this is the story of the old man's 6-week journey (this is my best guess for his duration). Characters are ordinary people, and therefore they are believable. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Anyone who has a sibling can relate to him. Lyle and Alvin don't even have to say anything. For a moment, they returned to the old days, and all the battles are forgotten.
