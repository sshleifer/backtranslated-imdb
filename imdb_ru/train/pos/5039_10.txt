Stunning. Absolutely awesome. This is a film about two children whose father suddenly had a vision. He claims that an angel visits him, and says that they need to kill "demons." He receives instructions later, and they start collecting demons, which, at first glance, are ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with an ax in the head and cut them, burying them in a rose garden. Their father claims that he can see their sins when he touches them. The film continues with a twist at the end. <br /> <br /> What I like about this film is that it perfectly reflects the weakness of human perception. Is their father completely insane? Or is he telling the truth? The audience remains to decide. Go judge for yourself and watch the movie. Now.
