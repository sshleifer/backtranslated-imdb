Theodore Rex is perhaps the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly an important milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this persuasive intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel unites with great directors of the 20th century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorsese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing short of breathtaking, and make any work of Spielberg looking trite and elementary. During its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar for filmmaking to levels never expected by directors. The concept of creating not just a dinosaur movie, but also an adaptation action, an exciting detective novel involving a “talking” dinosaur with a postmodern name, such as Theodore, and an existential policeman-womankind humanity, as we know it, has changed. The world can never be the same after having experienced such magnificent beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is very much like looking at the face of God and hearing Him say, "You are my favorite creation." This is one of the few films for which it is easy to DIE !!!
