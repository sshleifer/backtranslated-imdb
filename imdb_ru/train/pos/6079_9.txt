Shakespeare's plays have a way to transcend time. Language somehow overcomes the time barrier. but maybe the actors really do it. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment of Romeo and Juliet (version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio) did not dare to take another modern version of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Yago's character played so well the guy from Kenneth! even though Iago is really angry and despicable, the character played so well that he performs what Shakespeare intended to create for the character, a pleasure for the audience to hate. I have to say that Fishburn's performance here was really good. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to both Shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book).
