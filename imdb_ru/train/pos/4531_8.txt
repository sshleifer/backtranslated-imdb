This is a film about love, telling about love over the centuries. The film consists of the fact that Keaton is looking for a mistress in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and now (1920s). In all three cases, he is the usual weak Buster, and he fights with Wallace Beery for his ladyly love. It seems to me that of the three periods I liked the Roman most of all, although I admit that he was also the most fun. I really liked the scenes with the lion, who was obviously the guy in the costume, as well as the strange chariot races in the snow â€” but what I liked the most was seeing all of Keton's amazing acrobats. However, all three time periods were old-fashioned fun, and the film, although not the best, still remains an exceptional and enjoyable film. Check this!
