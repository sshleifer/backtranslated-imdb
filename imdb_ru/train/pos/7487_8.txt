I really liked this film because I am very interested in American history ... the years of Antebellum and the Civil War in particular. I recently bought it from a rack with previously viewed videos in a store in a supermarket, and I was very pleased to add this to my video history collection. Although they are not the films of the civil war, like Glory or Gettysburg, they talk about the pre-Civil War fraternity among the cadets at West Point. <br /> <br /> This may be a gray form of youth or military discipline, but I admire the history of the Cadet Corps from about 1830 to the brink of war. I imagine what it was like to sit in a classroom with other young people, learn to fight, and then apply lessons against my classmates! <br /> <br /> In fact, there were two classes Graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. the film does not mention this, with the exception of the mention of Henry A. Dupont, the first graduate of the May class; and George Custer, the last graduate of the June class. the reason for the two classes was not so much in the war, but as a result of the transition to a four-year course of study after several years of experiments with a five-year course (I think that I attended the first class for five years, the other for four). As the film shows, the cadets looked like brothers and often had nicknames for each other ... George "Fanny" or "Auti" Custer; Alonzo "Cushing Lawn"; James "The Beautiful" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class 1854), etc. I’m saying that this film is "Santa Fe Trail", as it should be, because this movie 1940, albeit a pleasant one, really makes up a story. Cadets from several different classes are issued together. JEB Stewart and George Custer are depicted as best friends and side by side to stop the John Brown rebellion in 1859 on the Harper Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Caster were never friends, but were enemies during the war. They met each other (I think for the first time) at Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was in the harbor raid on the Harper ferry, but Caster was still a cadet at the point where it happened). <br /> <br /> Fanny Custer plays a role in the “61 Year Class,” although his classmates, friends of Dev O'Neal and Shelby Peyton are fictional. John Pelham, two people you can watch. <br /> <br /> In any case, I really like this film or any film that opens the window to the middle of 19th century America.
