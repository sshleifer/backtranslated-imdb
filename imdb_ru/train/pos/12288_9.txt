House of the Spirits - a fascinating story about family intrigue, South American politics and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons embody Isabel Allende's novel with all his passion and tension. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons, like Esteban Trub, is very likely aging, and Meryl Streep in the role of Clara supports her gentle, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a beautiful couple fighting for family adoption in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, gives a very touching presentation. The countryside of Portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. The settings of Clara's house and Esteban's ranch are effective, and American period cars add pleasantly to the post-war atmosphere.
