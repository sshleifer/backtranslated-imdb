An example of how a Second World War documentary film should be shot using first-hand reports from real military and civilians who participated in this terrible conflict, and archived footage collected from about that time. a year and a half ago, without actually having any knowledge about World War II at that time, but it embraced me, and now I consider myself a fan of World War II, watching and reading everything I can find about it, but nothing compares this significant documentary is definitely worth buying a boxed set ............. <br /> <br /> This is quite a simple documentary making of the highest standard.
