This film definitely gives me a big thumbs up. These are witty jokes and even occasional stereotypical and derogatory views of Eastern European people made me stitches for most of the film. This plot is smart and 100% original, and you will be guessing throughout the entire movie. In this film, I was most impressed with Hilary Duff. It is clear and easy to see that she made a leap of faith, going beyond the chick-flick genre she was used to. Her accent is excellent, and her acting was surprisingly clear and well executed. This is the best performance I've ever seen with Hilary, and I have seen most of her films. Her character, Jonica Bebiya, is described as "Britney Spears from Eastern Europe," and this is evident from some of her manners and the song "I want to blow you up ... ... ... up." You also feel sorry for her, because her performance really captures you, Yonika is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack made me laugh throughout the film with her sometimes humor, and also with facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you laugh all over. I highly recommend this movie.
