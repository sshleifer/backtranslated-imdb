Over the years I have seen quite a few episodes of the cold event, starting from the episodes of the first season back in 2003-2004. And although most of them were good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but also had few competitors in the Emmy categories. Although some may disagree with the content of the story (that is, the romantic relationship between men), I doubt that anyone could observe this without being deeply moved by their spirit. <br /> <br /> The story of the case was reopened based on the testimony of a dying drug dealer. The two main actors are two policemen in the 1960s named Sean Coop (who is also the victim, who carries the last name Coop) and his partner Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In this story, Coop is the lonely, veterinarian of the Vietnam War, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners in the police and form not only friendships, but also secret romantic relationships that they both have to hide from the deeply and clearly homophobic culture that was prevalent at the time. <br /> <br /> The memory of their lives is mostly black and white, with pieces of color scattered from time to time. Examples are their red police car, yellow curtains, gently blowing by the window in the bedroom of Jimmy, where his wife Jimmy watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss each other while intoxicated. It seemed to me interesting that in scenes with memories only selected objects were painted, and everything else - in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and rationale. <br /> <br /> Explicit homophobic tension between fellow patrol officers and two central actors only increases the intensity of the episode. One key emotional scene was when Kupu was confronted by his father after the baptism of the child Jimmy. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected officer in the squad, confronts Coop about rumors of Coop's relationship with Jimmy. At this moment, you can feel pity for Kup, as the shame and shame of Kup's father fell on Kup: "You will not disgrace our family ... and you are not my son either." - clearly indicates hostile views on same-sex relations of that era. <br /> <br /> Additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room, where Coop and other officers go for it after Coop and Jimmy labeled "Batman and Robin Gomos." <br /> <br /> With regard to the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it is obvious that Coop wanted more than Jimmy in his life. As soon as he sees the tension in Jimmy’s face, when he has to choose between his devotion to his wife and children, his church and yet his immortal devotion to Kupa. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy leaves Kup, realizing that he cannot have Kup and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop was killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed because he knew about drug money and police corruption, which have reached the highest level. <br /> <br /> The most touching scene in general, this episode occurred when Coop, who was dying in a police car dying, quietly said his last words on his police radio to his partner: “Jimmy ... we were the lucky ones. Do not forget about it. "<br /> <br /> The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the entire episode. I liked the final scene with actor Chad Everett, who still plays the grieving Jimmy, only much older and obviously bored by his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this episode and consider it the Best. It is without a doubt the most well written, well played and well made of all the episodes of Cold Case I have ever seen.
