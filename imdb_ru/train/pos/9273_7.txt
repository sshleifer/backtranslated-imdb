In Iran, the Islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still continue to live their lives, usually just doing what you expect, for example, go to football matches to cheer the national team as it prepares to qualify for participation in the World Cup. Except that women are not allowed to go to the football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> Often a funny little film tells about a small group of women who were caught wading into a football stadium, and a small group of bored soldiers were assigned to guard them in the pen near the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to support the team (there is nothing subversive there) and the small human touch on the life of each person as a whole gives a pretty good comment about humanity and ideology. <br /> Amateur acting, good script and dialogue, really nice movie. Bend, like Beckham, a kind of - ardent heart and joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people.
