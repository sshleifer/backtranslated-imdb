I like these films: smart and well-designed, entertaining, exciting, well-played and beautifully made. No one — not even Pacino — is chewing on a landscape *, trying to stand out; One of the most effective moments of the film (Ayelo stops at his favorite convention from the springboard) is frightening precisely because of his restraint. <br /> <br /> Not as good as, say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL of a similar fabric: involving the mind, as well as the eyes, ears and the heart. Why such well-developed entertainment failures in the box office no one guesses. <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino experiences this in one particular scene, but precisely because it is required. Great scene too.
