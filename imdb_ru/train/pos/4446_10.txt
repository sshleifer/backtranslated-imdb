Yes, I call it a perfect movie. Not one boring second, a fantastic cast, mostly obscure actresses and actors, a huge number of characters who are all clearly defined and who all have clear motives with which I could sympathize, perfect lighting, clear black and white photography, a suitable soundtrack , intellectual and harmonious design of the scenery and fascinating story that works. This is one of those super paintings on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest, a goal that everyone should strive for. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stenvik is awesome. This actress could not do anything, and from the melodramatic side she was always easy. No hysterical flashes with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than a screen goddess like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this film confirmed my opinion. Always strong, like nails, and at the same time expressing true feelings. It is fair to add that she also received many good roles in her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title is very well suited for this movie. It's about desires, human desires, I think everyone can understand. In fact, in this film, no one seems to be plotting intrigue, all the characters act impulsively, everyone wants to be happy without harming anyone. The sad fact that this most often leads to complications leads to dramatic content, which I will not go to. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that this film speaks of young people, about growing up and the need to compromise. The film that I most associate with this film is Alfred Hitchcock's “Shadow of Doubt”, it creates a similar atmosphere of an idealized and at the same time caricature Town of America. This story bears a certain resemblance to the much sharper Fritz Lang film “Battle at Night,” filmed a year earlier, in which Stanbike plays in a similar role. I can also recommend this.
