The story tells about Jet Li, who must fight with his old friends. But there is one problem, friends are super fighters. The film is filled with blood, super action and the best tricks forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-actor. Of course, the film has a typical HK-Fun. But I like it! In Germany, the "Black Mask" is not cut.
