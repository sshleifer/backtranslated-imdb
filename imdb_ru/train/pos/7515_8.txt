I know about Betty Page for many years. Her soft-gang porn images from the 1950s have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today. The style of "Betty Page" is also still very popular in the heterosexual world of fetishes and today remains as distinctive as it was then. Therefore, I watched this film with a little acquaintance from the very beginning. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was very interesting to see how such figures as Irving Clow, John Willy and Bunny Yeager are recreated in the film ?? everyone considers pioneers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job creating the desired atmosphere of sexual repression and hypocrisy in America in the 1950s, along with sexuality, which, by today's standards, was innocent to the extreme. I especially liked the use of monochrome and color as a visual reduction of the emotional and spiritual climate in which Betty found herself. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol perfectly showed the character of Betty in all its manifestations. innocent sexuality and all its complete naivety. Betty loved to look beautiful, loved attention, did not see anything wrong with naked bodies, and enjoyed dressing up in “silly outfits” for the camera. Fundamental sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires — everything that aroused was completely lost to her. To this day, she still does not understand “what all this fuss is about” when it comes to her photographs or their content in S & M. <br /> <br /> It’s not that she’s uneducated or too simple so that I understand that she simply does not understand fetishism and will never understand. There is no harm there. Betty Page is just who she is. The film is very well reflected. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s, which Miss Harron portrayed and she wrote with Guinevere Turner, makes me really happy that I live on that day and in that era, which I myself am. Hypocrisy and repression combined with tremendous ignorance about our sexuality unite in a frighteningly suffocating world. In the film, this is clearly seen, and Betty experiences all this with her unshakable faith and unchanging naivety. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this film was a little slow, but hit all the points that Miss Harron tried to hit. im good I would recommend this film even to those people who practically do not know who Betty Page is and what impact she had on American culture. For those who have such interests, then this film is a must see.
