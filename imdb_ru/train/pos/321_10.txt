I do not know how or why this film has a poor IMDb rating. This film, accompanied by “I'm Curious: Blue,” is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will let you down in this film is that if you don’t like the process of the film, you don’t need either psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic ramming <br /> <br /> This is not movie you want to watch to relax. This is a movie that you want to see, like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** THE SUMMARY CAN BE CONTAINED A SPOILER OR TWO ******* <br /> The main thing in this film is that it mixes the entire movie with film, but it does this in such a way that sometimes you forget that fiction is not real. <br /> <br /> The film is similar to many films in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary about the social system of Sweden at that time. Which in many ways is still relevant today. Interview with a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. The story of director Vilgot Schomane, who makes a film ... he deals with the relationship with his star in the film and how he never had to communicate with people with whom work. <br /> <br /> 3. The film that Vilgot takes. This is a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2), who is young and very politically active, she is shooting a documentary (IE. # 1.). She also came of age in her sexuality and freedom from it. <br /> <br /> The magnificence and sheer brilliance of “I'm Curious: Yellow / Blue” is how these three elements come together. At one moment you are watching an interview about politics, and the next is what the interviewer does behind the scenes, but it does it so well that sometimes you forget that this is a story. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamic between “yellow” and “blue”, which, if you see one, you should see another. "Blue" is not a continuation at all. I will try to explain it as best I can, because, as far as I know, no film has done this, although it is an excellent technique. <br /> <br /> Think of “Yellow” as a living creature, real events in 14 scenes. Full story. <br /> <br /> Think of “Blue” as all things WITH RESPECT TO 14 scenes in “Yellow” that you haven’t seen, which in itself is a complete story. <br /> <br /> In essence, these are parallel films ... the same story told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> I didn’t see the first 30 minutes of the Blue that I fully understood Yellow This film changed my view of the film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
