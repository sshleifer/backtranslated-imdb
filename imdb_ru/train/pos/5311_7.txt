The most accessible film by John Waters today is one of his best, given that he reduced all the hatred and outright vulgarity, which seem to litter most of his previous work. Of course, nude and sexual links are still present, at least they are presented in a <br /> <br /> style that cannot be considered too disgusting or disgusting. Due to the large choice of actors, this film really revealed the stupidity associated with contemporary art, and the subjective nature of your contemporary artist. Funny and a little carefree (if possible for Waters), this is one of those films that I would watch on a rainy day.
