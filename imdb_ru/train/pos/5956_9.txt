Yes, this is a film with a very low budget. Thus, the acting is not award-winning, and sometimes the action is slow, because the directors shoot longer episodes, rather than a million episodes, which are then edited in the film. This film compensates for this outstanding script, which is serious about vampirism, explains it and develops from it a complete plot. In addition to the vampire story, we get detailed genetic information, information about laws and law enforcement, martial arts, philosophical thinking and good metal music. Glory to Dylan O'Leary, director / screenwriter / main actor. It is outside of me how this person could fulfill all these roles and do them so well. I think that in order to appreciate this film, you need to be well-versed in various topics to see that the writer has done a lot of research and knows about all these things. Also there is an excellent camera work, interesting camera angles and one attack of the underwater vampire - something I have not seen before, but which pays homage to the attack of the underwater zombie in Zombie Fulci. Casting is good because a sexy woman is really sexy. The head vampire also looks perfect for the role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a low budget horror movie, there should have been more nudity. If you want to watch an original vampire movie with a great story, this movie is for you. I look forward to the future projects of Mr. O'Leary.
