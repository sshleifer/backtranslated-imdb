In the opening scenes of this film, a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another personâ€™s bathroom and lit all the lights. It must have been a very difficult case for 1936, but rather a way out and having nothing to do with the film, Robin Hood did not appear, as far as I could see. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "Whales of August," 87, was very young and attractive and played one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisy never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her night dresses and the so-called bathing suit on her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "Spiral Staircase", 46. Daisy even suggested marrying Johnny in the Ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a great couple, one of whom was very rich and the other a very bad reporter. Outside the stage, Davis and Brent had a real ardent love affair, and this is a good reason why sparks arose when these two appeared in this film. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this movie is for you!
