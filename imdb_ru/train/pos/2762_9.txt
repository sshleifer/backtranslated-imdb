This film is about to be my favorite piece of celluloid. There really is not much that I need or want to say. Except maybe “Watch this movie” and “Enjoy the great work of Daniel and Pascal,” which takes you through this neat, funny and heartbreaking story about “holding the eighth day” - your own day! <br /> <br /> Watching this movie made me seriously think about how I spend the eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us are wasting precious time on what we need. Or, if this is a pleasant career, or just a passion for TV shows and ball games. What we are inclined to miss is the satisfaction of the fact that you are something for another person - to change the situation. About taking a place and time to be spontaneous and alive - NOW! (on the eighth day) ... At least that was what I got from Eighth Day.
