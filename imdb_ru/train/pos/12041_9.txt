This is a simple old creepy ghost story. I showed it to some of my friends in my film club, and they were fascinated to the end! No blood or blood - just a good old-fashioned wait. It starts from the very beginning, builds and builds. The ending is a true twist that took me by surprise. <br /> <br /> Well directed and well acting. It is also a “historical play”, created in the 1920s, which added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed that I received a book by Susan Hill from Amazon. The film follows the book quite closely. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not available on DVD. My copy of VHS. This, along with “Haunted,” are probably two of the best ghost stories I’ve ever shot. Which only shows that a bit of creativity surpasses "in your face", caked on any given day!
