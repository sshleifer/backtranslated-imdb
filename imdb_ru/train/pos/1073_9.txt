It took us a couple of episodes to “get into” the Dark Angel as a story and a series, since we were moving from The Sopranos, a completely different basis of mentality. But as soon as we understood the essence of the series, we were hooked very quickly. It is a pity that the series ended precisely when it was just beginning to turn into an excellent category: “Dark Angel” was much more than your usual television series. He kicks ass and shakes when action takes place, but the interaction of characters and society’s reaction to “mutants” reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face (and create) every day. The fact that the story unfolds in the future preserves a surrealistic mood and prevents the rubbing of anti-discrimination information into our faces (and therefore does not destroy “fun” for those who do not like being lectured during entertainment), but each event and human interaction and Society remains relevant to the present. We all make judgments, face our own prejudices, but in the end, the question is who you are: do you sit and close your mind, or do you get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight, for the sake of survival or justice, this series gives them the opportunity. For those who have never had to deal with this issue, this series “penetrates” into this message under the guise of a pure action movie. It is much more well done and well written than most TV shows; I am very disappointed that it ended before it could really kick in the swing.
