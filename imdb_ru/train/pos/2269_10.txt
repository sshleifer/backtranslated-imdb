I just recently read the novel "Mother's Night", for some time already I own a DVD and watch it very often. Several films that I have, and which I have seen, made me think and question as much as Mother's Night, I am amazed at the brilliance of not only Vonnegut, but also the translation of his text on the screen. <br /> <br /> Do not shoot or watch this film on VHS, this should be done on DVD, and it should be accompanied by the director’s comments on the film. To see how they took a fairly simple story, but complicated in its essence and dialogue, and made it work so well, I think that every viewer will be amazed. <br /> <br /> Gaps in the film are just some of the text, and don't distract him too much, the film may be a book, and this is the best adaptation I've ever seen. I so strongly recommend both the book and the movie together that it can be a disservice simply saying “go and see.” <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do that.
