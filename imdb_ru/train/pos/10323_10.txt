This is a VERY entertaining movie. Several of the reviews that I read on this forum were written by people who seem to think that the film was an attempt at serious drama. THIS WASN'T BEEN MADE BY THIS METHOD ... This is an extremely pleasant film, performed in the cheek tongue. All the actors are having fun entertaining us. Combat sequences are lively, lively and, above all, not free. The so-called “Green Death”, used in several cases, is not, as I read in one review, “terrible”. Several reviewers criticized the martial arts struggle between Doc and Moresh at the end of the film. Hey, calm down ... Once again, I remind everyone that this is a funny movie. Each stage of this “battle” was signed, which added a funny aspect. The actors did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is NOT one of those martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice for playing Doc. Another nice touch is the unique manner in which the fate of the “bad guy” (Sea) is decided. I promise you that if you do not take this film very seriously and just watch it for fun, you will spend 100 minutes in the most pleasant way.
