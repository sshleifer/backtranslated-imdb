Well, for starters, it was actually Clausen’s most elegant film for this date. <br /> <br /> This person always has a sense of characters with a small amount of humor, but I think that in this film he adds a dimension that is not parallel to everything he did before. His work — in very black and white words — was accepted by a wide, but not that critical audience, and we always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a particular way of letting the audience know what to say. <br /> <br /> However, in Villa Paranoia, for the first time, he is surprised by unprecedented wisdom and respect for minorities. Not only ethnic, but also normal people, which you tend to forget. Set in Jutland - in the "country" - it deals with the eternal problem of lack of love, but in a close and sometimes brutal manner that makes you look and keep you focused. And besides, he himself manages to play b ****** d! A real b ***** d who wants the right things, but doesn't have a clue how to get there, and therefore people suffer. Bitterly. <br /> <br /> I would say that this is one of the best films I have seen this year, and I’m really looking forward to its next one.
