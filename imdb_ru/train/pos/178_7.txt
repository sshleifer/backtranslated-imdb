Protocol is the movie of Goldie Hawn, starring with a sparkling cocktail waitress, who rescues an Arab guest one night from a murder attempt. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job, working for the US government. Will the corridors of power in the capital of our country ever be the same? Hawn, as usual, is gorgeous, although “The Protocol” is not as funny as her best film “Private Benjamin”. But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
