I like this movie. The scenery was spectacular, the plot had nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. However, in two directions, “Rob Roy” scored much higher than average. First, I rarely saw a “popular” film in which the quality of the dialogue was so high. There were a lot of verbal strokes and pushes to accompany the brilliantly staged sword game. I could cite many examples, but why do I need this? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film understood the principle, rarely recognized more. For the success of the drama, you need not only a hero, but also a truly believable villain. If you don’t have one, it’s not very pleasant to root for the good guys. And “Rob Roy” has not one, but three - Count Montrose, his henchman Kilarn and Archie. Not one-dimensional villains, but quite dense and very nasty. It requires a bit more patience than Braveheart - there is more dialogue here, and the accents are a bit tough, but this is a much cleverer and more delicate part. (As I said, I liked this movie!)
