This documentary has been shown on RTE and BBC in recent months. Having watched it twice, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the media and making documentaries. <br /> <br /> Originally, this documentary was intended to tell in detail about the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. The Irish team set off with these intentions. What happens when they get to Venezuela is amazing, as they personally observe the attempt to overthrow the rebel groups (especially the oil concerns in Venezuela) Chavez and his government. We, the audience, are witnessing how the media manipulate the situation and actually support the overthrow of Chávez, distorting the events that occur as the coup intensifies. <br /> <br /> This is a really excellent documentary and a wonderful piece of work by several novice directors. <br /> <br />
