This is a great, ridiculous horror film, which captures the essence of the obsession of the middle and the end of the 80s with what supposedly evil metal music was. I remember being scared of metal teens when I was a kid. It does not help that I found a defiled grave in the cemetery of my hometown, when I was ten years old. It turns out that this strange metal child dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some strange victim to Satan. So maybe such things somehow kept me from the metal for a while, but I love them now when I was 24 years old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD for 6 bucks and expected it sucks because of the lame cover But, to my surprise, he ruled. It's all about the extraordinary demonic power of metal. And you have to love the scene where the guitar shoots lasers and vaporizes the headbangers in the crowd. This movie is great if you like 80s metal and bad movies, this movie is for you. 9/10!
