At a time when Hollywood makes money, showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs and war, a film appears that reminds us of the concept of “Indomitable Spirit”. If you feel depressed, this film will free your mind and make you fly. We all know how hard life can be, sometimes we need to be reminded that perseverance and courage will help us cope with the situation. This is what this film has done for me, and I hope it will be for you.
