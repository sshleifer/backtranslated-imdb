This film is a real masterpiece, it really is. Rarely do you come across such a stunning click, full of fun, laughter, a broken heart, and a little drama to keep you in good shape. <br /> <br /> This Homeward Bound family movie tells the story of three brave pets who went across the Rocky Mountains trying to find their owners after the changes they pass through and the obstacles they encounter along the way. One of the truly amazing things about this film is its ability to give human characters to animals - voice acting is good. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise, and courageous, and watching him trying to save Sassi in the river was a very powerful and exciting moment. Chance - who would not love a dog like Chance? He should be the most mischievous and cute puppy ever shown on the big screen. And Sassi is very witty for a cat - she made me stitches when she mocked the keeper; â€œHere is Kitty Kitty Kitty ... not in your life, plump. <br /> <br /> There were also many well-done emotional scenes, such as the Sassi, climbing over a waterfall (I was really afraid for her), Shadow falling into a ditch (almost in tears), and then a fantastic ending when all three pets back home ... including the good old Shadow! <br /> <br /> Beloved for all times - anyone who does not like this film should simply not love animals. Rent it or buy it now, and you will have happy memories that will last a lifetime.
