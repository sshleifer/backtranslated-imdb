Well, to be honest, I watched the preview of this film and thought to myself what the producers think? Hatton, Jolie, and Spiritual? How could a monotonous actor compete with the natural power of Jolie on the screen? But surprisingly, both had such chemistry, which showed intense concern without a kiss. Even David's humor matched the Jolie spark and fire. As for Hutton, he played a psycho very well, unlike Davidâ€™s calm life-threatening situation. Overall, I was very impressed with the writing and character development. I gave him 8 stars.
