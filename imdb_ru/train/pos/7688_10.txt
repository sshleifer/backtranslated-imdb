Back in 74, Erik Monte made the classic T.V Good Times show. JJ has always been my favorite and I love watching Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmy Walker always seemed to be a star, not Esther Roll. John Amos most of the time felt a little jealous of Jimmy Walker's popularity, when millions of fans began to sit and watch the Good Times. Drinking KOOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 years old when he came out and 8 when he ended. Instead of 1974-1979 Everything had to go longer than in the 1980s, when I was just growing up.
