When this film was opened in 1976, the legend says that it was greeted with immense mockery and contempt - it was considered a failure. I remember very well how Ebert gave him one star, and allegedly condemned her in Cannes. <br /> <br /> Obviously, these people did not understand the film, which is not so difficult to understand, because it is very esoteric, dark and multi-layered. in ways that still hit me. Reading many reviews, I find (even after 7-8 views for many years) many elements of the film that I previously viewed. But even without understanding the many psychological reasons for this story, it is still a burdensome suspension ... even if you just accept the increasing paranoia and persecution that hits the title character of Polanski as a tsunami wave during his two-hour run. br /> <br /> Studying the source material - an excellent novel by the underrated novelist Roland Ax - reveals more intriguing layers. Trekovsky Polanski is a milquetoast of the highest order. Although at first he seems to be another light soul, one gradually understands that he is one of those people who seem to float aimlessly through life, allowing her to direct him. It seems that he has little strong feelings for his likes and dislikes. He discovers that he is gently pushing this way and that, but he never seems to become too bent, no matter what. This vague weakness is more noticeable in the novel than in the film, but there are hints at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Staging a play for the apartment of a woman, Mademoiselle Schul, who is in hospital, recovering from a recent suicide attempt, seems to be the boldest thing he has tried (even effectively reducing the deposit price in the transaction). However, he soon discovers that he pays for his “good thing” more than he is not indifferent, as he finds himself in the center of the maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic, control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign. human life, such as a night walk or a knock on the door. <br /> <br /> Instead of defending the position, Trelkovsky is increasingly moving away from the situation, he is seized with paranoia and a sense of persecution. He becomes obsessed with Chowl, imagining himself like her, dressing like her, and so on. As his own personality quickly begins to wear off with his own madness. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever doubted Polanski’s fearlessness as an artist, they would be advised to watch this movie. His trademark black humor is noticeably (and sometimes embarrassingly) displayed here, and God bless him, he makes it out of himself. This is a tour de force performance in one of the richest, riskiest and most gothic horror films ever created. What more people have not seen is a real crime.
