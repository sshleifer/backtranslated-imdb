The fifth feature of Mitchell Lizen as a director, and he shows his versatility, directing the musical, after his previous films were heavy dramas. He also plays a cameo as a conductor. <br /> <br /> You can say that this is a film with a preliminary code, and it didn’t take anything like that in the US for quite a long time (for example, more than 30 years). Leisen shot musical numbers in such a way that they looked like what the public would see - without wide-format pictures or on top of Busby Berkeley. What I find amusing or interesting is that you never see the audience. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the roles are rather faceless, and Jack Okey and Victor McLaughlan play their usual characters in the movie. Gertrude Michael, however, gives a little spark. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are interesting and good (especially “Rhapsody of the Rhapsody” is funny), but the drama is unconvincing and falsified - three murders are too much and the minimum emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could be much better.
