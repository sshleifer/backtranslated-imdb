Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and other adventure films that were popular in the eighties. Wayne Crawford plays the role of Jake Speed, an adventurer who always battles villains wherever he goes. With their assistant, Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), they run around the world looking for some action (and decent plot lines). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins), whose sister was kidnapped by an evil white slave trader (John Hurt). Can she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her save her brother or sister? <br /> <br /> A juicy and stupid film that doesn’t claim to be what it isn’t. I have to give this recommendation. This is if you like movies in which you like to have fun, and for those who do not take everything at face value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
