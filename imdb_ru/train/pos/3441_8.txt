This film is incredibly realistic, and I feel that I appreciate crime very well, which many people do not understand due to lack of experience. Many people who think they can understand what is happening in the victim's head are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in her role as Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly brave movie. It looks at rape from a different, more realistic point of view than any other film I've ever seen on this subject. The end took a long time, but I know that many victims represent such justice, since the probability that an attacker will be sent to prison for a crime is about 1%. It's nice to see a film that is closer to reality than many dare.
