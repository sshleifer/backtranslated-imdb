As with the guys at school, we have to give it a thumbs up. Even the Grim Ripper made us smile. These two alien things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the most stupid, but also the funniest in the whole movie. This is much better than the first. And yet for some reason I feel like I am missing something. Something big. Something important. Made a better home and girlfriends. No, I would say better villains. Use clones instead of robots. I gave it 7 out of 10 because of these two robots. <br /> <br /> Grim Ripper, do not worry, he is not a deadly look, it's funny. When he fell from the sky, I divided the gut. Splat, I'm not sure about these aliens. Where are they? Scientists? Never.
