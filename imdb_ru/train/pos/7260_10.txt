Hello everyone, my name is Larisa. I am 13 years old, when I was about 4 years old, I watched curly Sue, and it knocked me off track. I actually watched this movie about 30 minutes ago, I just finished watching it. , Alisan Porter is a really good actor, and I like this film. It's so funny when she deals the cards. Every time I watch this movie at the end, I cry, so to speak, I know that I am only 13 years old, but this is such a touching story, it is really strange that Alisan is now 25 years old. Every time I watch a movie, someone is always young, and the movie comes out a year after he shot it, and when you watch it and find out how many years the person in the movie is really interested in how they can go from one age to the next. Like Harry Potter. This film was also wonderful, but Daniel was about 12 years old in the first film, and I was about 11. So, how could he from 12 to 16 years in about 4 years, and I am only 13. I'm not sure if he is now I am 16 years old, I think he is almost 18, but it is a bit strange when you watch one movie, and the next one is about 4 years old, and then when they were only 1 in the last one. I'm not sure that I have a big imagination, and I like to insult him. I am a computer man, but I like to do a lot of things for children. I am very clever, like a curly Sue in a movie, but one thing I don’t like in a movie is when this guy calls his foster family and makes him remove the curly Sue, I would kill this guy if he really did it in real life Well, I'm going to stop writing, I know that I write a lot sometimes, but children really need a lot, and if they don’t do it, children will never learn. <br /> <br /> Larisa
