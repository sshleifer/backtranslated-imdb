One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old when I first saw this film, and since then it has always been a favorite. Music numbers are remembered. In the 60s, people who played musicals actually had musical talent (unlike the CERTAIN Academy Award, which is awarded to the current musical in a big city in the Midwest). All the main roles were superbly performed ... Ron Moody, like Feigin, shines, as does Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was the formidable Bill Sykes (fortunately, he has no musical numbers, laughs), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wilde as Dodge were also great. Mark Lester looks like an innocent wretch, which Dickens wanted when he wrote a book! Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers who perform in “consider themselves”, “I will do everything”, “who will buy” and “will be back soon”, many of them were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
