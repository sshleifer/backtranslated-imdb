Remember the early days of Pay Per View? I know, and I almost remember the number you had to call to actually make a movie on your TV. As a child, we always wanted to rent a playboy, but this meant that we needed to call someone from PPV and ask to rent it. And then you have the courage to do it, and you will watch the four hours of the soft core without any shit. Well, the reason I raise this is because this film was also on PPV. And I remember almost every scene that was in the supplement. In the past few years, I was delighted with having received all the wonderful films that I used to see as a child, and that was one of them. This is one that is difficult to turn off. All the star actors are trying to make a perfect bankrupt, but nothing happens. There are many good banking capers, and this one should fall into this category. He has enough action and laughter to sustain him. check it out if you dare!
