“Father is still on a business trip” was the headline of the review after the premiere of “Promise me this” at Cannes. I understand why many people think that the same thing, but Kusturica’s unique expression is still present in his new film, and that’s why critics cannot touch him. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from a lack of concentration or fear of empty space, he is still unique and not spoiled. Surprisingly good performance Stribor Kusturica. Much more close-ups and fewer landscapes than Life Is A Miracle. Maria Petronievich has a world-class fatal potential, please do not spoil it. Of course, I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
