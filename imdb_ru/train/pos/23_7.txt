So the music was poorly written and, as a rule, poorly sung (although Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sounded pretty good). And so they destroyed the fourth wall at the end, forcing the king and his nobles to sing about the “battle” with the cannibal, and to praise the efforts of Puss in Boots, when they rightfully should not have known about it. /> <br /> Who cares? This is Christopher Friken Walken, makes a film based on a fairy tale, sings and dances. His acting style is very well suited for this role, as an insidious, mischievous Puss, who seems to give his master more and more serious problems, but in fact he has a plan that he conceived seven or eight moves in advance. And if you've ever seen Walken in one of his villainous roles, then you * know * that the ogre bit him at the end when Walken drove him into a trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie and a must-see for anyone who loves the unique style of Christopher Walken.
