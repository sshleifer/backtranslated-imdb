I have to say that from the very beginning, when I watched the Stargate film, I was not amazed or something like an ordinary sci-fi film with great potential, although the film was not as amazing as other sci-fi movies. Movies such as Star Wars or Aliens that, if you're a fan of science fiction, admit that one of these two titles is amazing, although I’m not a hardcore science fiction fan like some, remember one line from any of of these films i'm not a big worship wearing Star Wars T-shirts, in fact, if you saw me, I would look like a normal person to you, well, a little distracted from the topic, well, my point is that you don’t need to be a science fiction fan to love this wonderful series, which, unfortunately, ended after 10 amazing seasons, with no reduction in quality as it approaches the end, in 2006. <br /> <br /> Although I didn’t really like the film, I was looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you that special effects were only one of the main Monkeys in the series, the chemistry between the characters just shook me with special effects , were just as good, if not better, than most science fiction shows held today. I have to admit that I would never go to Sci-Fi if it were not for StarGate, and my dad, who actually brought me to Sci-Fi when I was about 6 years old, and I'm glad that he did, otherwise If I had, I wouldn’t see such bright shows as SG1, which, in my opinion, sets the benchmark for almost all science fiction TV shows and movies, mostly if the new science fiction TV series is no better or not as good as SG1, you should not watch it. in fact, this is the best science fiction show to date, and if you do not watch it, it means that you have no idea what you are missing!
