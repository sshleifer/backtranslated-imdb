Ernst Lubich's contribution to American cinema is huge. His legacy is an outstanding group of films that will live forever, as in the case of "Shop around the corner." This film was converted into other less prominent films and musical pieces, without the charm or elegance of its own Mr. Lubicz and a certain version. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked together in several films. Their characters in this film stand out as an example of how to be in a film, almost not posing to act at all. Both stars are delightful as pen-friends who do not know each other, but whose fate forced them to work together in the same store in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic films worked so well is because of the amazing acting techniques made by the studios in the film for the film. Here we have a wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the store owner. In addition, we see how Joseph Shildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, work impressively, forcing us to believe that, yes, they are in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That is why these films will live forever!
