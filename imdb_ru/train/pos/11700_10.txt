I read most of the comments on this movie. I have seen this film (and the entire series about prophecies) many times with family members of all ages, we all liked it, and it just made us think about what we already knew from reading and studying the Bible about rapture and the end times. Nobody got scared or hurt, as I read in some posts. The film is based only on biblical facts. I have seen a lot of recent films “Sorrow”, “Armageddon” and so on, and today this film is one of the best in presenting biblical truths. Perhaps there are not so many good special effects in it, as in today's films, but I think it is a good tool for witnesses. You can watch this film and its series with prophecies for free on this website upperpraise.com, and judge for yourself. Blessings to all.
