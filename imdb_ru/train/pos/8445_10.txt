Murder: the film turned out to be a good conclusion to a well-written, well-directed, and well-played series. Weak ends were tied, which were not properly resolved at the end of the final season. The entire series, and especially the film, provided a realistic view of life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high level of murder. My attraction to the show began long before I moved to Baltimore, but as soon as I experienced life here, I realized how realistic it is. And the film certainly retained this spirit. Of course, I will miss the new original episodes of the series, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers for giving us one last look at the dark side of Charm City.
