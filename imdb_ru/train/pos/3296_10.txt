Mina Kumari demonstrates more style and grace, just moving from standing to the floor than you can find in most other films. The director has created more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would have seemed possible. Music and dance of the highest quality. In the first dance scene, you can see that the director is going through a variety of things: the other girl is dancing, drunk is falling down the stairs, a lot of activity, but he knew that we would watch Mina’s dance, and I’m willing to bet if you watched this many times, you have not noticed. In general, perfection.
