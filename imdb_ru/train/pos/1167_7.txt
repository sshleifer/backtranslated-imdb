Alain Delon visits the quick and ruthless revenge for the ruthless criminal family, which used him as an assassin in the Thriller thriller Big Guns after they accidentally killed his wife and child. Tessari and scriptwriters Roberto Gandus, Hugo Liberator from Minutes to Pray, Second to Die, and Franco Verucci from The Ring of Death tell this action movie about a professional action movie for the mafia right up to the wire. Indeed, the Big Guns are fairly predictable, but they are still considered solid entertainment with many wild and often sudden killings. Alain Delon from the “The God’s Father”, respectively, is laconic, as he methodically reports the death to the heads of gangster families who refused to allow him to resign so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte of The Godfather plays Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury the ax with the character of Delon, but the rest of his die-hard partners want the killer to die. Like most criminal thrillers of the 1960s and 1970s, Big Guns adhere to cinematic morality that crime does not pay. Interestingly, the one who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero, survives, while the other betrays the hero with prejudice. Tessari doesn't lose a single second in this 90-minute skirmish. Besides the fact that a mother and a son die in a car bomb designed for the father, the worst thing that happens is happening in a car dump when the hero’s satellite is crushed in an abandoned car. Allegedly, “Big Guns” is a rather bloodless walk, but it has a large number of bodies for a 1973 melodrama bandit. Only at the last minute, our main character let down his guards, and therefore the far-fetched morality of an eye for an eye remains intact. Tessari makes a couple of decent car chases, and Don’s death in a train passing through the train’s tunnel is as bloody as this cruel yarn. Photography and compositions are excellent.
