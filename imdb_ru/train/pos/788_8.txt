Ok, I admit. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this film - but, besides its attractive appearance, the film carries a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot. <br /> <br /> Starting from the fact that we met with the three leading film girls. One director is very concerned about her image and has never been married. Policeman - with a child and a bad ex. The third is a power-hungry and eager status doctor with a desire for recognition and three former. <br /> <br /> They are almost “First Wives Club”, and there are indeed many verbal beatings of the former, as well as some “he left a credit card” behavior. Character set - the film continues. <br /> <br /> MacDowell's character, the headmistress, is late for the funeral, where a young organist is striking, replacing the regular player (Doughty). What would her two friends say about the trouble that followed? Will they live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> A cloth or two is recommended, if you suffer from tears - the end is uplifting, but perhaps not what you expect. In general, an excellent film that stands out among current actions, special effects and horrors of sloka.
