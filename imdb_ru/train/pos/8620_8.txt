I just finished watching the 139-minute version (widescreen) with some friends, and we were amazed. I will not repeat what others said. What the directors do with the concept is unexpected and fun. A huge battle is tiring. After that, we were stunned to find that there were still about 30 minutes left, but this did not prevent us from being fully involved and entertained. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that almost ruined it, and it was awful music / songs. Blues, country / folk and rock ballads do not belong here, and every time they are used, we all burst out laughing. It's disgustingly warned you, but the story and the narrative help you stay in touch. <br /> <br /> There are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence as well as slow motion that work beautifully. I really would like to erase the music, but alas. <br /> <br /> Look for this. It’s fun, it’s different, and you’re in places you don’t expect, and it’s very refreshing.
