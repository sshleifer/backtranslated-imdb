This film was very, very strange and very, very funny. All the actors are quite real and very strange. The overall “look” of the film was also different, sort of dreamy and discolored, which only added to the spatial, awkward, strange sound of all this. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone I mean, this is not what you would call “mainstream”, but this is what I liked about it. It is not like anything I've ever seen. , unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and highlights in the strangest places. Children are so heartbreakingly stupid (and acne) that you can't help but feel them. In other words, this is not the "Hollywood" version of adolescents. <br /> <br /> All this, in my opinion, is good.
