Expecting to see a “cute little movie” from mainland China, I was poorly prepared. Family dynamics, commonality and the inevitability of change have rarely been studied so skillfully on film. Each character is solid, and I am fully involved in the story. Organization is much more complicated than the American audience. However, there are no difficulties following the progression, even when reading the subtitles. Jiang Wu, as a retarded brother, is a permanent shining light. Leave your cynicism in your locker. It will be there when you check.
