The comedy that worked surprisingly well was the small British work Divorce Lady X (1938). This is the first couple of Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before a small film about uncontrollable passion in the 19th century English swamps. And while Olivier and Oberon are not well suited for comedy comedy, everything is going well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who got into the hotel room of the lawyer for divorce proceedings Logan (Olivier) because of the unpleasant English fog that impedes travel. She does her best to annoy him - but the films go crazy, he falls in love with her. And she falls in love with him. But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Olivon "Lady X" (that's all she leaves for Oliver in the note), considers Olivier to be a married woman. Worse, and even more fun, Lord World (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier, wanting to divorce his wife, who, as dear Larry thinks, must be Oberon! There is a good dialogue about the battle of the sexes and an interesting study of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too sure about the comedy, but in the true Olivier he is an unsurpassed professional, and delivers. And he copes with the turns of the bolt, perhaps not with ease, but with pleasure. As an actress, Oberon was not particularly good, but usually she was competent enough, and, despite their indecent hostility towards her, worked well with Olivier. This was filmed in the early Technicolor, which today looks very primitive (everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but perhaps the seal needs cleaning.
