If you are a fan of the big Altman ensemble, as evidenced by such large films as MAShH, Nashville, Gosford Park, and less popular films such as The Wedding, then you will no doubt be entertained by HealtH . The focus is on the Health Convention, where two women are running for president, HealtH has many Altman loyal clients of the late 70s, such as Paul Dooley (who helped write the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, as well as star Altman newcomers such as Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. As in many films about the Altman Ensemble, there are many plots in this film, but it is not as overwhelming as films like “Nashville” or “The Wedding”, rather, it has a more centered feeling, perhaps like M.A.S. . or Gosford Park. All this is an obvious satire on the Health movement, filled with excessive, outlandish, controversial characters, with guest stars, such as Dick Cavett, providing ironic commentary on all of this. Stressing the entire election process is Altman’s pessimism about politics and public attractiveness, but what’s most appealing in this film is just pleasure that most people seem to enjoy. It would be one of the latest Altman films, like this for a while!
