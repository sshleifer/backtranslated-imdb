When I learned of the death of Sir Alec Guinness, it was the first of his many films that I thought to revise. What a wonderful comic commentary on the film gives even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave charm into every frame. His eyes and face shine just like the white suit he wears. Both he and the film should be considered favorites of a lifetime.
