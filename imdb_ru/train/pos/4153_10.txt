it was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip of this on YouTube, and I swore that if it ever appeared on TV, I would stick myself to the TV to watch. I watched it with a friend of mine who turned out to be gay, and the two of us cried at the end. it was a really well written, heartfelt episode of forbidden love between two cops, which I felt were (according to Kup) really “lucky”. these are the episodes that really make Cold Case one of the most fascinating and favorite works of television magic on CBS. I look forward to new episodes and reissue of "Forever Blue", because I will always watch it again and again.
