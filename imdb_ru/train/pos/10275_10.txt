Get ready for this: this is one of my favorite films of all time. I am relatively unaware of the other works of David Mamet (writer and director), but after seeing this film half a dozen times (it's always nice to watch), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This film is very well written, and it quickly draws you to deception, deceit and behind-the-scenes fuss. The sensation of the film is very similar to The Bite (1973), and it also pays homage to the film Noir. <br /> <br /> This is a rather psychologically complex film that will surely make you think about different plot twists and motives. from shady characters. From time to time it is a bit predictable, but the shocking climax is always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Actually, acting is great, especially Joe Mantegna, but the one with whom I watched the movie remarked to me that it’s not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crows) who is not just a player, a smoker and a thief , but also has a hairstyle of the 80s. I agree, but I think she is nonetheless outstanding in this role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this film, the better, as in the last film Mamet “Spanish Captive”, because the final will be even more impressive. Just sit back and get ready to go to a movie that is dangerously close to brightness.
