I just used this video and I watched it last night. The game started very badly (hey ------ hey ------ twister), but soon after the charges became very good. Tornadoes looked very unreal, and many of the effects of CGI were very tricky, but the scene with the house collapsed and the explosion and sucking the contents inside was very well done, and about the same as films like Twister. The scenes of destruction were also very well made. This story was very well written, and it's nice to see that a film like this one, far from the same old “disaster formulas”, films of this genre seem to have been stuck for 30 years. <br /> <br /> Although it was a very strange combination of effects and acting quality in the film, it deserves a difference in my book.
