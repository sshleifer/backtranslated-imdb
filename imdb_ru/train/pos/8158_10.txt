“Fear of a black hat” is what CB-4 should (much weaker). Rusty Kundiev's satirical look is merciless, as he adds, deploys and distorts all aspects of hip-hop trends and culture. Does "FoaBH" look like a spinal cord? Yes a little. Is it a derivative of Spinal Tap? No, not at all. The goal is more focused, satire is better focused, and, frankly, it's funnier.
