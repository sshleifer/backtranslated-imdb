If the first film of Jean Renoir’s “Maelstrom of Fate” takes us for the first time to the world of countryside, rivers, and the lives of the peasantry, which he will continue to explore, then it is entirely appropriate that his second film is devoted mostly to the rich and privileged, the upper classes and those who try up. Bring together the characters from the first two films, and you will receive the seeds of his great "Great Illusions" and "Rules of the Game." It is beautifully shot, with a hectic camera taking full advantage of the surprisingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film’s interiors, and the action, although often overloaded, also offers some great moments, especially from Muffat Werner Krauss. But the glamorous and sultry Mrs. Hessling, who at first glance seems like she can give Louise Brooks a race for her money in vampire, never goes beyond a single note, a selfish image of a harlot. Perhaps this is partly a problem with the scenario, which, apparently, mainly concerns high moments and disturbed emotions; without reading the novel, I do not quite understand whether the choice was made correctly or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between Nana's fans are well drawn, and I especially liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo's Vandevra - a tragic understanding that everyone seems to have about his final fate and their sympathies with each other. to a friend, especially in the scene at the bottom of the huge staircase, where Vandevr warns Muffat, and we wonder if violence will occur - these are other signs of the absurdity of the idler helping the film to give the film all the depth. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement, and for me, probably just a shy overall film “Maelstrom of Fate”, it’s still worth seeing Renoir’s fans or those interested in quiet cinema in general.
