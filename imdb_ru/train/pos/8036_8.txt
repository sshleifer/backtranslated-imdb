Some guys think that the sniper is not good, because part of it was not good enough. Well, if you consider it as a fighter, this view may be quite correct, since the action of this film is not very exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama, not an action movie. <br /> <br /> The film basically told us about two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Thomas Beckett, a veteran who had 74 confirmed murders, looked as if he had composure. However, after Beckett showed his daytime dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was a fierce war and the sacrifice of his partners that made Beckett so-called cold-blooded. <br /> <br /> Millar, on the other hand, was a newbie, green-handed and not even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane succeeded in showing the indecision and fear of Millar, when he first tried to “punch a bullet in the heart” (as Beckett said). What he had in mind about the suicidal mission was that it could be easily accomplished, and then he would be able to quietly return and get a reward. <br /> <br /> These two guys were completely different in character, and I think the film successfully showed the difference and the impact they had on each other due to differences in their personalities. The two snipers quarreled, suspected each other, and finally came to an understanding as a result of communication and what they did to even save the other. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good fighter, but a good psychological one.
