Hello to all the people who watched this wonderful film, I am sure that you would have liked it as much as I did. I like the songs when you saw a show where you can sing as if you were participating in a show, singing and dancing. dancing and singing. ONE is also a favorite music song of all time, and at the end it stutters in front of the mirror, so oh, you should watch it
