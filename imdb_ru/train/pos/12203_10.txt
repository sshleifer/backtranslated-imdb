Orson Wells's “Lady of Shanghai” does not have a brilliant “Citizen Kane” script, for example, but Charles Lawton Jr.’s cinematography, unforgettable scenery (such as an aquarium scene, a maritime scene featuring stunning blonde-wearing Rita Hayworth singing “Don 't Love Me', and a truly amazing climax in the Hall of Mirrors), and a great cast (Everett Sloan in his greatest performance, Wells in a perfectly played role, the aforementioned Miss Hayworth - Wells's wife at the time - in her most magnificent) makes highly ezabyvaemy experience filming. The plot of the mysterious murder is funny and compelling, but not incomprehensible. The spectators are surprised by the turns, and the final line of Wells is a boundless classic. The Lady of Shanghai receives four stars from this impartial arbiter.
