Although the style of this film is not as understated and realistic as the sound version might have sounded, it is still a very good film. In fact, it was seen as an excellent film on his day, as it was nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar (loser WINGS). I still consider Wings to be an excellent film, but this film is excellent, despite the fact that Emil Jennings outplayed it a bit. <br /> <br /> Jennings is a general from tsarist Russia, living to the last days. earn a few dollars in the 1920s, being a Hollywood extra. His luck seems to have changed when he got the casting - to play the general of imperial Russia, fighting against the communists during the revolution. Naturally, this is not so difficult, but it makes the old man think about the old days and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Exactly what comes next, I will leave it to you, but this is a pretty good movie - especially at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as a Russian director. Although it was made in 1928, it doesnâ€™t look much younger with cosmetics than in many of his later films.
