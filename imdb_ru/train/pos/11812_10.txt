This movie is the best movie for comics. Sets, costumes and color are just as bright as if you were in a comic book. This is the movie I think about when Mob is mentioned, costumes, hats and attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives a comic relief when she mumbles, and you can't help but feel sorry for Madonna when she tries and cannot win against Tracy. This film contains all the classic clichés of mobs: bury people in concrete, blow up people's cars, tie a good guy and try to blow up his girlfriends' house. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in every sense of the word, even the camera angels shout out comics. It’s so great to be able to go back to the old movie and see that someone knew how the comic should be turned into a movie after seeing errors like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!
