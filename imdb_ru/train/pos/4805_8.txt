When I first heard about this film, I thought it would be like “The Duchess” (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of “Young Victoria”, I realized that it would not be just a solid film. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really awesome, and the settings are also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really brings me down is performances. Emily Blunt (“The Devil Wears Prada”) is a film star that revives Victoria, and in this film she shows that she is a great actress and, perhaps, chooses the first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost as soft as Prince Albert, but he has excellent chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is as hard as Lord Melbourne, although I expected more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both play minor roles, but they are easy to forget. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the film is not finished. Perhaps the screenwriters have changed too many things in the script, I don't know, but that’s how I feel about the film. <br /> <br /> But overall, this is a great film about the early years of Victoria with excellent performance. by emily blunt
