The film is actually a pretty good story, but it is stuck in several key places. It is as if the director put the film together without taking the time to make any significant changes in the film. Dennis Quaid copes well with his role ... but in some key scenes something is clearly not enough. <br /> <br /> This 2.5-hour film could be cut to about 2 hours. And, perhaps, the film would have been much better if there had not been the feeling that it had been put together. <br /> <br />
