By saying this, I mean, this is not a well-made film, but it is a very good version of this event and the best image at the moment. and if you are a fan of World War II, then this is a pleasure for you, because there are three out of four members of the saboteur who play roles in this film. At best, this is a theater, but still, as was said before the semi-documentary film. <br /> <br /> I am personally a fan of our almost superhuman heroes of World War II, and there should be several hundred of them. from these films showing us what they have done, so that the next generations will not forget about them. Because nowadays children do not read books, they watch movies. <br /> <br /> So if you want extravaganzas, rent a private Ryan, it's true about prolonged pain, incredible endurance and the will to fight when everything seems lost.
