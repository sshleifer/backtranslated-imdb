Truly, this is a "soulful" film. He won the George Forward Award by winning Roots, so this can tell you about the essence of this film. I look on the Internet how to order this film, since my former father-in-law, Eugene Logan, co-author of this film, has already passed away for several years, so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him, I would like his only granddaughters, my daughters , watched this film, and also conveyed this wonderful story to their great-grandchildren. My eldest daughter was seven years old when she was shown on television, and since then I have been looking forward to seeing her again. One of my friends said this was her favorite movie. I will not "spoil" this film for you.
