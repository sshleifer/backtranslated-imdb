When Gundam0079 became a trilogy of movies with which many of us are familiar, in many ways it was just an act and the least of all the rest. This OVA is a kind of opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not filled with action, but emotional things. I believe that the two basic sequences of actions in this are enough to satisfy me. After watching so many episodes of gundams, films, and OVA, I was fully prepared for a film for civilian Esquires. This movie has done a fantastic job. What makes this film stand out is that both sides of the war have good and bad people. This made Zeon more human than the original films, where they are depicted as the second revolt of the evil Nazis. Most people who don't like the anime that I made to watch this movie (laughs) liked it. Therefore, I would recommend it to many people just for anti-war history. If you are a Gundam fan and have not seen it, you should not read it; You should already be watching this right now.
