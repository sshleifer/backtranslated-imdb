This film is smart. That is, more than most other films, it goes beyond the lowest common denominator - stupid people probably won't appreciate it. History also depends heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels with the “Lost Translation”, although “Before Dawn” is much brighter, somewhat less abstract and simply much better. <br /> <br /> Script, characters, and even a little surreal atmosphere look absolutely realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely did I see a movie in which the script and acting skills merged perfectly. <br /> <br /> The dialogue turns to very personal questions, risking to be a little higher. However, it remains on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a bit awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line requires insanely talented actors. Sometimes it gives great results, and in general this film is just awesome! Only very, very rarely is “love” in films portrayed in a way that I consider credible and realistic. Every time this is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the amazing and seemingly timeless beauty of the leading female actress helped a lot in this regard. She still looks amazing in this film, after 12 years. <br /> <br /> This is just a jewel of the film that should not be missed. One of the best films I saw in the 1990s!
