I only watched it because Josie Lawrence, who I knew <br /> <br /> from Whose line, acted in it, anyway? I was very pleasantly surprised by this warming and magical gem. It is uplifting, touching, and <br /> <br /> romantic, without being sentimental or sentimental. Characters <br /> <br /> are all real people, with real weaknesses, fears and needs. See it.!
