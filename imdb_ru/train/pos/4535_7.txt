The first 50 minutes of this film were pretty boring. The focus was on Doyle’s personal problems, including his sick wife, death threats from fans, the insistent publisher, and guilt about his mentally ill father. Despite the fact that these subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was more interested in learning about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally looked inside Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to “kill” Holmes. The actors are great. Including intriguing Selden, played by Tim McInnerney, Arthur Conan Doyle, the compelling role played by Douglas Henschall and Brian Cox as a “role model” of Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. Places are good, especially for a television movie, and work with the camera is good. If the first 50 minutes were as good as the last 40 minutes, it would be a small masterpiece.
