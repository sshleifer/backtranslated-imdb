It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments about this star movie. I laughed at the whole picture, like my whole family. The film clearly defined itself as an old gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good old time while they were shooting. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great - and what about those Everly sisters, each of the two Falco, and divine music everywhere. Rob Reiner was a great laughing limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne was a ridiculous neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Heins, Berthe Reynolds, the character of Sleepy Joe, as well as the morgue and burial ground. Paul Anka was his usual amusement, with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to make a duet of his “My Way”, welcome home to Vic's performance. <br /> <br /> I think this film was a funny tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfus imitated him well. I also hold the opinion that no one, regardless of age, would even think to imitate the actions that occurred in this film - this is a joke, and not a horrifying gangster film. The cars and the clothes were impressive, as was the decoration of the Vic Place. <br /> <br /> Indeed, I consider The Time of the Mad Dog to be a musical comedy less harmful than many cartoons, TV crime dramas, and talk shows. I would recommend a video for a family evening.
