Kurt Russell I.S. Elvis, simple and straightforward. His devotion to this role led to the fact that, in my opinion, this is the best biography in the movies. If you're an Elvis fan, watch it if you can. <br /> <br /> A film made for television was made two years after the death of Elvis. <br /> <br /> One tip There are two versions - one in 180 minutes and one in 117 minutes. The only one you can see is longer. The shorter one has more than an hour of edited material. It simply does not work, because the scenes in it often depend on the scenes that were cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece will take you from Elvis childhood through his appearance as the greatest star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's dad) are superb as Elvis's parents. And Pat Hingle delivers a very competent Colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
