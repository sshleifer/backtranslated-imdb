When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was that this movie was more like an anime than a movie. The reason is that vampires do incredible stunts. The stunts are very similar to how the Matrix moves too fast for a bullet, and jumping around is very far. Another reason why I'm good at the movie is because they make the charming anime faces during the movie. The way Gackt makes his puffy faces or how they act is VERY ANIMAL. I think this is a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this film is 10 (not to mention Gackt and Heide, also 10). ^ _ ~ If you're fans of Gackt and Hyde, you should see this.
