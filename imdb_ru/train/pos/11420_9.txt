This film tells about the subtlety and complexity of navigation in the ever-changing boundaries of manners, race and desire. Of course, this is not a movie for everyone. There are no car chases, no building explosions, no murders. The drama lies in the tension caused by looks, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, lighting, and things left — sometimes very ostensibly — unspoken. It is about personality, memory, community, affiliation. Different parts of the film work together to strengthen the leitmotifs of themselves and others, identity, desire, limitations and losses. This will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer. This will cause discontent of those whose tastes require explosive, massive, sharp action. This is a beautifully filmed human story. It's all.
