In her autobiography, Lorin Bacall tells us that the Gods told her that she should not make such stupid films as this or something like that. At that time, Douglas Sirk was called “tears for women”, in fact, he was restored in favor, at least in Europe, after he stopped directing. And when he was shooting “written in the wind”, Circu left only three films: “stained angels”, “time to love and time to die”, his masterpiece, IMHO, and, finally, “Imitation of life” (1960). Then there was silence. In fact, the characters of Bacall and Hudson are not interested in Circ. They are too straightforward, too virtuous. Dorothy Malone, who was a kind of replacement for his former German star Zarah Leander, and her brother Robert Stack provide the plot’s main interest. Built continuously, most of the film is a long memory. The instability of a brother and sister, from a family of rich Texas oil owners, is highlighted by bright clothes and rutile cars that travel at maximum speed in a tower landscape. Malone’s metamorphosis at the end of the film is staggering: costume and chignon playing with a small tower: she is ready for life, the rebel is tamed. Now alone, because she lost Hudson (but, in any case, he was not in love with her). This end is a bit reactionary, but the melodrama is mostly reactionary, three years later, in the "imitation of life", Sarah-Jane (Susan Coner) will be blamed because she does not know her place.
