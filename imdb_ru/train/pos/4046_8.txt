Romer returns to her historical dramatic events in the real story of Grace Elliott, an Englishwoman who remained in France at the height of the French Revolution. Everyone always suspected that Romer was a conservative, but who knew that he was such an eloquent reactionary. If you can put aside Romerâ€™s shameless defense of the monarchy (and this is not easy to do, considering, for example, that the French lower classes are portrayed here as disgusting louts), this is actually an elegant, clever and honed film. 18th century France, Romer instead plays actors against clearly painted cardboards. This is clearly an artificial vanity, but it somehow works. And rookie Lucy Russell succeeds in making him a responsive character that should not be there.
