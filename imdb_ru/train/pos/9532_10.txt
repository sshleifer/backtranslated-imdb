I really liked this movie ... time spent on character development, attention to detail, great performances, amazing lighting and cinematography, a wonderful soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch, which Will not work for anyone who wants the typical fast moving action flick. If we lived in the Elizabethan days, I would say that this film is a bit like the Shakespearean tragedy. But since we are not doing this, let's say it looks more like the movie “Drama Suspension”. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The film is intelligent in how relationships and issues are explored. Most of the story is shown, not told, which I think makes it more subtle and touching - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). At times, I felt that I was actually in the 1930s, part of this story — there was such a realistic but fabulous quality in the style of the story. <br /> <br /> I don’t often prefer the films of the book on which they were based, but in this case I do. (Although I also liked the book.) I bought a DVD, which is great because it has some great deleted scenes and an insightful commentary. <br /> <br /> (I also took my cousin, who is a little younger than the boy in the film, to see him after I saw him for the first time because he has problems at home, and I wanted to use it as a way start a discussion with him of father and son. He loved it - and discussion.)
