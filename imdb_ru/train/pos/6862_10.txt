When people ask me why I like films so much, I usually reply: “Have you seen the sequence of the art gallery in De Palma’s Dressed to Kill book?” This scene alone is pretty much what I want to see in the film. If I were a film director, I would like to do it. “Pure Movie” is one of the ways to describe this sequence, and it’s truly amazing to see how the entire film by director De Palma works on the same high artistic frequency of this scene. It's a dream-like movie, clever as hell, and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films combined. I think that the film raises an important question that will always be the subject of heated debate: can a film rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success? The film does not make sense to speak, the acting is great, but it serves the style, and the script lacks logic. De Palma's film shows really well that style, with proper processing, can sustain a full-length film. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, and Keith Gordon give excellent performances, but this is a film directed up to extinction. This is a sensational demonstration of the capabilities of the film industry. I won’t tell you which movie Hitchcock pays homage to (I don’t want to spoil the surprises), but I think De Palma goes beyond the plot and he manages to create a film that pretty much summarizes his entire career, Not for faint of heart!
