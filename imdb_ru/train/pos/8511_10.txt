This film reinvents the term Spring Break. Hans, the fat man of the group, demonstrates his talents of Chris Farley of this generation. Johnny Kansas, the “king of $ 1 bids,” shows that he is no longer in Kansas, constantly raising bids. Kyle's laugh is really infectious, and offers a little candy for the ladies (as well as Matt). The dwarfs, though they had their moments, did not pay tribute to the Mexican hat dance as he deserves. Finally, we have our main character, Ed. He gives hope to all of us, awkward, stumbling, gangster, pale people who are still looking for this special person. And this hope, this little place called Cabo San Lucas. Although this blockbuster just missed out on theaters, you need to rent it, since we can all relate to one of these spring holidays.
