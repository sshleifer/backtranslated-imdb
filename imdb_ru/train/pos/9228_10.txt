Expecting to see another film about “Nenspluatatsii”, in which the older mother abuses and torments her charges, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I expected. <br /> <br /> In fact, the plot is feminist, although I do not think that such a term existed in the era in which the film was set. It certainly has not been practiced. Women (both Jews and poor) are very discouraged and find themselves in narrow places of society. Throughout history, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) has been watching the tyranny of her time, until she just can no longer sit there, and in fact does something about it, albeit with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> Pre-Loan Consistency has Flavia as a young teenager near the battlefield. She sees the wounded "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few who is still alive) and is trying to help him. Before she can do this, her father, filled with hatred, beheads the soldier and waves to his face (great family dynamics, eh?). After that, her father forces her to join the monastery, where she witnesses an even greater injustice. Although the scenes are really connected with violence, rape and nuns, I would consider it more like a historical drama than a non-proliferation. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many ingredients for dirty exploitation, but the acting, cinematography, storyline and music are too good to keep it at that level. Most monastic films I've seen usually have a basic premise: a good girl somehow ends up in a convent where the supreme mother is the supreme bitch who loves to whip people and / or turn their lives into hell. <br /> Flavia spends most of the first part of the film, passively questioning all the atrocities taking place around her. Most of her passivity is forgotten when she meets a strong spirit (but a little crazy - she likes to pee outside like me, but the guys are much easier) Sister Agata. When a group of Muslims attacks their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not shrink in fear like other nuns. Their attackers actually act as their liberators (from the cruelty and almost slavery of the abbey). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim invader, who pierces dear sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It was Agatha’s death that caused Flavia to make a cruel crusade against those who oppressed her ... Her father treats her like mud. Her Muslim lover leaves her at a very inappropriate time. I do not want to give out too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened by the conclusion. This is a great film, so do not put it on the junk epic's reputation. Also, how can a movie with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli actually go wrong? I am not familiar with the other works of Maria Casares, but Sister Agatha is a hell of a character. <br /> <br /> I have read a lot of great reviews of the Synapse release (USA), but I like my German X- Rated Kult DVD copy. It is not anamorphic / 16: 9, but actually contains a bit more information about the image on all edges than the Synapse release. <br /> <br /> And there are also many wonderful, wise, or funny lines of dialogue (many from Agatha’s sister) <br /> <br /> “Why is God a man? Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? They are all men! ”-Flavia <br /> <br />“ These people are afraid, look at them, sister. You are afraid that their power will be taken away from them! ” -Sr. Agatha (that Christians flee after the arrival of Muslims) <br /> <br /> “Woman, where are you going? Muslims cannot do anything with you that Christians have not done! Ha ha ha! ”-Sr. Agatha (group of fleeing Christians) <br /> <br /> “The Lord will bless these Muslims for fearing these pompous Christians.” -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Is one Muslim’s gaze enough to make you underwear?" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Final Message: “Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim, no longer a Christian, was punished as a runaway nun. The idea of ​​the film arose from the events that occurred during the Muslim invasions of Italy, culminating in the fact that even today they remember the martyrdom of 800 in Otranto "
