What can I say about this? This is another terrible Hollywood film with a very high budget (80 million dollars). Not scary, he offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with the skeleton in the fireplace. A lot of computer works special effects and nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones, as always, is beautiful, Lily Taylor is also a good actress. Hill Houseâ€™s architecture is amazing, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... are amazing! However, I do not like the ending, because it was so juicy. Check it out and make your own opinion about it. I give this picture 7 out of 10.
