I really liked the film, but I did not realize that Little Richard had so much going on in his life. First of all, I did not know about Lucille. Very few (almost no) mention of the fact that women are closely associated with Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of any participation of women in a romantic manner. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned? Overall the film was great. I also did not like Leon, who plays the role of Little Richard, he is a good actor, but I feel that the role should have been changed to another actor. Visually, he did not remind me of Little Richard. I also did not know at all about debauchery, of which Little Richard was a part. From the film, he was portrayed as a sex addict. Currently he will be referred for counseling for his sexual supplement. He was a voyeur. I don’t want to spoil the movie for someone who hasn’t seen the movie, but there were a few things in the movie that I thought shouldn’t be part of the final version.
