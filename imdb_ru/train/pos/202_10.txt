A Give this film 10/10, because it deserves 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Mattau and George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors who are in this film, + director Herbert Ross, and all this makes this stage adaptation a reality. The Sunshine Boys - one of the best films of the 70s. I like this humor in this film, it just makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> I received this film on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS, because it was cheaper - only $ 3). I watched it as soon as I returned home, but I had to watch it again, because the first time I missed several parts. The second time I watched it, I felt much better, and I laughed much stronger. I am definitely going to get it on DVD again, because I MUST see special features. <br /> <br /> Very funny how it happens. Two people work together as artists / actors / performers. They get along well on stage, but actually argue backstage, they can't live another minute with each other, and then, 15 years later, you want to reunite them for a television event. You can find it in this movie. Matthau & Burns was awesome in this movie. It is a pity that they died. George Burns deserves this Oscar. He gave a strong comic play. He was also 78 when this film was shot. So far, he is the oldest actor who won an Academy Award in old age. Jessica Tandy beats the record of the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic at that. He won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He deserves this Golden Globe. Although many people may not agree with what I am going to say, everyone in this film gave a strong presentation. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: the one who hates this film is "Putz"
