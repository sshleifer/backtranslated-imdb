Robot Jocks does not suffer from history or bad effects. I mean, it was 1990, if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used stop animations, like most movies in the 80s. If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the help of special effects that were available to them at that time. Only next year, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, a breakthrough in technology was published, and storylines began to use this motif. But you will have pleasant memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very formidable. It makes you not want to meet with a person without a really good backup plan. And there are some great moments in this movie. Traitor / spy works in his environment. He who you think is on your side and fully supports you, may be the kind of person you didnâ€™t expect from him. And it is very troublesome, isn't it?
