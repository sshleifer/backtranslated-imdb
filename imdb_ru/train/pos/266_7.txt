This story has never been among my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation. The murine motive was effective, if you slightly overdo it, it has the bones of history, although more attention is paid to the plot “Crime in the Past”. All the students were pretty much the way I imagined them, although it is a pity that they were no longer a cosmopolitan group — perhaps the revised thirties settings did not allow it! I thought some very brave risks were taken from the shoot; Perhaps because I did not reread the book for a long time, but it seemed to me rather obvious who was the killer by their appearance in some demonstration shots rather early. <br /> <br /> Humor was much more common in these early poirot. Sometimes it works, but I found that a lot in this episode is quite hard (although I was smiling on the line “Lemon sole”). In general, though, a solid record in the series, although not one of the best.
