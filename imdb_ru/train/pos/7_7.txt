Although I didn’t really like the movie “Stanley and Iris”, I admired the acting. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I was not always a fan of the work of the Foundations, but here she is delicate and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to transform every role he portrays into acting gold. In this film, he plays great, and there is a great scene in which he has to take his father to the home for the elderly, because he can no longer take care of him that will break your heart. I would not recommend this movie as an excellent cinematic entertainment, but I will say that you are unlikely to see somewhere much better to play.
