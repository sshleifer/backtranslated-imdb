Because of all the negative reviews about this film, I almost did not watch it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a rather nice horror movie. The game was not great - except for the wonderful Alice Krieg - but some of the dialogues (“Just consider yourself as lunch”) were pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, Stephen King’s efforts are above the average - 7/10.
