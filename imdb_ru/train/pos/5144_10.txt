This very strange film is not like anything made in the west at that time. With its turbulent emotions and a network of visions, dreams and striking images, its effect is both beautiful and disturbing. Actors are put more like a dance than like an actor. It contains the only dream I know that really resembles a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).
