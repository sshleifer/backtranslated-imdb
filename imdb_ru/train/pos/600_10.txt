Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father (creepy Ray the Wise) on a sprawling ranch with windmills, and eventually finds himself entangled in the dangerous web of his young, intriguing and seductive stepmother. (tasty Claire Ren), thus creating problems for an already dysfunctional family. A harsh, stylish and exciting drama that did not receive a promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV - where I first saw it. It is beautifully written, delicately acts, and tightly directed from the script that keeps you biting your nails. I can't believe that reviewers who didnâ€™t like it have ever really seen it. This is an undiscovered classic.
