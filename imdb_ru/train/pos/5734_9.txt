I consider myself a big fan of the works of David Lynch, because he provides viewers with absolutely unique movies with typical “Lynch elements”. After seeing most of his work, I naively thought that I could predict the next step of Lynch. I was completely wrong. Dumbland is something that I could never imagine under the name of David Lynch. However, after my recovery from the first shock, I began to reflect on this extremely primitive main character and came to the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, cruelty and disgust presented here reflect pieces of reality, emphasizing its distortion. There are things in our life that we hardly ever emphasize, because they are disgusting or terrible, however, they surround us, so I can say with confidence that Dumblend focuses on these pieces. This is not a movie for enjoyment, although sometimes you will laugh because of a strange, perverse sense of humor, it is a lively reflection of all the things that we most likely refuse to watch, with its simplicity, soreness and absurdity. Take it as it is, you don't need to like it. It just exists. And finally, if you are attentive enough, you will also find elements typical of Lynch. I recommend for tolerant people !!!
