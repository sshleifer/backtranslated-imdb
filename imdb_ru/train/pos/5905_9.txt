This is a really good movie. Sumitra Bhave always made a sensible movie, and this is my favorite movie on her part. This film should have won the National Award and would have been my choice to represent India at the Oscars. This is at least a thousand times better than at Shaw, which is sent to Oscar from India this year. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that information about this (and all other Indian films)) on IMDb is not enough, and sometimes wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this film, and he is not even marked on these pages. The rest of the cast and crew are also not mentioned at all. Awards and nominations for this film are not awarded, even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There were no voices for the Great Danes. <br /> <br /> Great Danes is not a Hindi film. This is Marathi, and, fortunately, avoids the sequence of song and dance, does not get tangled in brilliant glamor and indecisive designer tableware. This is a true, spiritual story, written with a rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> “Great Danes”, which can be translated as “two women,” is the story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. In fact, this is a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not risk to understand many plots, and this makes the film very difficult to shoot. The whole film takes place in an indescribable remote village in Maharashtra, and the screen rarely moves away from the home of the two main characters. There are no aesthetic sunsets. <br /> <br /> The film opens and we get to know the whole house, which is preparing for the wedding of Gauri. Father Gauri and Krishna, being a hardworking farmer, the house is full and happy; There is nothing willing in their simple life. However, on the eve of the wedding, the future husband, Gauri, is fatal. Gauri's father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers from a strong blow. Without a strong working member, the house could fall apart, but Gauri's mother took responsibility for this. She works as and when she can, but cannot make ends meet. But her life is still easier than that of Gauri. Superstitions, which people hesitantly try to forget, make Gauri an evil bearer of luck. She is banished from society. <br /> <br /> Mother Gauri writes to her brother. Desperate for help, she accepts his offer. He takes Gauri to Mumbai, where she is forced to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she earns and their condition improves. Gauri gives his life for the life of his family. <br /> <br /> However, when Gauri returns home to Krishna’s wedding, her mother does not go out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna to be with her and does not allow Gauri in front of her guests. She loves Gauri, but she fears for the life of Krishna. This completely destroys Gauri, and she decides to return to her miserable life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. She asks her beloved sister to come back. Krishna promises to support her. Promises that they will face the world ?? together. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that is not required. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri leaves for Mumbai, but what does she do there, they never say ?? subtle dialogues tell us what you need to know. It's just a bare story that is deep in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> Great Danes is a responsible movie. Is it respectful of the subject Is it respectful of its audience ?? he does not consider that they have the mental abilities of a four-year-old child. <br /> <br /> The acting game is first class. The direction is amazing ?? silence promotes history in such a way words could not be. The script is well crafted. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a good movie will definitely love the Great Dane.
