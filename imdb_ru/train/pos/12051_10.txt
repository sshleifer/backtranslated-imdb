This film has given me nightmares for several months and I am 17 years old. This is the worst movie ever filmed! This is not an exaggeration !! I saw this film at school in English classes, and no one else was scared, which struck me. After reading the other reviews, I'm glad that I'm not the only one who found it so scary !!
