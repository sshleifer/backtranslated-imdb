This film was made by Victor Nunes, who also wrote the script (Ulee's Gold). A beautiful and clear letter that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award and dedicated to Ruby’s daily life. What we see is a piece in the life of a young woman, Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Role for this role. Ruby begins to live independently and establishes his individuality. She explores work, friendship, buddy, sex, a typical search for young adults. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent movie buff, I chose a film because of the Sundance. I appreciate this type of film because there is no Hollywood baggage in it. <br /> <br /> Although the plots are completely different, it reminded me of the Fool No One, with Paul Newman. The later film is part of the everyday life of the common man. I like it. The story is very beautifully told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the name. I am sure that there are not so many bugs here, and they fly in paradise, like in Florida. Since I am allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me, and I really want to think about Florida. I turn into a full red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean on a walk along the beach of Panama City in Florida. Indeed the sand is very white. I was there. Favorite quotes: “Necessity has always been a good excuse.” "All this fuss, associated with the search for a man, is now completely different, who he will be, when and why." <br /> <br />
