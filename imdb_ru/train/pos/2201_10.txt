I just finished watching the first disc in a collection of 4 discs (26 episodes), created in conjunction with the UCLA Film and Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (except for the 1st episode) the image quality is pretty good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> “Mr. Pipers” is as charming as at the moment when I first saw him (5 years), and Wally Cox is really cute in this role. If you are in the mood for a quiet comedy that sneaks up on you, as opposed to a blow to the head, you will appreciate this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you may remember from your childhood. Although some of the jokes are a bit commonplace, most of them are brilliant and well executed ... and even trivially funny. This is one series that fits my early childhood memories of it.
