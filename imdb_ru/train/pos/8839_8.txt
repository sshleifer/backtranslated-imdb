Thank God, it was not based on a true story, because it is a story. Populated with disgusting characters, whose depravity knows no bounds, “Before the Devil” is a hypnotizing, terrific excursion into a perversion that would be ridiculous (and sometimes - or, perhaps, because of - the disgustingly tragic human dysfunction everywhere) it was not done with such magnificent, stunning belief by its stars. Excellent script Kelly Masterson and excellent directorial skills, no one else, except for Sidney Lumeta, also not interfere. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction here is family nature, with two mostly spoiled brothers (brilliant images from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) decided to rob the jewelry store of their parents, but this attempt was completely unjustified. <br /> <br /> The story is told with time shifts (which are marked on the screen, for example: “Charlie: two days before the robbery”, so no one should be confused); some people said that they didn’t like this device, but I thought it worked fine, adding to the bias the whole process, believing that the two brothers in question hardly play with full decks - between them you cannot do a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw these crazy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Jean (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who has an affair with another brother, faced with some monumental rivalry of brothers and sisters, along with the fact that The drug addict hates his father (Albert Finney's tormenting performance), who apparently caused him serious pain in the past, and you have Shakespeare's-Greek tragedy in your hands. Act with caution.
