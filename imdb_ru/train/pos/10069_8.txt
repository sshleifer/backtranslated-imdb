This film is worth seeing for visual beauty and a touching acting game alone, but there is also an interesting cultural implication of alienation. Women and performers (both brought together as an opera star-transvestite) are doomed to be relegated to minor positions in China. This makes an incredible connection between an older street performer and a young girl even more powerful, like a triumph over a native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered in this film was that the soundtrack intensified Emotions, deprived of the role of actors. <br /> <br /> A great alternative to unsatisfactory summer action films.
