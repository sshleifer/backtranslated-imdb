Of course, one of the best films that I have seen for quite some time. The refined guide and impeccable game make this film very interesting and often touching. Denzel Washington plays one of his most attractive and emotional roles to date, while the rest of the actors play superbly. Christopher Walken, of course, is great in his part, although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of extreme greed that backfires, counteracts childish innocence and love. It is also a movie for action movie lovers, as it has its share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a sense of semen and corruption, which in itself is sensational. In general, a really exciting movie from start to finish. Highly recommended!
