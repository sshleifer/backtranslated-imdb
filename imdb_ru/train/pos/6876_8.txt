"The Groove Tube" was originally shown in the video, in the first "cinemas" here in Boston. In one room in the high stands were television monitors with old seats in the cinema in small groups in front of the monitors. There were old Pepsi refrigerators and baskets of mints. In the second room there were fewer seats, only large pillows. It was a “smoking” room, that is, people were high there. This act just added a fun video. <br /> <br /> I was a "frequent spectator"; The scenes that I liked the most and still remember: Koko The Clown, Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shorening), Safety Sam / VD PSA, Chevy Chase hitchhiker with nude runs through the woods, Finger Ballet on what the result was the naked body of a woman. The latter subject was very reminiscent of the deceased, incredible Ernie Kovac. Now I have lost a lot of readers under the age of 48 (“who is Ernie Kovach ??”), but believe me, this is fun. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why I was a “frequent spectator” was that my friends and I would bring the other virgins of the “Groove Tube” to see it. We sat and looked slyly at the faces of the "virgins" while playing "Sam Security." As the camera slowly approaches Sam, we will wait for this “OH!” Recognition on the “virgin” face. Each time was more fun than the previous one. And then this “virgin” would bring a friend to watch the show, repeating what we did. To get this joke, you must watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of them are dated, but most of the games, movies, television, and now video. Just look at any video made in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I saw The Groove Tube in the theater as a film, a grainy translation from the original video. It was cut, and it lacked some original plot scenes. <br /> <br /> The first Saturday Night Live show featuring Chevy Chase caused instant remarks: “This is the guy from The Groove Tube", so this was the predecessor for Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can't look at the jar with a shortening without hearing a voice-over, "cover your hands with a generous amount of Crump Reduce lubricant ..." and reflect on the recipe for "Crump Holiday." "The need for baking" at the grocery store. <br /> <br /> The early 70s were terrible; Groove Tube was fresh, new and really "got" the humor of the time. He suggested "generation of hips" which was not in any other format / medium. MJH
