Wooden Horse is a very clever film about a very intelligent and successful escape plan developed by British prisoners of war during World War II. He works wonderfully with an ironic sense of humor, especially in expressions expressed by the acidic languages ​​of Lev Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are amazing like two heroes. The direction of tight and fast moves everywhere. Highly recommended.
