1936 was the most prolific year for Aster and Rogers. Their second film for RKO this year is the third film in this collection ?? Mark Sandrich "Follow the fleet." This time, Astera is painfully embarrassed, as Bake Baker, a sailor on vacation, who accidentally stumbled upon a gloomy cafe on the waterfront where Sherry Martin (Rogers) sings the romantic sweet to the ear. Yes, you guessed it? they are hot for each other again. Only this time, Sherry's sister sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard), threatens the whole good romance by falling in love with Bake's trusty buddy, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); something like using them and throwing them out of themselves, thus forcing Sherry to reconsider his opinion about all sailors in general. Irving Berlin provides an immeasurable classroom to hearings with its classical, classy score, including the standards "Let Your Go Go", "I put all my eggs in one basket" and "Let's face the music and dance"; the latter is an inspired parody of suicide, which turns into another, immediately recognizable and perfectly sublime pa-de-dú for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> “Follow the Fleet” is a bit weaker. The gray scale remains well balanced, but now it looks a bit thick, with an almost not-so-large change in tone, like the previous names. Grain is still present. Like age artifacts. Once you have established a slightly dense, and sometimes more softly focused image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for this vintage film type. The sound is mono, but very well balanced. Extras include a feature, a theatrical trailer and a short theme, but oddly enough? No audio comments. Given the importance of this film in the overall Aster / Rogers canon, this is an uncharacteristic omission of Warner Home Video.
