The first time I saw this episode was a shock for me, in fact it was the first time I saw "24". The speed of what is happening is amazing, and it is so amazing, exciting and even interesting that you are almost reading a book; Once you start it, it is very difficult to stop. From the minute that Richard Walsh spoke privately with Jack about the possibility that they had a mole inside the CTU, I sat 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes !!! (It sounds ridiculous and crazy, but I am one of those guys who, when he is interested, he simply cannot stop). This series is one of the best of its kind. And it is built in such a way as to have several different stories that are related to each other. Recommended in all respects!
