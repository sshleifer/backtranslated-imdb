"The hare with the condition of the hare" Chuck Jones - a fast-paced, often hilarious cartoon. Opposing Bugs Bunny against the bizarre, yellowish flat store manager who wants to be filled, 'Hare Conditioned', makes full use of his multi-purpose settlement. The chase leads Bugs and his pursuer through various departments, which leads to an inspirational gag in which they quickly leave the various departments, putting on any clothes associated with this part of the store. However, this huge gag surpasses a truly inspired sequence that includes elevators in which Bugs disguised as an elevator boy deceiving the store manager to constantly get up or down in the elevator at the wrong time. This is a brilliant climatic story, which, unfortunately, gives way to a not very funny ending. By then, however, “The Hare with the Condition” made its mark as one of the great chase films bursting with wild energy. As in some other cartoons of this period, Bugs became more and more refined, “The Condition Hare” showed that he could still be as attractive as a more anarchic character.
