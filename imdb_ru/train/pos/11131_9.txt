I looked through the Oscar winners list and was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kidd for the best picture in 1969. However, seeing him, I am no longer surprised. He was well ahead of his time in terms of style, cinematography and the use of memories for the development of Joe Buck's character. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing for me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short film. I think Voight seized naivety and depravity when he provoked. The two scenes that really caught me were after he got a blowjob in the theater, and when an elderly man asked him. I think when he looks in the mirror, he is trying to understand whether he really did - or is going to do - something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think Hoffman made a brilliant decision to take on this role. Otherwise, it could be typographical after graduate. In any case, it is considered all the time great for a reason.
