Several storylines are intertwined here around different female characters. The shoes they wear are a sign of their troubled life. All transformed at the end of the film. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; Her daughter Anita (Monica Server) is backward and has a limited life. Leire (Najva Nimri) - designer shoes with problems and loses her boyfriend; Marikarmen (Vicky Pe√±a) lost her husband and is now raising children from her late ex-wife. Isabelle (Angela Molina) - a bored rich lady. <br /> <br /> Other characters are used to connect the five main female characters. In storytelling, not everything is given at the beginning: some connections are made surprisingly late in the film, and this adds to the experience. The subject of shoes is brought to the extreme: for example, when Leir works as a shoe designer and works in a shoe store, where she steals shoe shoes, she breaks one of her heels. <br /> <br /> When editing small links made between scenes. The phone rings, a cigarette is ignited, a song is used, and so on. To make the connection and quick cuts. Frequent change of the plot does not get bored and does not reach the television levels. It depends a lot on the music to set the tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as a backdrop for stories, and pictures of these cities are used to expand the story beyond the characters. One of the most touching shots is when Anita, who takes the same walk every day, widens her walk and limits life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road: how visually the space limit translates is well done. As with most Spanish films, many stories are made visually, using soap stories as a plain background. There is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> Ramon Salazar is too in love with his material, and he is too long. Some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level, including acting (Adela's love life, Dr. Isabel). The subject of shoes is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is more technically literate, but somewhat mechanical. This provides more opportunities for visual transmission of emotions and atmosphere. Seeing this, you tend to immediately move to a new film city: Madrid.
