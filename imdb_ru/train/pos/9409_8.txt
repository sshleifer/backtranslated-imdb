A chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out, but is seen as a threat to survival in various industries. In this delightful comedy Ealing Studios, Guinness is amazing as a meek but persistent chemist. Greenwood, with her sensual voice, plays a love interest; Parker is her agitated father. Tesiger amuses as a patriarch of the textile industry. Telling a fascinating story, the film also raises some intriguing questions about science, economics and politics. It is artfully directed by Mackendrick, who would later make Ledkillers and the sublime Sweet Taste of Success later in the 1950s.
