A small, charming little movie, of course, but superbly crafted. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast who has gathered around her is heating up the dialogue. It happened during the time of Feelings and Feelings, and I am sure that I do not know why this attracted all the attention of Oscar. Emma is the most accessible and least stifling story of Jane Austen, well told.
