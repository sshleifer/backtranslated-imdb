This is a small film, several characters, theatrical. And yet he says something about Ireland that you will not find anywhere else. This film is IRELAND. In all this is rudeness, this is sadness, this is self-deception. Boys, master Doyle, SP O'Donell, Cannon, the daughter of Senator Dugan, Gare and, above all, Madge. I know them. I am with them in the pub or kneel down to pray with them. This is our sad story and our gift.
