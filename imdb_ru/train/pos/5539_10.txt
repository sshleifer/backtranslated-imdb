When I watched this movie for the first time, it was a taped copy, and the title was / is in a cage of terror. I still have the tape, and I confess, I watched it more than once from start to finish! The film has a very low budget, and the dialogue is often unintentionally funny! I made some of my friends see this, and we laughed at the terrible script. The film is about a couple (remember, this is like the beginning of the 70s, so they are just too trendy people!), Who go camping on weekends, I believe, in upstate New York. After they caught and ate fish, they lead a cheerful dialogue, and the girl complains about the death of the fish and that they have eaten it! The guy comes back with something stupid about how they ate fish, and now she was part of them, and he leaves; "And this is a handsome man!" Heavy man, really heavy! LOL! In any case, together with a pair of Vietnamese veterans, I think one of those who play the flute. (In any case, they are musical guys!) The guys obviously attract the girl, and when the couple turns out to be unfriendly, they end up terrorizing them at night. The guy is in a cage in the hen house, and he has to watch as his girlfriend is insulted by two guys. In fact, by the end of the night she seems to be addicted to it, and when morning comes, the guys leave, and the girl and the guy can leave. Supposedly, the guy learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on his face! :) In any case, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a damn good laugh! It never ceases to entertain me! If I could find it on a DVD and replace my old copy with a magnetic tape, I would actually buy it again, this is a classic camp! You gotta love it!
