I would say that the time has come, this film was awesome ... and yes, if you do not want to become a Christian, then why watch it. I saw this film after I was already saved, and found that it is very touching. Now I see that they have raised these films to another level and created the series “Left from the back” ... they make a thorough comparison and are definitely more modern to reach people. I think that in order to actually judge this film, you have to see it, there are 3 or 4 of them, if I'm not mistaken ... do not use our comments to judge, watch the movie yourself! ! God bless you, if that's why you look at them.
