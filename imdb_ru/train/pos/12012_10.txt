I saw it at the Heritage Theater at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I am going to assume that the level of pleasure during this film will largely depend on the level of acceptance of the story of Joseph. <br /> <br /> However, except for the fact that he was very well done, he acted well and had a good score. If you get to Salt Lake City, be sure to visit him at the Legacy Theater. I have never been in a good theater, because the quality of the image, the sound quality and the atmosphere throughout my life ... I wonder if the Church will let me watch Batman start there! Since I am a LDS and consider Joseph a prophet, I was touched in several places and brought to tears several times ... which, I suppose, is expected since they were handing out tissues before the movie began! Anyway, I was told that this film is available at several LDS visitor centers around the world, if you have 70 minutes, watch it, because, whether you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.
