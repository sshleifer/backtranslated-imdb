Initially, not wanting to jump on a leash from watching "The Lost", I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of the first season - the episode with the polar bear - and since then it has always attracted my attention. This show. Not a polar bear. So be patient (heh) with me while I throw out as much disjointed, semi-cohesive praise as I can collect. <br /> <br /> “Lost” is a simple idea of ​​a passenger flight full of people crashing into the desert. the island, and gradually adds an extraordinary depth to its premise, exploring each character deeply and steadily, what drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island on which they are located serves as a common denominator for many things in their lives, regardless of whether they are escaping from something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or communicate with spirituality (Locke, Claire), But "Lost" also increases the island itself and its mysterious horrors ... and they all seem strangely related. <br /> <br /> Although television actors are not entirely known for their sophistication or dazzling acting skills, most of the Lost actors are, in truth, impressive actors in their roles, projecting heart and humor in their performances. There are also many hints, but, as a rule, not plastic Hollywood type, as in most television shows. All the characters feel very real, and they are very interesting to watch. Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable happiness, petty disputes, or stupid melodrama (although they are annoyingly secretive) ?? These people first of all try to survive, and any relationships that appear appear to be considered secondary to action. The realism of these characters facilitates an already well-built plot. <br /> <br /> About this graphic ... Present the tree as a template graphic, and then the branches as subplots (in this case, one branch for each symbol) ?? well, Lost adds branches to each branch, and then tiny branches to these branches, like the other story lines. If you are a brother / sister of one of the main characters in the memories, you will get your own storyline. If you are a DOG, you will have your own plot. If the authors fail to weave them all together at some glorious climax in the end, they substitute themselves. I’m more than a little concerned that this show will be disappointing, as I’m sure most people do. <br /> <br /> But if we assume that the writers will cope with this task, perhaps “Lost” is the best show on television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
