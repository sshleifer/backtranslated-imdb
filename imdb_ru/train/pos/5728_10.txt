I went to this film, waiting for an elaborate scary film. What I got was scared for fear. This is a horror movie in its essence. It's not boring, like in other horror movies, where there are simply ghosts and blood in the haunted house. This film does not even show you most of the deaths, it shows the fear of the characters. I think that one of the best things in the concept is where not only the house pursues him, no matter who enters the house. They are pursued, wherever they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some external reviews, I am really surprised that the critics did not like this film. I am going to see him again this week and am very happy about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars, because it did what a horror movie should do. It scared me to death.
