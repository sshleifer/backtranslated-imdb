Without a doubt, Beat Street is the best movie about the breykin scene. Everything in this place, clothes (cougar), music and, most importantly, dancing! The main storyline is the baseline, but what is there to talk about? The whole point of the film is to show what the children of that time were doing that mattered. This shows that teens are generally good, all that mattered for these everyday children is music, dance and friendship. Having recently watched a DVD, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it stood the test of time! The clothes did not look outdated (perhaps due to the fact that Puma is now having a massive return), the music still sounds fresh, and dances are still exciting to watch the film. Anyone aged 10-25 should see it as part of their youth culture. .
