This is the best of the high-quality series of Shelley Duval "Fairy Tale Theater." Ugly stepsisters are a comedic relief, and Eva Arden is the personification of an evil stepmother. Jennifer Beals perfectly copes with the role of straight Cinderella, especially in the garden scene with “The Charming Prince” Matthew Broderick. Jean Stapleton plays the fairy well, although I’m not sure that I liked the “Southern Lady” feature with some lines. The comedic relief of Steve Martin as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is typical Martin, but a bit out of place in the show's stream. <br /> <br /> As usual in the series, there are several ironic comments for older children (age 15 and over). With a couple of little bumps, the show goes well and they live happily ever after. Children under the age of 8 will continue to watch it after their parents finally get tired of it - I found that 3 times a day is too much.
