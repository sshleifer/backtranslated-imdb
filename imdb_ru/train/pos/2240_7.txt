My constant love for Italian actress Lucianne Paluzzi, who helped me start puberty with her performance in 1965 in Thunderball, led me to some rather unusual places. For example, this is the 1959 British curiosity "Carlton-Brown from F.O.", in which Lucianna plays one of his early roles. In this film, she plays the princess, although in fact the picture is a demonstration of the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, whose stars were probably on the rise at that moment. In this sweet, often very funny film, we learn about the island nation Gaillardia, similar to Madeira, which was a British colony until 1916, and then completely forgotten. However, after forty-three years, he becomes the center of universal attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there, and Her Majesty sends clumsy Carlton-Brown from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take responsibility. Terry-Thomas perfectly emphasizes this role, as does Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphiboulos of a tiny country. (This was Sellers’s second film of 1959 about a tiny country that connected wit to the world, the other one was “The Mouse that Roared”, of course.) Jan Bannen almost steals the show here as a suave King of Gylardia, and my girlfriend Lucianna is as attractive as possibly in her minor role. The film shows a lot of dry humor, although there are some enthusiastic laughter that you need to have (for example, at the reception at Gaylard airport, and especially at the May Day parade of the forces of Gylard). And the miserable Prime Minister Sellers with his cracked English and seemingly eternal stains of sweat is another memorable character in the pantheon of this great actor. Despite the occasional case of two deciphering British nonsense, I found this picture incredibly modest entertainment, and is well represented on this clear DVD Anchor Bay.
