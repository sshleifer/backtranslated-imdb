Well, here is my personal list of the best Nicktoons shows, like today: <br /> <br /> 1. Square pants "Grown Up / SpongeBob" <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a teenage robot <br / > <br /> 3. Invader Winters <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Did you notice the word only in capital letters? This means that this is Nick's show, which I am going to talk about. <br /> <br /> “Catscratch” is a simple but brilliant animated comedy about three rich cats - Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle, who in strange and REALLY surrealistic situations, from trying to join the Kimberly Man overnight party root beer to save the planet slugs from an evil spaceship. This is one of Nick's shows that will sooner or later tickle your funny bone! The song on the topic is catchy and catchy. The voice actors — including Wayne Knight from the Seinfield franchise — enliven characters with very bizarre personalities. Stories are pleasant (episodes of fans would be "King of all root beer" and "Lucky Claw Gordon"). And the humor is all done in some Jim Earthworm style. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Catscratch is one of the Nicktoons series, such as Invader Zim and MLAATR, which is becoming very, very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less.
