While the Lady from Shanghai was being created, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth fell apart. Wells tried to light up the old fire, both the film and the classic classic noir. At that time, the Shanghai Lady did not receive due approval, and over the years she received more and more critical acclaim. With age, so to speak, it became better. <br /> <br /> Wells is an Irish sailor, Michael O'Hara, who in the fateful night rescues the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three robbers in Central Park. Sparks fly, but then comes, it turns out, a woman married to a crippled, but brilliant criminal lawyer Everett Sloan. Nevertheless, Sloan obviously likes Wells and he hires him to the skipper of his yacht. <br /> <br /> So far this film is starting to be like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and at that moment had not thought with his man, he would have jumped back to the sailor’s reception center in Lower Manhattan. Instead, he is drawn into a beautiful web or intrigue and is tied to two murders and Sloan as his outstanding adviser. <br /> <br /> Wells, for any reason, decided that his wife would be a blonde in this film. Supposedly, Harry Cohn fell on the roof, as Rita was world famous for her copper-red hair. This may have spoiled him in the picture when he joined the studio bosses legion, who saw Wells’s vision of an independent film endangering their power. <br /> <br /> Stage actor Glenn Anders plays partner Sloan Grisbee, who is one slimy dude, he gets a corpse. Another corpse that will be here is Ted DeCorcia, a private investigator with a breadwinner who is trying to do business for herself. <br /> <br /> This is a good noir thriller, featuring Rita in her best-looking form, even if she was blonde. Here it is. The final shooting in the mirrored room is perfectly organized, but I would not advise her to see if on some controlled substance.
