Soapdish is one of the best, but least remembered comedies of the 1990s. The film revolves around various backstage dramas that take place behind the scenes of the cheap “Daytime Soap Opera”. The first of the film’s impressive strengths is the fantastic cast. The film "Soapdish" featured some of the greatest actors and actresses of their era. <br /> <br /> The film is led by Sally Field, an actress suffering from neurotic aging, Celeste Talbert (she is very hysterical when she puts on a costume that makes her look like “Gloria F * CKING Swanson!”) Her cast sounds like “who is who” from the 90s of “Great Movies”! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Kevin Klein and Katie Najimi - all this greatly enhances the film. Goldberg is predictably superb, while the performances of Downey Jr. and Hatcher hint at the comedy excellence they later achieved. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the script, the film is outstanding. The scenario has a truly modern advantage, which several times turns into a surprisingly strange one. There are also several visual jokes that are well ahead of their time. In a sense, the film resembles Mel Brooks at its best and often reminded the reviewer of High Anxiety (1977). Much of the film's humor depends on how often it is terrible, but rather accurately, the reports about daytime television, about neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, casting actors with an exploitative performer, played by Carrie Fisher, is cheerful and honest. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, “Soapdish” is one of the best Hollywood comedies, created in the 1990s. This is a great script and the cast of the A-Class, which is a must see. It's hard not to like this movie after it made you laugh for 90 minutes.
