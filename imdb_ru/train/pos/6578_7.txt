Ironically, for a play that was inaccessible for a long time for a movie or video, “Guns and Man” have remained fairly accessible on stage for many years since its debut in 1894 - in no small part because they have aged just as well. as a solid satire on nature. heroism and business war. Whenever the world plunges into a struggle, WEAPONS AND PEOPLE seem to soar more relevantly than ever. <br /> <br /> This is a play that Oscar Strauss (from most of the best ideas of Shaw) turned into a successful operetta CHOCOLATE SOLDIER (when Hollywood reached * this, * they left Shaw's last traces, and did not pay him for his rights - he was by then the winner of the Oscar itself). Although in “Arms and Man” the best of Shaw was always his ideas and dialogues, and not his naked plots, the plot also shines, and the master controls a happy ending for all interested parties. <br /> <br /> Young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter), the daughter of an officer and the richest man in her city, is betrothed to a dashing officer in the Bulgarian cavalry, and everything looks good until the Swiss mercenary (Peep Torrens) breaks out) with the other side climbs up its drainpipe, fleeing the battle where its army was defeated. As usual in the show's satire, everything is not as it seems at first glance, and social agreements stand before them in the light of a simple - and not such a simple reason. There are no "good guys" or "bad guys", just people of different classes, perfectly mastering their minds - just like life is only better - and, of course, with Shaw, the wit is perfectly honed by all interested parties. br /> <br /> The early (1932) version of the movie (from Shaw’s own script) of this most traditional and traditionally ridiculous of the stage satire of the Show, and one of his first ones who really hit this side of the Atlantic has long disappeared without a trace. Shaw did not sell the rights to the screens for his plays - he licensed them only for 5 years, and it turned out that thanks to the rapidly developing sound technology, thanks to which the films of 1932 look primitive only a few years later, Shaw did not renew the license for its display. Therefore, we are deeply indebted to the BBC for finally releasing their 1987 version of the broadcast in a DVD box with nine other brilliant plays. (Somewhat sadly, PYGMALION, which many consider to be the best on Shaw's show, works least well on this set with Lynn Redgrave and James Willers.) <br /> <br /> Even as a pair, like on his DVD, With the less impressive act of "Man of Destiny", "Arms and Man" turns into a real treasure. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter continued, cutting her teeth on such television roles as this, to a great film career. This will lead many viewers to this early role. They should not be disappointed, as Ms. Carter gives an idea in accordance with the multi-layered innocent audience expected from her, but under the somewhat pedestrian guidance of James Sellan Jones (and despite the uniformly beautiful and well-watched BBC physical production) the harmful fire of the role (and its outrage at undervaluing in the last act) amounts to only about 80% of its potential. <br /> <br /> About the real star of the play, Pip Torrens, you can say the same thing as Blunchley "Switzer". This is a beautiful, attractive presentation, but it does not apply to a physical comedy hidden in the early scene, when a young soldier can hardly fall asleep, despite his mortal danger. <br /> <br /> Despite these reservations, this is a solid production of a wonderful play moved to a small screen with aplomb. It deserves to be seen widely, and, ideally, encourages an even more lively remake on the big screen with the style and twist of a recent remake of WILD'S IDEAL HUSBAND. Virtually * any * WEAPONS AND PEOPLE should be cherished, and, if lucky, we may even end up seeing the original 1932 version. “To this or that surface, this product will appeal to anyone who loves a good show.
