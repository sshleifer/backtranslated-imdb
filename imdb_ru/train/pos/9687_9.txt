A talking parrot is not a creative idea for a new film, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant, touching film that will delight the whole family. She manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel cruelty during the separation of Marie and Pauly, and all the events in the film lead to an extremely satisfactory emotional conclusion. Animal training is well done - everyone will be amazed when Paulie spreads her wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character, and he should have done better, although this film was not the highlight of 1998, in contrast to Saving Private Ryan. These one and a half hours will certainly be enjoyable, and you will remember. The story of Pauli is touching, sad, happy and interesting - from the moment he is first seen, until the moment when he is united with his original owner, you will like to follow him and watch how he learns about friendship and gloomy realities of life . None of them will be missed if you have any heart or emotions. 9/10
