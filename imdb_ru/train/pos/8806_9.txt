I decided to watch this film on the day it was opened nationally in France, as a personal way to think about what happened a year earlier; the collection works as it was intended: it evokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, working as an intellectual image, never stooping to cheap sentimentality or knee reflexism. <br /> <br /> many statements were made that the film was anti-American: although I cannot speak for everyone in this regard, I am one American who considered such statements completely false. people make a lot of noise about Cheyne’s Egyptian segment because it voices the perspectives of Palestinian suicide bombers claiming that civilians in a democratic society are “just goals” because they choose the governments that bombers are trying to attack, but it ignores much more : several points of view are discussed, none of which is considered to be true, and critics - if they even saw this part - seem to forget about the tenderness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director m, and the specter of American dialogue, and strong sadness director, heard about the tragedy. <br /> <br /> To a large extent, all the films are beautiful, thoughtful and inspiring, in particular the brilliant work of Makhmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach and Inarritu. Nair, as usual, effectively tells the true story of the injustice perpetrated against the Muslim family as a result of anti-Islamic hysteria, which embraced - and still embraces - the state. I found Gita’s article a bit vulgarly loud and simple in its criticism of media hysteria in the face of terrorism, and Penn’s article was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes, although I expected I would like it. Borgnine is very good and brave about it. SPOILER WARNING: One reviewer below incorrectly read the fall of the towers as a happy moment for a character; I read rather that the fall of the towers is that, because the light floods his room, leads him to a loss in his life, which he refused to recognize. Again, this is a kind of impressionistic piece, because we know that if the towers really blocked the light in this man’s apartment, there would be nothing in his window except smoke and ash, and not light.
