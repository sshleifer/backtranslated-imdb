This is a real drama, controlled by characters and stories, at a level that shames most of what we see on TV at that moment. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the start. Do not despair if you are not a scientific fan (like me ...) It can happen on earth, the fact that it is in another galaxy only makes the show more interesting. no spaceships or laser guns (not yet). Until now, I have seen up to s01 e04, and I wonder what will happen next, since there are so many possibilities. <br /> <br /> Cast roles play roles with passion. Eric Stolz is especially strong. <br /> <br /> This show has really recommended itself, no matter if you looked at BSG or not, in fact they are completely different. I read some negative reviews from science fiction fans who expected less drama and more foreigners and beam weapons, etc. But, I would say, ignore them. <br /> <br /> This is really a positive start to the show. Hopefully, they will not endure this after 1 or 2 seasons, as they usually do with good shows these days.
