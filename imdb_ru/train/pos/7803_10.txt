I just finished watching this movie in my GCSE history class. it was exciting and it was a brilliant understanding of what actually happened to Steve Biko during the time of the apartheid law. How can anyone say that this film was the most boring or dreary for two and a half hours of their life, I do not know, because it hooked me from beginning to end. it was great how Denzel Washington portrayed him and showed how he fights against the apartheid law and for equal rights for blacks. In one part, Steve Biko tells the policeman that we are just as weak and humane as you are to show them that he and all the other blacks in South Africa are no different from whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he was faithful to what he believed in and did not completely believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko created a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and awakened the world. I really liked this movie and I highly recommend it to people. it helped me to understand that racism is wrong and that everyone is equal, their fate should not be determined by the color of someoneâ€™s skin.
