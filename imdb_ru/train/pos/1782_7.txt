I watched this movie three times. The last time I kept skipping tangled scenes was to find resolution for the plot. Perhaps the plot is not intended for logical combination. Or perhaps these coarse spots are conspired because Ann’s memory of distant events is rather erroneous. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who studied in an unnamed college with the descendants of a wealthy family. She must have helped get this very expensive education, but she never seemed to have any family connections. It seems that she never has relatives to whom she can turn when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions come into effect. <br /> <br /> Ann shares the evening of passion with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris comforts Leela after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds him disgusting and loathes his own behavior. I must have missed something important here. Anne's behavior seems completely inexplicable. Anne abandons her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the bridesmaid at Laila's wedding. Despite the fact that Ann rejects Harris, she continues to have a deep feeling on his deathbed. <br /> <br /> It was obvious from his behavior that Harris was very passionate about Ann and would love to marry her. A scene showing their casual encounter years after Leela’s marriage showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The film showed an example of Ann’s romantic relationship. She always had quarrels with her men, and she rejected them. This pattern was kept with Harris and two husbands. On the contrary, Leela married a man whom she did not love, and remained with her husband until her death. Perhaps Laila managed to build a relationship because she refused to allow her marriage to fail. <br /> <br /> Then Laila Ross arrived at the bedside of Anne. Obviously, nurse Anne was able to extract enough information from Ann’s last few clear moments to identify and contact Leela. None of this message appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking about the house in which Ann lived in recent days. How could she afford to buy such a house for the meager earnings of her singing career? Ann always seemed one step ahead of financial distress, raising her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level I really liked the setting of the film and the music. The seaside mansion was so heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Danes was radiant, like a young Ann Grant. She is really a talented singer. I prefer her natural brunette to be a dark blonde, like she was in films. If only these annoying CGI fireflies were gone, I could lift the film to the full voice!
