I recently filmed an animated version of The Lord of the Rings on video, after seeing the live version of the FANTASTIC 2001 film. The Lord of the Rings trilogy, director Peter Jackson, will undoubtedly be much better than the George Lukas Priquel trilogy “Episodes 1- 3 ", like a true fantastic 21st century movie series! <Br /> <br /> I remember watching the animated version as a child, and I didn’t quite understand the depth of the film at that time. Now, when I read books, I understand what the whole plot is about. Of course, some of the characters are pretty stupid (Samwayz Ganji is especially annoying, almost the same as Jar Jar Binks in the first episode of Star Wars (HORRIBLE!)), But I have to say, he follows the book pretty closely part of the second book, Two Towers. The good thing is that the action is somewhat interesting, and some of the animations are quite remarkable for their time. The bad thing is that it ends halfway through the Two Towers without any result of Frodo's attempt to destroy one ring, and the animation looks rather outdated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, not so bad as many say. BUT, the live action version of 2001 is the new hallmark of the Lord of the Rings! At least, Ralph Bakshi was serious about the script! Peter Jackson said that the animated version inspired him to read books, which in turn made him create one of the greatest fantasy series ever filmed, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for that! I'll take an animated version of The Lord of the Rings over the live version of Harry Potter at any time! <br /> <br /> 7 on a scale from 1 to 10, LESS less fierce than the live action version of 2001, but nowhere near so good! For unshakable fans of books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.
