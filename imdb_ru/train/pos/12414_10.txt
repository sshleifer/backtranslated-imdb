Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best horror films in prison set (for example, House of Death or Chair) in the late 1980s. Twenty years ago, guard Lane Smith wrongfully executed a convict. Now he is the superintendent of the newly opened prison, and the ghost of this man returns for bloody revenge. In this atmospheric and very capricious film there are a lot of terrible bleeding and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder in advance for an entertainment slaughter.
