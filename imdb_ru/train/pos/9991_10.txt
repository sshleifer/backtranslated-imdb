I thought this movie was hysterical. I watched it many times and highly recommend it. Mel Brooks, great. The cast was fantastic ... I do not understand how this film was rated 2 out of 5. I liked it ... I saw his other films, and they too were funny, but this one is really remembered for humor ... Its I just can't say enough about this movie. I expect it to be periodically, but it will never be enough for me. People playing homeless were compared to the funniest standards. Please put this movie more often. I don't see it enough .. Lesley Ann Warren was also my favorite, starting with Cinderella. I always thought she was not very funny, but I loved her game. In this film she was very funny ... and she and Mel did a great job together. They should put more of his films on television.
