I still love him about 17 years after seeing him for the first time, in fact I found that I had lost my copy and was very upset. Despite the fact that it is not related to the original (which, as a child, I never noticed, and, as an adult, I am not indifferent), this is what cartoons should look like. Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough for everyone to enjoy. I am more than glad that my parents raised me on such things, and not on the cartoons we see today, which teach our children nothing. The music is great and itâ€™s stuck in your head forever ... I downloaded the whole soundtrack at one time or another.
