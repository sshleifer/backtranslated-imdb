There is a compelling reason that Walter Pijon warns Leslie Nilsson and his crew from the aid ship, which he does not dare to dream about. <br /> <br /> Like Dr. Edward Morbius, Pijon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years ago. Since then, he married another expedition member and had a daughter, Anna Francis. These are the only people left on this planet that once was the home world of an ancient civilization known as Crell. <br /> <br /> Records decoded by Pijon indicate that Krell has come to a disastrous ending of unknown origin. The mechanism they left is still functioning. <br /> <br /> It is possible that it works too well, as members of the help party are beginning to die and are especially terrible. <br /> <br /> I see all the possible assumptions about the remake, and this film cannot be redone, because it is as fresh as it was in 1956. The terms would change, we would now say that the speed of deformation instead of hyper-drive Due to the enduring popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We cannot see men on an expedition to aid in a flying saucer like a spaceship. It might look more like a 2001 Star Ship or Space Odyssey. It is interesting to watch sci-fi films of different generations and to see how ideas about the future are changing. <br /> <br /> The story of the Forbidden Planet is an eternal story about mortals trying to play God. /> <br /> You cannot write about the Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robbie Robot. This mechanical miracle, connected by Pijon to the knowledge he gained while studying Krell, was a real blow that day. He received a new life in the sixties with the character of a robot from Lost In Space. His scenes with Count Hollyman, who plays the cook on a spacecraft, and his satisfaction with Earl's requests for some homemade spirits are very funny. <br /> <br /> Robbie and other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but lost the Ten Commandments and the parting of the Red Sea. A failure with the Forbidden Planet is to run into a Hollywood founder such as Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> There are classics among you who recognize the "Forbidden Planet" as a futuristic remake of "The Storm", which, if you think about it, could be Shakespeare. take risks in science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite cast is Warren Stevens, whose victim lets Leslie Nielsen know exactly what he's dealing with. <br /> <br /> Never miss this movie when it is broadcast.
