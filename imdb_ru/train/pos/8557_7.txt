I have to pass this on to the creative team behind these films "American Pie". “Direct To DVD” is synonymous with cheap, incompetent filmmaking. And yet last year I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that I fully enjoy the sequel to the Naked Mile DVD. The filmmakers took the opportunity to create a funny, but funny movie. This year they are offering a sequel to Beta House. It's true, Beta House makes the first few American Pie movies look like The Little Mermaid. <br /> <br /> It has no barriers, tasteless, laughs out loud. Of course, the story is a little thin, but that's the beauty. During the first 10 minutes, we meet with all the main characters, new support characters, we get a handful of evil jokes, meet with the villains and establish a common storyline. Despite all this, the film becomes a trip without limits. There are a lot of gags, and they are NOT holding back on this. I'm talking about male sperm, urine, dildos, tiptoes with pussy, sex with sheep, female orgasim sprays and much more. Not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobies or the sex scene. <br /> <br /> Returning from The Naked Mile, John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a similar supporting role, like the last few films). The whole cast is great. In particular, Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) has great energy and presence on the screen. I predict good things for him. The film is also loaded with excellent movie links for those who keep an eye on their eyes. Of course, the biggest laugh of the film for me was a parody of “The Deer Hunter”. Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you are a fan of the show, you will feel at home with Beta House. It really widens the boundaries of good taste, but in the end it’s damn ridiculous.
