When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another movie. I was wrong. This movie sends a powerful message about how to judge others. I was deeply moved. To everyone that I came across, I recommended this film. No one came back and said it was bad. Busy, also coped well with his role in this film. I donâ€™t know much about her acting career, but wow how she handled it was great. <br /> <br /> In the beginning it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital ... wow, the film resumed. I have no idea why this movie was not talked about in the movie world. I would like this film to be released again and advertised more ... because it sends a powerful message in just an hour and a half.
