Another of those films that you heard about from friends (or read about IMDb). Not a lot of false notes in this. I could see practically everything that is actually happening here with a young girl running from a dead end to her hometown of Tennessee in Florida, with all her worldly things in an old battered car. <br /> <br /> A heroine, Ruby makes several false starts, but learns from them. I caught myself thinking why, why, she no longer leaned on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her own reasons, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> Just a good movie. I think the only thing I donâ€™t really like about this is the name.
