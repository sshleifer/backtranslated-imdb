all the actions done in the first season were really awesome. First look at Max and Zack you see through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazarus or, as I like to call them mini. mini do the best acting work I've ever seen, kids do. main actors and actresses, that is, Jessica Alba Michael Weathery, etc. make you forget that you are watching a fictional TV. show that they seem to make this show alive. in general this is the best show i have ever watched
