From the stream of Austin films of the 1990s, this is my favorite movie, even more than Persuasion, which turned me into Osteniana. Before I saw this Emma, ​​I saw two previous versions, but in one Emma seemed completely wrong, more like Lady Tizl, and in the other she seemed half wrong, as a possible impostor, whereas here she seemed just right young and stupid. and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude and atmosphere of production conveyed the charm of the novel extremely well; indeed, it is one of the sweetest, funniest things I have ever seen, rather in the form of a Christmas treat. The script is unusually well formed, and the additions of the adapter, such as the beam of light that shows Harriet Emma in the church, are all in line. Mark Strong, like Knightley, is not what I expected, but I really liked him: he strongly emphasizes the character’s outspoken, practical side, unlike Emma’s emotions and his choleric outbreaks against Frank Churchill, are quite amusing, Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse is a figure of almost Carroll’s absurdity; Samantha Morton, as a protégé of Emma, ​​is as soft and smooth as it should be. And as in the Pride and Prejudice of the same manufacturer, they take care that you can believe in possible combinations of characters - unique in some cases. For me, this product has always been a delight.
