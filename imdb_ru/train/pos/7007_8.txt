From the first scene you are given clues as to what may happen here. This is becoming more and more obvious as the story continues. The acting is great and these actors touch your soul. Although I knew what was going to happen, I was extremely puzzled by the motive. I'm still puzzled as to why Ben did what he did. We could see “second thoughts” on his face, but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and touching story, but it embarrassed me. Maybe that was the point of the film. I liked the movie, and Wil Smith can choose another good movie. This guy knows how to entertain the audience!
