This film was a disaster at the box office, and the reason for this is the innocence of the film, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such a story is very good, the director tried his best. Abhay is gorgeous and impressive, and he shines again in his role, he did his best in the comedy or in the emotional scene. Soha looks so cute in the movie. The acting star was just fine. Music and all the songs are good, Khimesh is impressive as a singer here Do not miss this film, it is wonderful and enjoyable for us. Abhay is the best work to date. I will give 9/10 of Acist Acista.
