This is not a movie for fans of the usual creepy stuff. Rather, it is for those who value a good story, or are tired of ordinary things with obvious sentimentalism and oprah "This is such a wonderful movie! You have to see it!" - semantics (though this time it is right!). <br /> <br /> The story flawlessly unfolds, and we embark on a journey that I believe most of us will ever know. A compassionate, existentialist journey in which we correct our past, approaching our inevitable demise. <br /> <br /> Acting without mistakes, cinema also (sometimes quite brilliant!), and the dialogue goes down to the viewer to understand the details of the story. <br /> <br /> Warm film. Not overly sentimental.
