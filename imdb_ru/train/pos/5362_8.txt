“Running Man” with TOTAL RECALL is my favorite Schwarzenegger film. No, it is not 2001, but it is not. Both the action and the script are not even on par with other Arnie films, such as PREDATOR or TERMINATOR. But I argue that the IDEA behind this film is one of the coolest ever to appear on the big screen. A state-sponsored game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete with “heroic” stalkers armed with all sorts of weapons (runners don't) to satisfy the public's thirst for sport and blood. The main prize for the winner: freedom. Or so say the rules. <br /> <br /> For a film with such horrible death scenes and funny plots, there really is something to say. Someone else pointed out all the comments on culture / government presented in this film, so I will not go into details. Suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly stupid feeling of a movie, you will love it (especially if you are a big fan of fiction with great imagination). As I said, he is not trying to be a serious feature film, but it is surprisingly multilayered for an 80s film. The premise is borrowed from the short novel by Richard Bachmann (aka Stephen King), but rather strongly at odds with his source material, especially towards the end. (The book ends quite nihilistic; it goes without saying that this film is not.) I liked both of them, but I like the film more. <br /> <br /> My favorite line is: “I think this is caused by steroids.”
