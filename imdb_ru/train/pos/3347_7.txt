Robert Mitchum plays the role of Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western: “The Man with the Gun” Tollinger is the city’s professional tamer — for example, when a city needs someone to save itself; he is the one who was brought for this. Tollinger's last performance was an accident: he, walking through the city in search of his former alien, enters the city, which is played by the local western gangster, like a puppet. But many townspeople are beginning to regret the day when they hired Tollinger, because his method of cleaning the city becomes very burdensome (suddenly the Drifter of the High Plains seems less original). <br /> <br /> “The Man with a Gun” begins as a regular western film about tough guys, but it starts to surprise you more and more as the movie progresses. What begins as a forgetful and mediocre becomes dark and character-oriented. The whole movie is very well shot, and the cast is very pleasant. Mitchum, as usual, plays himself well here in “Man with a Gun” - this is not one of his best performances. Mitchum still has a cool and effective presence of a tough guy at high speed, and he is amazed at the intense, meaningful and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park. The man with the gun is a Mitsumsky western, and he is easily worth the time spent.
