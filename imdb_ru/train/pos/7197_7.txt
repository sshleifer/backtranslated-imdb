There were several films about Zorro, some even shot in Europe, for example. Alain Delon. Outstanding actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins also played this role, but for me Reed Hadley has always been the best of all times. This series gives you the opportunity to see an interesting Western, in which you will find only the real villain, Dona del Oro, at its end. The series also played a lot of B film actors such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, timeless villains such as John Merton and Charles King, and Hadleyâ€™s very good performance as Zorro. He was fast, smart, well used his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any Zorro.
