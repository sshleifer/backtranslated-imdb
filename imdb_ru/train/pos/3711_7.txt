“The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!” ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Lawton shot The Night of the Hunter, a creepy piece of southern Gothic, in which Robert Mitchum plays a terrible serial killer. One of the most famous scenes of the film consists of two children running from Mitchum in a rowboat, the children frantically row while Mitchum stalks them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played the same creepy killer in Cape Fear, another film shot in the American South. This film was attended by a local lawyer trying to protect his family, as well as the film "Mitchum" terrorized people on the boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese, trying to develop and do something more massive, reworked “Cape of Fear”, the scene with boats and all that. <br /> <br /> Now we have the “Gingerbread Man” by Robert Altman, another piece of a small town. Southern Gothic Altman says he turned to Hunter's Night for inspiration and started such a popular film only because he wanted to “spread his wings and try popcorn,” but what he secretly tries to do here is to deconstruct canonical films gothic <br /> <br /> So instead of opening on a small boat, we get an opening on a giant ship. Instead of kidnapping two children, we find that two children are safely returned to the police. Instead of hiding money, we have money that is readily given out by will and will. Instead of a righteous attorney for the 1961 film and a regrettable attorney for the 1991 remake, we get a rather three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branach. Instead of monsters stalking a family, we get a hero chasing the bad guys. Instead of a monster breaking into a family's home boat, we have a hero hunting a monster aboard a monster's “home ship”. In the same way, instead of the murderous serial killer, we get the innocent pervert, played by Robert Duval. , and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Altman continues and continues, slightly turning everything, pulls over the edges and does his job. His touch is most noticeable in the first half hour of the film: the film is in a difficult space between ordinary plot narratives based on the plot, and Altman's love for overlapping dialogue, random narratives, camera roaming movement and the fact that the characters are not so much Introduced as they are just part of what's going on. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, despite the best intentions of Altman, the film never rises above mediocrity. Altman is too tied to agreements on “thriller format” to cause great damage, his style is too sluggish to cause tension, and the film is simply not radical enough to oppose other canonical films in the genre. The Gingerbread Man is too widespread to work as a cleaner Altman film, and too Altman to work as a major thriller. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not a waste. Robert Downey Jr., Kenneth Branagh and the usually unbearable Daryl Hannah - all turn into juicy performances. The film also has a pleasant atmosphere set against an approaching hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns. Although the movie "Cape Fear" Scorsese is not a complete disaster, the film still does not constitute anything special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 1990s, Altman made three films in a row in the American South: Kansas City, Gingerbread Man and Cookie. In contrast to Gingerbread Man, and Kansas City, and Cookie, the genre is engaged in broader, more free canvases, with which Altman was most comfortable. <br /> <br /> “Kansas City” is the most important of these two films, its class hierarchy, politics and crime, as well as its desire to radically break away from the framework of typical gangster genres, would have influenced all the serious 21st . authors of criminal films of the century (see, for example, "Wire"). However, cookies, although a much lighter story, may be the best picture. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he shot Images, an art house thriller. in 1972. <br /> <br /> Worth one viewing.
