I don’t know if it contains any spoilers or not, but I don’t want to risk being blacklisted until 3462. <br /> <br /> I completely disagree with the comments of viewers who described * Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist". They could not watch the same series as me. <br /> <br /> The series I watched portrayed the history of European colonization in North and South America and southern Africa without any inaccuracies. I did not see anything in the series that would depict Europeans as bad people who, as it turned out, were lucky, although the Europeans were often * lucky - and there is nothing wrong with that. Also, I did not see the indigenous people portrayed as poor little innocent things. In any case, the Inca was rather arrogant - as one would expect, any leader would deal with foreigners if his country was not conquered in a living memory by any other world power. <br /> <br /> I, of course, did not see anything that could be interpreted as Marxist or non-Marxist, except in an incredibly flexible imagination. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African nations have built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans do not have. At a time when they reached the peak of their success, the Aztec, Mayan and Incan * civilizations were * just as advanced as any other in the world - and just as rich; sometimes even more. Native Americans and Coyu * were * eradicated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just as European colonists were destroyed by tropical diseases such as malaria. (NOTE: The Koi San people are completely different from all other sub-Saharan African peoples.) <br /> <br /> So I don’t understand what some other commentators are complaining about. The only thing I can complain about is that the series does not tell me anything that I did not know by the end of the seventh grade. This film is nothing new in historical information. This, however, presents some good dramatization of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; production values ​​are very high; and he fills several holes here and there, which did not hit the sixth hour of Mrs. Gruber’s social studies at Milan High School. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy it, provided that you have a decent In primary and / or secondary school education you will not learn anything new, but you will have a pleasant and interesting time when you will learn something that they had already learned (or should have learned) by the time they entered high school.
