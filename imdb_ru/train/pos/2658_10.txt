Kubrick again demonstrates his amazing ability to create the perfect atmosphere for a movie. Mainly through cinematography, but also using ingenious musical score, he creates a frightening and sinister tone that sounds throughout the film and causes my spine to tingle completely from the very beginning. It is this impeccable atmosphere that makes the Shining a masterpiece, as it is in my eyes. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest views I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic depiction of a mad mind. Duval and Lloyd are man-made to be cute, but it's easy to see through these two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. In addition, it presents the actor with the greatest name of all time (Skatman Kroters).
