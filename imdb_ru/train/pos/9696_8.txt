I am not a fan of new films, but this film was very nice to watch. Adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! My aunt liked it too. He had laughter, tears, love, adventures, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of the beloved, The Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and is experiencing many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always remembering his decision to find his girlfriend Marie. Highly recommended.
