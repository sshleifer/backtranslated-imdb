This show is good. I like acting, funny beats and wit. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ..., etc., they all did very well on the show. The show began splendidly with his funny, illogical main idea of ​​returning the dead people to the first series and, frankly, as people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a little disappointing, but later they became good again. And now I really hate the fact that it will be canceled. Why doesn't ABC just allow him to finish until the very end, when all the episodes have already been done? I really want to know how the story will be. I think this should be given a chance, as there are still so many viewers who love it.
