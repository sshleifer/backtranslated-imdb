Zero day makes you wonder, even rethink why two boys / young men will do what they did - commit mutual suicide, killing their classmates. It captures what should be beyond the strange way of existence of two people who have decided to leave common courtesy in order to define their own / mutual world through joint destruction. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie, but considering how much money / time the director and actors had, this is a great product. In terms of explaining the motives and actions of two young suicides / murderers, this is better than “Elephant” - in terms of the fact that a film that falls under our “rationalistic” skin is a much, much better film than almost everything you are likely to see. <br /> <br /> Defective, but honest with terrible honesty.
