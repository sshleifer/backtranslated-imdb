This is a completely amazing and unexpected movie. You start by keeping an eye on a young man who hopes to get into the qualifying football match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will go to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young man is a girl, and girls (or women in this regard) are not allowed to “sit with men” at football matches. This is followed by a wonderful comedy, played with the unsurpassed skill of a small cast. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women (and in this regard, young soldiers who must drive them). There are several excellent decorations, not least when one of the girls should go to the toilet, and, of course, there are no toilets for women in the stadium. Filming is the simplest, and in a sense this story could be told as a stage play. Yet this is a small scale that gives the film its bite. Great cinema? No, probably not; great fun - for sure.
