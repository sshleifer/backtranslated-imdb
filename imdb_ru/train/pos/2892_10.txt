Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I have not watched this movie for about five years when I last saw it. The magic remains. There is something that definitely contains this sense of a storybook, songs are entertaining and everything is of a minor character, please. Villains in the form of step-sisters are completely evil and nasty. Then there is the most magical of all Disney mice that make a dress, and you know everything else well. To summarize, one can say that all four Disney Princess films are great, but this is a charming magical experience, watch and enjoy. Yes, and of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character of the film. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Helen Wood and the others in the film there is a feeling that you just can not help but smile. <br /> <br /> They say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, in the real world, some are believers, others are hope. In this film, it's even more magical when her rainbow smiles. <br /> <br /> And of course, everything else ... Cinderella
