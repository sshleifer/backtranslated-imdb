A great addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys are a movie that you donâ€™t see every day. He has great actors to go with a great story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he plays a role similar to that of John McClain. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a story about several hundred survivors. This is not a new story, but the story takes a new direction in this. <br /> <br /> A person (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about the virus that most people have destroyed. <br /> <br /> The actors in this were awesome. I have to mention Brad Pitt, who was hilarious because the psychiatric patient James Cole (Bruce) meets in a mental hospital. <br /> <br /> The director did an amazing job, providing us with a disturbing picture of a devastated future from an artificial virus. <br /> <br /> Animals that were seen in the virus world created the impression that they control the world when people are driven into underground structures. <br /> <br /> This film was excellent and must see, as well as own it. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
