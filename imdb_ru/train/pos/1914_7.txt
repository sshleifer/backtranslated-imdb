Eight Simple Rules began as a very interesting series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessy, and his relationship with children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I have always preferred Kerry Bridget, Bridget has done this before, Kerry is quite unique, and I can relate to her in many ways, although I’m not sure that I like the direction in which her character walked in later series. <br /> <br /> Early episodes were funny, good simple stories for teenagers about the discipline of Paul and Kate children, but I think the show lost its brilliance when John Ritter died. I admired the actors and the film crew for wanting to continue the series, but when he died, I felt that the program had coped. For me, the whole essence of the show was based on the “8 simple rules for meeting my teenage daughter” manual, it was written by a real man with teenage daughters, and the relevance and perspective of the show changed without father Hennessy. <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed to be getting more and more annoying, Rory was still the same, and Kate always gave the lessons of her life to the children who earlier seemed funnier when it was all left to Paul. I think Grandpa is funny (especially when he watches The Great Escape), but I feel that C.J is not needed for the show. He is funny in details, but I felt that the storylines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. In the end, the new ones are not so bad, just skipping the excitement, and someone else is annoyed by the fact that Kate works at school, and S.J. and grandpa is always there? I would always recommend this show to friends, since at the beginning it was very strong and it was worth watching Paul and Kerry, but then at best they were average.
