The fake journey of Bill and Ted is a continuation of the great adventure of Bill and Ted. Their fake traveler follows almost immediately after the first movie and does the same, if not better entertain the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot that an evil man from the future is trying to kill Bill and Ted uses evil robots that are similar to Bill and Ted. After the robots kill Bill and Ted, they will have to compete with the grim reaper (death) and return their lives to normal. <br /> <br /> An acting role in a top-level film, and even it seems a bit strange at times, especially the talk of Bill and Ted, this is a great movie. Dear rockers made another great movie. Raise it the next time you are on a blockbuster!
