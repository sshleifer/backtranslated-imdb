I laughed a lot watching this. This is a fun short time with fun musical action and lots of silly acts. Characters are simple, but their simplicity adds humor to stylization. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything seems just wonderful. There Max, who obviously led a terrible life. And there is Edward, who is not sure what kind of life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, the mad boss of Edward. Tom has a short but memorable role. Highly recommended for anyone who loves silly humor. And you can find it online now, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all Jason cartoons and can't wait to see what happens next.
