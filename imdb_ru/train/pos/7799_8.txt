Very slow, but intricately structured and ultimately very moving. A beautiful, very believable look at the small beach town of Florida at the height of winter - I was there, and this is absolutely certain. <br /> <br /> This is also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe that this film is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in cinemas, and I recently shot Rubin again. With the exception of the clothes of the 80s, she kept very well. Esheli is so radiant and touching that it is difficult to think about her subsequent career without frowning. Boy, tell me about the failure of his early promise! Anyone who saw Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" would have suggested that this elegant, natural beauty was used in all sorts of interesting feature films and serious acting games - instead, she became the go-to girl for silly action movies and slashers! It is very disappointing, but at least we have preserved this beautiful performance in order to demonstrate its early promise. <br /> <br /> Some other commentators say this is not for everyone, as the pace is very slow. This is not an action movie or romance. The director (Victor Nunes, “Ulees Gold”, another excellent character study) relates to the life of this ordinary young woman with deep respect, allowing her stories to evolve slowly and with much detail. Thus, I think this is one of the most touching and respectful stories of coming of age, which I can remember - not about Ruby’s sexual awakening or “how she lost her virginity,” but about her life choices and her growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A great movie if you take the time to watch it ... I think it would be a really great movie to show teens and young girls (or boys for that matter) and give them the opportunity think and discuss it. <br /> <br /> Special thanks to the director Nunes, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and well-detailed that I assumed that throughout the film it was based in a female novel or memoir, but in fact this is an original work Mr. Nunez. Rated 8 out of 10.
