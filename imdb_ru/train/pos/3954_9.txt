Whenever they ask me to name the worst movie I've ever seen, I invariably answered “Black Midday”, and to this day nobody has heard of it. <br /> <br /> I watched him alone about 30 years ago. A gentle 13-year-old when my parents went out for the evening. As far as I know, it was only shown once in the UK and, unfortunately, is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If someone can trace a copy, let me know. <br /> <br /> If I watched it again now, it would probably be a big disappointment, but I always remember it as a particularly disturbing little movie!
