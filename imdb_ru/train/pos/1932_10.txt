I think that I usually appeal to comedies at film festivals with little expectation that they will invariably be “bizarre”, and that any supposed humor will occur solely due to the simplicity of the characters in the face of a complex context. What was special about Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to preserve the integrity and development of his characters in his film, while still finding funny humor in the scene behind the scenes. Refinement was perhaps partly due to the abrupt work of DP, which I rarely saw in indie films and even less often in comedies. Of particular note is that Paget Brewster - Amy, a math teacher. After watching this performance, I cannot understand why Brewster was not “discovered” by a wide audience. She brings the necessary combination of anger and sympathy to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential. This is a terrific job that deserves a larger audience. I look forward to more from the director and this cast!
