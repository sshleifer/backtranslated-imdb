WWE's last PPV in 2006 was a hit for fans, but for one reason only - in a tournament with Ladd London and Brian Kendrick vs. William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent PPV shit in December to dissolve, WWE realized that she had to do something for the fans to speak again, this proved useful when she presented MNM and The Hardy Boyz in the mix and announced that the match would be Ladder. <br /> <br /> The match was fierce and one of the best ladder fights I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a mess. Johnny Nitro didn’t even check his partner, they just continued as if nothing had happened, and Taylor and Regal didn’t do anything during the match, except that they had hit the people with several shots at the stairs. In the end, London and Kendrick retained titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere on the show, Kane defeated the MVP in a decent hell of a match when he set fire to the stupid MVP costume. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Van Young to retain the WWE title in hard work. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a complete mess, King Booker teamed up with Finley to take on John Cena and Batista. The action was cheesy, and no one cared about who Batista had chosen for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Kane defeated the MVP in a hell of a match. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Team Teams against Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a match for the ladder. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to retain the US title in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Van Yang to keep the heavyweight championship. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman defeated Mees in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker defeated Mr. Kennedy in the last match. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade - B
