I hate overly talkative French films, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most talkative French movie of all. I saw him twice in the mid-70s, and then he disappeared. But finally, I saw it again in 1999 and again fell in love. What is most remarkable is that today he feels as fresh as he was 25 years ago. If you have not seen this, do not miss your chance!
