Midnight Cowboy made a fuss when he was released in 1969, getting an X rating. By today's standards, it would be difficult to get a R. rating. New York. He meets a wretched street vendor named Ratso Rizzo, who is trying to make friends with Buck for his own purposes. These two eventually create a bond that is both touching and pathetic. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman was often brilliant, but never more than in this image. He is so in character that everything around him fades in comparison. The loss of the Oscar to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production, but this film has a grungy stomach that leaves an unpleasant taste in the viewer's mouth. Just look at the Hoffman performance.
