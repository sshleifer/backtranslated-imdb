This film has a clear storyline, which is quite unusual for a musical genre. The Cats, The Phantom of the Opera and Andrew Lloyd Webber's other musicals can be considered metaphorical, as they use literary works as a basis. The storyline "Biarkan Bintang Menari" (BBM) touches the very core of human relations, especially the Indonesian one. Despite the fact that the film was based on a “supposedly” fairy tale, in fact this is the fantasy of a “child” among adult Indonesians. The dance sequences are not perfect, but the songs represent how Indonesians express themselves. I believe that the choreographer should study the Indonesian way of dancing, not embarrassing the fact that the development of dance in Indonesia tends to be more westernized. The dance sequences seem awkward in some sense and are not synchronized with songs and / or music. Nevertheless, I still love this film and regard it as a new wave of Indonesian cinematic genre, which I hope to improve in the future.
