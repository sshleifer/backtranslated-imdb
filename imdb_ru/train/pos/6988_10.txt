This is one movie that will take time to get out of your head as soon as you see it. The dialogues are close to perfect, which is to be expected, since they were adapted from the play. The actors just try their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure bliss! <br /> <br /> Ivan Attal is completely trustworthy in his role, Sandrine Cyberlein is still a beautiful blonde (but not so dumb) who gives as much pleasure to his eyes as his ears, Jean-Paul Rove gives an excellent approximation to a complete jerk (and prides itself on being one), and Marina Foa is a stupid girlfriend who always makes mistakes when you least expect it. <br /> <br /> Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and colleagues for adapting this magnificent play and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there were more of them in modern production. If you like it, you will also surely like: “Un air de famille” and “Kitchen the addiction”. Both were written and played by a pair of Bakri / Jayi.
