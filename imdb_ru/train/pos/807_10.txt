Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between the Uprising and the Empire. The Second Death Star is nearing completion, and when it is completed, it will mean death for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, returns with Tatooine along with Han Solo and Princess Leia, who is now called Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead an attack on the Shields generator in Endorâ€™s Forest Moon, while Lando Calrissian attacks the Death Star. Not only do they know that the most ingenious trap was laid for them, and the Emperor Palpatine himself personally supervises the construction of the Second Death Star. <br /> <br /> Return of the Jedi - my favorite original trilogy. There is action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, stunning battle scenes and amazing music by John Williams. Mark Hamill now fully matured and became a Jedi Knight. The naive farmer left, and in his place a calm, relaxed Jedi, who decided to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this film, as well as Khan and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chuvey play their roles in T, and James Earl Jones is still the greatest movie villain: Darth Vader. Ian MacDyarmid is also a great villain, like the twisted and cruel ruthless Emperor Palpatine. The sequence of actions of this film is amazingly amazing, and the fights on swords are serious and tough. The score of John Williams is still cool and enhances the film by several levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
