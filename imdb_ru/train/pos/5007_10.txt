Barbra Streisand's first television special was fantastic! From her parody in childhood to her mix of songs in a high fashion department store - everything was top notch! It was easy to understand how this special offer received awards. <br /> <br /> Not confused by guest appearances, attention was focused on Barbra throughout the production.
