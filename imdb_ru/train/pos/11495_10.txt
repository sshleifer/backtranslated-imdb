We saw it at one of the local art cinemas in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, Texas. This was a complete surprise compared to the record in the ballot of the theater, but we were both amazed by the artistry. It was beautifully made and (apparently) photographed in the castle (the German name of the castle) somewhere in the district of Munich. This is a very clear study of the sexual relations of a group of twenty men and women, isolated from everyday restrictions. This is fantastic on more levels than I can remember. We came home after the film and talked until 4 am the next day. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mostly), so there should be at least two versions, since the first reviewer saw the film in (probably the original) German version. I searched and searched for the videotape version, but did not invent anything. Would love to have a VHS or DVD version of this. It explores relationships at a fundamental level, and is also an excellent educational tool on how to communicate with your partner. If anyone knows the writer / director, please convince him to release it again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine how tired I am to observe the frank performance of the actors, who are probably already over forty. Please, please return it.
