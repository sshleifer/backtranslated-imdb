Dude, some of you need to relax. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for reasoning or communication to justify it in your reality, why can't you understand that this is a work of fiction? Story. For God's sake, entertainment (no pun intended). It seems to me that too many of those present here are trying to be film critics - and they are not good at it. I am so impressed with Bill Paxton’s film direction work that I’m going to contact him personally to tell him. You know, if you weren't trying to analyze the damn plot line opportunity, you could just enjoy the movie. I and all my friends did!
