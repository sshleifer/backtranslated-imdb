I do not understand why the reviews of this film are so bad, if only I have not lost my mind. I found it sick, brilliant, perverse, and psychologically complex. In a Hollywood film, you wonâ€™t get a deeper understanding of the criminal psychopath than this one. It has layers inside the layers, nuances made by the Stone, and a plot that makes you guess even after it ends. People need to come to terms with the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old, but Michael Douglas is not. I predict that this film will be a big hit on DVD when people see it themselves and stop paying attention to unnecessary professional reviewers. Give him a chance, you might be glad you did!
