This is a great movie that everyone should see. It looks like a book by Dean Kunz. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton had a great game. Looks like he really believes in what he says and does. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why viewers should read some kind of propaganda of religious murder in the film. This is fiction. The ending is amazing, but fictional. So what? I think this is what makes this film so good. SPOILER DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU SHOW A FILM. Throughout the film, the viewer is constantly shocked by Paxton’s illness, the influence on children and the way children cope with this outrageous behavior. And then, in the end, it turns out to be true. God commissioned him to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant, as other viewers assume. Sure, he is given information that he could not have known otherwise, but the film goes on to show how God “protects” Adam through the convenient video quality problem and the total lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film does not promote the Christian murder, it simply sends the viewer on a very unexpected trip.
