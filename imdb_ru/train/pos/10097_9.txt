One of the first OVA (“original video animations”) I ever bought, it still has to be one of my favorite anime titles. A sci-fi comedy about cyberpunk against the background of an unlikely (for a comedy) background of pollution in the near future in a dystopian society. <br /> <br /> The “heroes” of the Dominion are the formed tank police. with the philosophy of “if we cannot defeat crime, we will get more weapons”, and who, as the name implies, patrol the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and who are actually far more dangerous than the criminals they are trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these policemen are borderline (?) Psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the phrase "free guns". <br /> <br /> No less colorful and amusing are their opponents, the terrorist Bouaku and his hench (wo) men, twin sisters, whose existence seems always to be connected with the difficulties of the police of tanks. <br /> <br /> Animation is not the most modern, but otherwise it is very good; the colorful palette and cartoon look of the characters and furs fit perfectly into the comic atmosphere of the Dominion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is very fun again. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. Interestingly, they ever made an album with a soundtrack to it ... <br /> <br /> In any case, Dominion Tank Police is great. This is a Japanese SF cyberpunk with a lot of comedies, filled with completely invincible characters and situations due to which he never takes himself seriously. Highly recommended.
