A great movie about the life of an old man who looks back over the years. Starting around 1910, he remembers his boy and youth; his family, friends, romances, etc. A very nostalgic play with a bitter-sweet ending ... “All things in life are combined into one whole, and the river flows through it. And this river is haunting me. ” Worth seeing.
