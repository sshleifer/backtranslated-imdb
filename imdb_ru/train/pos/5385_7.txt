I never watched the “Next Action Hero” show and, until I read the other comments, I did not know that this film was the “prize” of this competition. I just switched channels and stumbled upon this, and found myself looking forward to the very end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is over (the most dangerous game, etc.), but I was hoping and almost got “gocha” - as the main character is going to defeat the hunter in the end. I think high technology was overworked (GPS) and gave me memories of the Night Rider with a cold sweat, but, nevertheless, it was not too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The main problem I encountered in this film was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Unbelief) that was required from the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying a helicopter can throw countless incendiary grenades on a public bridge, and NO COPIES appear to conduct an investigation? Can a limousine make countless donuts at a crossroads in Las Vegas, and NO COPS appear? Pleeease. Too many things like this are fun to watch, but to keep it at least believable, thank you very much. <br /> <br /> The final decision was good, but the ending was disappointing, followed by a taste bad episode of Star Trek. At least now I understand why the game was so stupid - with the exception of Zayn, who doesn’t get as much work as IMHO deserves - they were winners in a reality show. <br /> <br /> Knock me out.
