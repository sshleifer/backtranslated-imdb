This film is one of my favorite. It's hard to explain why. Maybe it's Korin Nemeka's innocence and his awkwardness combined with Cheryl Pollak's courage, but this definitely has to do with the soundtrack. In addition, some characters have small lines or movements or moments that are fun in themselves. Finally, this story always makes me emotional, and the last scene is very bitter-sweet. In general, I love this movie; It is perfect for a sticky, sentimental girls night.
