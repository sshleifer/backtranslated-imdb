My father was the head of the prison (he is now retired), shown in this documentary, and I grew up in prison life, so maybe my views will be completely different from everyone who watches this movie. I will say this, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even the best people. They were brave enough to: a) show and tell this story, b) penetrate into these minds and hearts of prisoners and c) do it all responsibly. Responsible for their art and, more importantly, responsible for prisoners and staff of the Luther Suite complex. They must be evaluated without end for this work. To take 170 hours, yes HOURS, footage and be able to cut and shorten it to 93 exciting minutes - this is nothing more than unusual, and they respect me a lot. <br /> <br /> I saw this film under circumstances that only very, very few were able to see. I was on the inspection of prisoners. I was in the same room with these people as they watched their hearts pour out onto the screen. I saw people crying on TV and crying in the chair in front of me, and let me tell you, it was a very deep experience. These people committed horrible crimes in some cases, but still found ways to try to redeem themselves, even if they consider themselves unredeemable. How many of us have the courage to do this? How many people can do what they did in such a harsh environment? Seeing their reaction to the film is an experience for which I am eternally grateful, and I will never forget that. I thank the people who allowed me this glimpse in their lives, I thank my father for making EVERYTHING possible, and I thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour out their blood, sweat, soul and tears for this project. /> <br /> This film will change everything you think you know about prison life and the prisoners in it. "Oz" is not real, television is not real. "Shakespeare behind bars" is.
