This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Frames extraordinary, sometimes fascinating. He also received an Oscar for the best photo, and deservedly. I have a lot of films in my collection of films, and a few more that I saw besides them, and not many of them are shot more beautifully or even as beautifully as this one. <br /> <br /> This is a unique and generally beautiful film. The actors are awesome and do an excellent job of depicting their characters. We follow their fates with devotion and become very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn something about ourselves and our lives. I think a lot about this film, about what it represents and how it represents it. I highly recommend it.
