I was able to watch this movie entirely and was deeply moved by it. I wasn't sure if it was really a comedy or a drama - there were elements of both in it. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both looked great - our image of 60-year-old women has certainly changed since Aunt Bee! They are bright, beautiful, sexy! The only flaw in this film was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in the TV series "MTM" or "Rod" of the 1970s. I would have thought that since it was established in New York (where the Kin was installed), at least there would be a mention of her sister Brenda or that Julie Kavner would appear, suggesting, of course, that she is still in the Big Apple. <br /> <br /> I hope that ABC will make this series and will return for the guest performances all the old lineups of these shows. By the way, what's wrong with CBS doing this reunion or series? Wasn't it the network that carried the show MTM and Rhoda?
