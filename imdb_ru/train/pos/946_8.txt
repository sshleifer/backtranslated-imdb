Since the celebration of Christmas has evolved over the years, regardless of whether you are concentrating on religious or secular traditions, this is the time when people should behave a little better towards each other. It somehow slipped past one of Ebenezer Scrooge, a merchant and lender in 19th-century London. <br /> <br /> Since his nephew points to his uncle, he doesnâ€™t hold Christmas in any way, because Scrooge feels it is all this deception th century, Mr. Potter from Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens told this story, the Atonement is not too late for any of us, and a lone ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how it happens. <br /> <br /> A Christmas carol in prose is such a classic of timeless holidays that we sometimes forget that this is as much the 19th century British Social Commentary as Oliver Twist was. The characters in this movie are middle and lower class. Cratchits are a couple of steps above the street people in the Oliver Twist, but they have to struggle to stay there. Still love and happiness radiate their home, no, thanks to the guy who Bob Cratch works for. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did a lot of good things in his life, and he just needed to be reminded how much Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake-up call that he still has the potential to do something good about it. Old world <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart in his live performances and shot plays largely took on the role of Scrooge. But George Scott captured the old miser in this film pretty well. His meanness, but with a trace of sadness that makes us cheer for him to change. Scott joins the good tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastam Sim, who both interpret Scrooge beautifully. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles, I particularly liked David Warner as Bob Krachita and Edward Woodward as the nourishing and stern spirit of the Christmas present. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of the 32 versions of A Christmas Carol that they archived, and this is one of the best.
