This film proves that the "commercial" cinema or Hollywood films are in serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason why this film should have been shot, except for the fact that someone expected success based on the name of Shakil. The plot is worth mentioning: it is a bit more puzzled than the knot. What else? The screen is a bit dim, O'Neill is a bad actor, and Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
