Have you ever wondered why Pacific Islanders seem to automatically accept the sense of humor of black Americans? regardless of their ethnic background? Well, this film will not give answers to this frequently asked question - but it will serve as an excellent example. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, this film is a kind of “old school” for the inhabitants of New Zealand from the Pacific Island, which immediately raises the question of what exactly is the meaning of this task. Is it intended to perpetuate the deep-rooted stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders? Or is it intended to use this potential market? The story is weak, jokes without humor, and the final is expected. This film has done nothing for New Zealand cinema, as it is just a romantic comedy, devoid of any merits.
