Just not the quality I expected from Morris (I love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). It is very similar to a good student film. As for me, in all this, why did he win a BAFTA ??? Morris ridicules “hidden mediocrity” (Ayn Rand) in most of his work (Nathan Barley), and yet with this piece he urinates in the back of the talented and tells us that it is raining! <br /> <br /> I just hope that since he chose a topic that I would like to touch on (humanity of terrorism - Four Leo), he is not going to raise it, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of basic ignorance and opinions This emotional and strongly promoted phenomenon.
