I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated film on Ebay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this film. As an eternal fan of horror, from trashy American slashers to European zombie films, I told myself that it would be great! I can't tell you how wrong I was. First, I thought it would be much better than it really is. After all that I heard about this film, it was almost scary to watch it. Killing is boring. Acting ... forget it, no acting! The story, even if we don't care, is incredibly bad. It seems that they tried to attract your attention with some strange sex scenes and naked girls, but, unfortunately, in this case it does not help the film. What for? There is no atmosphere, and this is the worst in this film. It’s just a bad film making from point A to B. Although it’s very funny and fun to watch with friends and lots of beer, don’t make an effort to get it. There are so many movies in this world, don't waste your time watching the Necro Files!
