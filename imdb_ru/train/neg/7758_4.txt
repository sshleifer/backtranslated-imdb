there was a lot of blood in this film when the saber tooth attacked him, and I loved it when that boy and the women were having fun, and then the saber tooth attacked the women, ate her belly and pulled out her liver. it was the best, and the 1-ton saber tooth walking on its front legs, cheerful to make this film better, more action and less talk, if you know what I mean, and also, please, please, the people who did This film, do not make another film, like this film, ending with a reason. It was a terrible 1 live and killed saber-tooth, that women, after all, this film reminds me of discontent, ending always when 1 enemy remains! Well, damn it, this movie sucks, I can't believe it, I loved it when my lil bro was pissed off with stomach and blood attacks.
