... but it must be the worst adaptation of the Christmas song in history. And it requires some effort, as in the case of various life efforts. Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against Cecily Tyson. I enjoyed her in other roles (for example, look at Sipsi in Fried Green Tomatoes). But the script gives her no choice but to chew the scenery. And chewing on it she does with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim connecting the Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me the classics any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. Except for the possible Scrooged, all other excessive efforts to understand the past, present or future Spirit of Christmas.
