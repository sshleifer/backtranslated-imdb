<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed it. He became a joke on himself. Once again, we have a film about sex and violence, immorality, ridicule of women and personal conversations between characters and pans. <br /> <br /> All this for nothing. Because they are not in this film. It concocts all its fixed parts. All the actors give the appearance of performances from the film Verhoeven. In other words, it rages on action at almost every level. Star troop descended from his hands, because it was such a macho world in which the characters lived. In this, scientists act in the same way. Sorry, Paul, but the soldiers and scientists don't really have the same thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the plot’s main flaws was that after one night’s escape for doing evil deeds, Kevin Bacon’s character returns to the science lab, in which we have already spent more than enough time watching these animated mannequins (with the exception of Elizabeth Shu) walk and talk. Why not show the extent of what a character can do in the outside world. How could they track him if he could be anywhere at all ??? Think of all the different things that could be done with this concept, both in terms of history and in terms of characteristics. Then look at what this film does and you really understand how badly the whole project was made and completed. <br /> <br /> Even more offensive is the “Doku” on DVD, where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of magic genius. Well, one of the two is not so bad. <br /> <br /> There is nothing remarkable about this movie. Like the title. <br /> <br /> Emptiness !!!
