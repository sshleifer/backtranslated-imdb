Although the Bruce Willis film is always worth seeing, itâ€™s better to miss it. I watched it on TV, so I did not have to spend money on it. I'm lucky. <br /> <br /> The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so is plausible, by the end it is becoming more and more incredible. It is highly doubtful if such an experienced soldier as Lieutenant Waters would not obey direct orders. And even if he were, if the rest of his platoon were. They know that he puts them in direct danger, and they know that they will certainly die if they follow him, but what the hell is he - our lieutenant, so let's do what he says (despite direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> However, there are some good scenes in this movie. They are somewhat saving the village, where the rebels destroy the entire population. Well, they save a dozen or so villagers, the rest are already killed. The strange part of this is that they took the trucks left by the rebels. They rather go on foot. Perhaps because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for this. Anyway. I think that this is what brought the film one point, which I gave him. <br /> <br /> What made this film insulting to the brain and, therefore, completely unbelievable, is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without being wounded or killed. Only towards the end do they lose a few comrades. And this is only because they must fight an army of 500 or more people. Can you believe it? <br /> <br /> They fight with such a large army, kill hundreds of them and lose only a part of themselves. And they have ammo and ammo. Never run out of it. Grenades and Claymore mines, machine gun M60 and even RPG. Where they take these things. Carry it around or what? They even got a laptop, which shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that works for several days. Indeed? Who comes up with this nonsense. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you completely shut off your brain and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you will give this film a high rating. If not, skip this one. It saves you time.
