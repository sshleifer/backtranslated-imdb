This is the second film of the British rank, which tells about Sommerset Maugham. All but one story from the Quartet do not fit into the modern era; and the speech of the actors is resolutely “cut off”, as can only be in Britain before the 1950s. In any case, the "Trio" seems tougher and more cinematic than the first screen version. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that these two films cannot overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years before the films were released. Consequently, by the 1950s, the popular narrative of the “low morality” of Maume (pre-war) seemed rather strange, if not frankly modest.
