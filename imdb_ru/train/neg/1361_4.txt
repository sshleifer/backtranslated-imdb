I was excited to discover this comedy of the late sixties, in which some of my favorite people starred - Maggie Smith, very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment, therefore, was aggravated by the fact that the film did not work either as a comedy or as a perfect film about robberies. Ustinov plays a small temporary cheater, just released from prison, which places its sites in a large American corporation based in London. By bluffing past inept CEO Carl Malden and technical guitar Newhart, Ustinov pretends to be a computer expert and immediately plans the “perfect heist” of a part of the film. To do this, he needs to go through a secure security system that protects the mainframe of a corporation. And here is the first problem. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is surprisingly gullible and stupid. His unconvincing excuses are taken at face value, and it should be the only computer center in the world where there are no problems with video cameras. The second problem is that the robbery (really a fraud) occurs during the first 30 minutes of the film, depriving the rest of the picture of considerable tension. Maggie Smith, unfortunately, is mistakenly considered the neighbor / secretary of Ustinov, who simply cannot leave work. I love Maggie Smith, but she here seems too cohesive, too collected, a role that requires more wacky, physical comic. In addition, Ustinov and Smith do not have any chemistry together, maybe this is an age difference, but later romantic relationships, deprived of this novel, still turn out to be a bit creepy. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and at the time he was well thought out, but I found it an amusing, tortuous and sad waste of a large composition.
