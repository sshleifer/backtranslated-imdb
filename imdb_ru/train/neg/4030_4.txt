I remember watching Lost Rocket (in fact, I was fit with an attack, until my brother and several cousins, in whose house I was a night guest, agreed to watch it with me — from time to time I was 1960s Erik Cartman - sorry guys) and being somewhat embarrassed when a steady heat wave of a million degrees appeared as a conspiracy - even as a second-grader, I knew that a simple rocket simply could not carry energy for so much heat or devastation for more than and the radius of nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> My application of this turkey to loving relatives was a punishment itself. <br /> <br /> Film production was very good. The action is not bad (except for the actor Shatnerizm, who played the assistant governor, who was mentioned by someone else here). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​an Easy-Baking rocket on Earth's surface using the heat of its exhaust ... no. <br /> <br /> How did people in Mystery Science Theater 3000 miss the Lost Rocket? <br /> <br /> This is a great classic of an unintended comedy - watch it if you want something to drink beer on the weekend.
