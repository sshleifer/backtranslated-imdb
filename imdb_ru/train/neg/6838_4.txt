Summary of plot: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria tunnel, was killed along with his wife by his partners. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are separated. 25 years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, are joining forces to avenge the killing of their parents and qualify for the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettih worked together, after making the Lionheart. It is also the first of three films in which Van Damme plays double roles (the rest are “Maximum Risk” and “Replicant”). The plot is a very simplistic view of the story of revenge, the only feature of the film - Van Damme's performance as two completely different people. a rich and good-natured child and a cool guy with a cigar. Anyway, Van Damme does not do very well with this role, although his view of Alex is slightly amusing. It is surprising that the brothers mistaken for each other when they wear different clothes and different hairstyles. Bolo Jung makes a very decent minion for the villains.
