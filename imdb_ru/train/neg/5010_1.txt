Do not waste your time or money on it. A decent cast can mislead you, believing that this teen-thriller, although unlikely to break any records, may have a little fun for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Will not. <br /> <br /> It will not make you scared, laugh, cry or even challenge your intellect. It makes you wonder how this movie ever ended. Yes, it really is that bad.
