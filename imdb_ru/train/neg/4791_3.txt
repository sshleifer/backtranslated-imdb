* spoliers * read no further if you have not seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Raising after the oppressive “Phantasm II” has ended; Tall Man kidnaps Mike while Reggie and new guy Tim spend most of the rest of the film trying to get him back, and don't become slaves on the Red Planet of the Tall Man. This one gets really stupid: a trio of thieves in a bright pink hearse was only there for comic relief, and a black karate chick (I can't remember her name) was so annoying that I couldn't wait to see if the Tall Man killed her character. This sets him up so that he looks almost like Tim's character, who comes late and eventually becomes a hero, but ... this is not quite true. To the very end of this story, Liz is beheaded by dwarf killers, Mike implants a silver sphere into his skull, Reggie gets spheres, and Dwarfs get Tim, and there is no one else to stop the Tall Man. The bad guy wins - now how is it for an unexpected turn at the end? <br /> <br /> This was filmed in 1993 and was not released until '95, and the ending was final at the time, and although it is disappointing and anti-climate, it is also a suitable and suitable ending for this strange little series. But the fourth one changes this ending and adds nothing new, except bad jokes and an even worse and more meaningless ending ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
