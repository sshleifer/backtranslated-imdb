<br /> <br /> The worst. Movie. Ever <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of shooting this remake (except for turning it into a 90-minute commercial for the movie soundtrack)? Zombies that * run * ??? I believe that the director has never watched the original films of The Dead, which show hard limbs (from rigor mortis) dragging / staggering towards their live prey. <br /> <br /> And how exactly did the survivors find out which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed Steve? <br /> <br /> 1/10
