This film was hard to get, and when I finally saw it, the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the greatest stories of the twentieth century: an unknown person uses an unsuspecting aviation industry and leaves with millions of ransoms, without causing harm to anyone or disrupting attempts. With all this built-in interest, how could anyone make such a dull, talk-filled film about this real-life event. Although Williams is always interesting, the writers suggested that D. B. Cooper's persona was stereotypically as heroic as a movie star, because we get the typical type â€” without any interesting details or insight into the mind of a man brave enough and smart enough to cope with this. Garrold practically steals the film with its sperm and pure beauty, but the real disappointment was in the management of the plot and the lame direction. Shame on this film, even existing.
