Raising it for 50 cents at the flea market, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for about 15 minutes, then just repeating and boring. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s very nice to see Mick and the gang in their prime, I would like there not to be too many rewrites of the dialogue so that I can hear what they say and play. <br /> <br /> The parody is politically outdated, incredibly naive and simple, poorly written by Monty Python on acid. I spent more time looking at what happened in England at the end of the 60s, and not at what actually happened in silly parodies. <br /> <br /> This film is a good reminder that times really change, and what was important quickly becomes stupid. Good song, but now it has been played by this DVD.
