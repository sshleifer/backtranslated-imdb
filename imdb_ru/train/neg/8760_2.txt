This film concerns allegedly intact types (aesthetically and sexually), which obviously cannot withstand basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players take part, including John Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are based on a children's scenario that relies almost entirely on intelligent dialogue; which is not Nixon's role has the best features, but she often plays them too quickly, lack of time, which should be burdened by the director. The grotesque menopause uses all the available cliches, spent or not, and adequately completes this grim attempt at a comedy.
