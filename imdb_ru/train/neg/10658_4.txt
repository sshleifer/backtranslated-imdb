On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (note that you three of us Kamala fans) came to a unanimous verdict; VV was a complete shit, and thanks to the film we were going to screw it up on Monday. Not to mention that we vowed not to go to the cinema the next year. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Kamala here because he kind of hinted in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV), He said something like “Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Scenario, directing, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la "(Tamil cinema grew from the point of view of photography and editing, but we barely improved when it comes to script, direction and action"). While you are watching VV, These words sound very believable. <br /> <br /> Here are 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> < br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I can hardly hold I’m afraid to use curses here, but the fact is that HJ has mastered it perfectly knows how to spoil his recent film (think Anniyan, Gadzhini) with a sharp cacophony, he bills as background music. The next time I the eardrum transplant will be made, he will pay for it. <br /> 4. Songs No songs help move the film narrative spatially / temporarily, or make you sit and notice. The film is created from four VERY long songs with several cast scenes n in between. <br /> <br /> 5. Short went too far. VV is at best suited to be a short story, not 2 hours plus a "thriller." To use the cliché here, like the Energizer rabbit, it goes on and on; only in this case you do not want it. The later part of the film feels like a big delay. <br /> <br /> 6. Mating Kamal-Djotic Two ice cubes lost together could produce more sparks than this lead compound. There is no reason for you to support them in order to do this together. In fact, every time they get together in the second half of the film, they become a good irritant to the story. I hate to say it, but Kamalini Mukherjee's 10-minute romance does more than Kamal and Djotika achieve in this film plus Tenely. <br /> <br /> 7. Accent Kamala Khaasana Kamal has such a pretentious accent that no one speaks either in India or in the USA; and this is also not new. He has been doing this since the Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae. It just gets on your nerves. Imagine how much chaos this can cause when his talent for using this strange accent meets firing in the USA. He also does not leave him in the Immigration Service, he gives a dose of advice to his people (confused by T.N. Kopam from Keeranor, Satura and others) in the chaste Kamanglish (“What we have here is just bad police work”), of course , with a nauseous effect. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are several directors you expect to defend to a certain scale. Gautam is failing us badly because of some kind of crappy speech in the Department of Reason. Which dcp in his feelings would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss issues such as devoting himself and life afterwards! The scene inside the theater was so bad that it culminated; we could hear people behind us loudly challenging Hero's IQ. "He's stupid, can't he just use his siren or lights?" (On a busy road in Madras, the jeep Kamal-policeman-policeman rides a guy on a bicycle, like any ordinary dude!). "Can't he just use his gun?" (The “guy on the bike” starts walking, and we have a fully adapted Kamal in pursuit of the pursuit for a significant amount of time). I do not vote for the last, but just trying to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Blood and violence If I wanted to watch as women were raped, their throats were cut, more women were raped and thrown into the bushes with agonizing authenticity, I would sit at home and watch the “Police Report” or “ Kuttram. The use of excessive violence should contribute to the expansion of history, and not crush it! Somewhere below, Gautum seems confused by what stretching (rape, murder) is and what the basis (history) is! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double espresso could not get rid of the pain in my head.
