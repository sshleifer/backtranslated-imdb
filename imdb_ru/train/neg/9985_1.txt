Have I ever seen a movie more shocking? I can think of a multitude that equals it, but none that can surpass it. Cast all the terrible stereotypes permeated flat dialogue. I am ashamed of all the people involved in making this. Each of them is an expression of fear, caused not by the plot, but by the realization that this project can easily interfere with their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz do not give sufficient reason to subject themselves to this. Avoid, this is obviously a style of film that Americans really did not understand. If you want, look at the final result, and you will understand what I am talking about, but do not say that I did not warn you ...
