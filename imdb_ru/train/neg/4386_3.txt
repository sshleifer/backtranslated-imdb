with that title, you don't expect a big horror movie. But it was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really offensive and stupid: the escaped criminal is wearing a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he is someone else. This joke can really work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not for the entire movie! the actors are not so bad, but their characters are pretty stupid, and the story is boring and completely stupid. No waiting, no excitement and some blood (very cheap). Satan's Little Helper is trying to combine horror (...) with comedy and at the same time fails abruptly. By the end it became so boring that I actually stopped looking 10 minutes before the end. I didn’t care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great at Pulp Fiction, but come on ... it was 13 years ago, and after that she didn’t do anything worthy. It is therefore not surprising that she had to go as low as this piece of shit .. Avoid or be warned ..
