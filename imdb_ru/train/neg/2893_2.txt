What was that supposed to be? Fisher King remake? Why do we care about Sandler's character? What a slow, dreary, boring, film "who gives, damn it, about these people" !!! It just hurts to sit, I turned it off before it was over. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs help just like Sandler; as I said: can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character function in his daily life? We should not think so deeply, I think. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to attack him? If they were such good friends, how did they grow apart? If Cheadle controls the situation so much, why does he continue to seek advice from a psychiatrist on the street? We are never told. That's why Fisher King was the best movie on many levels and why it just sucks. Almost 8 out of 10 average points? I do not agree at all. Even the best films are lucky to get such a high average rating, and this shit does not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
