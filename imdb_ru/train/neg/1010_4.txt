I shot this movie last week. I saw that Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. And so it was, until Justin Timberlake came on the scene. He is really a bad actor, and he can no longer make a movie. I mean, he is one of the most boring, boring actors I've ever seen. He gives absolutely no emotion to any of his lines. What the hell was he cast as Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would be the best choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring that it seems like a bad combination of his character in American Beauty and John Dow in Se7en. It may sound cool, but believe me, it is not. <br /> <br /> Now Dylan McDermott plays very well. This is one of the few good things in this film. He's just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. He has really cool lines. <br /> <br /> About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated, sometimes it was good. I expected a big turn when Lasers (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but in fact nothing happened.
