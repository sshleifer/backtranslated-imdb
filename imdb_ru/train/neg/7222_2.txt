Knowing the comics of Enki Bilal for quite some time, I had to watch this movie. I thought it would be a good way for an artist, like Bilal, to spread his art and ideas among a wide audience. I also thought it was a good movie to recommend, and I thought that I would like to watch it ... I was wrong! Watching the movie was a real torture. The idea has potential ... but the movie leaves too much to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this film has the impression that he could do it better. I will not suggest whether you should watch this movie or not. Most likely, if you are reading these pages, what you have already seen, or that you will see it - but be prepared for a very bad 102 minutes.
