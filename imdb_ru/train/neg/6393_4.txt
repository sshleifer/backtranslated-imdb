I admit that I did not give this film a lot of chances. I decided pretty early on that it was just not my movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it looks great in terms of cinematography. Manhattan scenes of the early 70s look very good, like the main actress. This is a very clear black and white image that can make a film feel undated and fresh. However, some other methods that directors use are filming that threatens all hell. Scattered editing is VERY late 60s, somewhere between surrealism and a new wave. The story also seems to come from a very specific time, somewhere between free love idealism and fanciful experiments. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a young girl around the city who is looking for a man who had an anonymous telephone. sex with When she meets other strange characters, she reveals her quirks, and they - their own. It seems that this film implies a non-standard, disrespectful comedy, but it adds avant-garde sensation. I expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies, you would be very happy to know about the Phonebook. <br /> <br /> I have some problems: At the end of the film, one character tells an incoherent joke that lasts twelve minutes - itâ€™s brutal to sit until the end. In addition, there is a very clear animation sequence, which I found rude and underage, which serves as the climax of the film. I laughed out loud four or five times, and I liked the ending (except for the hideous animation). And when the film switched to color for the final phone boom sequence at night, I really liked how it looked even better. It became that experience when I felt that I would really like it if it were a bit different. But this is what the filmmakers gave us. It's unclear, pretentious and far to the left of the dial, but none of them is a reason to recommend it yourself. I do not find it unique or creative, but forced and pretentious.
