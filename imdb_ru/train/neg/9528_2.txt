Today they talk a lot about torture. That's the whole movie. This is about a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. Since then, it's just an attack on him. I do not know at what point you are doing something with it. Somewhere there is a wife and child; he has feelings of guilt and fear. But there had to be several times when he could act. The film seems like a joke. I believe that after the Manson murders, we are a little fixated on these two. However, why would anyone make such a film? What does he have besides sadism? The conclusion is completely unsatisfactory, but this could be corrected by an obvious plot twist. Well. Another hour and a half of my life.
