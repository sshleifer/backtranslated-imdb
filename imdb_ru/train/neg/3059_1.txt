Well, I recently got the chance to rent it and watch Santa Claus conquer the mountains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a Spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I will tell you, usually when we watch a movie, we all just talk and eat food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept their jaws open, wondering what the evil Mr. Peach would do next. Will Merlin help Santa Claus ?! or his robot deer will come and save the day? I would advise you to rent it, because it is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen, and I love it for it. : D
