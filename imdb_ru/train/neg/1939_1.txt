Come on! Do away with the Pakistani guys. Bollywood can not only make brilliant films, but also seriously influence the generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I'm a HUGE Bollywood fan, but anti-Pakistani films just make me wince to enjoy the script, the cinematography, the action of the sequence - that's all. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border reject propaganda, and there are films like Main Hoon Na that were brilliant not only because they deserved the quality of his Bollywood masala but also because he is trying to say: give the world a chance and shows that on both sides there are crazy people who do not represent the masses.
