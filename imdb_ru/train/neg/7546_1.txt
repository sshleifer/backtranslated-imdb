I am a big fan of Nicolas Cage and never thought that he would work on such a film. I could not believe other reviews, and I thought that it should not be bad to watch it at least once ... but believe me, this is so. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the old film. But why do they want to remake such a film? The most basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is either it must have an extremely clever script, or it must be extremely graphic. This film does not fall under one of them and just remains stupid. I just kept watching the film, hoping that at some point it would become interesting, but this does not happen. <br /> <br /> So this film is not a big one, both for fans of a horror movie and for fans of Cage. You could for this appear on television.
