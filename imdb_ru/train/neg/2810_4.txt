I am surprised by many women voters who even put this film better. I thought about this film that the target audience was adults and men. Whipped and tortured women, merciless revenge and a large number of bodies are typical ingredients in the history of the film with a subgenre of spaghetti. Opening and breaking hands is the plagiarism of DJANGO. However, the arrow lacks style, for example, DJANGO. Evaluation, acting and cinematography are mediocre at best, but if you are looking for the above ingredients, you have come to the right place. And the actors have no Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
