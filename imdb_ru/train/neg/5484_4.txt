This film is about a family that tries to come to terms with the death of a mother / wife by moving to Genoa, Italy. <br /> <br /> The plot of Genoa sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film consists only of a collection of scenes depicting the everyday life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are unnecessary and tedious, completely incapable of emotionally engaging the audience. The final is very disappointing, as it is not impressive, touching or emotional. I can say with confidence that I am disappointed and bored with "Jenova". The only thing that is good in the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Jenova. “Genova” can serve as an advertisement for a city, but not as a movie to watch.
