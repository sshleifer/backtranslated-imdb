What a waste! This film really could be something decent, but the script, in particular, is crappy, and the main characters are rather superficial and uninteresting. Mike Myers was good, and the historical re-creation of the decadence of the late 70s was well thought out, but overall this film was a big waste of time. Instead, a movie for viewing that has similar themes and the same basic time frame are excellent BOOGIE nights.
