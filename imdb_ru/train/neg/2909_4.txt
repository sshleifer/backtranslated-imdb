Looking at Tom Hanks as an assassin for the Irish Mafia is like seeing Jimmy Stewart in the role of a serial rapist, but that just doesn't work. It was very difficult for me to accept this. Not that I didn’t think that Tom couldn’t act, he might, I followed his career since the Labyrinths and Monsters, but for some reason I didn’t succeed. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and the risk of being like a fan (the only form of life below the fan is the cockroach). The film as a whole falls through for me. The additions to Jude Law, and the subtraction of everything else made me feel cold and more than disappointed. I was expecting a great crime film, more like Bonnie, and Clyde Mendez pulled the whole heart out of this story and left us nothing but bare bones. There is something in this movie that pleases, but the cinema is breathtaking, filling the screen with beautiful images. Paul Newman, as usual, is excellent, and I really enjoyed the score, but Tom, like the “angel of death” Sullivan, was completely flat.
