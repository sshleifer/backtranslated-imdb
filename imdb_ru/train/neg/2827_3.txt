The story is interesting from the very beginning: slavery in the (late) 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem with this is that he deliberately beats up two of Richard Fleischerâ€™s favorite enemies: Arabs and Germans. Making us believe that very Arab-looking men are free to roam and easily catch blacks in West Africa, just as believably as white slaves hunt in Roots. Obviously, both transactions are conducted by local residents and include (d) much more complex networks. While Arab countries are complicit in child trafficking and sex traffickers today, according to Amnesty International, Israel is one of the worst offenders. So why only point to the Arabs, and then choose a German as the only European buyer? This is an obvious prejudice and hatred for these people by the Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The game is above average, especially Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is as good as ever.
