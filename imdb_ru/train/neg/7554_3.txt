I have never seen 1973, an older version with a high rating. I support Nicolas Cage (by the way, well, as usual). This film probably took all five minutes to prepare the whole story (I see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party), if you cannot understand the end of this drool in the first thirty minutes, you will probably find this film interesting. . This, lately, is a terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror / mystery / thriller genre, unable to give viewers enough confidence and write a fresh, clever and tantalizing script, they compose a bit of creepy music and add a couple of things to make you jump a little, and then send the final version to your local theater. At least he didn't have a swaying camera syndrome.
