Don't get me wrong, I love action movies and revenge, I have seen them since childhood, including the last “Mechanic” by Dolph Lundgren, which is pretty good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use the camera, and can even be a genius when shooting and editing movies. <br /> <br /> But with “Man in Fire” (and even more than with “Domino”), Scott shows that instead of reasonably using his skills of “genius” in filmmaking, he uses this senselessly to brag about and compensate for the lack of a substance that his material does not offer him. The Fireman is close to two and a half hours, when he really should have been at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott filmed and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to watch his film, because his constant camera is moving and blinking really is torture for eye and makes you want to leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, when MPAA and studios are dubious about ratings, violence, and making PG-13 films, I also find it suspicious that a $ 70 million film is made from a B-movie script with a character that cuts fingers puts a bomb up a man's ass and blows a guy out of a gun, all of this to avenge the death of a little girl who is not even dead! Go figure out why the studio will broadcast the best script because of language or violence ... So it is said ...
