Before starting with this film, I thought that it could be good, but when I started with it, I found it really awful. They said that the film is being shot in Afghanistan, but I think that 95% of the film was shot in India. You can see cars made in India. You can see Larce, drinking bisclery (Indian water brand), Hindi, written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah *, this is really funny and there are many more things that prove that they were not shot in Afghanistan. I think you shouldn't spend your time watching this movie ... a waste of time .. I would recommend doing something else and not watching this movie, or maybe this is the best idea, but do not watch this waste of time
