I saw this film during an intermediate Tolkien lesson during my second year at college. Unfortunately, I sat close to the screen, and my professor chose me as a whipping boy - everyone laughed, but they didn’t have a constant view. <br /> <br /> Let's face it: Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films owe something to the film Bakshi. For example, in Jackson’s version of The Fellowship of the Ring, the scene in which the Black Riders attack empty inns is an almost complete copy of the scene in the Bakshi film, shot. You can call it plagiarism or deference, depending on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the similarity does not end there. I'm not going to do any research to find out what they are, because it would mean that I respect this film a little. I’m sure others have outlined the similarities - look around. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete train wreck in every sense of metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I decided to list what I can remember, more or less in chronological order. If I missed something else that offended me, it was because I was completely stunned, faced with a huge number of failures (and, most importantly, mediocrity). <br /> <br /> * Due to the intensive use of rotoscopy, Gandalf is no longer a soft, wise wizard, but a wildly beating prophet of doom (whose hat inexplicably changes color one or two during the film)). <br /> <br /> * In the film, Saruman Bely is sometimes called “Aruman” without explanation. He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> * Sam is just disgusting. The image of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childish and unsatisfactory. Yes, hobbits are small, like children, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin never introduce themselves - they just appear during a scene change with an explanation in one sentence. The film is filled with sloppy editing like this. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry sing merrily while walking along the road. One of the hobbits is producing a lute, at least twice as large as he is, behind his back — something that was not visible before — and begins to play in the typical style of a fantasy bard when they all break down in la la la. HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> * Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (without pants), complemented by a huge square buckle for a pilgrim belt. He is probably the worst swordsman in the whole film - often he gets one oscillatory blow before being hit on the ass. <br /> <br /> * Black riders look more like lepers than threatening tools of evil. They limp everywhere and walk painfully slowly. Of course, it is disturbing, but not frightening. <br /> <br /> * The scene before the Black Riders try to cross the Ford Bruinen (in which they look at Frodo, who is on the other side on horseback) goes on forever, at this time the Riders dimly threaten their horses and. .. do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline when he gives in to the wound. It turns out this is more tiring than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli Dwarf is as tall as Legolas Elf. He is a dvorf. This is simply no excuse. He also looks like the murdered David Dwarf. This is a rough but accurate description. <br /> <br /> * It seems that Boromir stole the gold armor of the Vikings Elmer Fadd from the opera episode "Bugs Banny". He looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarities with Tolkien’s illustration, Balrog howls and is the least threatening villain in the entire film. It looks like someone in pink slippers, and he's just above Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I will accept the Jackson version any day. <br /> <br /> * The battle scenes are awkward and awkward. Almost none of the characters show any level of competence with their weapons. I'm not asking for action scenes like the ones in the Jackson movie, but they MUST fight. <br /> <br /> * The tree appears very short, and I was sorry that he bothered to appear in everything. Watch the movie, you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> Ok, now for the good parts of the film. <br /> <br /> * Some voices are pretty good. It's not that Aragorn sounds bad, he looks like a Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this image; like Tom Bombadil, she seems immune to the forces of the Ring's temptation, and her voice actress is not terrible either. <br /> <br /> * Boromir’s death is not as heartbreaking as in Jackson’s image of the same scene, but it’s still quite dramatic (and more true about his death in the book, although I don’t believe that Jackson made a mistake shooting like he). <br /> <br /> * As my professor noted (between whisper threats), the orcs (mostly from the Helm Depths, if I'm right) resemble war-ravaged corpses of soldiers, a political statement that works very well if you understand that tried. <br /> <br /> * Although this is not a positive point in the film, Bakshi cannot be blamed for most of the failures in this film, or, as I was told, the project had a limited budget, and he was late in production, he lost his creative control over some of the senior executives (who, I am sure, have not read the book). <br /> <br /> Let me make it clear: I respect Bakshi even for trying something Hing of this magnitude. I just find it hard to believe that he is satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> In general, I can in no way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of the classic Tolkien trilogy even for laughter, unless you have read the book and do not have your own visualizations of the characters, places and events. I'm sure that somebody somewhere will pick up a copy of it in confusion; if you do, keep an open mind and choose what good you can get from it
