This film was shot in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks, and again brought back to the world’s vision what was left of Wild Canada West. When Archie started writing his stories for newspapers; The idea of ​​the day was to tame the desert and convert / absorb the nations of the first nations. <br /> <br /> The film puts forward and asks a question; why is a well-educated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, when an English boy dreams of becoming something, but to understand the whole meaning of this dream is unique and priceless - it doesn’t matter what it is. It seems that the famous puppet story is not so. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Archie became my lively image of the Indian Cigar Store, a very wooden character and not at all real - very well done by Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed a wild Indian on the dance scene for the tourist. The completeness and / or reality of this was not realized until he met and married his wife, Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the Englishman’s world scene, not as himself, but Gray Owl is a Canadian wilderness native. <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie to being the prototype of the noble savage. <br /> <br /> Interpretation of Mr. Brosnan, and the Directors are both great. I watched the documentaries about The Gray Owl and I think that this is a good movie on the big screen that you can add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I thought that the last scenes in which Archie would meet with the Great Council of Chiefs were a great, great moment in the film. <br /> <br /> A very beautiful Canadian landscape of the lake and the real places of the "Gray Owl". <br /> <br />
