This is a very stupid and obscure slavery film in the West Indies, and Paddy from the Seinfeld Show was filmed! Patrick Warburton made his debut in this artificial film, and he is noticeably slimmer here. Oliver Reed received the highest rating, but he is unlikely in the film at all. Warburton plays a snow-white slave, and itâ€™s ridiculous to see all the young and lustful wives of rich old people bet on him, because they all want to have sex with him. If this is not a drunken orgy in a bordello, then these are young wives who have a queue with him. Then, of course, by the end of the uprising of the slaves and the bloody confrontation. There is no real political message like the movie "Burn", but just another invented device for the development of the plot. Incredibly, they made a sequel, and Warburton returned to all the other actors! I hope they get paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad. Nudity makes it watchable, and Warburton's lack of any accent makes him at times ridiculous. Very bad movie, but I have to admit that I want to see the sequel.
