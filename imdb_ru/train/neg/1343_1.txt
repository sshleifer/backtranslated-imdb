We bought this movie at a store called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration, since earlier we bought the film No Big Deal and remade it. <br /> <br /> We expected this film to be very inspiring so that we could remake it and put it on the phone. HOWEVER, it was shocking. BORING - the main word that comes to mind. Bad effects and the script is not enough to make you watch it. The main female body seems to be knocked out at the right moments in a pathetic attempt to interest the viewer. However, it just makes you wonder: did they blow up the budget, forcing her to take off her clothes? If so, I would ask for a refund! It looks like a self-made film, the frames do not even match each other, and the camera work is so amateur that our remakes of bad films look professional. I CAN'T believe that it is sold as a commodity product. <br /> <br /> It's just boring and ugly to watch. The actors are bad and there is no professionalism in it. No words to describe how awful it is.
