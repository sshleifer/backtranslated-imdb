You can consider several facts in the discussion of spoilers. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but Spielberg didn’t deserve to win an Oscar for this job, and I think the Academy was right about that. vote. (Other Oscars for nominating the best actors and the like ... which I don’t know. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) intrusive. While watching this film, the difference that I made during the course “Film as art” shouted at me: “Feeling is honest emotions, honestly rendered. This is excessive sentimentality. When in real life, two people ever start to read aloud synchronously, as Seli and Shug Avery do, sitting on the bed and looking at the letters Nettie found them? There are examples of this type of artificial behavior in the film: all men crowd around Miss Millie's car, and then jump in unison, like a flock of birds taking off as she leaves; Harpo falls through the roofs of various buildings on which he works (cheap gag for farce); the whole detachment of revelers is sent from Joke JDC en masse to the chapel, as if magically fascinated by the singing of the choir ... and so on. Nothing rings true. I even wondered if the name Harpo was chosen purposefully, because this is the real name of his wife Sofia, “Oprah”, backwards. Spielberg is not above such "attractiveness". <br /> <br /> One cannot say that Spielberg is not capable of honestly rendered actions and emotions. Schindler’s list was terrific, deeply touching for me, and I greatly admire the “Salvation of Private Ryan” for his realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.
