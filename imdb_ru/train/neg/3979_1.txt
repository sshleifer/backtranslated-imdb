Well, this 2 is one of the worst excuses for 4 films that I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Like all the other Olsen twin films, except perhaps for the New York minute, there was no history in this film, gaping holes in the plot, disgustingly rotten actions and even bad filming !!!!!!!!! in case you haven't guessed yet, I hate Mary Kate and Ashley !!!!!! The only reason I looked at this was because I was very bored and there was nothing else. Interestingly, someday the twins will someday stop making the same stereotypical films in which they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic place, and save the day, at the same time getting help from two nice guys who immediately drool at them. The smallest thing they could do is have a boyfriend of 4 of them or make them both fall on the same guy. The plot in this story was so stupid and just stupid. even the kid could see the flaws in this. Perhaps they should break up and start making films individually, or perhaps films with a different story. Anyone who liked this film was not offended â€” really stupid, really artificial, or had not seen a single good film. or maybe they are really smart and just have a bad cinematic choice. In any case, I would not recommend this movie to my worst sworn enemy for a good movie impression. The only thing that is good, 4 - some kind of laughter, tearing ribs, with miserable attempts to be cool. if you look at laughter, it is fun. basically I give 0 or less.
