this film, I will not call it a “film,” was basically about nothing and functioned mainly for the popular acts of the time. Yes, the war was in full swing (pun), and this film gave the troops and our audience. <br /> <br /> but let's do something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> I liked to see young Buddy Rich on drums. the music was good in everything. <br /> <br /> but one cameo after another quickly grows old. <br /> <br /> I didn't even recognize the Zero Mostel! so if you're one of the "greatest generation," as they say, you will definitely like this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
