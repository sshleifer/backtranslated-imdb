The 80s were not very kind to the former main star Charles Bronson. Starting in 1982, Death Wish II and ending with this truly horrible 89th-year film, Bronson’s writers seemed to be trying to outdo each other in progressive rudeness. "D.W. II ”left little to the imagination in the description of the rape and suicide of the character Bronson’s daughter (the rape and murder of his housekeeper were also shown in hideous details). “10 to midnight” was a kind of disgusting film that made you want to take a bath afterwards. There is nothing atoning about it. Other films, such as “The Evil that People Do”, and the remaining films of this period, Death Death, cross the line between the high camp and the high barf with their serious images of cruelty and revenge. I'm not sure that the producers (usually Pancho Koner) enjoyed showing the weary look of a senior citizen of Bronson killing punks young enough to become his grandchildren, or something else, but the poor quality of the films and horrible scripts of these films they usually destroyed the small energy they could generate. <br /> <br /> “Kinjite” - the last of these films - is pretty well made, but it really turns the cake into cinematic wretchedness. In this film, Bronson: sodomizes perverted John; makes a pimp eat his Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; makes incredibly xenophobic comments, among other things, that I happily forgot. Also depicted is the gang rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off-screen, albeit implied). <br /> <br /> What did people think when they made this film? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films? For anyone interested in his best films, check out most of the movies he shot in the 60s and 70s, such as The Mechanic, Death Wish, From Noon to 3, Once Upon a Time in the West, "Red Sun", "Great Escape", "The Magnificent Seven", "Horseman in the Rain", etc., etc., etc.
