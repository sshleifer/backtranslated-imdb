... am I missing something here ??? "unexpected plot development"? "the plot is spinning with disruptive glee"? Do these viewers look at the same Arkett machine that I just underwent (in the already obvious subconscious (un) conscious fit of sadomasochism) ... I just joined this site just to make sure that no one else ever rents this bitchiness ... this film was embarrassing for every person involved ... quick question: did sir Stevie read the script before he gave Kate S. thumbs up? if so, it must be the same Spielberg who highlighted Howard Duck ... don't give me that, “it was a hit play,” I suppose Mssr. Reddin is not too happy ... The DVD cover promised "amazing corners" and "distorted history ..." Story !! Story ?? That shit that makes old Bobby McKee and his wandering Structurist group sound like geniuses ... Sundance ?? Berlin ?? Toronto ?? I have a home video of how my cat farts, and which causes more interest than Arquette’s negative dimension of painful loss ... and talks about deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T .; Thank God, just at the time when he thought that Dave would call the cops! and thank Shiva that the police just caught the real killer ... what !!! down to the credits that I was still waiting for, to become a kind of deception against Arquette and his “hidden millions” ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, you cannot remain unscathed: what the hell was this kitchen scene with “leg athlete in my crotch "gag ??? Are you worse in this or "just cause" ?? I don't know ... hey, movie lovers: why don't you have a party with a blockbuster, rent it with a "jersey girl" and "white tiptoe", and then make a sepukku (or it's seppuka) ... and take an E Dunsky with you ....
