I couldn't help but think about the mask: Leslie Vernon's takeoff (a much more amazing movie) while watching this movie because of the realism and the great innovative idea. it could be a BIG movie. action ... from some actors in order. from others ... it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> that aside the idea is excellent and the format is excellent. The story is also pretty good, although it often suffers from hard blows to the logical mind. <br /> <br /> never mind this, although right? In the end, it's a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this converted movie ... I really want it to be a fantastic movie, what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> However (and you can't blame the minds for the film for it), this is obviously based on the shoelace budget. and the film really hurt the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> great movie. ... if you want to swap for a better game and a little better. <br /> <br /> Whoever writes this, he has to continue, a great idea.
