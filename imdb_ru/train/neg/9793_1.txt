The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is the worst TV show ever made. There is no story, just a bunch of silly costumed children using martial arts, dressed in second-grade spandex suits. <br /> <br /> The special effects look like they are from the 70s, the costumes look like something from a bad comedy, and the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is worse than a television show is toys, just second-rate plastic trash that feeds our children. <br /> <br /> Your kids have much better shows to watch! <br /> <br /> Try giving your kids something like Nickelodean, these shows actually have some intelligence, unlike the siloviki.
