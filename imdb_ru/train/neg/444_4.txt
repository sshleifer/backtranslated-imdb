(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> Rosenstrasse is a film about heroic women of the Nazi time. But it is too long, it is not touching, and sometimes even boring! Too many cliches and not enough good play. <br /> <br /> Fairy tale (storyline) is bad. As in the "Titanic" of James Cameron, the old woman remembers the events of her life. Well, now we have a point. Then came another woman who does the same. It is embarrassing that they both remember the events of the lives of other people! Come on! This lack of knowledge on how to tell basic stories ... How can Riemann learn about the fate of a little girl's mother and her interrogation, for example? <br /> <br /> Scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when this happened. For example, the scene when Riemann makes an offer to Fabian. When did it happen? The scene looks like it happens in the twenties ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is, of course, a talented pianist, well, she is even a baroness! Wow. Her brother returns from the Eastern Front, he received the "Ritterkreuz", which he shows in some scenes. So he is a war hero and yet a good man who has kept his conscience. And he gained knowledge about the massacres committed by the Germans. He even took some photos! And so on, the cliché for cliché accumulates, and that is why the film does not work. <br /> <br /> In essence, von Trotta did something like a decent movie. And in the end, everything is very simple. Riemann finds a way to put Goebbels in bed and - yes, yes! - everybody's Free. This is not a historical fact, but pure imagination, despite the claim of “true story” at the beginning. Like Sass, it is vaguely based on a real event. <br /> <br /> This is sad, but true, this is a typical German film these days. This is bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
