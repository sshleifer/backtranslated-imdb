The spirit of the killed high school student revives the scarecrow, which then takes revenge on all. <br /> <br /> This movie really annoyed me. He has a great looking monster, has some good effects with a low budget, a bit of atmosphere, but he manages to lock in good things for bad ones. Halfway through, I began fast-forwarding, and then went through the chapters on a DVD. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems with this film. First, the cast is about thirty, and yet they must be in high school. You do not believe anything from the very beginning. The scarecrow, although it looks great, is not much higher than that. He says that he is a stupid liner, and moves more funny than scary. Is it a comedy or a horror movie? This is a problem that goes beyond one line for most of the dialog and settings. It seems more like a clich√© than a soulful horror movie. I expect the film was created for a very narrow audience of horror fans who want to make fun of the genre, not take it. <br /> <br /> Despite the beautiful monster, this film should be avoided. Even if you take it to the shopping basket for less than five dollars, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
