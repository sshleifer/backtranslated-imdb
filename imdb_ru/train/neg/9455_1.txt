Well, I think I know the answer to this question. For money! We were so filled up with commercials and Cat In The Hat merchandise that we almost believed that there must be something good in this movie. I admit, I thought trailers look bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well, I had to go with my instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood junk. Once again, the proof that an ordinary person can learn to believe in what he says well should be good. In addition to the offensive fact that the film lasts only about 80 minutes, it obviously began with a script eaten by a moth. He is full of unsuccessful attempts at senseless humor and terrible pastel landscapes. He jumps all over the universe without purpose or direction. This is then aggravated ............................ yes, I will say it, Bad action! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching “Coffee Talk” on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the Cat intended for middle-aged Jews? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not prize winners either, but Mr. Myers must disappear somewhere until he is ready to make another Austin Powers film. F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1 to 10. Save your money!
