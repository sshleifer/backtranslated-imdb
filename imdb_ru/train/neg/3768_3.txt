Like this. The film is written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred should have known better by working on the Titanic and Dogma sets.) <br /> <br /> So the plot. There are some scientists, and some foresters, and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. They all do very poorly with their work, including a hot chick (I think she should be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). One of the foresters says that scientists are “professional people”, and this is good, because it would be terrible if they were professional larvae, jellyfish or evki. <br /> <br /> They wander through the forest in search of some strange monkey-like bones, and no one even mentions that the bones could be the same as that of the shameful snowman They just wander around, and one of the rangers is shamelessly hits beauty We all hope that he will die very soon (along with his sister, who must be cute naive, but really just annoying). Then they * choke *, find Sasuke ... I mean the ape-like burial of animals. Of course, no one mentions that these may just be bigfoot bones with which they are connected ... I think scientists and foresters simply do not think about such things. <br /> <br /> Then Sasquatch and his tribe get angry and kill all the people we don’t like, chase away the other losers and bury his cousin Muriel and cousin Josh again (who died in a trout accident). <br /> <br /> A tasteless, boring dialogue (I switched off several times), a meaningless plot, unattractive characters, a bad CGI (a man in a monkey costume would have looked better) and an acting game that was simply not very good - all of it going into making a movie that I won't watch again. <br /> <br /> You check it yet; it's good for unintentional laughter.
