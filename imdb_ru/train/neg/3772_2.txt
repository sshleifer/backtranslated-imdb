I just saw Dick Tracy and thought it was terrible. Pictures on the background of cities looked terrible. Also, the mob characters looked too weird. Warren Beatty didnâ€™t do a terrible job as Dick Tracy, but this was definitely not his best performance. Madonna should just sing. Glen Headley did a good job with this movie. I gave this movie 2/10 just because of the amazing Al Pacino game. In his career this was not a high achievement, but he still did a good job.
