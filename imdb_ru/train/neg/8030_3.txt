Not really interested in this. The story is pretty awful and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, Bill Nunns is good. After that, it was pretty awful. Tim is not suitable for this role, he looks like a smug, swollen ass, and Pruitt Taylor Vince is completely unconvincing like a trumpet player. This is an idealistic film, and, as a musician, feel a little offended after watching. There are no 1900 scenes practicing or playing with their band mates; he pampers himself completely. It's hard for me to build any relationship with such a character, maybe I am watching the wrong movie. If you do not have a real passion for life or a sense of what music is, then gladly dive into the suspension of unbelief and watch this waffle.
