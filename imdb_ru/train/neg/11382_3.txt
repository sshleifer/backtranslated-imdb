Someone will notice that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes look at every enemy. 2. Holding hands face to face, mouth agape and frightened eyes. 3. Smiling Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I really hate this show, I don’t watch it, but it's like Code Lyoko, we all watched at least one, I have to say that this show borders on racism, it's not interesting and pointless. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends with a robot victory, with the exception of one exception, when the robot basically allows this overly disgusting addict to fly away on a jetpack. <br /> The jokes are also quite rude, I think that mostly people say the word “suck” or fart, I think that the hooligans in the show are also shocking. <br /> <br /> Is there really no one who hides a bowling ball under his hatred, while the other uses a chain, for God's sake, which school he will go to. Not to mention his older brother, who is a border-level psychopath and does not have other qualities of a character. <br /> <br /> All the shows that I feel are ripped off by the megas XLR and Fosters. As you might say, the coop trio, Jamie and Kiva, as well as Robotboy, similar to Megas, where he defeats everyone, regardless of chance, and he is free in spirit, despite the fact that he is a robot. <br /> <br /> It's just that I'm not surprised that it still works.
