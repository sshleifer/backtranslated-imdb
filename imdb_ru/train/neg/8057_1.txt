What is wrong with this movie? Lots and lots of things. Editing tries too hard to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer, while at the same time giving him / her a severe headache. The plot is confused and clearly continued from what began as a short one (story or movie). The plot gives less than ten minutes of a good story, and it just stretches out until it reaches the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They lose weight. In the end, the plot is so thin that you can even skip it if you don’t pay attention, which is difficult to do when watching this movie. The game is not even impressive. Characters are poorly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things that are wrong in this film is that, obviously, no matter who was responsible for the score / soundtrack, he had no idea what the movie was or what it should have been about (not that I I blamed him, I could not understand it too). As a result, half of the music in the film does not fit into the scene at all. In addition, what happened to all the sexual implications between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Naturally, this was to attract young men, but it was made so cheap. And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the movie? At any conceivable level? Completely? The two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the film, they were just there to have a few chase scenes. I doubt that anyone will really like the film, which is so badly complex, and such a shameless and terrible Hollywood attempt to create a somewhat interesting idea. But I digress. I recommend this to teenagers with low levels of attention who don’t mind a really awful horror thriller, as long as there is some sex and blood (although this can only be true for Killer Cut, which I saw). 1/10
