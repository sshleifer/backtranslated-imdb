Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the box did not bother to see this so-called “film”. They described "blindingly choreographic intrigue and violence." I did not see any "intrigue". Instead, I saw a pitiful attempt at dialogue in a supposed Kung Fu movie. I did not see "violence". At least, I did not see anything that could make me stop my disbelief in what could harm a person with “impenetrable” skin - but here I, perhaps, reveal too much “conspiracy”. In addition, as a viewer of many and different films (some of which include an episodic film about kung fu), I can say with confidence that this fragment of celluloid is not observable. Whatever you choose, I will always remain <br /> <br /> correct, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. I was not blinded by choreography.
