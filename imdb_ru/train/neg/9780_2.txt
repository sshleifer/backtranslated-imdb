Lord, whoever made this turkey, you need to bury it alive. Sorry, but another reviewer must have not seen this movie, he must have watched something else, or never saw the movie before ... 9 out of ten stars? He says that, is it as good as Ben Hur or Gone with the Wind? Unintentionally funny, incredibly incredible characters, absurd situations, it seems that they were filmed in Griffith Park (which is pretty good - MASH was filmed in Griffith Park), a shitty script, almost everything that could be wrong in the film that was filmed in one pack. You should need to watch for all potential filmmakers as an example of how a movie can be terribly wrong. It reminds me of something a USC student can do for a film class. <br /> <br /> Give it a pass if you don’t take drugs and don’t go to camp.
