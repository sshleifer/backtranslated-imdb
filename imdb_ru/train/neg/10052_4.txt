Warner Bros. made a lot of boilers in the 1930s, and most of them are booming, economical and very interesting. I really like how the studio used less glamorous elements of our daily life. This is one of the few tough Warner melodramas that just doesn't work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless newspaper editor who resurrects the killerâ€™s 20-year history with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance, but he is surrounded by actors who do not cut mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline McMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad play of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second role really hurts the film. Starr is especially bad during her big dramatic scene at the end of the film. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of the Hollywood pre-code. Leroy's direction is full of innovative visual touches, but he cannot overcome bad play and unintentionally funny situations. Camera work Sol Solito is strong. Somehow, this piece of wood has received an Oscar nomination for the best picture (in a year that M, Dracula and Frankenstein gave us).
