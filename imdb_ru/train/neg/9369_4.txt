Although I heard that this film was a bit dry, I look wherever Scott Bakula is. At the beginning of this film, I had high hopes for the classic stupid, but pleasant ending “Scott gets a girl” and up to 20 minutes before it ends. going great The plot twist was crazy, unexpected, and very clever. I kept my fingers crossed that it would work, and it would all be some terrible misunderstanding, until the moment when the captions ended, and I realized that there would be no happy and contented end. Unfortunately, I was left to regret having looked at it, and hastily made some kind of quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott!
