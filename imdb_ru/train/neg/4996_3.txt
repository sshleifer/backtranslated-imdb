I really liked the first half hour of this movie, but, wow, it became commonplace, or I should say, “just silly.” This is just another example of outdated humor. Perhaps it was funny in 1940, but not now ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always fun to watch. I especially liked him as soon as he began to switch from his boyish appearance and high voice to Busby Berkeley musicals to the place where he grew up, and he voiced him too. <br /> <br /> He was fine like Jimmy MacDonald, but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters, the worst of which was the boss (Raymond Walburn) of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who only screamed all the time. He was cruel to hear and was of great harm to the film.
