Well, I just paid a dollar for the DVD of this movie, and it wasn't even worth it. It seems that it is written poorly and is in the public domain. <br /> <br /> Negle, despite her fame, rewards and reputation, is a British home woman who cannot sing or dance. or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the great old Hollywood actors who are exhibited here must have thought they were doing the classics. Directed by Herbert Wilcox (husband Nigla) has always believed that Anna - the most exciting and talented woman on screen. He was wrong. She was incredibly popular in Britain before and after World War II. Her "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than her musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a couple of famous songs are included, and none of them are in high quality. Skip this one and find the one that plays Doris Day. At the very least, you will get a real comedy and professional dance style!
