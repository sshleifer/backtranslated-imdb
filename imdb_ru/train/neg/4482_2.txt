A perfect little atrocity ... I doubt that one shot lasted longer than the regular MTV 4.4 seconds. The sad cast is even worse than the Kusminsky version (a reminder: he managed to make a mistake with Juliette Binoche and Ralph FÃ©inne). But hey, the rich got what they deserved. Dark and brooding Heathcliff, brought to the status of an angel with golden castles, fragile and angelic Catherine, presented in the form of a plump, melon breast, meek and weak Linton - peeping tom, and the innocent Isabel becomes the hero of Sarah Michel-Gellar from "Cruel Intentions" 15 -year-old Eddie Bower and Abercrombie and Fitch Donners - pay attention. This thing was created for you. This is an hour and a half music video, where everything is given to you; You are spared from the uncomfortable need not even try to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from the initial shock of their actions. The actors tried, but, as I said, they were mistaken. Decent picture, but montage on the level of television production in high school. I beg you all: read a book or even comments; view previous versions of this, even Kusminsky; but stay away from numerous future replays, during which you will not benefit from the free premiere.
