It’s as if you took the common themes of “The usual suspects” and “Fight Club”, took all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave “I am an intellectual, therefore my film must be difficult to understand the meaning of the film” Garbage maker, mixed with a few extra styles for good measure, a severed end, there you have a Revolver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I thought about it a little after watching, and yes, he made an appearance that makes sense, but that doesn’t stop you from being rubbish. <br /> <br /> Wasting money. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> It’s like the worst movie I've ever seen, even with a bad newness of a movie, to pay off a little.
