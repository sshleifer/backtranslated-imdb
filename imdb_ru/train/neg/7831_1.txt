With the accompanying work MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES and DREAMSCAPES can only be considered as the absolute nadir of the genre, which began so favorably with TWILIGHT ZONE and OUTER LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem lies in the fact that it is of no interest to a relatively adult audience, instead it is aimed at TEN-YEARS OLD, who can only count bags for the body, and hardly it. And therefore, rudeness is the king, and the king is rudeness. <br /> <br /> Is Stephen King simply illiterate ?? in general, he has the ability to tell stories of Bart Simpson. Since he cannot read, his only inspiration is films. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinema is not a bad place to start, as it, as a rule, avoided the onslaught of “realism”. But these films are just a rumor, not a thing, and if you want to WRITE, you need to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PIKMAN had monsters as close friends. But even in this case, it should be clear to any student that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least the fourth AUTOPSY number is a clear indication of what is wrong. One can almost imagine this pathetic fool sitting at his desk, trying to think of something TERRIBLE. <br /> <br /> No, notice, trying to accurately describe the horror of the system, of which it is an integral part, making a foolish fool, but trying to invent a horrible story for his little nephew. Suppose you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead, and began to cut you, as they do on those autopsies! Will it not be gross? And that, boys and girls, is a story. <br /> <br /> What about the specifications? Oh yes, he's one of those stripes that never appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he screams ?? well, in fact they do not hear it, you understand ?? he says he is going to sue the hospital, but he is no longer such a big shot, you know, he lies there (or he lies, I can never remember) and all that. And he thinks: “Oh, no, please, please, don't cut me, and it's terrible, to lie (or lie) so?” Wouldn't it be a great story? You know, I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was the great medical authority of Agatha Christie. What's the name of this snake again, oh yes, BOOMSLANG? is not it? <br /> <br /> Let's do it with Peruvian BOOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, is it great ?? except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you moron! But how can you say that the target audience is children, and not just mental defects? It's simple: no sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is, but this is the kind that leaked through the gap in the door to the bedroom of our parents. Modern filmmakers really understand the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the woman victim, the chase. <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LUTON, they have no idea what is going on. All that is actually left is the giggling outside the SM club and the fascists' credo that people with sexual preferences are initially evil. <br /> <br /> Despite a certain discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay. Vray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there is nothing wrong with that, he must first torment her ?? you see, it could not have disturbed her in any way, because it would upset our Puritan sentiments. So, horror and romance become just a nuisance and care for psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Our hero, as you can see, is a rubber fetishist, and can get a slip only if someone touches him, who do you know with you know ?? rubber gloves (giggle). And this is what they use during the autopsy, and this is how they discover that he, in fact, you know. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is the author at the peak of his inspirational abilities. Too bad they cut him off because it could upset FIVE YEARS watching the show!
