Oh my God. I bought this movie and ... I ... watched ... the whole ... thing. Okay, everything will be fine ... I know, everything will be fine with me in a month or two. I hope to get rid of flashbacks soon. I was going to eat something after the movie, but I just can't muster the courage to try to put down any food at the moment. Bad? Yes, bad. Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, bad, it seems, is not correctly conveys the message. Hmm ... There are no words to describe how awful ... not awful ... Hmm disgustingly awful abandoned / acted / withdrawn / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do, but throw it away. Perhaps to burn it, I would not want it to be at the bottom of an architectural excavation in a thousand years. Worst movie since "Hey, Happy"
