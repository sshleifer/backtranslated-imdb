She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she is also a constant nominee for Razzi. Making a movie that is so bad should be a sign that it needs money. She could make an announcement about why you shouldnâ€™t talk on a cell phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a busy shopping center. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should be producing (Shoot 'Em Up) as she is not very good as a writer / director. <br /> <br /> Four thugs approach her in the parking lot of the shopping center, and the first thing they do is tell her that they have a gun. What does she do? She begins to push and curse them, as if she knows martial arts or something like that. She manages to escape, but after falling she is lost in the forest. Why didn't she run away to someone's house? We get four thugs with guns chasing a woman with a tool box. Of course, their weapons are not suitable for her wrench. Ha! Of course, she also has a iron and a screwdriver. These poor things. <br /> <br /> Now she is home for Christmas - and she brought a gun!
