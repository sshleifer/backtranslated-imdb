I had a video of this stuff. And I think that this was my fourth attempt, that I managed to watch the whole movie without falling asleep. This is a slow movement, and the idea of ​​a mid-Atlantic platform, which may have been revolutionary at the time, is now just a huge onlooker. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is quite easily forgotten, and only at the end of the game, everything becomes really interesting. When the water began to spill heavily, she even woke me once. <br /> <br /> But give the man his due. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Wade. He does not squeeze him between the index and middle fingers like mere mortals. He holds it in his fingers, showing us the old pearl brown. In this film, there are several scenes where smoke rises to heaven against a dark background and looks very artistic. But it says little about this film, if all that impresses you is tobacco smoke.
