This film mainly talks about some girls in a Catholic school who get into trouble because they put red paint on one of the shampoos of one of their schoolmates, and after reprimand for this action they decide to go to Florida for a vacation . On the way, they meet up with the guys at the local diner and decide that they will later meet each other elsewhere. The girls find themselves on the side of the road near the forest and stop for a while, and while one of the girls decides to take a walk, she sees a murder involving the local sheriff himself. She is scared and runs to tell others what happened. The other girls decided to go see her, and two of them were killed by the killer. Then the two remaining girls were caught by the killer and placed in a local prison cell. Meanwhile, the deputy sheriff watches the girls and, despite their persistent belief that the sheriff is a murderer, he ignores both of them and acts as an uninformed and everyone else in this film who simply cannot put two and two together, much less than some lousy detective work on this. The best part was the scene of rape between the killer and one of the girls, where he decides to rape her in his prison cell, and it seems that the girl really WANTS to be raped by this man, and I admit that the scene with naked breasts was good, but earlier their lips meet, he means other things. This film reminds me of the low-budget thriller “Bloody Song” featuring Frankie Avalon, with the same motive, only with a different part of the character. This film is not worth renting even for a low-budget film of the 80s, and the final was the worst I've ever seen in a film, and that made me get my money back!
