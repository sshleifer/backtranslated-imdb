In another good review, loleralacartelort7890 says: “The truth is that Americans use a secret aluminum anti-radiation alloy. This is not so well known. And exact specifications are secret. And why is it a secret: well. Why should they open it then? If they were in the space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY silly to show that they have a new technology that can protect the crew from radiation. ” This is completely wrong. In Apollo, there is (and was not) any "secret" of radiation protection. The design and construction of the Apollo command module has long been available to the public. It uses lightweight honeycombs made from aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except for windows), of course, is covered with a heat shield of phenolic resin, thicker at the bottom, which is facing forward during re-entry. These materials actually * better * stop the radiation that we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons, such as x-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Cosmic radiation is a specific problem for * long-term * space flight due to the risk of large solar flares. But it simply was not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The command module gave them fairly good protection during their short (1/2 hour or so) passage through the Van Allen belts. All of them had dosimeters, so we know exactly how much radiation they received: not more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. Of the 24 people who flew to the moon (12 of whom landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Svigert (bone cancer). The rest died of heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). In fact, this is pretty good statistics for a group of men who are already over seventy (Shepard would be 86).
