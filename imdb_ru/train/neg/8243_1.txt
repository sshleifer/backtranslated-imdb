The word in the summary sums it up, oh;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home, when they stop at the store, to find the way, they crash into a parked car breaking one spotlight, they leave the stage at the fair. getting into trouble, but suddenly they see a single headlight behind them (oooh). <br /> <br /> From there everything screams, cries and violence when they try to run away from this madman who lost him because the lights;), well, cries and crying largely remain throughout the film (very annoying ) The film is shot, with a cheap camera trying to make it seem “real” or “shocking,” I think it’s just confusing and useless, though. In the absence of something better, to compare it with the Blair Witch style. <br /> <br /> Screaming and crying almost the whole movie with a shitty sound was terribly annoying, you literally get a headache :) <br /> <br /> Sorry, but it wasn't scary, only an annoying painful piece of shit movie .
