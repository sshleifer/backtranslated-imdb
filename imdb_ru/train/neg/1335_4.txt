This movie was awesome !! (Not as good as Leif Garrett Longshot's masterpiece), but still awesome !! I thought Ashley looked so damn huge compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought that they could with such places and almost get away with it. Although dad was a jerk, and mom was too friendly with Helmit Head. I give it 4. Anyone who likes this movie should check out Longshot.
