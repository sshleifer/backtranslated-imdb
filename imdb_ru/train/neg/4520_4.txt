Irwin Allen was great. All of his television shows had a great pilot or first episode. the rest were mostly frustrating his other shows. Several episodes of the Swiss Robinson family were ripping off his old TV shows. One Swiss Family episode is identical to the Land Of The Giants episode, when a party member needs an operation on an application. The show was big and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost touch with the TV show after the 60s. The game is strong with Martin Milner. Stars for kids start with this show, like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. One bright spot is when Irwin Allen includes his own disaster scenes, such as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption, calling him the "Master of Disaster"
