It really impresses me that it was done. The director / screenwriter / actor must be truly charismatic in reality. I can't think of another way to go through the script stage. I want you to think about it ... while watching movies, I felt sorry for the actors. I felt in the comedy club, where the guy dies on his feet, and you sit there, do not get pleasure, just feel very bad because of his attempts. I would really like to know what the budget is, probably, it was low, because the quality of the film is really bad. I want to write "I didnâ€™t like the jokes." but the reality is that they can appeal to you, you have to be the person who wrote them. or retard. So imagine in the form of a script ... and this guy got this green light. This is impressive, isn't it?
