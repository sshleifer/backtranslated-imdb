Well, first of all, if you view Zombie Rising as some very early film like The Night of the Living Dead (1968), forget about it. It is about “zombies” in a more psychological sense, where this term simply means someone who does not control their will, but must follow the will of another instead. “Zombies” here, just as little as in the film, are largely metaphors of subordination to the state or government in general, as in wartime. It's hard to call this movie a horror. <br /> <br /> The film was shot during the First World War. The “French Cambodian” contingent heard strange stories about zombies - supposedly, Angkor Wat was built using zombies - and there are stories about armies of zombies easily overcoming opponents. Armand Luka (Dean Jagger) returns the priest, who allegedly knows the secret of zombies, but will not speak. So, Luka and the international military contingent go to Angkor Wat on an archaeological expedition designed to uncover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before the zombies get a chance to "destroy the white race." <br /> <br /> One of the strange things about Revolt of the Zombies is that the script writer / director Victor Halperin may have decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. The film begins as if it explores the zombie / military metaphor, and may even contain elements of adventure, but after about 15 minutes it changes the mechanism and becomes more like a love triangle story. <br /> <br /> Halperin really adheres with an implication of will and strength (and the Nietzschean “will to power”). The film is interesting at this level, but the script and installation are very unstable. This is another older film for which I would not be surprised if there is no footage, especially since some scenes even disappear or are cut when the character speaks a dialogue. <br /> <br /> Among the far-fetched romantic story, Halperin tries to continue to refer to the zombie thread, but little material about zombies makes much sense. Luka reveals the secret of zombies, but he does not mean that much to the viewer. Is the mechanics of zombie material unclear and confusing? Halperin even resorts to using superimposed video clips with the eyes of Bella Lugosi from his 1932 film “White Zombie”, but never explains that this is related to anything. There are big gaps in the plot, including a love story. Promising, interesting characters early drums disappear for a long time. One potential villain unceremoniously gets rid before he does a lot. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of old, raspy films “B”, “Zombie Rising”, you may need to watch it at least once - acting skills are not so bad, and if you have a good imagination, you You can collect an interesting story in your mind to fill in all the gaps. But this is the second time I watched the film, the first film was only five years ago, and I could hardly remember anything about it, so it’s not quite memorable.
