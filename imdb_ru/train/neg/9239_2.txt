“Heavenly Days” make a serious comedy: these are desperate attempts to teach us the lesson of civil society, and this will not stop until we pass the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly go to Washington, where they see the Senate in action (or inaction, if you will), quarrel with their senator (Eugene Palitra in one of the worst roles of his career), meet a bunch of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meet a man on the train reading a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace !! A year later, he was considered an almost communist deception, but in 1944 he was fine. Add some really awful musical moments, lots of bright hooligans and a boring story about newspaper reporters, and you have a film in which Philip Wiley must be ready to write “Viper Generation 2: D.S. Boogaloo. " “Heavenly Days” is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.
