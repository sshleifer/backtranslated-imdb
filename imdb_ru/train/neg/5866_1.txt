I remember this film when I was 13 years old (I think many reviews mention the same age of 13 years!) With a group of school buddies. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first film and fell in love with the typical commercials that this is a great comedy. We survived about 45 minutes, and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and not at all that Billy Crystal could make us laugh, we did not laugh. I accidentally stumbled upon this review and decided to register, just to tell the rest of the world what kind of trivia it was. Now, if you rent it, you deserve what you get, YOU were warned !!
