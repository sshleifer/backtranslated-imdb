Well then. I just watched a bunch of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I was not too sure which one I would like to consider first. Then he hit me like a rat sack: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monster does not beat anyone and painfully boring to sit. And this is about mutant rats that kill people. Yes ... a real damn original one. "Food of the gods" or "Willard" anyone? It was better than this, and it says little ... <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Well, here is the story: Inna's scientist and his brave assistant are experimenting on rats and in their laboratory. is in a stupid neighborhood and a shitty building, and the retarded friends of the brave assistant turn out to be drunk, and everyone becomes food for crazy rats, and almost everyone dies, and, yes, there is one giant rat that looks trashy, but it's killed, end, There in one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I beg to differ! As soon as we all understand that there is a giant rat, we all know that it will eventually die !! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here’s a breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> - Well, I watched it for free, but for everyone else .. hmm no There is nothing good. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt, did not help: <br /> <br /> - Well ... well. the blood was decent. - Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> - CG rats are not as bad as they could be in some pictures ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - and others The CG rats were pathetically cheap. Listen, if your movie has a low budget, you may not need to rely on computer graphics. The lesson to take to heart. <br /> <br /> - The acting game is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> - Characters are uninteresting - we have a lot of clichés, and none of them are even made so well, <br /> <br /> - Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - We have done before - many times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - A giant rat looks like a fat man in a badly designed bear costume - it was pretty funny, but not funny enough to give this film some value. <br /> <br /> - Excited, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> - All college students from college drink tequila from huge plastic milk jugs, and, nevertheless, do not drink them for more than a few seconds. Guys, keep the continuity. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Just awful Worse than you can imagine. This is not even funny bad, as, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead." Now these films are crap you can enjoy. Even if they make you more stupid. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - Lame action movie ending, full of unaffected heroes and an explosion. Because it’s not at all like the rest of this monster - but it still sucks. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Plot: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nude / Sexuality: 1/10 ( I sometimes took care of my son during the film, so maybe I missed him, but he was supposedly there) Violence / Mountain: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (time average) Writing: 1/10 Direction : 2/10 Cheerfulness: 7/10 Rubbish: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total: 1/10 <br /> <br /> See it, only if you like horror films on rats and parasites. Wait ... Check it out. Do not look. This is crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
