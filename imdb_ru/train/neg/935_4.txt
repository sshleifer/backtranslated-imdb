Users who rated this film so highly simply could not see enough good films to compare it with. They all brainwashed ?? I seldom felt so frustrated by a film, and some of this must be related to the ridiculous rush around this film. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, BU is just a chase movie. We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight to the other. And another. And another. And another. Do you see how the picture develops? Virtually no time is lost on the plot, character development, or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen the other two Bourne films yet, you’re pretty confused. If you have - you only WISH that you were lost - somewhere far away from the cinema. <br /> <br /> Paul Greengrass's impartial style worked exceptionally well on United-93, which was a desperate overload, but on Borne and his endless troubles simply prevented viewers from communicating with the character. He's running. He is jumping. He punches. He is blown up. He cleans tall buildings. Yada Yada Yada First of all - he survives. He survives just as a plastic fighter survives, which only does the ridiculous stunts that he performs, the more relaxing and lacking tension. So he drives off the building? So what? He will survive. Yawn. <br /> <br /> A girl was added to the mix, because Born’s love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she’s just a decoration. I saw more depth of character and lively dialogue in the episodes of "Captain Scarlet". <br /> <br /> Bern's own journey through literal self-knowledge is boring and shapeless and does not tell us anything about what we did not know from the first film. He was turned into a killing machine. Big deal He learns his real identity. So what? When he comes, he has no emotional resonance. <br /> <br /> The “twist” end is wired and weak. Oh dear, the more I think about this film, the more I hate it! I have already reduced my bill to 4 at the time of writing this comment! I'd rather finish now before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I like a good action movie and a good thriller. Born's ultimatum is neither. This is a loud, tedious series of bright edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that it “shows the way” to the Bond franchise is complete nonsense. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.
