My God, I give this movie three stars out of ten for the following reasons. the final sequence is once again quite efficiently processed, and it was absolutely fun. that's what he gets these three points for. besides this, it was terrible. it shouldn’t have been so funny, it’s obvious, but duplication, the play of duplicate voices, the dialogue that they said, where it’s often funny. performed and / or not performed actions also lead to a lot of fun and / or throwing things on the screen. for example, when the entire city is being slaughtered, and one small group of people is standing on the balcony, watching as if they are watching the glass for cooking, or “trying” to escape from the church in which they are hiding. <br /> Evil Mayor: I think something is happening outside, so you have to go upstairs and look out the window. <br /> <br /> hero: good. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: now is my chance to get some idiot to go out and spin around with fire that is completely ineffective and hacked. <br /> <br /> enter the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> Evil mayor: hell, wait, I will take this little child and she will go out and cry to dad, seemingly not noticing the fact that these rotten corpses are not just creepy strangers, but a zombie affair without flesh, without skin, or anything else, and it will lead them away, and I will run away! insert the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> Hero (upstairs): he is trying to escape again, fool, and he left the door open, he is stupid, this is a good view. <br /> <br /> Woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (now below): I don’t know, I don’t see her anyway, and she wasn’t outside, because I couldn't see her, despite the fact that she wasn’t at home. there and I have a view of the whole area, and she stands right outside, where the hell can she be? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, someone will throw things on the screen 10 minutes after that. So, watch the first movie with a few friends, drink a few drinks, and make sure that by the time you start watching this movie, you are completely drunk and can just laugh at the stupidity of it all. and there was not even decent blood, such a shame.
