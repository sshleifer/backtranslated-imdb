Songwriter Robert Taylor (as Terry) "dizzy, slap" and can not look through the otherworldly Norm Shearer (as Consuelo). “It makes the sun shine even when it rains,” explains Mr. Taylor. But Mr. Taylor has a lump in his throat when he approaches Miss Shearer. Finally, at the Shearer private casino in Palm Beach, Taylor announces: “I love you!” Shearer waves him off because she is engaged to George Sanders (like Tony). However, to pay off gambling debt, Shearer hires Taylor to impersonate "his lover of cardboard" to make jealous Mr. Sanders. <br /> <br /> The title of this film offers an obvious and pertinent three-word review: Cardboard film ". This is most noticeable as the last appearance of the film for Shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world from" He Who Slaps (1924, plays another Consuelo) before Women (1939). To be fair, this was the kind of Shearer's movie that MGM thought the audience wanted to see. However, the role is unflattering. <br /> <br /> Taylor and Shearer, who are in The Escape (1940), coped with the task by a large margin. If Shearer continued, she could become a leading actress than a “leading lady"; apparently she was no longer interested and, of course, did not need money. Taylor has a great scene telling "When I die, my dear" Christina Rossetti, threatening to jump from the balcony of Shearer , at the direction of George Cukor. <br /> <br /> **** Her cardboard lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
