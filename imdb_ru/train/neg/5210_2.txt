Let me be honest first. I haven't watched this whole movie. I watched the first five minutes, and when I realized that I almost fell asleep, I decided that I, too, could rewind ahead and see if it would become more interesting later ... It’s not. This film is simply a collection of unsuccessful attempts to turn a story that is already uninteresting and poorly told into something it will never become: a decent horror film. Because I feel it is important to say that even a film with bad special effects can still be good if it is well done. This film will not and will only plunge you into a deep sleep if you try to watch it. Finally, I feel that it’s important to say that I think this film is in a public domain, so if you feel you have to watch it, then a little search on the Internet will show you a place where you don’t have to pay per view. this pile of cinematic manure.
