This film sucks from start to (especially) to the end. You probably do not get worse: acting, storyline, photography, camera work and so on - all this is bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But this is what makes this watch “gorgeous”, it will give you more than enough good laugh. The worse the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what these people were thinking about when making this film. A serious viking film? This story is damn ridiculous, it looks more like a disguised comedy, like the Mafia, also meaningless, but damn funny. <br /> <br /> And pay attention to the very end of the movie ... hmm.
