There were some scary scenes that I always liked more than just blood, but otherwise this film was rather weak. There were too many unanswered questions, and when they tried to explain something in the film, it was still rather incomprehensible. After watching this movie, I still seemed lost in many ways. It reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. This film was also unsatisfactory, but still better than this one, because it really tried to work, and the story really made sense. Not so much this time. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the action in “Abandoned” was decent, but the film dragged on and never really gave a satisfactory conclusion. As I said above, there were some horrific scenes, but otherwise this movie was erratic. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
