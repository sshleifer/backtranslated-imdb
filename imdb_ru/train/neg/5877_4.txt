Williamson accent is hard to understand. He speaks incredibly quickly, as if he is in a hurry to get through the lines. During monologues, he acts as if he is talking to someone when he should be talking to himself. All this and his bald spot just annoyed me. He was too old for this role. Reading other tales of Williamson, he may have gotten this role because he was insane, and the director decided to imitate a little of the art of living or compulsory action. When actors cast Hamlet crazy, you believe it! Marianne Faithful is an amazing beauty who can spoil the role of Ophelia and still get a pass. The plot is dark and gloomy, but it looks like it was shot in a real castle, especially scenes in tunnels / corridors, where the dead king shines like a bright light in the sky.
