"Demons III: Ogre" is not associated with the sequel to "Demons" and "Demons 2 is a cool classic of horrors of the 1980s." Demons III: Ogre is a very stupid, bored, cheap monster. I am very confused about the writer "Demons III: Ogre" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti is a poor-quality and stupid writer who bored the ghost of William Shakespeare or the web of a demon from a web or what Huhuhuhu makes the girl dream). I'm sorry, a very, very, very, very boring movie. I bought a special DVD box called “Demons” for 3 different films “Demons III: Ogre”, “Other Hell” and “Black Demons” do not have subtitles or subtitles. worth $ 14.99 in a Best Buy store in Downey. Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writers who make a stupid film almost like Halloween III, in which there is no monster by Michael Mayer, but people wear Halloween. I am very confused. I really love “Demons” and “Demons 2 are better than boring stupid ones”. D Emons III: “Ogre” is not part of “Demons”, and “Demons 2” are the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Juan Antonio De La Torre
