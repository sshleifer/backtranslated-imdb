Of course, the most important requirement for any movie following fraudsters with confidence is that they should, at least from time to time, be able to pull on us, as well as their stupid tracks, cops, the crowd and (ideally) each other, But this film NEVER copes with it. Each fraud can be seen for a mile (especially from a big one), and at the same time they are not very interesting, intricate or complex. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this with quick dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are fine, but they are set in such an unnatural, unnatural, stylized way that I thought that some clever conclusion might have been made that we all act all the time ... but this is not so. As for the psychological complexity, the protagonist is a little depressed and makes it ridiculously forcing Freud to talk about her father, considering her a whore, but she copes with it. I really liked the street scenes, though. It looked the same as the picture of Edward Hopper.
