I find it hard to believe that someone would put this film in the same context as the exorcist. Where the exorcist was thin and creepy, the Stigmata was blunt, awkward and too formal. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful films I've ever seen, but the images don't make up a downward spiral of patronizing exposure that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film peaked when it was compared with the Exorcist, and my visit to the official website increased this interest. The site has had many stories about “real” stigmata throughout history. However, scene after scene, the film is so obsessed with the search for “authenticity” that at first it becomes comical, and then it is difficult to watch it at the end. I began to suspect when a priest accused of investigating potential miracles enters a beauty salon, where our future heroine cuts her hair and, obviously, flirts with the priests. <br /> <br /> The plot: a woman without faith in God begins to receive the wounds of Christ (Stigmata) and is upset and upset because of this ordeal. The priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the matter. Is Frankie obsessed with Satan or a vessel for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this film is that it finally ends.
