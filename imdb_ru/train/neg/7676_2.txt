I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I saw. There are no characters, only a few stereotypes wandering around and being killed. The degree of character development gave each character a name and occupation, and that was all. There was no real plot, and none of the heroes had any motivation. In fact, many action scenes were just starting on their own, emerging from nowhere with a mysterious techno track. While I was watching this film, I kept asking: “Where does this happen? What is going on? ”The acting was in a high-quality theatrical production, with a tough wooden delivery, as if the actors were reading from a cue card, not understanding their lines. Their problem with the delivery of lines has become even more obvious thanks to the terrible sound design. The ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors constantly took care of hitting their tracks, looking almost like a robot in their movements. Thus, these sluggish automata are viewed through a series of implausible and intricate scenarios, often even without the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there. It was happening, now it is happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or intelligence. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine dollars, though.
