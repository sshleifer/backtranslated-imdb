However, ANOTHER film about a group of less intelligent people on a road trip who roam their original route either for the shortest route, or, in this case, to visit the attraction in the form of a runaway side show. The results, as was to be expected, are not entirely good, since a bunch of crazy inbred residents reside on this particular extra show, which the prisoners fled many years ago. The father, who appears to be a professional photographer, just had to stop and take a picture of this place, only to find that it was still inhabited. Different family members go off to see the various sights to be scared. Thinking that they got safely along the road, the van's tire explodes (surprise!), Leaving them to seek shelter and housing in a small town, which, as we found out, is populated exclusively by freaks (surprise!). <br /> <This film is played out, as expected, when the family is chased and killed by freaks. There are some resistances from families, but this is probably one of the worst scenes in the film, because they are poorly performed. There is nothing remotely original, except for a completely inappropriate soundtrack, which is reproduced during certain scenes, which completely destroys the atmosphere and mood of the film. The acting is about as bad as I have seen for some time all the participants (rather badly, when your cast is played by the actor "Camp Blood"). The special effects are lousy, and the ending made me want to hit the TV. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, despite all the negatives, I liked this film a little. It definitely sounds "so bad, it's good." I went through the whole movie and was even pleasantly entertained as soon as I passed by the ridiculously shaded plot, the terrible game and the stupid special effects. Although the finale left me deceived and angry, especially because the film is not so good to begin with, and the finale makes the whole film meaningless. <br /> <br /> In summary, I can list countless films that, if you saw them, you saw it. The difference is that most of these films are better. Although not a complete waste, this film is pretty bad and not so scary. <br /> <br /> My rating: D
