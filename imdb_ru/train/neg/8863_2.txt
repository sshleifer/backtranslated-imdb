Howl II (1985) was a complete 180 from the first film. While the first film was obscene and creepy. The second was sloppy and cheesy. The production values ​​on this are pretty bad, and the action is terrible. The brother of the leading werewolf from the first part wants to know what happened to his sister. The "scene" from the first film was poorly recreated. A thin, rustic woman accompanies her brother (Reba Brown) to an old country (Romania) to solve the mystery of the murder / transformation / death of her sister. Christopher Lee appears and disappears from time to time as a kind of sage / guide to both. Sybil Dunning and her two largest assets are in the role of Stirba, the main werewolf of Romania. She also suffers from a bad case of her morning face, whoo! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. This nasty thing is not good. I am surprised that Philip Mora shot this picture because he is usually a good director. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (no, not the content, but the film itself). At the end of the movie you will get a lousy punk performance from the accursed Babylon imitator. Perhaps if they had split a few extra dollars, they could get a real deal instead of imitation. <br /> <br /> It is best to avoid it if you are not desperate or have not lost the remote control and you are too lazy to change the channel.
