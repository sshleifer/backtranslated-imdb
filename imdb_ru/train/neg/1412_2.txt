While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie called “Making 10 or less items”: <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good and bad news. The good news is that we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter: This is great! But what's the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: We can afford to hire him for just one day. I think we will need to find someone else. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter: We hire him for one day. The film lasts an hour and a half. The working day lasts eight hours. I do not see the problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... he will have to take the time to become a character. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter: So, we will make him play a character, which In fact, he himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he still needs to understand his motivation and all that. You do not say that we play a famous actor who makes a low-budget film, right? <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: This is ridiculous! But well, at least we will have Morgan Freeman in our film. And I guess we need to make a movie in Los Angeles too. <br /> <br /> Script: Of course. <br /> <br /> Producer. We better make money on it. Just in case, ask the character Morgan Freeman to connect Wal-Mart or Target or one of these stores so that at least someone would like to sell the DVD. <br /> <br /> Author: Of course! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait a second ... what is this tiny winery with an express lane "ten items or less"? <br /> <br /> Author: Oh, I think it's pretty weird. But we cannot change the name now! <br /> <br /> I doubt that my script is really very similar to reality, but then there was no “10 items or less” either. This is a case of good acting, but a bad letter, and I don’t want to see it happen. When viewing an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey some message. I think they may have tried to find the weary old message “don't let anything hold you back”, which was done to death in much better films. In any case, with “10 items or less”, the only message I received was “Look! Look at Morgan Freeman! ”
