This film was written by Charlie Higgson, who had previously done the “legendary” Fast Show and his own show, based on one of the Fast Show characters (Tony, the car salesman). He also wrote books for children about James Bond. <br /> <br /> In fact, I’ve seen only Gordon’s films based on Lovecraft’s stories before, and each of them is amazing. Here Gordon is trying to do something else. The style is completely "modern", which means a shaky camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background. I think everything works pretty well here, but it’s still pointless and cheap. This makes me often think of a cameraman who shakes his dv-camera in front of actors / actresses and tries to make stylish movements in the pictures (hoping that something tolerable will come out of it). Casting is good and the atmosphere reigns as a result of good direction. I think that the main character, the “zero” young guy, is quite interesting in his “zero”. The fat man is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but not him. But pretty soon after the beginning of the film, something not very interesting turns out: in this case, I mean the endless line of scenes of sadism and illness. There is not much humanity in this film / story: it is completely pessimistic, and every person in this film is disgusting and hopeless, or will soon die. It goes without saying that there is no humor. This vomit is 40 minutes long without relief at any time. In any case, Gordon remains for me one of the most interesting directors who work today, and I consider this film an experiment and a failure in it. Everyone has to experience loss sometimes, just to learn and find his way again. This may be the most uninteresting and empty work of Gordon.
