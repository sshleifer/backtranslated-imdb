Inventor Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his problematic compression / expansion machine to the Smithsonian Institution as he and his wife Diana (Yves Gordon) are preparing for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall). Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenny (Allison Mac) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) voluntarily look after Adam while his parents are out, but fortunately it will turn out (and the name made would expect you), adults were accidentally hit by the shrinking beam of Wayne. When children go crazy, their miniature people have to fight with monstrously huge insects, wrinkles on the carpet that look like canyons, and other threats to them. It was bad, like most video sequels, “Honey, we pacified ourselves” was funny. I had to laugh at this film “Roach” by Stuart Pankin, and the hooligan parties were even more ridiculous to look at your own peril and risk!
