The sun should go down in this movie forever. <br /> <br /> It goes on forever (which is usually not bad - an English patient, Schindler's list), but it is SO boring. The aging of the actors is unbelievable, as is the protracted endless storyline, which does not seem to go anywhere. In short, a waste of talent and film.
