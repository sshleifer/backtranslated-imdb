This is another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very accidentally and predictably and continues throughout the entire film. I kept waiting for him to raise, but unfortunately it never did. Acting is fair, but the script requires a lot of work. And if you are looking for nudity, do not waste time on these not very hot actors. Due to poor sound quality and lack of titles, I missed 1/8 of the film. If you have never seen more than five gay films or have recently come to terms with the fact that you are gay, this film may seem interesting to you, otherwise it is your ordinary low-budget film. This is one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
