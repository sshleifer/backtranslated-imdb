Just an ordinary film about Jason Lee. Some parts of the movie were funny. I think the implication of this step is to live on the edge of life. These are the films that, I think, 14-year-old girls look at hen parties. It was a good movie. This is kind of one of those films that you shoot in the background and from time to time look for when something attracts attention. I think that Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a film with a good story and plot. It's just the kind of boy that meets the girl movie. This is the ideal film that they would show at the Central Comedy. I am glad that I did not see this film in the theater, I would be angry. But I think this is why I did not see it in the theater.
