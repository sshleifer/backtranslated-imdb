After seeing this pile of manure, my husband and I asked if this was not the result of an experiment in order to find out if a computer program could create a film. It was so sluggish and patterned. But the US propaganda thrown in your face throughout the entire film proves - disappointingly - that this is the work of people. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes such as “We must steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it” look like ways to justify such actions as invading Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicolas Cage is spewing lines like “ I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip, ”as my husband and I wondered if the whole cast of Valium would take it before shooting every scene. The “reasoning” behind every turn of the plot and the new “hint” is really ridiculous and impossible to trace. And there is another bonus plot about misogyny, when Dr. Weas-Hee-Names-scolded all the participants for the fact that they "never fall silent." She is clearly in the film only for looks, but they felt the need to hit the “doctor” title on her character in order to give her some seriousness. At some point, Cage's character says: “Do you never be silent?” And the camera shows her, looking at her hands as if she were a child. Really grotesque. The only advantage of this film was that it is so terribly bad that you get a little laugh from it. It’s really scary that most people who watch the movie with us liked it. Terribly ....
