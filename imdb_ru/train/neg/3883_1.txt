No, just kidding. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> Last night I watched my local sci-fi station, which plays movies every night as part of its monthly theme. This month is "Cosmic turkeys, or: How I learned to stop worrying and loving bombs." The films are so bad that they should not be made. It was a good choice. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is terrible, with two exceptions: make-up of blood (which showed potential) and editing (which I did not like a little in the rest of the film, are awful in terms of being). Everywhere a terrible game, terrible dialogue, script, direction. This is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two forms of special effects: bloody and stock video recording of space. I will focus on blood. Watching this film, I thought to myself: “What was the motivation for making this film?” People like to do things, of course, but I did not dare to think that something good could come out of it for everyone who was involved. I came to the conclusion that this film was made in order to increase the demo video of the guy from Make-up Effects. He (Rick Baker) actually continued a rather good career, he worked on Star Wars (1977), King Kong (1976), Men in Black (1996), and even Incredibly Cringing Woman (1981) , as well as a number of other noticeable clicks. Besides this, I cannot say that I have ever truly seen a real, living, melting person — incredible or otherwise — but I would have to say that this was a fair idea of ​​one thing. <br /> <br /> Now that I think about bad editing, I usually think about the scene where someone is talking on the phone, and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone falls on his shoulder, or something in that kind of This film really underlines the fact that poor editing can take many forms. In particular, too long and completely useless scenes. Almost every scene lasted longer than it should, from a small amount of dead air to this insanely long screaming scene with the Cleaver Girl. And this severed head is in the river, the head is thrown into the river (in slow motion), the film continues for a couple of minutes, and then we return to the floating head and see how it falls on the waterfall. Although I am sure that they were all very proud of their severed head, WHAT IS HELL? <br /> <br /> Finally, I will mention the scene of a running fat lady / slow-motion at the very beginning. A jerky slow motion tells me that initially they didn’t shoot the scene in slow motion, but later decided that it was “not working” and then slowed it down. Oi vey. In any case, if you ever see another film in which a hysterical fat woman runs down the corridor and then right through a closed glass door - all in slow motion, remember - INCREDIBLE FLOATING, because * this * is where it all started. <br /> <br /> Such films are best viewed at home with a group of friends. This is a bit slow in most cases, but it is even more time to come up with your own strings. This is not the worst of the worst, but it is damn bad.
