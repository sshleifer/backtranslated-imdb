I am a big fan of the novelist / screenwriter Michael Chabon. His novel, Wonder Boys, was a curtis Hanson film. His masterful novel The Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, and he had a hand in the script for Spider-Man 2, perhaps the best comic book of all time. <br /> <br /> Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber also made great comedy productions such as the ugly Dodgeball and the brilliant short film Terry Tate: Office Midfielder. And with such actors as Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, it seems easy. <br /> <br /> This is so. Literally. <br /> <br /> John Foster plays the role of Art Bechstein, the son of a gangster (Nolte), who recently earned a degree in economics. John is in a state of arrested development: he works at Book Barn with a minimum wage, has an empty relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), which is a little more than a copious amount of sex, and no other plans than to abandon a career for which he has no passion. <br /> <br /> Once at a party, a former roommate introduces John to Jane (Miller), a beautiful, smart violinist. Later that night, they go out to the cake, and she asks John a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence: “I want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul. If you do, it will make this night indelible. "Then John tells her about his returning dream, in which he wanders around the city, looking at the faces of strangers passing by, but none of them looks into his eyes." that this is exactly how death is felt, ”he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, wild guy Jane Cleveland (Saarsgard) kidnaps John from work and takes him to a huge abandoned steel mill, and soon John, Cleveland and Jane spend every waking moment together, go to punk rock concerts, take They drink drugs and drink a lot of alcohol. It doesn't work well with Phlox, who pushes John to a more personal relationship, which allows her to meet with his new friends and his father. Then the film tries to take us on John's journey when he gets rid of the shackles his father, Phlox, and his dead-end work when he finds freedom and expression in his relationship with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem for us to follow John throughout the film: he is completely uninteresting . He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He walks through life like the invisible ghost he described to Jane that night when they met. From the very beginning this is not a problem. But it never becomes more interesting. He is completely passive character. He just follows the bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never gave us the slightest idea of ​​what he cares about or what he wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> Consequently, the film and its characters have nowhere to go. to go and do little else besides a party, have sex and get into arguments. In other words, much ado about nothing. What we have here is the fine skin of a good film without an inside. Wide cinematography, a loud voice-over with characters looking into the distance, lots of sex scenes, both direct and funny, loud arguments, more angry sex, a chase scene and a tragic death ... but that doesn't seem to matter. Ironically, at some point, Jane, entangled in a series of John's pointless actions, asked him: “What is happening, John? What is this all about? ”Yes, John, tell me. We, the viewers, also can not wait to find out. <br /> <br /> The name “Secrets of Pittsburgh” should refer to the characters themselves, because this is what they are. All of them are facades, one-dimensional stands for real people. The film never lets us. We never know what makes any of them tick. We see that they do a lot of things, but we don’t know why. And the lack of “why” is one of the worst things a movie can have.
