If you are younger than 6 or 7 years old, then you really will like this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when watching him. As an adult, I can not stand it !! I'm ready to continue ... when they have a decent plot. But this is not at the proper level. Please forgive me for making a film for children, but when you have to watch it almost every day, when your children love it so much, you will understand why. My daughter will watch this movie again and again on the same day if we let her. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 4 out of 10 solely for the fact that it entertains my little ones.
