While acting and directing can be argued as having a certain value - the plotline is a very bad film about Vietnam for imitators with just a changed country name. <br /> <br /> At least, the film is trustworthy, try to have some semblance of accuracy in equipment, weapons and tactics. Never mind the gross distortion of information about the behavior of troops as a norm. <br /> <br /> Aside from the limited use of stupid propaganda about the South African defense forces, it serves a small purpose â€” definitely no entertainment value. <Br /> <br /> Aspiring filmmakers - that's how not to shoot war movies. Do some research and be proud of your product.
