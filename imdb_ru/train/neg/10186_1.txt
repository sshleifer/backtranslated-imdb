Where is Michael Caine when you need him? I have seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare film before season 1 (episode K-20) is one of the worst films ever made. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Macpeus and Burgess Meredith, are fighting for the worst batch of cinematography, providing lines that should have been written by a secret working group in the style of Dick Cheney, consisting of Exxon and GM lawyers, trying to cut funding for mass research in the field transit and energy efficiency. It looked like it was filmed almost in complete darkness, possibly on Super 8. Makes Logan's Walk walk like a cinematic Sistine chapel, crossed with Shakespeare. I can not imagine that I look at it without comments from Crowe and Servo, because it is impossible to see even with him. Obviously, some 401K is needed in Hollywood, which prevents actors from making bad films like these in order to pay for their medical care. With his topic of “pollution and driving rights,” in the end, I half expect to see Charlton Heston's cameo, where he gives his speech “Cold dead hands”. Lee, I could forgive you for this in 1989, but in 1981?
