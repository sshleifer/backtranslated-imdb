I hated this show when I was a kid. It was on the day when the children demonstrated that the characters really have accents, and not just a mild, common, common American dialect, to which we are accustomed. Jack Wild had a British accent, while Pufnstuf had a southern accent. Like one of those mentioned above, I never understood what was the matter with the witch who wanted the flute. It always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute just annoyed me, and I wouldn't bother to take it away! <br /> <br /> Just a comment about the similarity of Pufnstuf with McDonalds advertising from the early 70s. what others have mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds. In the midst of the popularity of McDonalds, the television show (or rather their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds refused, the television show slightly changed the characters and passed it on as their own. They even hired former employees of the advertising agency McDonalds and voice actors to participate in a television show. McDonalds sued and won. Look for a lawsuit Pufnstuf McDonaldland, and you will find many articles about it.
