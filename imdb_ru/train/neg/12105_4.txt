It was a disappointing movie. People seem to have no meaning; the main character, Martin Kahil, has zero redemptive values, virtually everyone in it, including John Voight, personifies littering. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Violence is unpleasant, although done skillfully. Shooting should be black, at least those prints that seemed to me suitable for this category.
