I'm still trying to figure out if there was any point in this film. <br /> <br /> For content that is supposed to be so “rebellious” and “controversial,” things that Maddox spreads among students are terribly lame. It seems to be easy for students to shake the vague anti-authoritarian moods and passages of words that are illegible sketched on leaflets. Rebels, everything. <br /> <br /> I think it would be too much to ask to make a film about the uprising of teenagers, in which the school fire alarm does not work. <br /> <br /> “A huge battle on the football fields” is a battle in which two people participate. <br /> <br /> Characters' characters seem to differ wildly in random order. The football athlete Maddox fought for (and who later suffered a major blow to the face) was all smiles and apologies the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that he does not come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that all this could be prepared in half an hour after the school program. If they cut out most of the pseudo-glitch soundtrack attempt.
