When I call Malis a Noir film, I don’t compare it to such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Refund or The Maltese Falcon, and I don’t compare director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Louis Bunuel. I simply register a protest against the darkness that permeates this film from beginning to end, to such an extent that most of the time you just can't make out what happens. I can understand the darkness in the night scenes, but this film was dark even in broad daylight, for whatever reason I cannot understand. However, be that as it may, it would not matter if the director Becker shot it in complete darkness.
