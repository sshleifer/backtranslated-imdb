The jungle fever is too much stylized, stereotypical and looks essentially unfair. Wesley Snipes was wrong, and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Despite the fact that this film has a lot of talent, it is mostly wasted because the details are reduced to a little more than decorative cameos. In addition, instead of simply showing racism for this ugly and stupid thing, Spike Lee prefers to wave it, like a flag, in the most nagging and annoying way. I did this for most of the movie, but I couldn't finish it, and this, for me, rarely happens.
