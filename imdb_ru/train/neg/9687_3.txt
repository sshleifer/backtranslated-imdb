This is an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Beauty in sexual relations between men and women is manifested in the humiliation of men and women, which can only be described as a set of eccentrics and losers. <br /> <br /> Greenway recognizes his inspiration for the Fellini film “8 1/2”, but while Fellini is a titan of world cinema, Greenway is not. <br /> <br /> He has neither the ease of touch of the maestro, nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a cleverness of clarity. <br /> <br /> It is pretentious, the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to everyone, as if the viewer should be sent to the film, except that the written notices remain only on the screen for a few seconds, not long enough to viewers could read, causing them to be largely ignored. <br /> <br /> With regard to women, only two can be described as observers, Palmyra, played by Polly Walker and Jakonda played by Natachi Amal. The rest oozes routine. Both women and men are moving away from the harsh light of reality into the vague shades of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Greenway obviously wants to emphasize that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. Women themselves are oppressed because they provide their services in exchange for money. Relations between men and women are reduced to a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no feeling of joy, happiness or love in the film, there are indeed several scenes that are very unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The assumption of the incestuous relationship between father and son Philip and Storey Emmental played respectively by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The ruthless neglect of both men by the fact that Jakonda bears their child, in fact, she becomes pregnant twice, the first fruit is interrupted, and the second time she is sent to the destination chosen by the men from the book of flight. Both men have sex with a woman who has no legs (half the woman in the title). The Hypericum, which exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortensia. Father and son share the women between them. Women enjoy sexual beating. The father sleeps with the corpse of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, none of these scenes are shown sexually, only hinting at her. <br /> <br /> The hint at the degradation of women is such that It cannot be surprising that the film was booed when it was first shown in Cannes. What is even more unusual is that the actresses in the film lined up to protect him, once again demonstrating that there is no limit to the naivete of women and that women are fooling themselves for men to exploit them. <br /> <br /> Greenway’s directorial style is pretentious, it’s a triumph of style over substance, the image of the film as art, accompanied by a rejection of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenway is trying to reach the heights of surrealism, but he only manages to show the banality of human relationships.
