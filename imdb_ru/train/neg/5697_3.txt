This is the most basic kind of traditional ghost story, not even to a large extent the lively use of Irish locations. If the great Mr. James ever invented such a fine story - does not James have a story called The Subtle Ghost? - he would not bother to publish it. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles appears in flabby tips as a favor to brace old friends, producers of this film. His presence and the only joke in the film industry would deserve this Oscar nomination. This is further proof that Academy awards have never been a guarantee of merit.
