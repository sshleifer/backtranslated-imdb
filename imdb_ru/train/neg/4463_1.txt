This is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it, and then some, such as the time you spent randomly selecting it, the time you spent getting to the video store, and t. D. <br /> <br /> First, the appearance: grainy, low-budget. Now this in itself does not make for a bad movie. But the way it was shot makes the action unnatural, so it is a little distracting. <br /> <br /> Then the story. 3 girls go on a weekend away from guys. Of course, like EVERYTHING, when they go camping, they stop on their way to get earrings. When they arrive in the area in which they are going to stop, they are stopped by Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car during the hot season, and then take them where they are going. (remote cabin). Of course, 2 “cute guys” roam around, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubrey fight immediately, but obviously Bambi is struck by something with two legs. Maidi is rather disappointed with this development, because she was looking forward to the weekend to forget about her ex, having received a shizan and a face with stones from her gallop. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot, there is such an old, old hermit who lives in such a way that someone may not be associated with, and the area and the hut in which they are located has a kind of "reputation." <br /> <br /> So, of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, MUCH LATER) some of our weekend forest visitors start dying and discover various booby traps (although a couple of them actually fell just below) , and, of course, the remaining tourists are understandably upset. Of course, there is no reception from a cell phone (who would have missed the opportunity to check your cell phone for a movie reception?). Mr. Ranger Sir continues to appear at odd moments, and his behavior seems a bit strange, but he said he would be helped. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic twist that you just don’t want to miss. if you are still awake. Pray that you wake up on a blank screen. <br /> <br /> This is terrible, production values ​​are terrible, and the whole undertaking is just lame, and I find it amazing that they even let him out. Avoid at all costs, 1 out of 10.
