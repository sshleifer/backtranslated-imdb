“Angry Red Planet” (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like “Man from Planet X,” this is a strange science fiction tale created in an era when fantasy and science fiction were still like that same This means that we have very funny special effects and rampant pseudoscience disguised as science fiction. And yes, this is another “classic”, released in high-quality transmission with a clear picture and a sharp sound - from Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So the main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's definitely all the time when our space crew is on Mars. (What did you think the “Evil Red Planet” refers to Neptune?) Before that, a rather low-quality space crew boarded a spacecraft inside which they smoke and are thrown around a sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the “little female” member Team. It would be somewhat offensive by today's standards, if it were not so damn ridiculous. But Mars is the real reason we watch it. The film is usually black and white, but Mars, well, Mars screams blood-red. This is filmed in this strange red plastic sheen, giving the angry red planet a rather interesting kind of overexposed reddening. It really is quite a sight, as are the spectators (haha), the witnesses. The best creature is the rat crab. Do you think this is a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! This is a giant chimera (small puppet), combining the features of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. This limits all puppies and scares the crap from our “heroic team.” There are other strange and poorly represented aliens who can be seen, but he takes the cake. In the end, after the painful experience on Mars, the sexist team sits on their “ship” and returns to any planet where they came from. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Lovers of science fiction and curiosity lovers, as well as some movie lovers. Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will spend this field day with this (if they never got to the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Current rating, 6/10 Nostalgia rating, 4/10 overall rating. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
