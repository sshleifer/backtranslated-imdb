Hmm ... where to start? How did a serious actress like Demi Moore get involved in such crap? “First Blood” can be rated like a bull *** t, but this type of stupidity is just Rambo with tits, period. Of course, if you are interested in nonsense (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be a part of Navy Seals), this is the stupidest cliche I can think of, you will say: “JJJ is a great movie. Only the performance of Viggo Mortensen made this film bearable, but damn, I can't imagine that Demi Moore is Rambo (especially not the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve to make this film suitable for women with equal rights, this is just brainless propaganda for the American army, and to make it more attractive, they threw Moore into it. Horrible movie.
