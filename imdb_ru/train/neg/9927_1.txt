This very unfortunate unsuccessful television pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th Annivesery special DVD "Blazing Saddles". Imagine a movie without satire, humor or writing skills. But with all the attributes of a typical 70s lame sit-show, completed with an intrusive track of laughter, you still donâ€™t understand how disgusting this unfortunate show was. What the hell was Lou Gossett Jr. thinking when he signed up for this disaster? Perhaps it was the worst thing he was in (and yes, I include the first film "The Punisher" and "Iron Eagles 3." Steve Landesberg, as I understand it, he cannot say no). <br /> <br /> My rating: F
