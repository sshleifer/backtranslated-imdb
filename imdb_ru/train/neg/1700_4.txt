In the movie, I feel that it must be more than just art. I think it should be something more, a way to tell the story on the screen. This short from David Lynch tells the story, but not most of them. I felt it was funny, but too weird to be a comedy. This is a good film, but in fact there is nothing else in it. As I said before, I’m a big fan of David Lynch, but some of his works upset me, because I don’t see the need for it at all. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far, but I know that he still has a ton of talent, and I'm glad to see what he has prepared for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check it out, but don’t be surprised if you don’t really like it.
