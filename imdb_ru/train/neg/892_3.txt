(I will point out in this review the point where spoilers start.) My dissatisfaction is divided: 30% deafness, 70% inaccurate writing. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the summary of the first commentator about the lack of diversity in the nature and scope of stories. I was surprised how this film, at best, sadly changes the real New York City, presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow that it seems that it is populated only by Gossip Girl actors (this is from someone who loves Gossip). Girl). Several minority characters are recorded in the story, but they are included by commitment, while we can see the mechanisms under the film so clearly, trying to be “diverse”, but very short. <br /> <br /> 70% - that's why everything is missing. All characters, white plus a few symbolic minorities, are one-dimensional, cardboard clippings of people's concepts. Worse, their interaction with each other is written in such a way that for each vignette of the film, the audience perceives what I would call a “gag”: we get the basic vanity, and then some highlight, designed for a smart twist. But even if we stopped cynicism for a moment, to say: “Well, it was unexpected” ... the stories are still not so interesting, because they are also small. When you create stories in such a way that their existence depends solely on the surprise of the finale, you write jokes. <br /> <br /> Spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> Basically the movie is trying to tell romantic stories. Everything is good. But romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. Each of these “romantic” stories tells about a girl and a boy who, at some point, live in one place and look at each other. The exchange of words, thoughts are projected through voice-overs, but they also manage to convey to the audience only what attracts one person to another. <br /> <br /> This means that there is no seduction (in a broad sense) There is no tension, there is neither confrontation, nor communication between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence in order to adapt to the Other. The only story connected with superficial “seduction” is told only to make the audience surprised that the guy (Ethan Hawk) outwitted the girl he attacked, who unexpectedly turned out to be a prostitute. Of course, his words when trying to raise her are interesting to hear, and we are surprised as if we were next to them, but there is nothing substantial in this story outside of “A, then B”. So it unfolds if something like a postcard can “unfold”, along with all the other fairy tales: A, then B - That's it, the only thing that happens is “on the set” in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn that we see is a sketch of Coney Island; The only queen is the twinkle of a train ride that a character travels to in the West Village. <br /> <br /> Easily select movies that reproduce all the common stereotypes of race, gender, and sexual orientation soon. “New York, I love you,” however, deserves stricter control because of its name. We expect to see the real New York and the real New Yorkers, but instead we put in front of us a selected piece of the demographic image, whose characters flew in from OK, as well as several others, so that it seemed to me as if we were paying attention to diversity. But when we take a closer look at who these heroes are, the whole deception becomes an insult to the very concept of diversity, as well as ethnic groups and cultures that are not shamefully represented in the film. <br /> <br /> For example, the story of a Latin American with a little white girl in the park, which two women mistaken for their man (male nanny), although in fact he is the father. Despite the fact that the last scene of this part was unnecessary from the point of view of dramatic construction (it would be much more interesting to finish it when the mother and boyfriend / stepfather skip the girl), it is frankly a little disgusting that the scene where we know for sure that the girl's father Hispanic ALSO should tell us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, dad can not just be a guy from South America? Now that he is clearly hot, the public is better prepared to accept that he has a child with a white woman from middle to upper class? Are we so naive to demand this? As if the Mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This is not my place to dictate where the film should go. But in every conceivable setting and plot twist, the chosen direction shouts about the status quo and calls for security. All these stories could be made more interesting, even if we were forced to maintain the one-dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them, at least not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes. An Asian girl living in Chinatown, on whom an old white guy is frowning? How about an Asian cougar chasing a white schoolboy. Again, I am not saying that all vanity should be changed. It's just everyone. heck. background history. so beaten up - and therefore they are not able to convey anything about why you can love New York, except for a trite one. The real way to improve a movie is to write a script worth reading. <br /> <br /> I recognize the pleasantness of the soundtrack, the good pace of the film (even if the tempo was, well, dredge), and the overall feeling of many scenes. The movie was just great, and I would not dissuade anyone from this. However, this suggests that the most significant respect given to superficiality is when the old opera singer says (paraphrasing): "This is what I love in New York: everything is from another place." Well, you wouldn't know about that.
