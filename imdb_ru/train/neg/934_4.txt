Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were great as always. Ritter is also not bad. As her name is, as beautiful as usual. It could be a good movie. To a bad story was brutal. It was completely predictable, trite and boring. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was laid out as a children's coloring in the order of numbers. The characters were pieces of cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say, and it completely outweighed the action, which was a pity. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is very unfortunate that the screenwriter was not a victim. Especially with the "premature" features of the child, which were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Again, only the acting has prevented a much lower score.
