In order for a scientific film panic to work well, it must be either really original or a very good retelling. This film is neither one nor the other. Of course, there is a pseudo-original twist in that the guy is killing people because of the toxin, not because of the disease, but this is a very minor twist. There is a government plot, the main character of the Crusaders, who has personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And the real disadvantage of this film is that the infected person has no pathos. Although the character is written to be regrettable, it is not. Without pity, the film is meaningless. Other characters are so liver that they are funny. The plots are intricate and annoying. And the saddest thing is that the film is too flat to be used even as fake material. Make the film 45 minutes short, and perhaps worth watching.
