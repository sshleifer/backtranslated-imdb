The version of this film that I saw was called The Terror Rise from the Tomb. The horror in question is the evil medieval magician played by the Spanish horror legend Paul Ours, similar to the fact that he plays Abanaser in panto in the church hall. He rises from his grave when a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, as Nashi also plays him) returns to his ancestral home and reunites the head and body of the magician, who were separated by the healers who executed him, try to stop him by rising from the tomb. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that as soon as the head and body merged again, all hell broke up and many people died. Like all good magicians, Abanazer has a great helper here. This time, another great Spanish horror is playing - Helga's beautiful line. Like almost every other woman in the movie “Line” periodically shoots her kit. In this film, a lot of nudity, and not only women - we can even see Our bellied body, which, I can tell you, is not a very beautiful sight. Most of the sexual orientation of the film is ridiculously free. There is one particularly amusing scene in which Our and Line discuss their evil plans, and then suddenly decide that they both have the fumbles of a nude young blonde they possessed. <br /> <br /> In some places, it’s also pretty awful — especially Herschel Gordon Lewis — the moment that Line puts his hands into the man’s chest to take away his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is pretty spectacular zombies that are coming to an end. They are quickly frightened off by the fire, and they do not return. Which is a shame. The scene where zombies rise, however, is the most ridiculous moment of the film. All this happens in the long term, and we really do not understand what is happening until we see some figures coming from afar. There are several such moments, largely due to poor editing. When a worker falls under Nasi’s hypnotic spell, his face is covered in close up, which seems to last forever and has no meaning at all. <br /> <br /> In general, not a great horror film, but rather entertaining enough. Of course, the version I saw was a duplicate of the American version, which was probably cut into pieces. As far as I know, the original Spanish version can be a masterpiece ...
