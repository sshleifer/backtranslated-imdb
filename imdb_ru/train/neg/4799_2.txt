I myself am a big fan of the low-budget horror films of the 80s. This is not the worst, but still not impressive. The plot line is decent, but drags on for too long. You will go through half the movie before you can see any zombie action. The killings are not very creative, and the zombies are not too cunning. I really think that this movie would be better if they left the zombies and just turned it into some kind of mafia movie. It's watchable, but I feel that this film stole at least an hour of my life. I will give the film for originality. If you really love horror movies B, then itâ€™s worth a look, but if not, do not worry. But you don't have to take my word for it.
