The plot of this film was not only invented by the ease with which two psychos are able to abduct a pregnant woman without disturbing the sweat, but was also a terrible robbery of “Misfortune”. However, the main reason I gave this film such a low rating was that it was completely disgusting to me. <br /> <br /> I am not one of those who are easily shocked by the fact that the directors are preparing, and have always experienced a love of horror. Damn, but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just to get points for the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think most people watch only the first ten minutes of “Hide and Seek”. Search, find reaching for the remote.
