Who are they cheating? There were too many things in this film that were difficult to digest. From the very moment when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unknowingly wishes his father to die when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri), to leave him in a few minutes. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who has ever passed through London Heathrow knows that such a holiday would not have been possible, especially an Indian. But the problems of the film do not end, there is the problem of two main protagonists (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan), passing like rock stars on the verge of achieving their dreams. I mean, yes, we saw that success came to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK who achieved her dream after 50 years), but it was a rare case. It was really difficult for me to suspend my disbelief, because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was simply ill-conceived. They would never play with Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles. So why are we being forced to watch how Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men over the age of 40) are desperately trying to keep their 20 years? Let's not even talk about the most shy actress on the screen today, Asin. This is her second film (which I saw), and she is just hopeless as an actress, so aware of her appearance that she only cares about looking good and looking fashionably in front of the camera, and not showing good acting qualities. It is hard to believe that she abandoned all other film roles to star in this film, and then become as fluffy as an actress. And to top it all off, the film just dragged itself boring. There is nothing special about this, believe me, you will predict every clich√©d thing that happens in it.
