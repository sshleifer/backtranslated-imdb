Loony Tunes have ventured (at least) twice to the future. The first time was with the brilliantly funny Duck Dodgers. Last time was with this ?? hm ?? efforts. Loonatics Unleashed is not without its merits and can be considered a good product if not for the quality of Warner Brothers. WB cartoons are known for their brash humor, appealing to both adults and children. On the other hand, these episodes of pedestrian superheroes cannot but convince adults to abandon them. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that 6 ordinary people (2 rabbits, Tasmanian devil, duck, Roadrunner and coyote) live on the “planet-city” in Akmetropolis and acquire superpowers when a meteor hits the planet in 2772. What is confusing is that in the title section these people are represented with a score of up to 2772 from the 21st century, Sweet, but stupid fruling. <br /> <br /> In each episode super sextet ?? on the background of a slightly funny, but essentially banal banter ?? Fight various super villains. For the most part, these are the types that appear in every mediocre series of superhero adventures and even some of the best. Like many mediocre superhero series, this one takes its villains too seriously for context. And, of course, these guys are the only characters that laugh ?? the usual evil laugh, of course. Why are the villains in the predictable adventures of superheroes always ?? IS ALWAYS ?? laugh evil at every opportunity? Such animated materials seem to cause laughter only in the province of villains and (sometimes) their minions and / or horseshoes. <br /> <br /> In fact, the creators of this series missed their best bets right from Start. Characters' superpowers are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we do not see enough insanity of the WB. Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits that can be described as "bugs." What we have here is mostly stupid and obscene "Teen Titans", including their overly "modern" animated "appearance", but with animals. Feh. <br /> <br /> Another mistake made by the creators of the program is (or there are) villains. As noted earlier, they are not very creative and too funny. Surprisingly, the authors completely missed the obvious technique of creating villains from WB serial characters, as well as the main characters. In addition to the fun could, say, Jupiter Sam ?? as well as Fudd, still hunt for wabbits ?? and also technician E. Coyote turns into a really neurotic villain ?? and so on. Oh, sadness about missed opportunities ??. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this whole performance has been processed for too long (that is, in season 2). Nevertheless, we can rejoice that there is something new for the crowd of 14 to 9. The rest of us can hope for the 3rd season of the Duck Dodgers.
