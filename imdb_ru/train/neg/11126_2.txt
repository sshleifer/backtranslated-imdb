Of all the films I have seen, this one is rated almost at the bottom (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Problem and some others keep it from getting to the bottom). This is hastily, the story is shaky, and the events depicted are poorly played out, Of course, we have to put some of this at the door of the author of the book. The book, based on the film, is extremely outrageous and illogical. Oprah gives a pleasant appearance as a mom "Bigzhera", but almost not in its potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their worst. A plot that centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. Leading his daughter's family to a communist dinner, he meets. One thing leads to another, and the girl gets drunk. Now the family in which he works is not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home, he puts her to bed, but she starts to shit. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but chokes her instead. Now, fearing that he is really in trouble for having killed a white girl, he does what any logical person does - he pushes her into a coal furnace. Thus, the investigators are conducting the case of the missing person, and now they are checking the stove (the idiot had no foresight to get rid of the ashes. Then he was arrested, and the last hour or so are disgusting parts from the courtroom. If yours is desperate for bad film, this one might work, but if you seriously want to learn about the cultural issues of the 40s and 50s or see a good drama, there are much better options. Avoid this.
