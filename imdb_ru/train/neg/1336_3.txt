This film was definitely not one of the best Mary-Kate and Ashley films. I really didnâ€™t like it and I was disappointed with this movie. For some reason, it seemed like it was a film that they collected very quickly. In some parts it became so boring that I had to rewind it. He had no blunders or any exciting roles like in other films.
