This is the most disturbing film I've ever seen. This makes Requiem for a Dream look like a Disney movie. Although, technically, this is quite well done, acting, cinematography, music, directing, etc., This is good. However, the final scene of gang rape is the most terrible and cruel thing I've ever seen, and I really would like me not to see her. I am afraid that this will haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think someone would find the film extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were victims in a very similar way, and I really didnâ€™t need a clear reminder of the horror they experienced. I saw the film at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas, and none of the actors or film crew attended. I would like them to have the opportunity to defend the violence in their film, which I considered excessive, unreasonable and unnecessary. An earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they were obviously aiming for, but did not rub your face as a result of extreme and obvious sexual violence. This film should have a large WARNING label. For these reasons, I would not recommend it to anyone. You have been warned.
