What a horrible movie. Don't get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but besides a few interesting scenes, the film is mostly occupied by hysterical submariners who scream, cry, sweat and get mad at all when something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take this with simplistic views so that the audience still understands what is happening (the scene in which Denzel Washington explains to the radio repairman that he should be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke ), and you have a stupid fighter, not worthy of acting skills. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that the real US nuclear fleet is not in the hands of such a scenario! <br /> <br />
