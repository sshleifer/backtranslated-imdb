The first lesson some filmmakers need to know (especially those inspired by Hollywood) is simply “style” not for sale. I think that Tashan in translation will mean style. Secondly, if you are obsessed with the idea of ​​selling, it will not save you from a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that could be enough with a better director. But it is not smooth. For example, all three - Saif, Karina and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. But this setting is not used properly. There could be a better combination and comparison of their narratives. Sequences of actions belong to the seventies. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the film is terrible. I think that Vaibhavi the Merchant just slept, walked through this film. Vishal-Shekhar gave a good account, but he does not relate to this film. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haar) in Tashan? Why is the cool song Ding Dance Maare absent on Anil Kapoor when he is crazy in English? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar - the saving grace of the film. But he is in his stereotypical me. You do not mind to miss this movie.
