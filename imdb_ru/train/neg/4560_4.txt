Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment to me. While the actors have done a pretty good job, especially Smith, there is simply no cure for a bad script when it is shot. The film did have a sense of "sequel" playing from the partial events of the first film. In short, the story was ... bad at best. It was not well thought out, and at times it seemed very changeable and inconsistent. <br /> <br /> In the first film, the MIB organization had a kind of “elite” sense of power. You had a few special agents, and they had a “secret” feeling. In the future, the MIB organization has the atmosphere JROTC Summer Camp. <br /> <br /> The film was not terrible or something like that ... it just lacked the “coolness” (due to the lack of a better phrase) of the first movie. Much of the same old humor was reworked from first to second, and in fact did not add any originality to the MIB universe. <br /> <br /> Episode 1 for the first 3 films would be a great analogy. Was it decent? Yeah. Should I wear his title? Not really.
