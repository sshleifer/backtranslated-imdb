The screenplay for this film Colombo seemed to be pulled straight from the juicy opera of the 1980s. Films that are deeply controlled by characters are great, but only if the characters are irresistible. And in this film the only thing that convincingly was my desire to change the channel. The villainâ€™s dialogue sounds like it was written by a romance novelist. The great Lieutenant Colombo himself is not somewhere near his famous, sweet, self-deprecating, crumpled; and the victim of a bride / kidnapping is a whimper, a one-dimensional girl in trouble (she is in fear of a tiny scalpel fragile in the hands of her captor - come on !!! I could knock the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in you know that in 2 seconds ). In any sense of reality, this character would have to at least try to fight or fight back at least a little. And speaking of reality ... the story revolves around an abduction that works and is decided by the police. Police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI is taking EVERY kidnapping case. It was NO Colombo, just a petty and completely predictable crime drama with our friend Lieutenant Colombo written for 2 hours.
