National Lampoon was once a fun magazine. Did you enjoy the stone hippie days in the late sixties, or the smug and audacious days of the seventies belltower (when the comedy was enriched with many naked babies) very much depends on your date of birth, but everyone agrees that In the early eighties, the average age destroyed those anarchic sparks humor, which the narcotics didn’t have, and proposals such as this film and increasingly horrible side recordings, pierced further holes in the body. In addition to the well-illustrated sequence of headlines, absolutely nothing can be recommended to this unusually depressing skunk. If you go through a difficult debut segment “Grow Yourself”, hoping that things will get better, you will not be lucky - they will not. Whoever thought that the idea of ​​brutal rape of a woman with a stick of butter was comedic gold, deserving that his head was returned to him on a dish from a dog mess. If there ever will be a global shortage of mediators, then the negatives of this disjointed disjointed torn bag with dirty ideas and terrible speeches may well serve some purpose.
