This film is a very bad attempt to make money using a classic theme. I used to love Superman movies, but this one made me want to shoot myself. Very bad game, outrageous special effects and a plot equal to zero. To summarize: Superman leaves the earth because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (spirit), says nothing to his girlfriend before leaving (again), takes off on a spaceship (?!?) that 5 years later, and I look forward to the opportunity to communicate again with my girlfriend (who is now demolishing her son, and my son, in my humble opinion, is at least 7 years old). What about Lex Luthor? Trying to grow a new continent to sell land? You are welcome! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 out of 10 for this film, just because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have something else related to your time, do not watch this film and even if you are more nothing to do, stay home and watch tv!
