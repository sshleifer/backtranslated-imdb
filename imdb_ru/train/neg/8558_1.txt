This movie was just awful, I even feel uncomfortable calling it a movie. This is a typical Mumblecore movie, with a zero plot and a bunch of aimless and whiny twenty things stumbling around trying to "figure it out." I tried to give Mumblecore a chance, but honestly, this is just awful. <br /> <br /> I’m out of sync with movies, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies of all time. Therefore, I do not mind if the film will be shot cheaply, if there is some (ANY) substance in it. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is terrible: acting, script (or was it all improvised?) Direction, but most importantly, above all, the camera work was just nonsense. The camera has never been logical anywhere, there was no consistency. I have to admit that I was a guy who, as I heard, there was nudity in this film, so I thought well, even if it’s terrible, at least there is nudity (yes, I know, I'm a moron). Well, thanks to the supernatural filming work that you never really see, and what you see, TRUST FOR ME - YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE. This film made me want to vomit on many levels. <br /> <br /> Dialogue made me want to vomit, camera work made me want to vomit, but mostly the idea that this film was rated by some legitimate critics Well, now that I’m sick most of all.
