I remember a certain Tuesday morning of June 18, 2002, to be exact. I dozed off, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when there was a terrifying explosion. I went to the kitchen, where I had a view of several blocks in southern Jerusalem, and saw a column of smoke rising from a distant point, the sight of smoke was accompanied a minute later by the roar of sirens. I remember how I hurried to my bedroom, took out my binoculars, rushed back to the kitchen and saw an image of a broken bus. The bus was still near the pickup station, where a terrorist got on him and with one click on the TNT device killed 25 passengers, many of whom were heading to school. My good friend’s wife was sitting on the back of the bus, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. <br /> <br /> I’m sure every Israeli has at least one terrorist. There are memories associated with him that he would never want to have, and it was only a matter of time when someone made a film about it. As it turned out, the film was supposed to be a depressed memory of itself. <br /> <br /> A film about a play-play on a trial performance by Haim Buzaglo (depicted by Hmmm, Haim Buzaglo, who also wrote and directed the film), who spends most of his day conducting spectacular contests with his empty text editor page. . Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a reporter for an Israeli commercial channel, decides to write an article about a former army officer who has a duty. Buzaglo, bored and slightly paranoid due to what is medically known as the “what the hell is this hot babe meets me” syndrome, asks the private eye to do a breakdown with his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As the detective progresses in his investigation, his observations penetrate into the play, and then into the lives of its actors. In the meantime, the play turns from a comic play into an indictment against the alienation of Israeli society. As for the film, well, the film becomes an exercise in insane editing, enclosed in small cardboard characters and unreliable dialogues, while away from the object with which he originally had to deal. <br /> <br /> When I say “cardboard characters,” I mean characters who, under the obsession of the author / director with a “meaningful” film, were deprived of any genuine dialogue and any piece of reliability. I will not elaborate on this. Suffice it to say that I am sure that homeless, barefoot male prostitutes rarely go to the theater. With the intention to see the play, that is. <br /> <br /> This film, according to Chaim Buzaglo himself, is the first part of the modern agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be based on experience similar to the one I wrote about at the beginning of my review, unlike the solitary world of heroes that are not in the world, and the plot, which is not at all convincing. 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> ps This film has become a guide to savings. He was shot in ten days, all the actors worked for free, and the total cost of the film was about 12,000 dollars (no, I did not drop a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). Makes you wonder why it took $ 34,000 to complete the project of the Witch Blair.
