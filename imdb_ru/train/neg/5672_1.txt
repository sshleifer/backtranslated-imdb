I am ashamed to have this film in my collection. The most useful factor for owning a DVD is a short film with bonus features. My vote for this film is big fat zero. Don't get me wrong, I'm a terrible girl. but I want some meat for the story, not to mention the fact that I prefer evil to happen to people, and not be deceived by watching what seemed to be, forever, clips of a snuffing animal. Acts of cruelty interrupt painfully long silence and a bad game. If I was forced to compare with another film, the only thing that comes to mind is the Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, meaningless and completely uncomfortable hours.
