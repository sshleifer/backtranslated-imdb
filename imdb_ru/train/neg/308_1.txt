Simple thoughts about “Going Overboard” (aka “Babes Ahoy”) make me cry. Throwing yourself out the window would be better than watching this movie. This is not even the intended film "so bad, it's good." I would spend money to buy copies of this film and burn them so people can't see them. Oh pain, pain ...
