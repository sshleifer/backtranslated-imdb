<br /> <br /> Even in his youth, the old man wanted to marry his cousin, but his family forbade it. After many decades, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon the sister gets bored with brother No. 1, and she jumps on Brother No. 2â€™s bed. <br /> <br /> You might think that three brothers and sisters were stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no - they are Europeans from the upper class who go to college and are engaged in the social world. <br /> <br /> We will never see a flirtatious moment between any unrelated woman and two brothers. We never see any flirtatious moment between any unrelated man and one sister. All flirty moments are shared only between brothers and sister. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of the GLADIATOR is incest. The young emperor Commodus will have hundreds of slaves and a city full of girls everywhere obsessed with marriage, but no - does he need only his sister? If the film incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE (slowly) will excite you indefinitely.
