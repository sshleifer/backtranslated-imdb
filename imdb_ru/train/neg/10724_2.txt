This is an excellent example of the fact that something great is terribly bad ... therefore, can I advise anyone to see this? Well, I was somehow obliged to the fact that he participated in the tiff contest (I still can not believe that he won) .. and I stayed only until the end, because the director was there for questions and answers. but it is also anything but interesting .. what is it about? Well, the first half (worth seeing one) represents three characters: a prostitute, a musician and some official .. the first two lie about their profession .. but the third is a real liar .. the second half (to do something different .. will not spoil a good evening) includes old breasts and drunkenness ... but maybe you will see that this is quite different ... the jury pestered (did they drink vodka?)
