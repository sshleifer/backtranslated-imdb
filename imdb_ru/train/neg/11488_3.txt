It is hard to imagine that someone could find this short pet if he saw most of his shorts, but I know that humor is VERY subjective. I saw all of their sound shorts (by far the best of their IMO stuff), and I found this one of their weaker efforts. <br /> <br /> In the year when it was done (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one feature. They were extremely popular, and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage of the fact that he was constantly working. In addition, it was a time of experimentation for writers and Stan. I would say that it was an experiment that really did not work. As someone else said, it does not play into their hands. Too much dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The best part of it for me is a largely improvised sequence with Stan when the maid Agnes and the great Thelma Todd talk about "girlish" things. <br /> If you really want to see the boys in their most creative and fun game Blotto or Brats From that year. <br /> <br /> They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for getting a little less than the nominal shorts. They did something like 108 films in general. Very few (except those made in FOX) were frank failures, but there are some. County Hospital, Me and my buddy, Alive Ghost, Top of Fixer come to mind as essentially weak. But besides those whom I find something remarkable in all their shorts. Not a bad entry in my book. <br /> <br /> If you saw and enjoyed all of their other shorts, be sure to check out this one, but I would be willing to bet that this one was less memorable to Stan. and baby.
