Honestly, I am surprised by the positive voices this film received. The film simply stretches for its 81-minute lifespan, and viewers must endure all the way. In fact, there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spreadling gives a decent performance. She is given a rather pitiful dialogue, and she copes with it quite well. Scott Valentine (a friend of Merriedet at Family Ties), on the other hand, is a rather rough watch. I assume that the highlight of his work is the evidence that the guy was lying on the beach wearing tiger-pattern ties ... let me rest. In addition, Valentine gives us a boorish and miserable image of a suffering vampire who misses the day (to see a much more convincing performance of a suffering vampire, see Denis Duff in “Blood Storm: Subtype 4”). The film is moving so slowly and only positively accented and, frankly, the dance scenes of Charlie Spredling. Honestly, this film can only be recommended to diligent Charlie Spredling fans (which I am, and I still hardly watched it!).
