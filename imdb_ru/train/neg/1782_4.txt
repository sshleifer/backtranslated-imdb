The charming boy and his mother are moving to nowhere, and soon they are followed by cats and death. It is like this. <br /> <br /> I admit that after watching this movie I'm a little scared by the cats. But, despite all the seriousness, despite the many things that are wrong in this film, and believe me, there is a lot that can be bypassed, itâ€™s generally a very pleasant viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Characters are more like caricatures here only with their basic instincts, which you can rely on. Fear, greed, lust for pride or anger, it seems everything that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that this seemingly untenable, in fact, serves as a story telling. The supernatural premise and the fact that this is the Stephen King script (not that I have something specific against Mr. King) is rather pleasantly supported by some interesting works on Forex, make-up and quite suitable music. The undoubted jewel of this film is without a doubt Alice Creg, who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother. <br /> <br /> King managed to tell a simple story about an outsider or people who are a little different (in this case, a lot), trying to fit into it and turn it into a camp on top of a small jewel of horrors that should be in any collection horror fan
