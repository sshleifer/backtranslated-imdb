This film was an absolute torture. First of all, it's a whopping 4 hours! True, the Kargilov war could have several points that were captured and fought, but it was not necessary to show each of these battles. So perhaps this is a documentary and not a commercial film as advertised. Of course, this did not seem to be, as not enough information was provided, and there were some flaws. The sequences of battles were so poorly executed. I am terribly disappointed with the man who gave the well-done episodes in Border. Each battle was the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This may be a spoiler.) The whole army marches up the hill, five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each (they also use the same key every time), one of the main actors is shot, someone shouts on a stretcher, an actor says no, don't carry a stretcher. It takes 6 people from the battalion, and then the actor dies. The same thing happens again and again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the film is too big for his own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters was well developed. The actresses had the most minor roles. They are all dressed and depicted the same. Two of them wept in sync. It was so funny. They simultaneously moved their hands and heads, and then bit their dupatta. <br /> <br /> This list goes on and on. I know that I still forget something. Anyway, I think I broke the film enough for you to get the picture.
