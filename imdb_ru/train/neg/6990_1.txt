What the hell is this? This is one of the most stupid films I've ever seen. I don't understand why people on this site love it so much. It is meaningless & nakedness without reason. This is worse than Resident Evil. I strongly do not recommend it if you do not want to watch chess, bad acting nonsense. Watch real horror movies such as Stephen Kings, The Shining, Jurassic Park (JAWS, etc.). This is bad, like Croudy vs. Gason. The assault of killer tomatoes is better than this crap. <br /> <br /> Oh, wow, meat eats zombies. How many damn movies about Zooby we need. Skip this one. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
