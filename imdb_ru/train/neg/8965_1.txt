This is largely a low-budget, televised type of film designed to capitalize on the success of the original. I'm a fan of b-films, and this one might have been good if they hadn't attached the name “Cube” to it, because, as it is, the director and plot of the original were better, and this movie almost spoiled my taste for the whole series. Characters are annoying and cliché, there are problems with continuity, as well as a few overt mistakes. History is unlikely to get a chance to develop due to unnecessary dialogue and suffers from this. They more or less use the same horror tricks over and over again throughout the film, and since the first film was so good, it just disappoints. <br /> <br /> If it was a separate b-film, I would probably give about four. The “1” rating I give was largely a statement of how he completely turned pale in its effects and intelligence compared to the first.
