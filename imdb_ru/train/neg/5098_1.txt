It should be one of the best overpriced anime shows. And yes, they even showed me the “End of Evangelion,” and it still made me hate him even more. Not to mention the countless robberies of this show! <br /> <br /> I don’t mind psychological and philosophical untertons, but the Evangelion drags him into the dirt like nothing else! Not many characters seemed very interesting. The only ones that seemed interesting to me were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. In addition, basically all the others were a bunch of whiny losers. They need to go to a psychiatric center, and not to pilot giant robots against aliens, called "angels." <br /> <br /> Even the furs and alien fights did not help at all. Something like this happens: <br /> <br /> “Well, there are these robots, and they are really cool, because they bleed (!) When they are hurt, but in reality they are not swords, but captured angels, so sometimes they go crazy and don't do what minor pilots want, and they need to be controlled better ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm very sorry, but I just can not recommend Evangelion to anyone, Anime otaku or not. Those who love this series very much, it’s good that you have the right to this opinion, I respect you. But who has the mad mind obsession to think that everyone will like this series, you are more an egoist. <br /> <br /> I prefer Macross, Mospad, Run. -Dim and Robot Taekwon V "himself.
