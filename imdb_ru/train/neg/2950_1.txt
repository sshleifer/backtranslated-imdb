I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision at TNT. Even he could not make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I watched it to the end was because I was teaching video and wanted my students to never do anything so bad ... but it took me all my stamina in the bowels to get through it. Itâ€™s like watching your great-grandmother flirt with a 15-year-old boy ... painfully painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the film, dipped it in paint thinner, and then watched it would be more interesting. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the S-Mart bin, get away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.
