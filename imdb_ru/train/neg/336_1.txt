Why when a star reaches the top of the star chain, do they destroy all the good work by making a bad film? Burt Reynolds peaked, then began making horrible machine clicks on Hal Needham. Arnold Schwarzenegger has become the most popular property in Hollywood, only to laugh at himself with the terrifying Last Action Hero. And now, the talkative Eddie Murphy erases memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this “family” adventure film, which is incredibly tedious, childish and generally terrible misfire, in which the chance to see Charlotte Lewis’s big breasts in a narrow blouse an attractive aspect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure. This concerns the social worker Murphy, whom the mysterious types contacted and said that he is the Chosen One. Chosen for what, I hear, you ask. His task is to save a Tibetan boy with mystical abilities from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, the cool actor Charles Dans looks terribly embarrassed when he hits the movie, but hey, I’m sure he was well paid for donating his talents. Of all the movies, Murphy is easily the worst. I read some reviews that suggest that it’s nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a film that is not a formula, and although both of these points of view are untrue, there is no forgiveness for the fact that the film is atypical and not formal. maybe - this is an absolute load of garbage. <br /> <br />
