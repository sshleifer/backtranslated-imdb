This film was recently released on DVD in the USA, and I finally got a chance to see this gem that is hard to find. It was even accompanied by original theatrical announcements of other Italian classic horror films, such as SPASMO and OUT OF DARK. Unfortunately, the previews were the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> “ZOMBI 3” in a bizarre way is actually associated with the notorious Lucio Fulci franchise “ZOMBIE”, which began in 1979. Similarly, in comparison with “ZOMBIE”, “ZOMBI 3” consists of a worn out plot and several very bad actors who barely keep this “terrible” trash afloat. The mountain almost does not exist (if you don’t be afraid of people running around with green moss on faces), and English dubbing is a step below embarrassing. <br /> <br /> This time the plot involves some kind of covert military operation with a group of inept scientists (that is, an idiotic man and his stupid feminine side) develop some kind of chemical called "Death One", which must to revive the dead. If you don’t need to check my ears, I don’t even remember the REASON for exploring “Death One.” It seems to EXIST only to harm the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing a star in this cinematic laughter fest. <br /> <br /> In any case, Death One is experimenting with a corpse (of which I swear looked like Yul Brynner), and after it is entered into his system, he sits up straight and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite funny - because the face of the corpse is bubbling with green mucus, you can hear the sound of “crumpling the paper. The toxin “Death One” is taken out, and a group of thieves “drive into it”, with which it is possible to end it, but infects itself by cutting itself on an open bottle. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the guy turns into a zombie, but not before he escapes to a cheap motel in time, infects a sloppy porter and kills the maid, pushing her face into the bathroom mirror (!). The military will find out about this and take immediate action before “eliminating” all those who are not lucky enough to be in the “pollution zone” and turn the motel upside down. They find an infected thief and burn his body, only so that the smoke infects a flock of birds that fly over the chimney (!). <br /> <br /> We are cutting down a group of men who are on leave from the army, listening to the “cool music” that comes out of the little stupefying boom box, while trudging from the trailer with a bunch of naughty girls who pop out of windows and boast their chests. Can someone say "zombie food"? We also have a story with the participation of the girl and her boyfriend driving the car, who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road ... the same birds that were infected with zombie smoke! <br /> <br /> Birds attack the guy, and the girl leaves the desert gas station in search of water. This is one of the most incredibly fun moments of the film. She walks through this old dirty, rusty and obviously abandoned building, where she continues to loudly ask: "HELLO? HERE NO HERE? PLEASE, I JUST NEED SOME WATER! ”She meets a group of zombies, one of which is chained to the wall (!), And the other is waving a machete. After a small rumbling and somersaulting on the ground, she runs away, but not before, than to blow up the gas station with a lighter. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, birds are attacking a trailer loaded with whores, and one girl is being pecked and infected. All of them drive up to the same motel where the initial infection occurred, and this is where the second funniest moment of the movie takes place. After a few hours (at the most day), the same motel is now covered in dust, there are vines growing on it, and it looks like it has been abandoned for many years. In any case, what could be better than this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to crumble when several people leave together to get stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third funniest moment concerns the man and woman who explore the desert village, about which the woman says: “THIS PLACE IS THE DUMA!” Then she starts to push the zombies out of the balcony into the water filled with piranha (? ), Where her bite off her legs and after a few seconds she turns into a zombie! Meanwhile, her friend at the motel, who was injured and infected with HOURS earlier, is still turning into a zombie! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in this film there are too many discrepancies that make this film too stupid for words, for example, the time during which the “zombie” infected people vary greatly. Sometimes it takes seconds, and sometimes it takes hours. Some zombies run, others pull their legs and walk very slowly. Some even do Kung Fu movements, while others are hiding under the hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies are even talking! The funniest thing, of course, is the infamous “zombie head in the fridge” gag, which “rises” in the air and “attacks” a stupid person who goes in search of food. Oddly enough, his girlfriend breaks her throat from her “headless” partner (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> But the biggest disappointment for me was the lack of plots involving people who are in fact killed by zombies. We will never see that they are returning as zombies, in fact, we see that the “zombies” are those who are pecked by birds, and one girl whose legs are bitten off. Other than that, I at least expected the couple that was killed in the kitchen, and / or the guy who was killed on the bridge, would return as zombies. It is also surprising that these zombies only “bite” and then move on to the next victim. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous moment was, of course, the fruit of a zombie. Infected pregnant woman lying on the bed in the hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of "medical knowledge" is trying to give birth to a child (!), And the zombie tears off her face before her head is pushed into the belly of a woman, where the hand breaks out and continues to tear the rest of her face. Eternal! <br /> <br /> As usual, all the characters are the ideal stereotypes of this genre. A military officer suffering from delusions of grandeur, pathetic useless shrill women who scream about being killed, obvious characters who want to be killed (that is, watching a man chasing a chicken!) There were a lot of ridiculous scenes such as a shed, which was blown up with the help of a hand grenade (obviously, the scene on which the entire budget was spent), and the climate scene, where a person shouts: “I LOVE ... BLOOD!”. The costumes are really bad - the same zombies appear throughout film dressed in the same “Asian clothes that can be found in the Bruce Lee movie, and watch the blue skirt of the 60s, which the girl in the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend come across an infected man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the door open like usually for an apocalyptic storyline. A radio DJ who narrates throughout the entire movie turns out to be the zombie himself and warns his listeners about the “beginning of the end” while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. This is hardly the material "DAWN OF THE DEAD", if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Despite this, this film causes a lot of laughter. The blood is minimal, and the fact that there is very unconvincing, not to mention the fact not to invent. A common blend of black blood, thick green mucus oozing from weeping ulcers, and “zombie makeup” consisting of green moss. ZOMBI 3 is a good rental for an overnight party or nights of beer and popcorn. In addition, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
