Shamelessly ambitious fiction from Kerry Conran, for whom this is clearly a labor of love. Unfortunately, this is not so good. It all starts quite well - with an epic, but restrained score, a mixture of editing the style of Lukas and Hitchcock and Spielberg's glossy cinematography. The film also mentions a multitude of science fiction novels, serials and films, such as “The Day the Earth Stopped”, “Superman”, “Metropolis”, “Planet of the Apes”, “Iron Giant”, “Star Wars” and “Spy, who loved me. " The film, however, cannot be as good as any of those, for several reasons: the main thing is that it is such a labor of love, so connected with throwing everything on the screen and creating a bold new world, Conran actually forgets about making a movie . There is practically no tension, atmosphere or magic, despite the air battles, dinosaurs and the set-race against time. Even the elements of noir are not successful. Although this is a broad view of things - these elements basically fail, because nothing seems completely real and so clearly false - the green screen looks halfway up as a video game, and it’s obvious that the actors were inserted later, the actors can also do little - Jude Low Wood, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and all this because of the terrible scenario - the kind that should explain almost everything. This is a worthy experience, and some may feel a sense of nostalgia, but ultimately it is a meaningless step into the world of yesterday. Good ending, though.
