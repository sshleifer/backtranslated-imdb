This is one of the silliest films I've ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected this after seeing the first two, but I continue to get involved in these types of films with the idea “Maybe they did it right this time.” No, not even close. <br /> <br /> How to start? How about special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what is suitable for SFX in this film, at some point a soldier shoots Raptor when he runs down the hall. Even if the screen is less than a second, the viewer can easily see that this is just a man with a tail, clearly attached to him and running around. Bad, bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> How about a game? If this is what you can call it. There is one character who, I believe, must be from the south. However, having lived for six years in the south, I have never heard such a conversation. Perhaps he has some strange disability - inability to speak normally. I find it surprising that the character does not do anything that requires such an accent from him - so the actor had no reason to try to do it. <br /> <br /> How about the plot? It's pretty simple - predators run away, people with guns must hunt them down. I begin to wonder why the dinosaurs in these films always seem to collide with the nearest tunnel system ... will they really stay outside to hunt prey? Well, okay, at least they have the common sense to appear very little in the film, which supposedly revolves around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - let's say you are in a building and you know that there is a person who eats predators running around in it. Would you decide to take time out to argue about who is better: military or naval? And then they decided to arrange an arm wrestling competition? How about the idiotic idea that they have to track down predators - divided into groups of two. Have they never watched horror movies (or at least the Scooby-Doo episode)? In short, this is one of the stupid movies. Skip this if you don't want to moan at the movies.
