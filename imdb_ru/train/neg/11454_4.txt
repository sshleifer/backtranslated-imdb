So from the very beginning I didn’t expect this film to start, but it didn’t even justify them. while there were some funny parts, even one or two laughing loud parts, this film was terribly inconsistent with what I would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and ended very quickly, and we sat there and said: “Just what happened?” In addition, there were several anecdotes that simply dragged on and on. the part where he falls from the mountain made me yawn. In addition, editing really was not enough. There were some bad scene transitions, but this seems to be the style at the moment. It made me laugh, but I would not watch it anymore, and I am very glad that I waited for its lease. give him a chance, you may like it, but do not think that something is waiting for you on the model of a 40-year-old virgin or Superbad
