absolutely trash. I liked Halloween, and since then Johnny has been in a downward spiral. it's about pits. we get it, john. provocateurs are scary! You don't need to make a shitty movie that the hell bothers me to “tell” me. <br /> <br /> It’s already far away. It feels like John has nothing to work on here. to his credit, it appears that he did not write this trash. There are countless cases where the camera just sits and waits, when the actors look stupid or say something stupid. I love the long cut. It’s a pity that the carpenter doesn’t know how to use it. he needs to get close to Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop fooling yourself and bore me to death!
