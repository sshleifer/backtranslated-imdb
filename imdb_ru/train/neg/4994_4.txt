Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you are not in the mood for it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, not thinking about simple actions when I watched it. It started well and was pretty interesting, so why a bad review. Well, in the end, the film lost confidence. The storyline was not so stupid, the action was not too special, but overall good, the acting was fine, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But everything got worse because something excessive happened, and this left me with a bad feeling. They should have made a little more effort to make everything trustworthy, and they would get 7 in the “not thinking, just an act” category. So in conclusion, if you know, you will be annoyed because things happen that seem completely illogical: do not look! otherwise I would say, go ahead ...
