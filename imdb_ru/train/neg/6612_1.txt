I downloaded this movie yesterday via the website. The quality was pretty good! I watched the film with high expectations (although I knew it was a failure), especially since in the film the superstar Amitabh Bachchan plays the role of a villain. Although, at least, such actors as he could play a certain role. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan did not manage to make an impression of a villain, it proved that no one can compete with the AMJAD KHAN Rgv magic test to rotate the past! Sholay, the old - a milestone in Indian cinema with the participation of all the stars, a cult dialogue, stylish cinema and a great soundtrack, which is still a hit for current generations. A good actor such as TALANTY Ajay Devgan was wasted, and his performance was average. Prashant Raj, the newcomer does not know what acting is. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have, I donâ€™t know how she is still in the RGV film crew. Urmila and Abhishek in the song without excitement and passion Mohanlal tried his best, and Susmit Sen's work was good, and for some reason I liked the work in this film. It was a total massacre of the original Sholai.
