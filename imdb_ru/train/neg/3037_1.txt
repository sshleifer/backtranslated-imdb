This is one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance films, and I don’t see where all this “not-so-bad” garbage came from. Acting is terrible, it repeats the same storyline as all other "dancing" movies. It's horrible! The name should scream not to look. “As she moves. Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had half decent dance scenes, these don't even deserve a watch. I give him 1 out of 10, simply because there is no zero. I seriously beg anyone with an IQ of more than 60 not to watch or spend their money. 1.6 / 10 should say it all. This film should not even have been made.
