Despite the fact that the plot was very well detailed, and the storyline was clear, the fact that Stephen Seagals’s voice was voiced by someone else for most of the film was distressing because you were not sure who spoke. There were many parts where he began to speak in his deep hoarse voice, and then the next voice spoke for him. However, I don’t know the reason if he had problems with his voice during the production of the film, I think they could shoot events that did not contain his own voice when he recovered. I rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the movie. When someone pays for a movie, regardless of whether it goes to the cinema or on DVD, this movie is not worth the admission charge that is charged. I have been following Steven Seagal for a long time and all of his films that he has shot in recent years. To date, I think this is one of the worst we have ever seen.
