This film was filled with endless surprises! As soon as you thought it would not get any worse, they added more joints and more pink fuzzy-lined wagons with indecent sex scenes. As you can guess, I was a victim of the original version. We were deceived by watching this, thinking it was Supervan, the host machine that promised lazars, prison breaks and more. Who would have thought that a Dollar Store Christmas gift could be so fun!
