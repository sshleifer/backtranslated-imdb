Immediately after renting and watching this film several years ago, my friend and I decided that he defined an absolute zero in the scale of the film. There was nothing in the film that could be made worse than it was. To this day, we still value films, even very bad ones, by how much better they are than the Lonely Lady. <br /> <br /> Long ago, I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote scripts among other things, "Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife," and she said that she was asked to write a script for the book by Harold Robbins " Lonely lady. She said she sent the treatment, and it was rejected because they did not think she understood the difficulties of the writer in Hollywood. Then she said: "I think they have someone else to write this." The interview was filmed before the movie was released. She died in 1981, and I am sure that the first thing she did upon arriving in heaven was personally grateful to God for saving her from participating as a result.
