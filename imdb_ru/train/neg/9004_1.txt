Nothing could save this film, even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, the special effects would be awesome. Better direction could bring more sensations and better results from the actors. But nothing but the filing of the script dragon could not fix it. Holes in the plot, bad lines, terrible placement, endless repetitions of the same shot of a CGI dragon stomping through the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this in any way. <br /> <br />
