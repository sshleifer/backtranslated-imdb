This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas is not, but it is one of the best crime films. This movie should be viewed closer to STING Part2 or perhaps the Speed ​​Zone. Remember these gems! The only reason this film was made was to benefit from the cult following the original. This film lacked everything that De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked on so hard. There was no pleasant character, and it was the fault of everyone responsible for it. I hope that RISE TO POWER will win everything that is possible, and may even invent several new categories to allow it to become a record holder. After I watched this movie S @ * T FEST, I sat down and looked at the original way of Carlitos to get rid of the unpleasant taste. After seeing this, I would like Pachanga to come and save me from suffering.
