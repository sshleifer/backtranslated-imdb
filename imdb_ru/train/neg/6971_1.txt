Count Floyd appears every sixty seconds. Somehow they got together on the set of Steve Railsbek, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty, and they could not get to five miles, about eight kilometers, from a real movie. The boy makes this thing sucks. There is not a single original line, thought, shot or effect from a brainless opening sequence to brainless closing. The magic, unearthly Susan Anspach from five light pieces is boring. Steve Reilsbek - boring. John Vernon is boring. Big mistake is boring. If this is a scary movie, then “The Gang of Screams” is a documentary about gangster life. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie has its own explanation for its badness. Usually it is in the opening credits - “Author, director and producer” is one guy. Or, in the very center of action, something stupid, so incompetent, that you know that there is only one reason why this turkey was created. Here you will not find out until the very last of the loans, where cooperation with a dozen units of the Canadian government is gratefully acknowledged. <br /> <br /> Right now, I’m watching how MST perceives Beast of Yucca Flats to get a taste of the mouth. God, what an improvement.
