The film is very long and, unfortunately, very different from the novel. If you want to watch a movie, do not read the novel first, because it shocks you. However, the cinematography was fine, and if you are a person who loves the genres of adventure that explore Africa, do it. Acting is adequate, but many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was searching for his missing brother, not a woman in search of his father. Gagul was cunning and was killed in a cave, whereas here it seemed to her that she was a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
