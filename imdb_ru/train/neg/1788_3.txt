Paying tribute, only the technician, costumes and costumes deserve all praise. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career in Paramount. The script is as clumsy as you can imagine, and neither the occasional Bing, nor William Bendix, nor Sir Cedric Hardwick can do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks very stupid in the page boy wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a heroine in the role of a costume, demanding from her a delighted look at Bing and a little different, except for humming a couple of boring ballads in her voice, which will probably sound on this occasion. <br /> <br /> Just awful! The intelligence of Mark Twain does not appear in any of the scenarios. Only loyal fans of Crosby can appreciate this mess of the film, given the uninspired guide. Even the extras look like they don't know what they should do. <br /> <br /> Summing up: boring, like water. Not recommended even for children.
