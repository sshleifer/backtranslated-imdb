We loved the School of Rock and Jack Black. We could not wait to go and see this movie. It was the only time in my life when the film was so bad that I wanted to leave. My husband also hated it. The only funny details were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand near the cinema and tell people to save money. The letter was terrible. It was all the terrible stereotype of Hispanics, who had to be completely offended. The film was not so long, but it seemed like an eternity to us. People in the theater were so restless and silent that it looked like dry paint. I made my husband stay, because I was sure that there might be some redemptive parts, but there was no Save your money and your time.
