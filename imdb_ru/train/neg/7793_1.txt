This is truly one of the worst films in history. I consider myself a HUGE fan of zombie films and usually tolerate bad deeds, lame "special effects", a stupid story and everything that you can see in second-rate movies, LONGER. The movie has a good atmosphere / history / suspension or all that can be offered. . This basically has no positive aspect, and this is the third or fourth level, perhaps worse. Some of my friends and I made a small film during the week-long vacation and definitely did a better job (but not a film about zombies). <br /> <br /> This movie is not even funny, let alone something else. Really bad and unnecessary special effects, zombies that look like normal people (with the exception of white extra skin stretched on their faces), WAY TO A LOT of fake blood (I like realism very much, the combination of realism and zombie films is doubtful, but the presented blood is just stupid) The camera stays quite long with the feeding scenes, it gets boring, and you can't help but wonder why zombies are using WEAPONS (!) To kill their prey. I will not go into the details of dubbing (others did). Although I am from Germany and at least a little interested in the original version, I will NOT spend more time on this film. <br /> <br /> Stay away from him as far as possible.
