I read reviews that you obviously had to study in a very strict British school in the 1960s in order to understand this. Maybe it's true, if so, then this film is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* WARNING ABOUT SPOILER *********************** ************** The ending has the same meaning as all children who are anti-government and anti-corporate without any Best solution that does not set fire to the society of Mad Max. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters can go, but they do not. The reasons for which they go about this, do not make sense. Not enough character development to explain why. What should mean the execution of a handful of innocent people is never explained or even hinted at. It is mentioned that war is the last creative expression, quite possibly the only discovery that any characters in this film have, and there is no point in it. <br /> <br /> Characters who go to kill, do not fight the institution, they just kill people. I thought they could use all the explosives to blow up the place, or at least the sanctuary at the end, it would have more symbolic meaning, but they did not. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This film is a teenager's dream of fighting the power that plagues them, although in reality they need it. He has no moral, symbolic truth or meaning; This film simply plays the fantasy of killing teachers and people in “power” that annoy you. <br /> <br /> If you think murder frenzy / school shooting, similar to the techniques of Columbine or Virginia, is a rational and sensible way. Understand the teachers and institutions you don’t like, then I think you will like this movie . If you are like me and are working to make a life for yourself, and not just blindly (very blindly in this film) to rebel against the “man”, this film is juvenile and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also say in part that there was a lack of funding, and there seemed to be a sense of attention deficit in this story. <br /> <br /> In general, it looks like a very rough outline of what could be Good, a film, but no effort is put into the dialogue, character development, or morality, so this is just ... poorly done. <br /> <br /> If ... only I can get my two hours back.
