The DVD was a joke, the sound for the first few minutes was terrible with an asynchronous sound, and Segal's voice was not even his !!!! Pathetic! When audio synchronization became better in 5 minutes, the bad plot, roles and actors had to get another job, because the movie business is not where any of them should be. <br /> <br /> Although Segal had good films in the early days, the last jokes, and this should be an embarrassment for him and the company that made it. <br /> <br /> If Seagal was the one who did this, it would be better for him to return to ensuring that the other party runs the show, because he does not have the talent that is ever in it. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete embarrassment for all involved in its production and shame for all who watched it. I turned it off after about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll ask my money back to Block Buster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
