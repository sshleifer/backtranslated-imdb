(This is a review of a later English version of Disney featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and others.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this film to be good. Really very. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews of this early film about Miyazaki, I could not wait to see it. But I was shocked, shocked, I say, by the quality of this film. These later films boast well thought out plots, three-dimensional characters and the best movie music since ... well ... ever. This movie just does not fit. <br /> <br /> However, you can start with positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, this film is still very creative, with bizarre fantasy / science fiction in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by insect species. Nausicaa also boasts excellent animation of other films of its time. (although not as beautifully and smoothly as in later Miyazaki films) And the English dubbing is pretty well done. <br /> <br /> But this film ... just ... not ... good ... All the characters are cardboard - from the sweet, sweet little Nausika, to the ruthless evil Tolmek people and everyone in between. As soon as you saw each of them within 30 seconds, you saw all that is. And the fact that the plot just walks does not help. <br /> <br /> Then there is the music ... Now, Hisaichi transmits my favorite film composer, but Nausika does not make it fair. Half the music is an 80's keyboard overload, and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visual effects, but does not help them. I very much suspect that Hisaichi was told to write a lot of music even before he saw the picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! There is a great message with this movie, right ?! Let's all save the environment! It is a pity that this film hits you in the head like a sledgehammer. There is a scene in which Nausika hugs a tree. No, really. I am not kidding. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a little sad to say how this movie sucks. But for some reason all the other IMDb reviews seem to adore him. And when characters have to talk to themselves in long sentences to tell you what's going on, it's lame. <br /> <br /> If you are the person who worships anime, loves the music of the 80s and plants a tree every day, Arbor you will surely like this movie. If not, save money on his later films, because they play a lot of time.
