Films of Antonioni did not grow old very well. What always surprises me about them is that, besides the undoubted plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations. For example, recall the conversations between Mastroianni and the “evil capitalist” who wants to sing him in “La notte”, or Monica Vitti, laughing at the peasants flirting on the train in “La aventura”, or Ferzetti, dropping a glass of ink at the end of the same film . <br /> <br /> I reviewed Zabriskie Point yesterday. In this film, many good and carefully thought-out photographs of Rod Taylor's office, streets and highways of Los Angeles, advertisements, deserts, etc., which show the author's admiration in his American journey, in the same way than Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are too many hippie-left cliches that spoil the film: - A boy leaves the meeting, steals a plane and flies over the desert to free himself and find "something else." - The leaders in the gray apartment all the time talking about speculation. - The girl looks at the "object woman" in the pool and leaves, because she wants not to be like them. - A couple full of middle class in a caravan says before the beauty of nature that builds a hotel and earns a lot of money. - Last but not least, a lot of couples making love in the desert. What is the banality of hippies! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, half a century after the “revolution” in “La Aventura”, we see that the king has a goal and his films (except for “Le amiche” and, perhaps, “Il grido”) is just a handful of aestheticism and common places.
