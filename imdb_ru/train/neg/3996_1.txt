I don't see what everyone liked about this movie. The installation was too long and talkative, and when it was done, the main character remained as flat and opaque as he was in the first scene. After the movie finally brought Cusack to the hotel room of the same name, I had to wonder what would happen here during the next hour or so that I was busy. Answer: not really, just John Cusack has a long, protracted mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Cusack's character was deeper. perhaps if his psycho were more thoroughly reworking his daily life. , perhaps, if the film or better developed its semi-burnt themes about loss and faith or did not link them in the first place. Perhaps, if the film made a choice to be either a psychological horror or a thrill horror and fully embraced one of these styles. , , I dont know. All I know is that I saw this film with two other horror lovers, and none of us liked it. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a disturbing episode on a hotel ledge, an alarming crazy lady with a hammer and a crypt keeper, it was so silly to have fun in the duct, all three of which took no more than five minutes of screen time, this film was a bore. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and uses them here for a much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas from himself?
