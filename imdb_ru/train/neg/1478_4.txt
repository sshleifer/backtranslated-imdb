this movie has its advantages: hot chicks are dying <br /> <br /> the problem ... hot barley of chickens is exposed, and you don’t see how many people die, mostly just a lot of quick movements and screaming, although there were two good murder scenes. <br /> <br /> Also for those of you who watch this for JANNA JAMES, she’s just a third-party character with a very small role and minor nude scenes. <br /> /> What this film needs ... the script and the story would be good, but I will not complain about it .. in other words, he needs more nudity and better kill the scenes, because let's face it, therefore we watch these films ... <br /> <br /> I would not spend my money on it ... and, if necessary, wait until they appear on the old shelves in your local video store.
