There are several previous comments in which there is an opinion about the abundance of cliches in this entire film - and I fully agree, both in terms of the characters and in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I read about the terrible Elizabeth Berkley's performance in the equally terrible Showgirls, which I have never seen - and her performance here, although not terrible, barely meets the standards of the worst Lifetime fare. There was not the slightest hint of depth in her character, but it probably should not have been. If this is so, it would lead to an imbalance of the film, since there was not a hint of depth or charisma — not a trace — not a single character, performer, or image. <br /> <br /> The Director’s consideration of Liz’s initial complaint after her student kissed her in the hall was ridiculous. Her husband’s initial reaction and advice was the same (Forrest Gump, who attacked Jenny’s boy in his car, provided a more realistic, smarter action, and, damn it, he was mentally retarded). <br /> <br /> A smart, reckless attorney (sorry for being redundant) the father of a deceitful student actually did something, perhaps worthy of praise in his speech: he was both ridiculous and completely annoying, not in vain. Her lawyer was more like an unfeeling nerd, also unknown by profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and, to be honest, I rather liked this part), the police gathered so insensitive assholes that you rather rely on Barney Fife, without Andy, to cope with all law enforcement agencies and investigations in your community . I know that the majority of real policemen lack the acuteness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by the majority of characters in the Law and Order series, and the like - but the stupidity of this level seems to be Life during the whole life. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a kind of “history in history,” enthralled by what Josh had invented that he was the “victim” of his teacher. This script execution in history was even worse than its overall execution in the main story. It was something of an achievement, for example, moving from “F” to “F-minus”. <br /> <br /> This whole awkward situation had to be resolved - in real life - approximately 15 minutes after a realistic meeting. between the teacher and the school administration, with the participation of her husband. But then it would prevent the invented drama and leave an empty film in the camera. <br /> <br /> But writers who have proven their end could make things worse. When the situation was finally “resolved” and “corrected”, it was completed within about 45 seconds, without indicating what measures could be taken in any “real world” context for the offender and his parents, or were they possible? , managed to find some way to redemption. <br /> <br /> This is a presentation 2 *; the second "*", because it has some "charm".
