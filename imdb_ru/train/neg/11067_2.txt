I am a big fan of this criminal genre, but I could not accept this rotten piece. It was almost as if the Damers were conceived as erotica, right up to the porno-Flick soundtrack. There was no view of what caused Dahmer to tick, no research into who his victims were. Nothing but "Look at how creepy this guy is." And I have to give the directors so much - their Dahmer is the most terrible thing that has ever disgraced the screen.
