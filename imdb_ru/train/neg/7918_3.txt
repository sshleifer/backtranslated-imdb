I found the script in this movie absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this film from me, which rated it as 1 out of 10, was the performance of Lacey Chabert, which, it seemed to me, really played a lot of personalities. For me, she was definitely the main highlight of this film. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was as good as ever, but I found her role rather soft, so I donâ€™t think she can be said that her game was great. <Br /> <br /> Regarding the protagonist, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in the series of cheese hospitals of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> All this I could live. However, the terrible, terrible, terrible end / decision, the role of the psychic and even the role of the psychic were only some of the worst works that I have seen in a long time.
