We all asked ourselves: “Why don't they remake slasher films that were just fine, instead of remaking those that were already great, and so they can only do it better?” Well, with the prom night, they remade the average but a crappy funny movie about Jamie Lee Curtis of the 80s and made him even worse. This is a painting film by numbers, which is clearly trying to attract young adolescents (hence no violence, etc.). The knife in this film is dull. The director spends so much time trying to make a rather attractive killer look a bit creepy that everything else goes out the window. The actors, who include Britney Snow (who was gorgeous in Hairspray), go out of their way, but the material gives them nothing but to puff up and look scared. More annoying is how the death scenes are processed (we will hear the attack, but will not see it). In addition, it seems that the only place where the knife in this film worked was in the installation kit, because the film looks as if it was killed (I guess something remotely intimidating turned out to be on the floor of the cutting room so as not to scare children). pouring money from Americans who send this film to number 1 at the box office !!! Slasher films are a lot of fun, but in the case of Prom Nights I wanted to download the original. I have seen more terrible episodes of "OC" and "Dawsons Creek"
