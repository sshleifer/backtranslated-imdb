I can't believe that this show is still rated 9 out of 10. I could see if these voices were in the first 2 seasons, but who will have anyone to continue to rate him highly after that? I was a big fan of the 1st season. I sat down - all secrets, uncertainty, unexplained events. You never knew what would happen next. By season 2, I still watched faithfully, but I was a little upset that some basic things had yet to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it seemed like more questions. I love the unknown, but you have to throw people a bone from time to time to keep them under supervision. <br /> <br /> Now I can't even remember what turned me off completely, but somewhere in the second season is enough. I'm not a big fan of watching meetings â€” and you obviously can't skip an episode to keep up to date. So it cost me no more. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that they could not be a little smarter and more attentive on the part of loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it seems that ABC just became greedy and decided to see how long they could stretch the show. Don't they realize that in the end they will lose more fans than they could get.
