Why did I spend my time on this film? There was not a single funny joke or line everywhere. Farce was not even a bit ridiculous. I mean, really, an uncontrolled vacuum tube? Why was the name of the National Lampoon attached to this film? Even the Christmas holidays were better than these (I really thought the movie was very funny). <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague!
