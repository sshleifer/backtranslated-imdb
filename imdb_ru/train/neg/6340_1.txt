This is the kind of film that I fear the most. Arrogant and irresponsible, he is a sketch of the Colombian conflict, so shaded and stupid that it is an insult to the entire Colombian people. The performances are impeccable, from Grisales (her nude scene is absolutely pitiful), Bedjarano, Fanny Mickey (which looks right out of Tim Burtonâ€™s nightmare), Diaz, who makes considerable efforts to revive the character, so that it is dimensional, so stamped and so poorly written what he has to work with is a mustache. Not to mention the free final, a blood fest so crappy that Ed Wood cringed. He fails in all respects, in cinema, artistic direction, costumes, make-up, editing and, above all, directing. Jorge Ali Triana has always been a lousy director, but at least his previous films had some merit. I cannot say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope that Colombian filmmakers will learn a lesson about honesty, honesty and responsibility from this dastardly intentional fiasco.
