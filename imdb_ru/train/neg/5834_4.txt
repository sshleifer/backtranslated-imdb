I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 pounds and House, MD. The character of Tucci is brilliant, but socially unsuitable by his choice, similar to the character of Lori House, but without the sharp wit that Lori brings to House. Meanwhile, the “straight guy” Tucci, convinced Dr. Seger, did not turn into a more interesting character, like the erroneous “straight guys” Cuddy and Wilson. Indira Warma's character Adrienne Holland is too much like Dr. Jennifer Morrison Cameron to be random. <br /> <br /> Someone from CBS obviously noticed the success of House, MD, and told his staff that he (she) got a similar show, hoping that the mimicry would be successful. However, copying a show like House does require the same high level of wit and vagueness, and Tucci and the company simply do not cope with this task. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the show was canceled until I read the IMDb comments, but this does not surprise me.
