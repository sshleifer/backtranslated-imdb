So it was HBO "Made for TV Movie", huh? Is that an excuse for such a miserable conspiracy and terrible game? It is a shame to see Jim Belushi turn into a role that is so repetitive (shot, survived, lie, beat, survive, shoot, lie and so on to infinity. Call it a script? As for the British, it's embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton miserable (or he just took ***, it depends on how much he was paid, I think?) attempt by the southern sheriff). As for this other British, bleached blond, what the hell! Recently, there has been a tendency to glorify these “English-speaking” (sic) super-thugs, perhaps thanks to Mr. Madonna’s two films that excel in entertainment and justify violence by the skillful use of irony and humor, as Pulp Fiction does. However, this film discredits and depreciates the genre. definitely one to skip.
