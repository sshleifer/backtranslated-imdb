I had high hopes for this film. Theatrical monologue is great, and Nick Balthazar is a very interesting person with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to cinema. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a fan of many Belgian films, but this film is bad. It is absolutely incredible that actors who are 34 years old suddenly play the role of teenagers. "Linguistic games" were disgusting and excessive. Nothing in the film seemed real to me. The ending was too deus ex machina for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and I think I lost an hour and a half of my life.
