I was very excited when I saw that they had shot a film from my favorite book. I did not realize that it was Disney before it was too late. I was shocked by the many omissions of important parts of the story. As if someone made a film from the book of the 4th grade students about the novel. Meg did well at school, and neither she nor her father wore glasses. Mrs. Murray (mother Meg) was not at all portrayed as a scientist; they left her kitchen lab and replaced it with internet. And this is just the beginning. In the middle of the movie, I screamed at the screen, much to the dismay of other people who watched the movie, who did not read the book. I wish I had more thumbs so that I could give four thumbs for this. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read a book, this film is sort of.
