First of all, I just want to say that I love this show !!! But this episode ... this episode mocks the entire series. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know what they were trying to achieve with this episode, but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series. <br /> There is no storyline here, everything is chaotic, but jokes ..... rubbish. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example, "how curls look like", creating this nonsense "earlier in ..." ...... just a shame. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the authors are running out of ideas, and this is really very bad.
