It is a pity when such a film is shot. Most of the work and money was invested in the film, which at best is amateur. <br /> <br /> Editing is delayed, there are obvious mistakes that could be easily corrected for the second take, and we donâ€™t imagine the soundtrack. Much more could have been done with this video. I believe that they did not have enough time or video. <br /> <br /> Hand shots have a distinct amateur feel.
