A pathetic attempt to use science to justify the religion / philosophy of the new century. They have nothing in common with each other, and much of what is said about quantum physics in this confusion is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports the idea of ​​Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the subatomic world, you can never definitely predict the location of particles at a specific time. You can only indicate the odds of being in exactly one place at a time. In addition, the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solids can pass through barriers. So far this is all true. But then they claim that this means that if you truly believed enough that you could pass through the wall, you could actually do it. This is complete nonsense. Instead, the theory says that at our level you can pass through the wall, but this is just by chance and has nothing to do with faith. In addition, you have to continue to walk into the wall for eternity to ever have the slightest chance to pass through the wall, the chances are so astronomically against it. <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how they distort science. But much more annoying is the story of the unfortunate photographer, played by Marly Maitlan. About halfway through, the picture becomes so confused that it becomes incomprehensible. Something related to negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-loathing. Perhaps there is some truth in this, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> In addition, string theory is a hot new thing in physics these days. Instead of spending your time on this thing, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an amazing series made for NOVA on PBS, in which you will learn about the history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and Theory M in 3 hours. Quantum mechanics is explained there pretty well, if you want to know it without a fog of metaphysical appropriation.
