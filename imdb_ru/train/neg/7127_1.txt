This film was, to put it mildly, bad !!! Many excellent cars are dishonored by the fact that they were shown in this film LAME. It begins with a race from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, which will end in 1 hour and 45 minutes ... on a Ferrari F430. I did it in 1 hour and 50 minutes on a tiny 1993 4-cylinder 140-hp Honda Accord. Seriously ... this film does not do justice to these cars. Obviously, these writers are just like that and probably drive with a speed limit with their own hands at 10 and 2 o'clock. I remember seeing the news as Eddie Griffin smashed $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo at a speed of 30-40 miles per hour >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And .. .Andy Cheng director is a great SALE !!! He brings shame to his own race. I wonder how many people he verbally liked to just break into Hollywood? He took part in a film in which Asian Americans are depicted in such a negative and FALSE way. Asian women >> cheap money fucking whores. Asian men >> lose obsessive players and thugs who are constantly beaten. What the hell all fear of Asians ?? Why should one always portray them in such a negative connotation? I'm so sick of the fact that Hollywood ALWAYS portrays Asians in such a negative and false preposition.
