I liked the original story very much, waited for the movie very much (especially since Barker raved about it in the interview), finally saw it and what can I say? It was a complete mess! Directing everywhere, acting was terrible, eye-catching visuals and choreography were just flat, empty and completely unnecessary (what about regular music video tricks such as fast-forward-slow nonsense? It was stylish, yes, but not needed in this movie and cheapened the sound in some mute MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo). Although some of the killings are pretty cool and brutal, some are just ridiculously funny (the first murder of a Japanese girl was ridiculous, and the death of Ted Raimi was just silly ridiculous). He just rushes everywhere with zero voltage and tension, completely moving away from the original story and then returning to it in the final, which by this moment simply feels caught, to spoil it even more. No explanation was given, I mean, I only knew what was happening when I read this story, but for people who did not have it, it was even more confusing, because sometimes I didnâ€™t even know where it was goes and what is trying to do - it was crazy all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted to like this film because I am a big fan of Barker and loved this story, because it has great potential. for a terrific movie, damn it, I even enjoyed some of Kitamura's films as funny jokes, but this film just smelled of dilettantism and stupidity from beginning to end - I didn't care about anyone or anything, it was all hurriedly and greatly reduced from the actual source, turning it into something completely different. Of course, it was awful, and Vinnie Jones played a great guy, but everything else was everywhere, more than disappointing. Gutted
