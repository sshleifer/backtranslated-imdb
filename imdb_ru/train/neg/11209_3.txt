This tasteless mini operetta with Eddie-MacDonald's prototype in Valentino's script is so bad that in five minutes it becomes an exercise in endurance. This is stupid from the very beginning, since this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of masculinity in the son of one of the officers. In less than a minute, he is packed in Morocco, where he lives a double life like Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe who would rather sing than fight. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Claire have wonderful light operatic voices (with small acting abilities), and they also have decent bass, but the game has such haphazard scenes that are so poorly prepared that you feel that they come up with things when go ahead. <br /> <br /> These two videos were part of a large stage production that lists six authors. With more room for fake and hype, the show may have had some entertaining values, but this quick shot is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for a feature presentation.
