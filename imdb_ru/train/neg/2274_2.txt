Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love movies, so I have to watch these dirty movies in cinemas. And I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be fine. I hoped that they would either leave the original version of “Open Your Eyes” exactly the same, or make it their own. Well, it was a bit of both. <br /> <br /> It all started well. I love Radiohead. I would like it to be more. But by the end we are listening to The Beach Boys' Good Vibrations. Talk about a wide range of suck between. They had one or two good songs at the club and maybe a couple of others, but why should they shout out to G.V. during the climax. It was more annoying than confusing or glaring. Especially when it has nothing to do with the site. At least give meaning to the songs. Kid A = main. Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> He also worked on the club scene. It was cool. Otherwise, the film was one big ball of arrogance. As if the audience will get the movie. Those who receive it, read the subtitles, and the rest - no. It is so simple. Motivation spoiled everything. I did not understand the motivation of Diaz (did they not make Chicken Soup the night before?) And some others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise cannot play (especially in films of this type (i.e., with eyes wide closed)). And an elevator. I figured. Anyway, they tried to improve the original with a crappy American rock soundtrack and crappy corners, with good film printing and glossy processing, and that would help if Crow didn't screw it up. <br /> <br /> 2/10 A big disappointment.
