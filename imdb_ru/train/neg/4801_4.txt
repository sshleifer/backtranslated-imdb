I really wanted this movie. It has a good prison, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, an absolutely disgusting touch of the 80s, and this is the directorial work of actor John Saxon, who also plays the bad (you guessed it) bad guy. It reminds me of some (favorite) Italian horror movies. But the direction is very wooden, and there is no nightmarish / frightening moment. It just goes on and on and then (logically) should end. A more intense and daring image and his fate as a cult classic would be sealed.
