American second-level leader Guy Madison plays a character whose fame precedes him in this Spaghetti Western ?? which, having very modest powers, looks like a routine (although it shows a fairly good result). The plot is of some moderate interest: the name, by the way, refers to the wounded man involved in the murderous attack from the shooters on the ranch ?? the property of the family of their pursuer, agent cavalry madison. The latterâ€™s younger brothers and sisters are convinced that the injured party, now in their care, leads them to the responsible gang of the gang; ultimately, the identity of any mysterious person turns out to be a surprise ?? and both, ironically, become associated with one of the Madison sisters (the other was raped during the raid). The Euro-Cult Rosalba Neri asterisk is unremarkable as the owner of the salon and ex-Madison flame.
