Not one of Keaton's best attempts; perhaps it was a veiled attempt to avenge the family in which he married - Talmadge. The Polish-English language barrier and a series of coincidences lead Buster to marry a large Irish woman who (together with his father and brothers) treats him until he decides that he can become the heir to the state. Mistaken personalities abound here - the attackers are set, but the main thing does not pay off. <br /> <br /> This short Metro has at least two real laughs - Buster deftly turns around the lack of dinner, using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adoptive family to literally bring the meat to his plate. The other is a family photo, when the whole group slowly falls to the floor, as the camera tripod loses its stability. <br /> <br /> An overflow of yeast beer could have served as a catalyst for a huge series of gags, but it stops (for the whole build-up) development. <br /> <br /> Cinema print is clear and clear, and the score is one for player piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of the best works of Buster, but it is worth making fun.
