The Broadway show of Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante lasted for years, but the evidence of his strength and charisma is lost in this film adaptation, which is most likely related to the choice of director (Richard Attenborough, as far from B-way as you could get) and lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays the director-choreographer, as a slippery corporate lawyer). The subtle story of a grueling audition for a Broadway show that turns into a therapy session for dancer actors, singers, came across us with loud, brass talents playing for the rafters. Nothing is modulated or thin, especially the ridiculous story about a former dancer returning to theater and scalding old Douglas flames. Excessively full hopes are full of promises and spiritual suffering, but their personal stories are a little embarrassing; this, in combination with Attenborough's slow rhythm, means a catastrophe, and even now famous songs cannot break through the artificial wrapper. * 1/2 of ****
