I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and appreciate digital animation. I thought that a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable. I could not be more wrong: the story (or its absence) was completely uninspired and lacked imagination, while imagination is usually the largest component of any science fiction. Dialogue and action are worse than average porn movies. Especially Thomas Kretschman gives a new meaning to the term “bad work”. A bad acting game would not be such a big problem if only the “director” Bilal did not take himself so seriously; all the lines sound like they should be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks that he created a work of art here. Well, in this piece there is no art or poetry, only pretentiousness! This person should really stick to the comics, since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all, terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually makes watching this movie a physically painful experience. The graphics look so unreal that even the werewolves in Van Helsing look like live actors! And since half of the characters are CGI-animated, the problem is that the CGI effects look so fake. If the Egyptian gods really exist, then Bilal is a dead guy, as they will undoubtedly revenge him terribly for the ridiculous way he portrays them in this horribly bad movie.
