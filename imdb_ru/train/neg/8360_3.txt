What do you like about this movie? <br /> <br /> It is colored! <br /> <br /> He has an impressive underwater photo! <br /> <br /> He has a rhythmic musical score in the background that sometimes works well! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music accelerates! Especially when the shark or the villains are going to come close! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it slows down! As if to convey to the audience, it is time for sympathy! <br /> <br /> Like another bites the dust! As if in “spaghetti western” it is very similar to! <br /> <br /> Not that the Italians could not produce quality products! There was a series of television films titled "Octopus," numbered from about 1 to 7, that were broadcast on SBS television in Australia in the 1990s about mafia-like conflicts! And they were excellent! But, alas, you will not find it here !!! <br /> <br /> I assumed that this was done around the 1960s! Unfortunately, 20 years have passed, as evidenced by the funeral scene closer to the end! <br /> <br /> Then a razor-sharp bite of a quick shark occurred, which constantly causes red dust to appear in bluish waters! <br /> <br /> Amidst all this, either in a bar fight or in watching the last bloody demolition on the seashore from the inexorably hungry shark, the hero’s assistant looks through his glasses, almost without caring he was also bored in his relentless role due to the lack of a large amount of evidence of conspiracy or anyone's character development! <br /> <br /> At least the hero late indicates a fleeting concern for his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But, of course, even if the music is not capable of awakening our understanding, we hear the ominous sound in the voices of the villains, as if we are pushing us to the fact that another dark act is about to appear! <br /> <br /> And towards the end, someone thought about a turn! Just when we thought all this was absolutely predictable! But stay tuned, guys, because you can find another turn! If you look carefully! To more or less warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the advice of the hero and drink beer along the way! This will make your Shark Nights view more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you will be ready for something like the movie “007” to make your way back to reality easier when all this ends !!!
