In the 1990s, day talk shows began to take place left and right. Each network had one, and they all lacked the same originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the fat mother of a trailer park with a Marlborough cigarette dangling from her mouth, while breastfeeding one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate children. The English language and other cornerstones of mankind, destroyed by this, show existence. Titlites, ranging from girls, pigeon heads, and so on. How can someone want to watch this clean and full trash? Has our society really become nothing more than a bunch of brave fathers and hilly fathers? The people who appear on this show were trash. The people who watched this show were trash. Anyone who wants to see this show on the air or burn it to DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans become huge piles of fat and too fat to even get a job, and such shows tell them that everything is fine when they weigh 500 pounds, and 12-year-old girls act like prostitutes. The presence of such garbage on television destroyed morality.
