I bought this DVD for £ 1, and now I understand why. Acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. At best, the lighting and sound substandard. The plot does not make much sense, even when it is sober (ATTENTION: I do not recommend watching this film when sober.) This film looks as if you are watching a home movie of someone who doesn’t really like to go out. It really is a shame that all the very small money spent on this project went to such a waste of time, I look forward to seeing if any of these envoys still have a career other than eva longoria, which is This film’s only “star” was obviously not hit by a badly acting stick. I'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive, but I will say one thing to James Cahill, do not try again. According to Skulym, “He is greatly lacking in a good department.”
