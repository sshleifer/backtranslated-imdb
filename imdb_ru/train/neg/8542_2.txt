I make my way through the collection of Chilling Classics 50 films, and “The Mountain of Witches” (El Monte de las brujas) is something like the 17th film in the set. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in the film to keep my attention on everyone. The plot was incoherent. The dialogue seemed improvised. The game was bad. The characters were not sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning with an irritated woman who seeks to burn her seemingly trashy daughter. However, the only connection of this scene with the rest of the film is the main character, Mario, who has the most colossal mustache in history. But that's all. <br /> <br /> The film was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes were almost completely black. It's actually barely watchable - what else can I say?
