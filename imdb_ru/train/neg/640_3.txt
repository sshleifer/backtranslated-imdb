A cold, repulsive adaptation of Rebecca West’s book about an army captain returning from his post in World War II with a weakened memory (now there’s an original idea!). It seems he remembers the old flames of Glenda Jackson, but not the current wife of Julie Christie, who should be enough to cause some emotional spark. This extremely successful cast unites lead man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and his colleagues in the film Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but all the burners are low. There are some good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but Bridges' tempo is sluggish, and the muted color of the film excites. Long on the shelf this "Soldier" is best left forgotten. * 1/2 of ****
