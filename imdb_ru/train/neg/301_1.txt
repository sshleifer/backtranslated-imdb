This is the worst documentary ever to come out of Canada !!!! I'm glad the guys didn't make another movie. All they want to do is make a film, not the one they wrote. They keep changing the script to accommodate the person they serve. I couldn't get out of the theater fast enough when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival this year. Please never watch this movie.
