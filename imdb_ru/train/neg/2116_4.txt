The terrible pictures of “Poverty” of the 30s and 40s depress me to hell. God knows that I have nothing against low-budget films, but those that were made at that time look at them with such a dreary, battered appearance - and, ultimately, are not very good. “The Corpse Vanishes” is a bit more interesting than the “bottom”, like “The Invisible Ghost” and “The Ape Man”, but this is not a classic. Bela Lugosi, the long past flourishing of Dracula, plays another mad doctor; the unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins, because, as Lugosi explains to the dubious young journalist (Luana Walters), the coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Disgraced is also on hand, which can please fans of hardcore films of the 30s and 40s.
