The first: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics, turned into idlers for a child. They both sold themselves in this, worse than the character of Priora. Two: A horrendous, overly sentimental script that could be used in a film about Harold Lloyd. Three: choosing a black actor as a toy; racial overtones are unbearable because they have never been solved. There are no messages, the role of Priora could play any comedian. Fourth: This child ... I would like to go back in time and not let him ever play ... it would mean that films like this and Kid Co. could not be made ... and my childhood it would be free of their mind-blowing power. So, if you want to see how a couple of great comics defile themselves with a painful sweet click of a child, go on. If you want to see them in something good, see the old performance of Pryor and Gleason in something better, for example, for newlyweds.
