Ugh! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film was a well-directed story about a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original film had something to say, and he did not try his best to say it. And he had a naked girl on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version seems to me to be something that the manufacturer bought the rights to, and then refused the interest. It seems that a group of people deliberately decided to adapt it to the nineties and changed their ethnicity and gender in order to be cute. The film is not about burnout due to suicide in the last act of disobedience. We are talking about a man who is trying to get to the hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> This film had no reason other than to make me angry ...
