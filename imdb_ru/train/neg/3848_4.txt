The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters, united in the role of mothers of convicted murderers. With terrible disrepute after the trial, two women come together and leave New York for California to open a song and dance studio for girls who look like the Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning it becomes obvious that Reynolds made a mistake by taking Winters with her to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who seems increasingly confused. <br /> <br /> Worse, women who live together receive threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who wears a blond wig, soon marries the rich father of one of her students, played well by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorhead, in one of his latest films, is briefly seen as Sister Alma, who Winters is a faithful listener. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Shelly Winters. She is heavy here, and the heavyness seemed to make her behave even better. Winters has always succeeded in casting her nerves. <br /> <br /> The ending is grim, and who can forget Winters at the piano, looking away from this completely insane look?
