As for the films, it is pretty nice. Interesting characters, good dialogue, quite an interesting story. I would really like it if it didn’t irritate me while I look at total disrespect showing the city in which it is located. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet each character is English (with the exception of the girl Sean, who is Dutch). Scottish accents can be heard only fleetingly in black jobs and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who likes her “real life” movies to be a bit more like real life), I really don't think it would be painful to use any of the countless talented Scottish actors ... or at least there are English who could throw a decent accent! The futile attempt to use the word “baby” several times did nothing but further insult.
