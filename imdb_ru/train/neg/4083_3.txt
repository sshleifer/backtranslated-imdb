I saw this film when it was released, and my disgust for it remained with me all these years. <br /> <br /> And this is why: <br /> <br /> Greenway’s goal is to take every literary image in The Tempest and make it literal. If the character had said: “My heart flies away,” we would be shown a real human heart with attached dove wings flapping across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process creates some lush pictures, but in the end it is an easy exercise. And it becomes deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I do not envy the pleasure that other viewers receive in this film, but it’s worth knowing that not all viewers were delighted.
