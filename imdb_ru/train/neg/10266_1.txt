1st viewed 07/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): excessive rephrasing of imaginary horror films of the 70s, such as Friday the 13th (versions 1 to anything ??). I can not think about how to redeem much here, except (or can I think about something?) ?? The story revolves around a group of stupid people listening to a radio program a year after some children were killed in the forest as a "homage." on this supposedly. But, oh, a miracle, one of the stupid people has a connection with the actual event, because her sister was one of those killed (again, how silly she would even be a part of it). Guess what? The killer is again in this, and from the very beginning we will find out who it is (so this is a mystery). And besides all this, where are the "police" and why no one calls them. I can not believe that this film was financed and made by someone. You might think that by now the American people will be rated a little higher, at least according to their cinematic experience, but not so much by this director.
