The film tells about the young man Michael, who cares for the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients. At about the same time, he decides to model his murder after the killer of the zodiac of the 60s. He contacts the author of a book about the killer of the zodiac, and they form a friendship. Michael has a pistol (apparently, a single pistol, as it seems, in the hands of some other actors, just not depicted as the same pistol.) Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like movies B. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but editing and acting really drowned out the plot. I thought the “blood” was too unreal, the lighting in some places was terrible, and the dialogue was too standard. The film was shot on video, and this is normal, but the editing of the film is only for some of the strange scenes from Plan 9. A good movie for fans of the genre of B-movie, but if you want something a little more polished, go to another.
