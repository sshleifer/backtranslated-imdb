A documentary filmmaker, like any director, must convey a convincing story. Will Pasco failed in this effort, bringing together boring fragments of Chomsky's wisdom during a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is filmed amateur and in the video. The only Pasco effort, linking the fragments into a coherent whole, is to periodically emit an undefined heading on the screen: "9-11", "Activism", "Truth". <br /> <br /> Limping. <br /> <Compare this to documentaries like “Corporation” or “Fog of War” that create narrative drawing material from interviews, video footage and footage. In the end, each of them delivers an insightful and insightful message cleverly and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of the film is Chomsky’s carelessly set historical dogmas and the fact that the duration is only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> Chomsky's story about his experience with the National Public Radio was one of the most interesting passages. He describes conservative media as more adaptable to dissenting views, while the NPR liberal dogma humbles his pollees and sharply restricts their permitted messages. Another media is skeptical of this. <br /> <br /> This documentary is intended only for Noam Chomsky.
