This film was a yawn from titles to titles, it is boring to a tedious state, and acting is wooden and nonsense! Admittedly, it was directed by Richard Jobson, the debut director, but who the hell played the green script as bad as this one? It looks like another project spent on government needs (the Scottish screen is credited as a surprise, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times, and my review, unfortunately, should be more restrained than this. Please, please, Mr. Jobson, whatever you do before staging this soothing movie, return to it!
