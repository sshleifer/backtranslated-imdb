Previous comments prompted me to check it out when he appeared on TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but he doesn’t have enough time to screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palitt play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stuck. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the ego of character Lee Tracy, who at best is self-centered, physically and verbally abusive moron. The reaction of the “public” is poorly thought out and incredible, because of which the “machinations” seem to be tricks by a bad writer. And it makes you trust that Lupe Velez can fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> The “burning lines” mentioned in another review should depend on the observer, since I didn’t even notice that the attempt was made.
