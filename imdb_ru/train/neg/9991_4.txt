First, I'm not here to chase this movie. I find it completely enjoyable, despite the poor quality of the products. The action here is about as disgusting as the monster stalking them, although the monster itself is pretty well done ... impressively well done, in this. In fact, he looks like something otherworldly, like an alien family on vacation, landing in the Himalayas, and while his father was out, accepting ... calling for nature's call, Spot was released, and they simply did not have time to track him down. This or he is the Caucasian brother of the master of desires. I have not decided which one. <br /> <br /> Actually, it seems to have been shot somewhere in a snowy country, yes, but it’s more likely that it is somewhere in Canada than anywhere else in China. Trees and species tell me about Canada, and it’s normal that in a given area you will never feel the feeling of cold that can be expected in the Himalayas of China. This film is about a science fiction channel, so we can forgive the lack of location. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is obvious (as we have just installed) science fiction directors do not often travel because they do not know that commercial airplanes fly over the weather, as shown here, and the subsequent crash would not actually occur. But, as I said, this is a science fiction channel, so we have to forgive a few things. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the film is quite visual and revolves between “Alive” about Donner Party, “Predator”. about aliens in the forest and about any bad film on wushu, where they fly through the wires. The Yeti, obviously, can jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? “Run faster! Jump higher! Live longer! ”<br /> <br /> In addition, the Yeti missed his teddy bear. He searched for it high and low, but it seems that he cannot make the corpse work. Poor Yeti! You can not regret it. He survived and developed for thousands of years just to give way to a serious loss of a teddy bear. He missed his bear. Or maybe he wants to mate, but this idea is forbidden! Can you hear me? Well, it seems to be an unmarried man. REBANISHED! <br /> <br /> And this is superhuman. Well, this is not a man ... this is a super yeti! But then again, what's normal? Yeti? I do not know, but he has a certain quality of Michael Meyers, which is completely disturbing. And he has this incredible way of cleaning his fur. Terrific Dahlink! It is immaculately white at times when it SO should not be. He is fastidious to superh ... super yeti. <br /> <br /> in general? It was fun to watch, there were some great murders and some honest plot elements. Despite the awfully similar gravel production style, it’s actually quite interesting. I can't help but wonder if they are planning another one? <br /> <br /> On the M4TV scale, it is rated at 6.0 / 10 points. <br /> <br /> According to the film scale, it is 4.4 / 10 s ... Fiend:
