[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] This movie’s reputation precedes this, so I eagerly sat down to watch it in TCM's mailbox. What a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is great, production values ​​are first-class, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin, and it all takes too long. For the film, which is dedicated to alcoholism, family differences, infidelity, gambling and sexual repression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless and cliche. One example is the image of Frank Hirsch’s infidelity: his rather tough request to his wife to “go upstairs and relax a little”, followed by her predictable request for a headache, leads — more predictably — to his evening talk with his secretary (“Hello, Nancy , I have the blues tonight. Let's take a ride "), all according to a well thought out formula. We do not feel that these are real people, but cardboard cutouts playing the role of a puppet. In addition, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch has never been investigated or explained. Dave Gwen's craze "again, again, again, again" is inexplicable in the light of her stupid inability to defecate or leave the pot. His subsequent marriage in despair with the character Shirley MacLaine / Ginny, one way or another, from the moment of his presentation to this viewer, was obviously doomed to failure, and it was clear - according to the agreements of this type of soap opera - that he could only be solved by someone killed. . At that moment, when the jealous lover began to run with a gun, I argued with myself who, Dave or Ginny, would die. It was all false with a capital “P”. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the performance of MacLaine and Dean Martin are highlighted here. But in general, I find that the interest in the film is of particular interest to the historical part of Hollywood history.
