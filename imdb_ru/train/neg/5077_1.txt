In a recently deleted message from another IMDb user, it was noted that anyone who can see the “Touch of Medusa” should be warned about a scene that eerily resembles the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York. But I hope that anyone reading this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree (producer Elliot Kastner produced Harper and The Long Goodbye; co-producer Arnon Milchan jointly produced the Oscar-nominated LA Confidential, and screenwriter John Brilie got an Oscar for Gandhi) and international Cast, I discovered that "The Touch of Medusa" was a tough, unintentional riot of laughter. It was a poorly directed, badly written and acting mess. He tried to capitalize on the telekinetic thrillers genre of the 70s. The film fails for many reasons. Please consider Carrie and the Underrated Rage (both directed by Brian DePalma). These were two entertaining and exciting thrillers on the same subject.
