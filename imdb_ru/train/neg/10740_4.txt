This film begins with a certain promise; but, in my opinion, begins to lose him when the main character kidnaps a good Samaritan, who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. The fact that this well-intentioned stranger begins to repair his car when he is away, makes a phone call is implausible enough, but the fact that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him return his familyâ€™s life to the path is a type of beginners coincidence. The authors are warned against using in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this film at best average. Artistic leadership could be much better, as could be a movie. The game was good, as was the singing of Eva van der Gucht.
