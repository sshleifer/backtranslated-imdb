Quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen; I was ready to go out after the first ten minutes. In the theater, only teenagers laughed. Don't get me wrong, I like stupid, stupid movies just like the next movie, but the whole package, composition and humor are smelly. It seemed to me that they were going to feel "Napoleon Dynamite" - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, he was forced, awkward and strange. <br /> <br /> Isla Fisher was the only bright light, and I just felt terribly that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this terrible thing. /> <br /> Thank you, damn it, I didn't pay for it.
