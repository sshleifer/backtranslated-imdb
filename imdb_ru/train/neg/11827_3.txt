I have just returned from a free show, and I am very glad that I did not pay to watch this very low-quality film. The theater was full, and the crowd was a mixture of children and adults. It seemed that they were just children who laughed at all the jokes and farting (oh my, they loved to beat these poor mice in the crotch a lot!). The film is quite young, unreasonable, predictable and mostly annoying. It seems that the characters are simply brought together to fill the empty space, and the relationship between them seemed very forced, without any charm. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is about the average, nothing stands out. They did a decent job imitating the clay look of Wallace and Gromit, but other than that they are very easily forgotten images. <br /> <br /> Although I was really bored throughout the film, I laughed a couple of times. This is not an absolute failure, but I definitely would not want to watch it again. If you are a parent with children (and you don't care that your children see senseless cheap jokes), feel free to take them with you, but everyone else should not waste their money.
