This film is recommended as a good action movie, but I donâ€™t think so. I found the story confusing and not so easy to understand. Until the end of the film is not so much action, and quite gloomy, and it is difficult to understand what is actually happening. I was sure, hoping for something else, but, alas, I did not find it here.
