Where do they get money for such films? I mean, there's nothing atoning about this movie. None of the actors is known, the script is terrible, the picture is blurred, the story wanders between a bad version of Repo Man and western niclodeon, and the acting is incredible. For those who watch all kinds of movies, good and bad, I have to admit that this film is about the worst that I have seen since the “Eye Attack” People in the 50s. I don’t like to break the efforts of people trying to create some kind of entertainment or, God forbid, art, but this film does not seem to please anyone. The story relies on the mystical pollution of man, which is a bad version of the Celtic soul eater, although it functions more like a male succubus without sexual connotations. The bad guys have to team up with the good guys in the city, from where they can't escape. Take it from there, as this is, alas, the best part. My advice: if you are not into bad mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing acting, and tedious settings, you should leave it on the shelf when you shoot a video.
