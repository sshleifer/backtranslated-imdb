Julia Roberts is obviously making a concerted effort to shake the beautiful women off this false thriller of wife abuse, but it's hard to imagine that she will end up playing as powerfully and convincingly (and advantageously) as in Erin Brockovich based the back of this garbage. And don't be shy about it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts car, but unfortunately its performance is not the dimest thing about it. <br /> <br /> On the plot, all marks of late night are made - for-cable, and do not think that it will give any idea of ​​the dark world of domestic violence, because none of the characters are drafted so that -Really cared. <br /> <br /> In the end, disappointing and unsatisfactory, without Roberts ’name over the heading, I’m sure it would completely fail, deservedly.
