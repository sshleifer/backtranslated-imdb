Already his first statement that desires are always artificial is completely erroneous. <br /> <br /> When is a rejected Jehovah's Witness getting his own documentary about films ?? or anything for that matter - it's time for anyone to get their own. Although much, much smarter than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult), Zizka's mouth spews as much nonsense as her, just another kind. He combines the worst of both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both areas are notorious for the fact that it is convenient for them to offer the expert many opportunities to create unprovable theories, to speak out without beginning or end, as well as to almost randomly link concepts in the process of misusing English by creating semantics. only mother can mix. Example: there are three main brothers of Marx, therefore, what a “great” idea to link them with the three levels of human consciousness, id, ego and super-ego. I am a little surprised that he did not play the clip from Snow White and drew an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahanna (Muslim hell). This is similar to the premise of Schumacher's Numbers 23: play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any Kakama theory you want, even linking the ancient Greeks to the death of Princess Dee. <br /> <br /> However, there is an entertainment element in TPGTC: looking at a mad mad sweat like a pig, while uttering delusional chants disguised as intellectual analysis can be quite fun. Why watch "The Cuckoo's Nest" or any other drama from a lunatic asylum when you can have Zizek more than 2 hours? It's like watching a funny train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny once or twice. <br /> <br /> I have always been perplexed by people who are desperately trying to turn the creation of a film into a sublime intellectual social science. Thinking about such idiotic films as "Birds", hence the great merit, it is likely that his fat creator is laughing in his grave. The blunt truth is that the vast majority of films have zero intellectual value, and those few who have some intelligence do not require the psychiatrist-philosopher to draw a map in order to understand them ?? unless it's a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal films. Nowadays, hallucinogenic drugs should be quite popular and cheap in Slovenia ... <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed a hole in the bathroom in the shower “Psycho”, I thought that he was going to say something about galactic black holes ; how they drain the life of the stars just like a bath hole sucks the blood of Janet Lee. Or perhaps he could say how the hole represents Lee's vagina, with the blood flowing into it, and not from it (as during menstruation), which represents a kind of "smart (Zizek) irony." By the way, the real irony is that if Hitchcock really thought about every scene (and script), his films would not be illogical, contrived nonsense, which they often are. The meaning of these analogies with the holes in the bath was to show how easy it is to improvise about "hidden deep meanings." And when you add Zhizak's quirky terminology from philosophy and psychology, putting these terms on top of these analogies, such as decorations for wedding cakes, you get a messy mess that can instantly impress the uneducated, that is, easily impressionable and gullible. Zizek says here a few (unintentionally) funny things, one of the most absurd ideas of which is related to the fact that he connects the cleaning of Antony Perkins's bloody bathroom with "job satisfaction, well done work". Do not laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the author of "Psycho" could ever even vaguely entertain this idea that Perkins could enjoy a job well done - cleaning the bloody toilet - while they conceived / directed the scene. Talk about putting words in a (dead) mouth, but in the context of a misinterpretation of what the director had to “say”. <br /> <br /> I like Zizek's initial thoughts about Tarkovsky’s amazing “Solaris”, but then he ruins a rare good impression, drawing “antifeminism” and other nonsense into his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizhek refers to logic as a dog refers to a plastic bone. "I just want to play with it all day!" The logic has its own rules, and should not be raped - at least publicly - like him. It seems that he considers logic, evidence, common sense and reason to be enemies or simple toys; concepts that should be avoided, distorted to fit the final goal, or simply destroyed. Zizek is a hippie with LSD, and all of his favorite films are his own "2001s." <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek pays special attention to two of the most overvalued directors - and those whose films are often INSUFFICIENT intelligence, if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch - only reduces his already low authority. I was surprised that De Palma did not show more prominently; this is another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizka has a field day with the incomprehensible “Lost Highway” of Lynch. There are as many interpretations of this film as there are people who have watched it. <br /> <br /> Zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts Von Trier’s ridiculous, “innovative” physical installation in Dogville, I made a giggle. <br /> <br /> However, Zizek not only comes up with something, but also indulges in the “obvious”. Like all "sociologists" (oxymoron), it wraps its very banal "observations" in clearly formulated (if they are full of spittle) and sometimes complex linguistic shells. In the end, sociology functions in exactly the same way: it makes us believe that we hear something new, although in fact this is what we already know, but eloquently says that it is fooling a more unobservant listener. <br /> <br /> I hardly expected that men in white suits would suddenly appear out of nowhere and fasten him in a looney suit ... <br /> <br /> Glory иižek: you are soon a stalker in a children's park. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
