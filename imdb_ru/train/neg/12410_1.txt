This film was seriously terrible. Acting was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought to myself, well, this is an old film. Then I remembered that this is no excuse! I have seen old movies with the best acting games and things like that. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really changeable. Editing was bad (most of the dialogue was out of sync.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this film does not even deserve 1. I only watched it because I was bored and I was hardly entertained with the film. It was just ridiculous. My dead grandmother's left little finger could have made a movie better than this.
