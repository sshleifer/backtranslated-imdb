When you sit down to watch a comedy with actors led by Cary Grant, Jane Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer, you expect a lot of expectations. These expectations are supported when the film was directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so obvious, in particular, in DAMN YANKEES!, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. In the first five minutes or so it seems that these expectations can be met, and then -. Nothing. What should be a light comedy, plunges into a lead, heavy melodrama, without laughter. <br /> <br /> Susie Parkerâ€™s relative newcomer was often criticized for her work or her absence in this film, but in a film in which even the great Cary Grant often looks flat and wooden, the attack on Parker seems unfair. Even such a bright light, like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day, could not change the fate of this sinuous, dull and completely meaningless scenario that clumsily drags itself forward and attracts the interest and patience of the viewer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, continues to try to breathe a little bit of life into the process, but the horrible script is outside of reanimation. A desperate, pointless attempt to cause indecisive laughter from a numb audience in the last moments of the film only adds insults to injury. <br /> <br /> This film is nothing but a big disappointment at all levels.
