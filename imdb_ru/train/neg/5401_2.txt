It would be better to strengthen significantly by doing this in the form of the 50-minute episode "Outer limits" Too many unnecessary materials and things, such as the main bad guy, similar to the fact that he escaped from the Phantom of the Opera, did not help. The entire sequence of the Night of the Living Dead was extremely stupid and completely unnecessary. After all, if the dead were to punish anyone for their sins, now remind me who killed everyone?
