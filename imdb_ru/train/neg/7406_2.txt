Well, how could I know that it was the “promo” of the “stupid ass” of Lordi Motion Picture? I mean, I realized that when this dinosaur costume came out, and when the lead singer appeared, I was humming "Hard Rock Hallelujah" ... although I hate this song. “Dark floors” talk about a young autistic girl who is in the process of escaping from the hospital for a father defender when they and other people in this particular elevator fall into a trap for an instant ... When they arrive on their floor it is amazing to find that there is not anyone. The hospital is empty ... Except for the multitude of monsters who seem to be chasing them for no apparent reason ... They run around the corridors and stairwells, meeting all the members of the heavy metal band in their wild, shocking rock costumes ... Nothing especially memorable here, except for the lousy game, lack of blood / nudity and absolutely shameless promotion, reminds me a lot of “KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park”. Yes, remember that dirt? It’s a pity that I don’t ... I would recommend avoiding all these Ghost House films as a fungus, and not listening to Lordi, since they are the Gwar Ripoff band!
