Very bad attempt at a young spinal cord. At least the music in the spine was good. <br /> <br /> This is indeed a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at worst. A bunch of Hollywood performers, bad musicians and producers create some sort of poopie show so that their children can be the center of attention. Oh please !!! A little humor was even bad. I hate this stuff when there are really incredibly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) who are trying to succeed, and this shit comes. <br /> <br /> Help everyone !!!! Why wasn't Gene Simmons in this ??? The taste of America in entertainment goes down the toilet.
