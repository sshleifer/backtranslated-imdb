I will start by not going all the way. I took it on a rainy day from WalMart, like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I thought that in no way would I regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They need to be made to watch this movie again and again until the end of eternity. This is the only punishment I can come up with for releasing something so bad. Shooting reminds me of films I made for great projects on a big old VHS camera. The game is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some cool cameos. Yes, who cares ... Shekki Moskowitz is not funny, and the comic from the ships loses even more. This is about as much as I understood. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and gave it to many colleagues to watch. Everyone comes back and laughs and says: “Wow, I didn’t think that I would ever say that I turned off Adam Sandler’s film after 15 minutes ....” <br /> <br /> My answer is always “Ok, now you can "<br /> <br />
