This film does what I would call the viewer emotional rape. The film supposedly caused a great resonance among critics at Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pitiful attempt by the novice director to notice himself. There is hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other question in this regard). <br /> <br /> The metamorphosis of the protagonist from a good, but worried boy to a vicious rapist is virtually absent, while the rape scene (being overly prolonged, exaggerated version of the "Clockwork Orange" rape scene) is intolerable, and I refuse to comment its aesthetic values. There are some things that an artist should not do to try to reach his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: shockingly cruel, disgusting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. Instead, see "Clockwork Orange" or "Le pianiste".
