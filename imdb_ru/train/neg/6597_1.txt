This is much worse than these terrible cartoons of Laurel and Hardy 60s. They were terrible, but at least they were mere robberies for the rebirth of Stan and Ollie. The new audience has rediscovered the comic genius of the couple, and the cartoons were stunning rubbish for the benefit of the children. That was to be expected. But how can you even try to rationalize this work ... I can't even think of a word. I’m sure that the creators were hoping that this would somehow inspire Laurel and Hardy’s new revival, but you cannot generate interest in the past with a petty and unfunny caricature of what made the original so attractive. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do the Vegas act, and that's where it belongs. The plot is even more unconvincing than those used in earlier times, trying to draw ideas from two reels for function. If this film were someone’s first acquaintance with REAL Laurel and Hardy, I’m sure that the viewer would reject the original duo’s reputation as insane insanity. The only film that I hate worse than this, I spit on your grave. And, you know, these directors basically did the same thing with Stan and Ollie.
