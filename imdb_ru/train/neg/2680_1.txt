Brokedown Palace is not the movie that I would like to see. I also didnâ€™t like the movie when an Australian smuggled drugs into Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I would not go to this country, no matter what I saw after this film. Actually this film stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I endure. I would also prefer to stick to the United States instead. After I watched some films in the theater, including a false accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theater and got paid because I could not stand the film. If you are going to Thailand to meet someone there who can be a drug smuggler, forget it!
