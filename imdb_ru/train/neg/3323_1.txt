I watched a lot of cartoons or animated films, because I have a girl who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if I wanted my baby to watch it ... and no. At first, I thought it was such a cute film as Bambi’s, but it’s still a gay duck that was a homosexual. The information said that they laughed at him because he was not good at sports, but this was not the case. It's like a movie made for children to learn how to be gay. It was also very sad how much daddy dad and all that. I do not know, I think if you are gay, you will like it, but I do not think that I will watch it again with my baby.
