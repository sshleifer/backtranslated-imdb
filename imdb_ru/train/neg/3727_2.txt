Written and played by sincere lovers, created by some merchant, it is boring and hard to watch. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie ever, but at least one such as Plan 9 from Space, as a rule, had a real actor or two. I would recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only hardcore ironics and hardcore dispensationalists. So do I. <br /> <br /> Don't you believe me? Watch it for free (albeit from bad VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Relevant links have been added, mainly to achieve 10- lower limit IMDb minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
