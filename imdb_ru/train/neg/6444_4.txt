Most college students are lost in the educational space, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their conversations are conducted with their fellow students and college teachers. Stephen Greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a frustrated college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on a small group of people who are depicted as representing a large population. As usual, the people who shout the most get the most media attention. In addition to the fact that the documentary was well represented in the community in which the film was shot, it was well presented. My only argument is that the feelings and noise depicted in the film were attributed to the whole community, and not to the few individuals who expressed them. <br /> <br /> Naturally, it is important to explore such disputes and make people understand the differences that exist between political points of view, but it is ridiculous to involve the whole community of people in the actions of several radicals.
