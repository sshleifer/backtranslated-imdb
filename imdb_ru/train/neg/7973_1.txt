I go to many films, I often bring my 5-year-old son, I am so glad that I did not bring him to this. There are many mentions of sex and a tight scene, however, this is not the main reason I would not lead him to this. Trailers make you believe this is a lighthearted comedy; Nevertheless, almost all the funny moments in the preview. I kept waiting until it became interesting, ridiculous, or anything other than serious; however, I almost fell asleep when the plot story dragged on. I understand that dogs can be a great company, and, as they say, the whole story was focused on a dog with bad behavior, whose owners were not sufficiently savvy for training. If a man had caused so much harm and injury, this man would have been banned. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jennifer Aniston or Owen Wilson is a waste of their talent. The best way to summarize this film is to get a naughty dog, a couple falls in love with a dog, a dog dies, the couple is sad. The end.
