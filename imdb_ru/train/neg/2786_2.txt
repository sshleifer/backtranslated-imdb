Well, I'm not going to criticize this film in detail. I note a lot of eloquent comments that came before me, and, since I usually love Maria de Medeiros, I did not dare to make a dismissive comment for a long time - and thus almost a year passed. But every time I see this DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner groan. Anyway, let the haughty voices reject me! But for other moviegoers like me, be careful. <br /> <br /> Expressing this in the most simple and gentle terms, this is my position: <br /> <br /> Political turmoil and overthrow, providing the background for this film, also served as the background for a certain period of my life - through the newspapers that I read daily at my local Central European pub. At that time I was following the news, but did not understand what the hell was going on. Reporters tended to report either in non-partisan terms or with conservatism, which did not approve of any groups violating the peace or instigating rebellion against the institution. These were times when in Paris, Berlin, Prague, and in different places of the United States other flows of unrest flowed, all the problems of which I understand well at that time - but under a dictatorship or not, in my papers, the Portuguese government was usually considered just as an establishment - not so well developed "evil empire" to use the frivolous terms of "Star War". <br /> <br /> So week after week I read about the unrest, but I never found sensible articles that could be provided by the story behind them, or an assessment of the practice and socio-economic consequences of the dictatorship, etc. <br /> <br /> Therefore, by acquiring this film, I hoped for at least two hopes: to finally understand the details leading to social unrest, and to enjoy a well-thought-out drama. This film did not give me one. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that viewers already possess sufficient knowledge and deep emotions regarding historical facts. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to support Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but - she was banal and petty. <br /> <br /> I received my copy of the DVD from France - "Compilation of Official Cannes 2000 - Un Certain Regard". The box depicts smiling clean-shaven actors, the main role in which gives a sign of victory, which more closely resembles the Playboy rabbit. After seeing the work, I thought that the French might think about it - although I can understand their natural inclination to praise her for “honesty” as a small piece of “cinema” with delicate ethnic content, but ... <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the window: “Do not pay attention to chaleuruex sur la Revolution” - hot attitude? Try to describe Allende, overthrown and killed, with “warm respect”! Try this with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with a whole chain of overthrows and civil uprisings! <br /> <br /> Another tip: Maria de Medeiros pays her son Renue, pays her son, son and son. “Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish! at least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal. In all of Europe, my favorite cities are Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague. But my love for the city and the country does not embody a meaningless film. I’ll hang on my ancient Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa VHS recordings - in the meantime, I’m stuck in zone 2 under the above name, which might also be in the bin.
