This is a great story, and this was only the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it.) However, despite the fact that this is true, it is still a film, and this is the site of the film. I understand that it’s hard for independent films to find good actors, but wow. The only one, even mediocre, is the excellent Aussie Davis. But even he could not catch up on all the actors (including the one who played him in his youth) is absolutely brutal game. Of course, the script was terribly cliché, but even in this case, you have decent actors! I would not recommend it to anyone, because it is so poorly done in each category. Read some books about the true history of the American Mason, because they give these people the respect they deserve.
