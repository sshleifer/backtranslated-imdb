I don’t give out “alone” often, but if there ever was a film that deserved such kind of attention, it’s “Gas!” It is a smug shit that reaches the atmosphere of M * A * S * H ​​and falls completely indifferent in an attempt. <br /> <br /> I see what Korman wanted - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliot Gould attempted to reproduce the immortal role of Gould in the original version of the film M * A * S * H ​​with a similar plot (in the movie "Smell" - look its here at IMDb, http://www.imdb.com). / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorteinsch and Gould are closer to the copper ring with "Whiffs" than Korman with "Gas!" but not quite to get there. None of these films even came close to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gaz? What not? Nobody comes close to really playing at the level above the theatrical level of high school. Production values ​​stink. Someone else mentioned magically restoring headlights on a car, and more attention is paid to details. Nothing works the way it should be in this film, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" actually put me to bed. This is not a sure cure for insomnia, but very close. On the scale of cinematic induction of sleep "Gas!" lies somewhere between “Last Year in Marienbad” and George Clooney's remake “Solaris” (which itself was more boring than the original Mosfilm, despite the studio’s seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of ​​keeping the audience’s attention through sensible editing) br /> <br /> Proper editing would destroy "Gas!" up to twenty minutes. The result will be meaningless, but no more than the original film. <br /> <br /> Some films are so bad that they have an irresistible quality that is worth watching anyway. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not even funny, not bad.
