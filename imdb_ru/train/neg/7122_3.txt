“Screaming Skull” opens with a warning and offering free disposal services, if you die watching it - now you have a detour! The story itself has a rather interesting premise for a horror movie: a cunning husband marries a rich woman with a history of mental illness, and then tries to convince her that she is going crazy with piercing noises, mysterious knocks and skulls that appear at inappropriate times. Add to the formula a rather creepy gardener, who still keeps the memory of the man’s first wife, to whom he was betrayed. Maybe, just in the 1950s, there was no technology that allowed to shoot some of the scary scenes needed to create a film, the methods used here seem flimsy and mundane. But on the other hand, when I first saw "The House on the Haunted Hill" at the age of nine, he gave me a Hibi-Jibi just as I am sure that this film was made for young viewers of the same era. <br /> <Do not get me wrong, the film is not terrible, sometimes it seems that it is tedious. But on the whole, a huge, but unfurnished, Wheatlock house has some atmospheric tension, and the gardens and the pool are a pleasant touch. For me, the best playable stage is Eric Whitlock (John Hudson), playing manically in the pond, trying to get the hidden skull, he just wanders right in clothes and everything in a mentally backward gardener different from the contrast (directed by Alex Nikol in the role). It makes you wonder who the real jerk was. <br /> <br /> In its own way, perhaps the most shocking thing in the film: how about the neat roadster in which Whitlock first appears at the door of the gull wing? 1958! That at least made me jump out of my seat!
