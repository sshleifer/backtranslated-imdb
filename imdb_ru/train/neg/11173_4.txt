If not for bad dialogues and scenarios. I mean, the direction was really related to his topic. The actors did their best to liven up their characters. But in the end, the only thing that was really missing was a solid script that would hold all the pieces together. I highly recommend not to watch this. Unless you are an al Pacino enthusiast like me, and youâ€™ll watch everything he plays. Even if the result has been pretty bad lately. After S1m0ne this is the second very bad film for this actor who once knew how to choose roles.
