Please note that I have not seen this film since it opened in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not carry it. However, I really want to say something about this. I actually do research at the university for the main character Richard Maurice Buck and I would like to point out that the person on whom they based the main character was actually completely different !!! Hollywood's ideas about people and the artistic license made it possible for the real Dr. Bak to fully support the hysterectomy to cure the madness of women, and would never practice anything more liberal, as presented in the film. I think it's funny to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say that this film has some historical background! The only fact I see is the friendship between Dr. Buck and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time on the film with such disdain for the horror that real women have experienced from this doctor, who is now glorified by the film industry.
