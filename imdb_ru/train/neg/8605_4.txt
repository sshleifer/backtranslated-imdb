This is a slightly interesting blood festival of the late 80s, in which some nasty slugs with the taste of human blood are involved. If you manage to overcome all the absurdity of all this, you can get a little pleasure from it. The acting is terrible, and the plot is simply designed to keep the film between the attacks of the bloody slug, but the film is not a waste of time. The special effects are actually pretty good, and the blood is well done. It reminded me of the remake of Blob, probably because of the subtlety of it all. In general, you could certainly do more with one and a half hours of your time, but I would not advise watching this film if you do not have a strong stomach and you are in such a situation.
