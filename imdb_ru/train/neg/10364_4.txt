The book is so good that, at least, the opening of this film, created especially for television, will interest you, but then, as it disperses more and more from the book, removes all religion, love and mathematics and inserts clich√© wadded candy is getting boring. However, from the comments that I heard, people who have not read this book usually like it, and even if the child reads Wrinkle in Time, it will serve its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Medium a clone of Uncle Mary Poppins "Albert" (I love to laugh). Nothing is so abundant as the characters on the screen laugh merrily at completely unfunny things.
