Earlier today, I argued about why so many people complain about contemporary films, in which I was faced with a curious statement: “character development in new films is simply not as good or interesting as it used to be.” Depending on the movie (s), it can be associated with a number of things, sometimes general special effects and Hollywood junk, like a plot like War of the Worlds, but in the case of excessive, uninteresting attempts, social commentary and desperate struggle to return “Art” in the cinema, it is films like “Days of Dogs” that are to blame. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very high tolerance for films, no matter how boring or meaningless I am. find them (ranging from good, long, such as Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those that I thought were painful, to sit in the spirit of Alpha Dog and the Wild Wild West). I turned off this movie after 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I should have been. I was not interested in any characters, and I did not find anything substantial behind a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the dregs of society, this film is too easily transformed into smug, trivial, and exploitative in a very sincere sense. Of course, I have seen many disturbing films on the same topic, but there are so many better films about depressive, pathetic people (Happiness, Gammo, Children, Fat, Telling Stories, Irreversible) that actually contain characters with great emotional depth and personality. . In Days of Dogs, the eighth-grader was disgusted with society: he decided to ignore any real information about how people really are, and instead decided to be a boring, terrible, and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of “art.” This is not a characteristic of an unknown or clever observation in the dregs of society, it is just boring and worthless to care for.
