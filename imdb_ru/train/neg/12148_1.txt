Honestly, who in the name of God gave this movie a 8.1 rating? I guess the people who actually made or shot the film were the ones who voted. Otherwise, this movie sucks! This film is nothing more than an amateur or perhaps a student film. I'm a movie fanatic, and I saw horrible movies, but there was literally nothing. The story and the action were the worst I've ever seen. Props, including the use of toy airsoft weapons with terrible special effects, where as bad as everything else. I'm all for bad language in movies, but the F-bomb was dropped by about every third word, and I think we may have a winner for using the F-bomb the most in any movie EVERYWHERE camcorders, not really. I expect it to receive awards for an amateur film shown only at public access stations across the country, but it is not recorded on DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say is that it was a terrible waste of a free movie coupon. This is a valuable time that you will never get back. Unfortunately for me, this time is lost, but it is not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, please note this is my warning.
