Please do not hate me, but I have to be honest, watching this film, I had a lot of fun, <br /> <br /> This is a film with a silly line-up and silly songs !!! <br /> <br /> Unnecessary songs !!! Mehuba ... A complete insult to the original Holi ... well ... everything was in order! because of the tradition, every movie should have one !! Chad Raha hi Our Anything ... A REALLY REQUIRED by Ji Le's stupid ... Sounds like a playboy song A silly song ... <br /> <br /> Besides songs. The film was fine. This was Rama Gopal Verma's own adaptation ... If you think so, you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this film depends only on the viewer and on his judgment whether he thinks about it. full movie. Copy, he / she would like to hit her head over the seat in the cinema OR, if he / she thinks about the directors, look, he / she will be relaxed and watch this movie <br /> <br /> In any case I looked at both directions to congratulate and insult Rama Gopal for the disaster he committed ... <br /> <br /> Well, some other things that worried that CAST was incredibly bad <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan Aus Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own film “Make a Funny Film”) Ajay Devgan A Hiro / Veeru (Bobby Deol could be better) Prash ant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek was intended for this role, despite the fact that he did a special Appearance in the song Mehbooba) Sushmita Sen As Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right, Tabu was right for this role) Basanti (I think Es ha-deol would be great) Mohanlal as Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute ... Oh sorry, hehe hehe, he was fine, I couldn't think of anyone ) <br /> <br /> The film would even have been FAIRED a A bit if the cast was okay <br /> <br /> I wasn’t even an exciting movie, the film was just fine, just to watch it <br /> <br /> Overall rating <br /> <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I received a bit of credit to him Cinematography ... 9/10 Scenario ... 3/10 Bad scripts of songs ... 5/10 There was no film in the film necessary, it could be better, Easier on the ears on a PC, iPod and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br /> Sayed Shabbir Ali Nakvi from Pakistan
