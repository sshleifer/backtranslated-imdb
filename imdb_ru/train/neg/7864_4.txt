Hills Have Eyes II is what you expect and nothing more. Of course, this will not be an Oscar-nominated film, it's just pure entertainment, in which you can lose yourself for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is mainly about a group of National Guard trainees who are fighting. against the notorious mutated hills on the last day of their training in the desert. It's just that they fight throughout the film, which involves a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film), since blood and guts are constantly flying around the whole film, as well as another graphic rape scene that is meaninglessly added to shock the audience. <br /> <br /> I would give Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and this is only. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film progressed, as it began to drag out because I continued trying to shock the public with graphic bleeding and a random jumping scene, just to make sure the audience is awake The Hills Have Eyes II - it's just a decent entertainment, time to relax, if you are bored, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
