Slasher ..... well, if you like horrors, you can definitely see it, otherwise don't worry. It is quite obvious that this film has an extremely low budget, for example, it looks as if the whole film was shot in somewhere there is a warehouse, and in many cases you will see the shadow of a microphone boom and a camera, a shadow, believe me, you will not need look for them. Also try to ignore stupid actors, if that's what they are called! Several people decide to go to a game show, where they have to endure the night in a large maze due to the fact that they are 3 killers at liberty, and the one who lives at the end becomes rich. Now there is something in this movie that makes you look, and rarely do you find that with cheap budget horror these days, for example, when I watched it, I thought I did not mind trying this game! especially for $ 12,000,000. anyway, I would recommend that you look at it and make a decision.
