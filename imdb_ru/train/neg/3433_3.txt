This is such a strange film, you can call it terrible, or if you are sitting with friends, it can kill you. Strange comes to mind again and again. I shot it myself, I acted even worse and in the directions, maybe not. The special effects are funny, but the music accompanying the flying demon child will undoubtedly be the biggest hit. See if you have time to kill. But don't even try to take it seriously. Believed to be a tribute to "Porno" ,. Since I have not seen this, from tribute, I can assume that this is just as bad. I had to give him 1/10, but it made me laugh or two, so he gets 3. Excessive blood, the only thing that someone worked on. Stay away if you are squeamish, more bloody than you laugh. I wonder if the manufacturers laughed?
