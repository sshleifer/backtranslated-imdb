For film fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's “Ghosts of the Hill House”) and have never seen the play “Robert Wise” of 1963 with Julie Harris, this remake will seem damn bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have it, it’s just awful. <br /> <br /> Bad behavior (what did Neeson think about?), Stupid computer improvements and further departure from Jackson’s story doom this remake. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and make an original movie. It still scares effectively without special effects. The game is professional and believable. <br /> <br /> For the readers of the book, the year 1963 follows it much closer.
