I made this film the night before, because neither my girlfriend nor I had ever seen it, although we had heard from a mutual friend like “it's great.” <br /> <br /> Now I am rather conservative in my views, but I knew that it would be quite liberal to go into it, given who led it. I assumed that before the film, Michael Douglas would play a sympathetic popular liberal loved by the masses, and an awkward, conservative opponent would become his antagonist. But I thought that it was there that the political statement would begin and end. <br /> <br /> Well, the plot was solid: the lonely president falls in love with a lobbyist. Well, it has potential that I thought was quite interesting, since the plot was unique. But then the film turned into a liberal commercial. The film was more about gun control and environmental issues than about the relationship between the president and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There were several ridiculous prerequisites in this film: 1) a character depicting Sydnie a six-figure lobbyist who is “closer”. Could she be more frivolous? She was constantly disorganized and seemed delighted with everything. Hardly "closer." I am a seller, and she could not “close” the sale of a glass of water to a man dying of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfus playing right fanatic? This is the most liberal person in Hollywood, and she plays the right ideologue. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech at the end was simply ridiculous. The line “I am a proud member carrying an ACLU card” was a joke. Firstly, no president would ever admit this, being an active member of the ultra-right group. Secondly, why even raise something like that. You have just pushed more than half of the viewers of the film, who are moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was great and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the film turned from a “film” into a political statement of the left wing, so the film failed. <br /> <br /> It is a shame to see the great conspiracy destroyed by Hollywood, which forced the audience to impose their political views
