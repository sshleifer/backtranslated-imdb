I saw this film many years ago, and I was impressed ... but again I was only 12 years old. I recently reviewed it and want this time to return. This movie is pretty bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980), if you want to watch the GOOD movie in which he starred ... from Meatballs (also with Bill Murray) for laughs) and Burgess Meredith , this role does not do / did not do anything for his career. <br /> <br /> In any case, Lee Major's character, Franklin Hart, is a great racer who plans to drive his race car (which he had in storage) throughout the country to California. One problem: the government has banned all private transport. I thought the concept was fine (no worse than what I heard), but the performance failed terribly.
