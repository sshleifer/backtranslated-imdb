What a piece of trash in this movie. The premise was fine, but even at the beginning with shit effects to mix in a giant with people of normal size (even the effects in Hercules were better), I knew it would be bad. But the really awful part of the film is the dialogue. It is completely incoherent, stupid and stupid. I felt that it was written by a ninth-grader in a creative class and got a D-. I want to slap Casper van Dim and other actors for watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I had a share of bad and bad films (I love the tremor series), but this ... I do not recommend it at all. This is stupid, and absolutely stunningly bad dialogues will make you cringe.
