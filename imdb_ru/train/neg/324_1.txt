The worst mistake in my life. <br /> <br /> I took this film in Target for $ 5, because I thought: “Hey, this is Sandler, I can laugh a little”. I was wrong, absolutely wrong. In the middle of the film, all three of my friends were sleeping, and I was still suffering. Worst plot, Worst script, Worst movie I've ever seen. I would like for an hour to hit my head against the wall, then I would stop, and you know why? Because it was damn good. After I hit my head, I shoved the damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn ... and it was better than anything I've ever done. American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill just to deal with this shit. I HATE YOU SENDING FOR WHAT THIS IS PRESENT PASSES WITH THIS AND DESTROYING ALL MY DAYS LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
