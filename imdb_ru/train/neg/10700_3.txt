The film tells about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - Member of Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his romance with a character like Amelia Earhart, played by Katherine Hepburn. Until they met, he was a very devoted husband, but when he met the strange but charming Hepburn, he “could not help it,” and they fell in love. You can say, because they look a lot in space and endlessly talk about how painful their unrequited love is. Honestly, it is terribly outdated and almost impossible to watch a movie. Part of the problem is that in the days preceding the Code, films that are glamorous about adultery were very common. In addition, even if you accept this morally suspicious subject, the absolute temptation of the dialogue makes it sound like a 19th century novel ... and really very bad. Sticky and difficult-to-love characters (after all, Clive's wife is a good lady and harmed no one) makes it a big waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this film is the costume Hepburn wears on the early stage, where she is dressed in a butterfly costume! You have to see it in order to believe it - and it looks like one of the bugalis (an obscure but appropriate link).
