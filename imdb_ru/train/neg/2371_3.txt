I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that doesn't mean that I don't like Robert Englund and his other films about “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays better than Freddy Krueger than he does. But, no offense to Robert, this film sucks. The game is terrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddie Krueger is the only part of the cast that is even worth seeing. Sometimes prequels can be better than the first, such as Friday the 13th franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) But this is not one of those films. The original was good, the 2nd, in my opinion, was better, the 3rd was fine, but I don’t, I didn’t see others. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake as me watching this shit.
