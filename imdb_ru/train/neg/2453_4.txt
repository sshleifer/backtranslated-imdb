I could have given this movie a higher rating before the Peter Jackson trilogy came out, but it’s just impossible to see them together. The pace of this film is swift, many important scenes from the book are not taken into account, and the character development is insignificant. Animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoons and live action scenes that have been painted over. And the most disappointing thing about this film is that it is torn in the middle of the story and has never been completed. There are a few good points - the battle scenes are fun to watch, and the dialogue is almost entirely consistent with the book. Check it out if you are in a hurry and can’t spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you will probably be confused, because in this version a lot is missing. 4 out of 10
