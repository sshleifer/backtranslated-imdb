I will be short ... This film confuses everyone except its cinematographer. The fact that this is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems valid as long as we do not “heal” from a protracted dance scene. The plot is ridiculous, no one, except the most ardent fan of terrible horror, will not get anything from it. And for the love of God, please stop saying that this film is a story about lost innocence or even about women's empowerment, because this is clearly not the case (childish, awkward lesbians, what the hell?). it was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival (which I saw anyway), someone even crashed halfway through the film, probably because they could no longer take it. this may seem overly critical, but I really can't find a feature of this film, except maybe if you take it as a pure comedy. In short, this film is best to look at a cocktail of class A drug.
