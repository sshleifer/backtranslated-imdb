just below the surface is what? that film is an atrocity. <br /> <br /> As other viewers rightly commented, the storm sequences are ridiculous. to cut already dense firewood in the pouring rain? now it's clever. to threaten? hunch? sexual tension? for those who read boring and contrived, boring and contrived, boring and overly contrived. <br /> <br /> I want to thank God for the scene in Mia Sarahâ€™s soul, but, looking back, I think that the producers of the film, having seen the completed Disorder, understood that they needed to put something in order to make it half-standing. so it just becomes another trick. do yourself a favor and let it pass.
