The idea of ​​seeing this film was so attractive in the hope that it would justify the magnificence of Charlotte Bronte of the original classic story. I was deeply disappointed to find that this film, which seemed to be either written or shot in a hurry, did not have the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Most of the witty, back-and-forth protagonists, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed either to be absent from the script, or to remain on the floor of the cutting room. There was also no Jane Eyre charismatic self-esteem, which allowed her to suffer from turmoil and triumph over all. Jane Eyre was originally a hero. The woman in this film, it seems, could not win, including one of the greatest parts of the story, when Jane ran away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame for having to ask for bread, the threat of freezing in the cold, all that was needed to run away from a loved one, were, in my opinion, sharp parts of this story left from this film. The title character seemed dry and boring. The story was unattractive, and for those who have not read the book, I can not imagine that this story would be the least interesting. Scenario and direction almost did not affect the classic story.
