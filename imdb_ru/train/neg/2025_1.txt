The show of Howie Mandel and my wife and I am a little amused. I also like Shatner, even when he is in the most deplorable state. <br /> <br /> But this is absolutely the worst show on television. <br /> <Please cancel this show. This sucks **. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that the girls on this show are hotter and seem to wear less clothes than Deal or not ... <br /> <br /> The questions are a mixture of too simple and incredibly obscure. And when I watch Shatner or the participant say “Show me the money,” I have a desire to vomit. <br /> <br /> This one will not last long.
