This budget Italian hybrid of action films and science fiction films shows David Warbeck as a reporter from Miami, whom the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) Have chosen to prevent the evil businessman (nominee for the Oscar John John Ireland) from using the grown telepathic fruit using asteroid disputes to rule the world. Did you get all this? Despite such a foolish plot, in fact it is rather boring, and RAIDERS ATLANTIS scoffs at it with contempt. Honestly, the most (intentionally) creative thing in this film is a small remake of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most unintentionally creative bit includes a scene in a laboratory that is inexplicably shown twice in a row. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to get us in the avant-garde in the twilight of his career? I was going to announce this worst film in Ireland in his resume, but then I saw that CHEERLEADERS SATAN was there. I would also like to state with confidence that I am perhaps the only person in world history who made the double feature of this and Vertico Hitchcock.
