Although this film certainly has the smell of a bad film, it can surprisingly be watched on several levels. First, it is interesting for lovers of old films to see the main role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mick). While Jagger later played a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even having received an Oscar in this category in 12 hours of “HIGH HOUR”), his performance is truly unique, as he actually has a complete head (I have never seen him ) this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film simply shows that if an actor cannot play in his earlier films, this does not mean that he cannot ultimately learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (SILVER BOWL) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The second reason to watch a movie is its slight obscenity. everything. Scripture is bad, the game is bad, special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian roam the water, it is obvious that they actually just walk in place, and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus, as soon as they get out of the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! The terrible continuity and insanely bad dialogue abound throughout the film - so much so that it’s hard to imagine why they didn’t ask Bela Lugoshi or George Zucco to star in the film - since both of them were shot in many class z horror films for a movie about not making a movie. <br /> <br /> So, if you give him 3, this is perhaps a bit overly generous, laugh at him and briefly fun, so you should look for bad movie fans.
