This film fails miserably at every level. I have an idea, let's take all the participants of this film and send them to a hot zone in the Middle East. Perhaps, if we are lucky, they will all be shot, and we no longer have to waste time. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a bunch of cinematic crap in my whole life? My God, I can't think of anything that I have ever seen, that it was so bad. I would prefer to watch Ishtar 25 times in a row, than to sit 10 minutes sorry for the movie. If I ever meet someone who participated in this film, I spit in their faces, and then I beat them senselessly. This is my two cents.
