I would not recommend it if you are not passionate about David Copperfield and do not want to "complete the set." There are some good performances (for example, Uriah Heep) and well-directed moments (for example, beatings), but in general it really fades compared to the 1999 BBC version, as well as earlier versions. <br /> <br /> There are unexplained changes in history that do not really serve any big purpose, with the possible exception of muffling (stolen jewelry is a good example). American actors were poorly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but sheâ€™s not right, like Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is only slightly better than Cockney Dick Van Dyke. I understand why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Micawber; however, he is too rude and annoying. He also speaks his lines with an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes just ridiculous. Anthony Andrews is threatened as Mr. Merdstone, but you can expect him to put on a black raincoat and tie David's mother to the railway line (although this may be partly Dickens' fault). <br /> <br /> I got it for free with a newspaper. It helped to pass on Sunday afternoon, but I felt rather disappointed than enchanted at the end.
