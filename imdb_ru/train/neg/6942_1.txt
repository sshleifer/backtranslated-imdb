This thing is really terrible. There is no character with weight, they all swim in BG. Motion Capture is a great toy, but this film demonstrates that you really need people who know animation to make an animated film. MACHINE CAN'T MAKE YOURSELF. If you consider it a strange film, you will have fun finding errors in continuity ... In a 3D film !!! It's funny to watch the princess's dress move, like a thing with different physics. You need animators and 3D animators, not data records that 3D-programs know. Pay attention to connections such as elbows, as they lose volume and deform. The person who made the character design (very good), probably suffered when he watched them move - because it cannot be said that they came to life.
