I really liked this movie to the end. Of course, it was stupid and rather unlikely, but still it kept my attention on a rainy day. Until the end, it is. What does the protagonist do for her last performance at the prestigious classical conservatory, where she struggled to catch up with other classically trained students? Wow them with her understanding and performing this time revered musical traditions? Not. She tortures and kills the great sensual Habanera from Carmen and turns her into a completely forgotten pop song Brittany Spears. My ears were bleeding! And at the highest moment of horror, her teacher gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher not participating in Spears' fantasies would have let her down on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
