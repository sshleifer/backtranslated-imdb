This film can not be watched if you are not trying to commit suicide. I think this film can cause serious brain damage. The main characters are a tearful, not Kevin hero, Amy, his stupid, godlessly conservative girl, Kyle, a redhead in a red shorts who loves phone sex, Daphne, a skinny, horny girl who is supposed to be “cool” and has no feeling, how to dress, and her overloaded boyfriend Nick, an army recruit who can make hints of anything. No, I'm not a pervert, it is REALLY how the movie goes. The film itself is a perverted 1986 Gremlins game, but you will not find any trace of Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, provoked by the Wimpy Man (sorry Kevin), make someone’s wildest dreams a reality, and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it - in the end, they end up in a strip club, where Amy’s know-it-all dream is revealed - She wants to become a stripper! Listen, I watched this movie through MST3K, and even when Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot taunted this cinematic train wreck, and it still made me bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I would like to. I no longer give you a conspiracy, because experiencing this gives me a great desire to pierce the pitchfork in my brain. In addition, it is not necessary to mention the conspiracy. They must put the Surgeon's General Warning in this film.
