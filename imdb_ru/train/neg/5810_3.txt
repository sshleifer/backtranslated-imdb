Spoilers through: <br /> <br /> Gettaway is basically an action movie. And what action there is !! Shootout, chase, garbage containers and much, much more. It filmed Kim Basendzher and Alec Baldwin as McCoy. <br /> <br /> This is a remake, and I didn’t see the original, but I really didn’t care about it, although Basendger and Baldwin have a good screen. chemistry. But the film itself did not do this for me. <br /> <br /> Gettaway became very tiresome very quickly. The plot is overshadowed by one battle / chase after another, and as the violence continues to accumulate, Basendzher and Baldwin retain their magnificent appearance, no matter what dangers they may be. In fact, by the end of the film, they almost look BETTER than in the film. Start. I do not think that the eye makeup of Bassenger changes once for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I’ve ever seen, of course not, but it’s not very good, and if only an action movie purist I don’t see, I really enjoy this film because it’s not so much. The retreat is also not very original, and goes from unnecessarily cruel to rather boring. I think it could be better. <br /> <br /> Basenzher and Baldwin perform well, but they have nothing to do except to chase their lives. Sometimes less means more, after you see the same thing again and again, it becomes stale. Didn't really like this one.
