Slash is a film about students who shoot a film. This is very much like a scream, an ironic, self-referential horror movie that, at least for me, falls because, for all its irony, it is still just a bad horror movie, just like the movies it refers to. br /> <br /> But it was not without its charms. Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic, like a spoiled, harsh American actress who hated every minute of work with an amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that it was tempting to believe that this was not an act, although everyone associated with Cut said that it was a pleasure to work with her. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of her sulk, sulk or pop was gorgeous. Everyone else, however, hesitated between being fine and being awfully wooden. <br /> <br /> In any case, “Cut” has a few laughs, a few buckets of blood (some of them are surprisingly terrible), and in the end it is ... just another bad horror movie.
