I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented a DVD from Blockbuster .. Actually, I know one of the actresses from the movie ... I won’t say who ..! (It is kept secret ...) But I must admit that it was not as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini? I hats off to this guy .. But it's a shame that he was not in the film for a long time .. The disadvantage of the film is the idea, the script, the sound, etc. It may look like a good movie ... but it wasn’t that interesting. . <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad my sister paid £ 10 for renting 3 DVDs from Blockbuster ... I chose this one ... and was disappointed. Anyway, the thumbs down for me ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
