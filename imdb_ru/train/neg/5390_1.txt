Make no mistake, this is neither horror nor really a movie. I highly recommend not watching this 82-minute setback; The only reason he deserved a star is the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that an unexpected turn might occur, a hint of surprise, a plot that will appear, but no. <br /> <br /> Characters in their actions change their rhythm, but so far He has no time to develop - thanks to economical editors and frankly shameful writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (evoking teenage rock montage) state . The only thing that could worsen the situation was to add a perishable ethnic “companion”. <br /> <br /> Their collision with obstacles (physical or physical) is brief, confusing and completely pointless. <Br /> <br /> Chris Pine struggles to stay on the surface, drowning in trouble from an easy throw. Lou Taylor Pucci could not dry if he spent the summer with Keanu Reeves, combing the Navad desert. <br /> <br /> Watch “Road”, watch “28 days later”, watch daytime television ... anything but that; I beg you. Suffering from boredom, unlike you may believe in a film, this film is not a cure.
