It seems that everyone is just delirious about this and do not notice how the film was made. A deaf, dumb guy is good, a loser wins is good, cricket is great, but the film is generally average. I think that this can be done much better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable for a film that is not based on real events. I'm sure the film could be more interesting. The songs were simply inserted there, and I had to literally promote scenes in which the same thing would show from different angles. <br /> <br /> Although a good game. Watchable.
