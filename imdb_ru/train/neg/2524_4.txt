Title: Robot Jocks (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Cast: Gary Graham, Ann Marie Johnson, Paul Coslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon, whom we usually associate with horrendous horror horror films, such as Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, made a short detour and made a small science fiction film. I emphasize the word “small”, as this is a very modest budget, and this is its main weakness. <br /> <br /> History happens in the future. A world in which the great superpowers (according to this film, the United States and Russia) overcome their differences not in a full-scale world war, but in battles in the style of gladiators with giant robots. Our hero Achilles must go against an evil Russian robot fighter named Alexander. It turns out a lot of cheap stop motion animation. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is amazing, I think. Great nations resolving territorial disputes with giant robots? An interesting premise and one that could be handled properly if the proper budget were available. Unfortunately, what could have been a funny movie ultimately became an embarrassment for another great director. <br /> <br /> I really liked this film as a child, and I think if you want to enjoy this film, you will have to return to the mode of a small child to have fun with it. I showed this film to some of my friends, and as it developed, my friends said what the hell is this piece of shit, Franco? And it seems to me that this film is a science fiction film of one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon? ". But when the film moved to a banal territory, I almost wanted to stop, not allowing them to go through this torture. I could get through this. This is because I loved this film as a child, and watching it is still accompanied by a little nostalgia. But everyone else just won't get it. <br /> <br /> And I myself realized that the film is not 'It's really that good. First of all. The film is about giant robots expelling each other to hell. And in order to achieve this in a reliable way, you have to use damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects would help viewers to suspend disbelief. But, unfortunately, this is a small film from a small company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!), The effects only help us to giggle and laugh at them. Sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half inspected. <br /> <br /> OK Of course, once you agree that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animations and thumbnails, you can somehow succumb to the film and even enjoy how big robots knock each other out of a rut. There are certain scenes when robots fight, something is awesome, and made me go "that's why I liked this movie!" But everyone knows, and they, some kind of crap effect will take you right out of that little protective cocoon in which you tried to hide. And boom, your right back in the implementation of this film simply does not match his plan. <br /> <br /> And one more thing that worried me a bit about the film. This film is mainly a film for children. Do you know giant robots throw it? Stop motion tween? Hello? But this dialogue of films had many sexual hints, and the violence becomes a bit bloody. So I kept asking myself, is this a children's film or not? After a while, I just came to the conclusion that it was basically a children's film with an adult feeling, which is actually not a very good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who don’t feel so naive Baby charm in the form of two robots fighting each other, and if you don’t have a nostalgic connection with this film (like mine), I would advise you to stay away from this. Gordons is an excellent director, but this film that he made is just not for me. Well, at least not now, when I'm an adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 of 5
