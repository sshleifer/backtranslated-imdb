If you like completely frivolous, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-institutional, anti-civilization juveniles, then this is the perfect movie. A very poorly written script, with often unintelligible dialogue and tediously tedious handheld camera, this film represents the world in a strikingly simplistic, Manichaean expression: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are at best insensitive and clumsy and predatory monsters at worst . The only way out of the horrors of civilization as a whole is a multitude of primitive screams (yawn) and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive cave space in the forest, where utopia takes the form of a rave party - again, into the forest (naturally ...). Displays all the flaws of the first movie and more.
