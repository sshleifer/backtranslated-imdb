When I was in school, I made a film about a couple wandering through trees and talking, and halfway through editing, I realized that this was not just an unsuccessful aesthetic strategy, but a cliche for Canadian cinema. burdened strikes on social commentary. But whatever the flaws of my own film, I feel much better seeing this ... this ... thing. First, I had 20 minutes, not 85, and I had more pleasure: all meaningless things here were spoiled for four, five, six unremitting minutes. Male leadership is simply unbelievable: a pummeling, loud cry that comes from flashes of dramatic class improvisations between the philosophical views taken from the U of T pub, and he is given plenty of space to make us hate him. Admittedly, if he were not such a hole, then the third action would have even less sense, as a pair of sarcastic guys appear to provide distant and completely useless echoes of the values ​​of “exploitation”; but it doesn’t make it easier to watch the hoarse scream in the "please" cage close up, until the magazine ends. I come back to what I said about AUTUMN BIRTH, which at least had the boldness of its own inept depravity: this cinematic crater is and will remain the worst Canadian film of all time. At least I really hope so.
