I admit that I don’t expect much from Roger Corman’s movie. In general, I expect a lot of walks and bad scenarios. And yet in this case, I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> “Shooter” is the story of a woman (played by the playful Beverly Garland) who becomes the sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. Miss Garland shot herself pretty well, killing one of the killers the next day at her husband's funeral. Her first task is to close the local bar, which violates the curfew of the city. The owner of the bar is trying to buy land in anticipation of the redemption of the (desired) railroad. However, Miss Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bartender hires a man to kill Miss Garland. <br /> <br /> Since Miss Garland plays her part honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers "She is the Sheriff" is joking. With the exception of a pair of false testimony (the door of the apartment, which opens outwards from the inside, traces of jeeps and two horsemen waiting on the screen for their signal to roll around the corner), the film becomes quite tolerable as a fare to the cinema. However, Korman could not refrain from filling his film with riding scenes, just as he walks in other films. <br /> <br /> Sterno says that “Shooter” is a horse opera, which is worth your time.
