Being a big fan of only the first 2 BSG seasons and a separate BSG Razor feature, I was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. I usually have no problems with science fiction, which is mainly based on dialogue, as opposed to the visual bonus of special effects. If the script is closely related to the original ideas of good actors, you can create a deep film with little CGI cost. This prequel is not one of the above requirements. The virtual reality world created by teenage terrorists was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene was simply placed there to raise the release rating to Restricted. Not that teenagers dislike virtual reality pits filled with sex, violence and heavy dance music. It’s part of those teenagers with intellectual depth and intelligence or political and religious passion to create such futuristic programs or become suicide bombers, which puzzles me. These children are definitely not from this planet. The film is played as a soap opera, only the last 10 minutes are a bit interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz, giving his cyborg a divine conscience through a student’s firmware update, was funny, if not entertaining. But this old concept was much better depicted and more believable in the brilliant, classic original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica picks up her only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. There is nothing surprising! Overall, this film was boring, unoriginal and cheap, using Kaprika's reworked computer graphics from BSG. I doubt that I will watch this cosmic soap when it is aired on Sci-Fi. Unless, of course, I suffer from a fit of insomnia, then this show will definitely become a cure. Zzzzzzzz
