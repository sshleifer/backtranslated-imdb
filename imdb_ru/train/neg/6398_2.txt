In the early 1980s, Richard Pryor ran down the street in a fire, must have somehow influenced him. In his position, he jokes about it, getting a big laugh. It seemed that he had done something with the participation of the projects he had chosen. "Toy" is the worst of all whom he has ever chosen, except for "One more you." <br /> <br /> A film where a white man buys a black man to his son? A good little political incorrectness in front of you was such a thing. This is the vision of Richard becoming all sentimental, which made me finally go to the end. I wanted Pryor to catch up with this child, instead he becomes a misunderstood child, nausea! At least Gleason had his moments. Do not pay attention to it and see how Pryor is with Gene Wilder or any of his 70s things. This is a waste of time for any viewer!
