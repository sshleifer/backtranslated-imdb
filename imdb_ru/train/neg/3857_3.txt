I was hoping that this film would be a bit interesting, like other genres. However, it was not convincing, and I did not laugh very much. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rental to waste, and you need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it would probably be funny if the script were better. Jason Lee may be hilarious, and he gets some laughter here and there, but the film fails. Just do not go watch it. The direction is dim, but for him the leadership is not so important. I assume that its main disadvantage is that it is simply not very funny. See something else, do not waste your time here.
