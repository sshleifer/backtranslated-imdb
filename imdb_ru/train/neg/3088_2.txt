1. Aliens resemble plush toys and hand puppets, although their hands do not work. <br /> <br /> 2. Aliens have mastered the intergalactic space journey, but they do not know how to open the unlocked vault door, but can open the door, which is closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. Old guards know how to get hold of C4, and just wait for the right time to use it, for example, when they are suddenly fired without an explanation. <br /> <br /> 4. Obviously, several sessions of the “battle for garden tools,” including pirouette, were held in the US Army training camp in the 1980s. - <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your noble girlfriend, you have to "save the world ... make mistakes ... the surroundings" from aliens. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are whores, openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Scummy nightclubs are like bad visitors. <br /> <br /> 8. “Scummy” waitresses act as dancers for Fontanelles (how did they talk about this?), who can only do bad dance moves of the 60s. <br /> <br /> 9. Ordinary armies secretly dream of becoming Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. The grenades seem to have a setting for “flash”. <br /> <br /> 11. Burning alive, apparently, leaves one person with minor burns on his hands. <br /> <br /> 12. The sergeants of the US Army headquarters are obviously always in the area and do nothing with the newcomers in the area. <br /> <br /> 13. The aliens seem to always “go home,” which means returning to the vault where they were unlocked. <br /> <br /> 14. Aliens are attracted by a bright light, which apparently means that in the Los Angeles area the home of the protagonist is the most brightly lit thing in the area. <br /> <br /> 15. Showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the viewer demand more. <br /> <br /> 16. Vans of the 80s obviously have a terrible suspension. <br /> <br /> 17. The comedy must take place in this film. <br /> <br /> 18. The horror must occur in this film. <br /> <br /> 19. In this film, a parody and homage should occur. <br /> <br /> 20. This film treats insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Apparently, garden tools make electronic keyboard noise whenever they are used, and not just in fights (say that I am not the only one who noticed this). <br /> <br /> The simple truth is that this film has just failed, Period. There is not much meat on the bone, and it does not work very well. Even the average. This is just bad. However, I have seen much worse, and the rake-battle scene is pure comedic gold, intentional or not. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse than that. At least the film never took itself seriously.
