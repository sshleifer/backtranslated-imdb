If you like derivatives and predictable thrillers with rape, then you will have a rare pleasure ... I really don’t like them, so I couldn’t find a single thing that could redeem this strange story. It seems like something straight from the 1980s, a different age, when it would go straight to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work well with a weak script and a tiresome script. But what does Gillian Anderson do in a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock on the BBC television adaptation at Bleak House last year? It is said that the director was influenced by the evidence of rape and his work on documentaries, but even this does not justify the bizarre scene where a pack of village hounds beat Dyer. I don't think I was the only laughing man in the movie. What I can not understand is the participation of the companies that created this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - The Straightheads do not deserve mention in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best thing you can do? What independent British filmmakers are going to make from your artistic judgment? This is a big spot on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: do you hear thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair?
