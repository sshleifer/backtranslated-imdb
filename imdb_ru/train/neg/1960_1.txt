I tried to finish this movie three times, but this is terrible. Case in point: mom and daughter drive up to bed and breakfast, mom stops on gasoline, a crazy gas station is strangely angry with her husband, the manager of the B & B, trying to rape her. She escapes, goes to B & B and instead of courage becomes ballistic, and she wants to call the police, the story just continues with warm behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other shortcomings of action logic abound. Acting is also very warm, and the warning of the nearest neighbor is delivered at a really banal, badly acting moment. <br /> <br /> The moments of intense bleeding / death are unevenly intertwined with warm scenes of interaction between time and filler between the characters. br /> <br /> Less focus on blood, more attention to mood and history would be appreciated.
