I watched it, knowing almost nothing about it, except for a brief description I read here. After seeing it, I was originally going to say that the director is promising, but it seems a little amateur, then I looked at other things he did to see if it was his first or second film, but no, he starred in the movie on the ghost Â»Fear Dot Com. He somehow did not get into both films, and with this was the same thing. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible too, can someone just fall in love with a girl because she is pretty, but does she have a child's mind? I gave him 3, because there were some visual effects that I rather liked at the end, but overall this movie is pretty awful.
