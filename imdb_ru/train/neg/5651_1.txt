In my life I have seen many wonderful and terrible films. I am not an expert in professional reviews, but I definitely have something to say about this. Firstly, these actors are the worst I've ever seen ... Their game is so unreal that you even want to throw out the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another terrible thing about these dialogs - they are so lame. You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems your 14-year-old son could do better. I feel that the budget of this film was comparable to the cost of my 14-year-old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message reaches you, save your time and money.
