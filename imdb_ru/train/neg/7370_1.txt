I have seen a lot of Seagal films, and although most of them are not very good, or even not very good, this cool bunch has lowered the bar for bad films. <br /> <br /> Story: not really sure. Something about a drug that makes you crazy and strong or something like that. Who are the good and bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the film is episodic scenes in which people in dark rooms go back and forth, complaining about how good the character of Seagals is "Meshall". <br /> <br /> Action: Strikes. <br /> <br /> Voice duplication ,,,,,, What was with the terrible voice overlay ?! Could they have found someone who sounded like Seagal? Maybe Cheech or Chong did offscreen voices, maybe at least it was interesting then. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely stupid. Avoid this at all costs !!!!
