“Kill me later” has an interesting initial premise: a suicide woman (Selma Blair) is on the verge of jumping from the top of an office building protected by a bank robber (Max Beazley) who promises to “kill her later.” <Br /> <br /> Real fulfillment of this premise, however, fails, since almost every action serves as a simple means for moving the plot to its predictable end. Unusually written characters that show no motive for their behavior jeopardize the quality of action of all. The lack of depth of character especially reduces the performance of Selma Blair, whose character Sean ranges from sullenness to acting, and ultimately looks confused. This is unfortunate, as in other circumstances, Miss Blair is an attractive and capable actress. <br /> <br /> The challenge for the worst is the persistence of director Dana Lustig in using fast cuts, inappropriate special effects (for example, searching for an unintentionally fun infrared motorcycle chase at the end) and a hip soundtrack hoping to attract viewers to MTV. Of course, Ms. Lustig proves that she is capable of mastering the technical side of directing, but her ability in no way helps to overcome the problems inherent in the film, and therefore the film is delayed to the end. Clearly, Lusztig has an excellent visual style; however, it may be better suited for music videos than for feature films. <br /> <br /> The producers (Ram Bergman and Lustig) deserve praise for their ability to realize this film: they were able to scare up to $ 1.5 million. to finance the film, get a good cast and get domestic and foreign distribution. This is no small feat for an independent film. However, given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
