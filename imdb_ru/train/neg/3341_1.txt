I just rented this film to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I have not seen in any film since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this film was a big disappointment. The game of all sides was bad, with the exception of Mr. Lundgren, who was fine. There was something pleasant on Kata Dobo, despite her ridiculous outfit and makeup. <br /> <br /> The plot is not at all clever, it is repeated a million times in different films. The fraudsters were completely stereotyped, and there was no depth in Lundgren's character. I really did not expect a cinema masterpiece, but, unfortunately, this is not even a decent action. Every turn of the plot is extremely predictable, and an incredible amount of incredible unrealistic characters and comic characters began to annoy me very much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to young children who want a joking action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I believe that the current average voice of 7.0 with 6 votes may have been influenced by someone who contributed to the production of this film)
