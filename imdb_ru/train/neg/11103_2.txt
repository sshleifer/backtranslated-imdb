So, I just watched the movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was a decent movie, except for the storyline, which was stupid and horrible ... First, we will never know anything about beings, why did they appear, what do they do in our world, and were they really on Earth before us, or did they just come from space? Secondly, the role of the butcher in maintaining order is just so obvious ... Indeed, how big could the underground be for the substation? There were only very many such creatures, so I think that instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have just thrown a few tactical bombs or, perhaps, cleaned them, and nuclear weapons would do the job. I know it sounds ridiculous, and it’s so, but I don’t think that killing people MUST BE ... Thirdly, Leon behaves like Superman jumping on a train and fighting with Vinnie Jones, who was much taller and bigger . On the other hand, when he encounters a conductor, he does nothing and acts like a wimp, watching all the abominations. I mean, the conductor had terrible help (laughs), but if Leon were so brave, he would have gone all the way ... I mean, he first risks his life and then does nothing exactly when had. He could have died like a hero, but he would have lived like a coward ... it could have been like this, but not after he had shown so much courage before ... Then, a police thing ... come on! It was a city with a subway, I bet there must have been other policemen besides that lady, other police stations, it was pretty stupid ... In general, Vinnie Jones's great game, an interesting idea, right up to the reason it was not built at all ... By the way, what did the signs on the chest mean? Winnie Jones can not catch up ...
