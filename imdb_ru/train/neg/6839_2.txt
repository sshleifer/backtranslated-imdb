Twin brothers, separated at birth (due to the death of their parents), reunite twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and pick up their million-dollar tunnel. A double strike lasts two hours and practically does not add a real approach to the plot of the Corsican brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme, although adequate, because the evil twin brother just bothers you, like a good twin brother. Also this time the sequence of actions is not so exciting, and Jean-Claude relies more on shooting than on his martial arts. Also, the cast is lost, and after two hours the film is just boring. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
