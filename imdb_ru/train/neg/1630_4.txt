Mary Pickford becomes the leader of the Scottish clan after the death of her father, and then has a romance. As one of the commentators, Snow Leopard, said, the film is quite episodic to begin with. Something funny, for example, when Pikford beats his clans into the church, and something only there. In general, the story is weak, especially the reworked, contrived romantic storyline and its culmination. The show is so dark that it is difficult to appreciate the landscape, but even if you consider that this is not the best work of director Maurice Turner. Pikford and Turner again united in a somewhat more accessible "Poor little rich girl", depicting Pickford as a child.
