Okay, so I was impatient to see this movie. Puzzled about the “who is who” in the land of horrors that is in the film ... well, my friend took it down, brought it, and we started to watch it. It should be a comedy .... I didn’t even smirk ONCE until 40 minutes had passed. <br /> <br /> Is it related to the budget? Not at all, in fact, there are films that stand ANYTHING CLOSE TO AN ABSOLUTE, and they are awesome (for me anyway) Moreover, while watching this film, I could not help but recognize the similarities (for example, theft) the film “ACTRESS APOCALYPSE”, read my review about it (this is DESTROYING this film, by the way). <Br /> <br /> This film ... he had the potential that he really did. He had a "star power", a stolen plot (let's shoot behind the scenes of filming ... That is ... "ACTRESS ACTRESS" ... seriously, it angers me more and more, what I think) ... it really could be ridiculous. A LOT OF, A LOT OF JOBS didn’t work. With acting, everything is in order. But it was delayed, it was not funny, and the plot was completely stolen. <br /> <br /> I give it two, because it was not COOO HORRIBLE, but this is the ONLY reason.
