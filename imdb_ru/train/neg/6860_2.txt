Besides the fact that there are crazy people and there are religious nuts. <br /> <br /> In most cases, characters do not make sense. <br /> <br /> The film has no real beginning, middle or ending, and nothing explains a lot. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young man with an unlikely name Hazel Motes, apparently returning from the army. <br /> <br /> He gets to a two-story house, which is in very poor condition, the windows are boarded up. He enters the house, walks and finally writes a note that he leaves there. This scene does not lead to anything, and we no longer learn anything about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It is not exactly known whose house this is or where people left, but we got the impression that Hazel might have lived there once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to the city. Why - we do not know. Arriving in this city, he writes down the name and address, which he sees on the wall of the bathroom, and goes to visit this woman who is surprisingly fat. For some time he sees her, and then, apparently, he no longer sees her. Like everything else in this film, it leads to nothing and does not make sense. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch tries to make friends with him, but Hazel is really not interested, although they continue to intersect. <br /> Enoch as crazy as you can imagine. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are, and talk insultingly to them. <br /> <br /> We really never know why Enoch behaves the way he does, or why Hazel behaves like he does, besides the fact that Hazel had an overdose of an old scary, fundamentalist religion through his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Later, Enoch is fond of a man who wears a gorilla suit, and he manages to get a gorilla suit from him, and then runs in it. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who is pretty coiled and seems to be in constant frontier rage, preaches a little on the street. I got the impression that he was trying to free himself from the wrong of the religion that was thrown into him. <br /> <br /> He had several meetings with the preacher and his daughter, although their interaction never makes anything special and the storyline is missing. <br /> <br /> In the end, Hazel gives in to religious zeal and begins to hurt himself. <br /> <br /> This is a very strange movie. Interestingly, this is strange, but apart from this, absolutely nothing happens in it. <br /> <br /> The cast does outstanding work, but this film does not provide either a point of view or a plot line. <Br /> <br /> There are also characters in the film who occasionally rush around the letter N, having no connection with the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
