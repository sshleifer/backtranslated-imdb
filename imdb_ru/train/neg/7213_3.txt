Although I certainly consider The Exorcist horror classics, I must admit that I do not treat him with the same high esteem as many other horror fans. As a consequence of this, I have not seen many exorcist robberies, and if Exorcism is something to go through, I must say that this is a good thing, because this film is boring as hell and definitely not worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to other exorcist robberies, this is often considered one of the worst, and perhaps this was not the best place for me to start. It is not difficult to guess what the plot will be: basically it is the same as in Exorcist, and sees how the girl is obsessed with demonic spirit (which, as it turned out, is the spirit of her dead father). Then the village priest is called to perform the exorcism. As in many Spanish horror films, Paul Nashi has appeared in this film, which is largely the best in the film. Exorcism was led by Juan Bosch, who had previously led a derivative of the Spanish Jallo "Worn killer gloves." I have not seen any of his other films, but based on these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strengths. I can't say much good about the movie itself; basically it's just nonsense, and the scene of exorcism is not worth the wait. I certainly do not recommend it!
