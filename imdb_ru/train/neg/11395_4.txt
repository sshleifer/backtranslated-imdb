Not exactly a new storyline, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and an awesomely beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale) meet by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other. Although both are promised to others ... strangely enough, they still feel that their soulmate is somewhere . A bit juicy in some places, but in living love. Being a romantic, I almost have to be chained. My favorite scene is when Cusack lies on the ground and the snow begins to fall. The finale is almost too sweet, but the most worthy. This is not one of Cusack's deepest roles, but who in Hell cannot be hit by Beckinsale. Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon have provided significant support. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is quirky and funny. Watch it with your other half.
