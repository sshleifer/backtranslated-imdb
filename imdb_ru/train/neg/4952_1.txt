Well, I've always been a Batman fan. I loved the animated series and even Batman beyond. I even read the Batman comic from time to time. So, as you can imagine, I was a bit excited when I heard about this series, and then I was VERY disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like one long commercial. No depth at all. And what the hell was with the joker? Who, in my humble opinion, is Batman's best villain of all time, and they killed him. I would like to say that its design was the worst. In fact, I would like to say that there was something creative or interesting in this series. In short, (because, believe me, I could say a lot more), DO NOT waste your time on this show or your money.
