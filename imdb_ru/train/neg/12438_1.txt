The victory over the bad guys ... Again, this is the key phrase for this film, there is so much truth in it. <br /> <br /> Home One on One, classic movie. One for three and four, good movie, if you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, however hard you try, it is not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Lienz or something else. He is a very mild actor with mild performances, but this is not entirely his fault; in the composition, soft vocabulary and soft expressions were required. The jokes are simply copied from the first two with different rogues, and you must be blind to think that this chicken pox is real. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher who shows this film on a rainy day. And, even worse, a completely different cast, see if you believe me, but you will regret it.
