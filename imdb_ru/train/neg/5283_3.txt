I looked forward to the first show of this film since it was presented to me on DVD for Christmas. Having reserved a special slot for this last night, I enjoyed watching it with my daughter (17 years old and a cinema student), of course, waiting, with chocolate. We love Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> After two minutes, we realized that we were drowned. Shaky shots and angles, poor cinematography, directing and wooden performances have already made us feel flat and dissatisfied. The despondency we looked at. <br /> <br /> Ann, played by Sally Hawkins, several times looked strange and without a special purpose, directly into the camera, smashing our hard-won "fantasy of the moment" and drawing us right into almost "I will find you" in pursuit of . <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and guidance, bless him. I hope they paid him well, however, because he was actually drowned by a huge wave, which, as expected, broke through the sea dike, sinking him and his coauthor. They were almost swept into the sea. Health and safety would have a field day! Poor Rupert had to spit out the sea water to deliver his line. Presumably, the cat did not have enough money to re-release this scene. In any case, anyone who has a meaning would not try to do it on such a day. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige played the only convincing role as Lady Russell, but her efforts were soon balanced. Judging by the unconvincing image of Anthony Head annoying Sir Walter Elliot. <br /> <br /> By the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth seemed strangely graciously visiting Ann every two seconds, trying his best to avoid her for most of the film. As if he had a memory problem, because of which he forgot the very reason for his existence. In contrast, Anne ran with hyperventilation from pillar to pillar in search of a good captain, who in the meantime managed to summon almost all of the Bath we are told about in just three or four minutes without even worrying. <br /> <br /> We have not experienced any of Annâ€™s delights crossing the screen. In fact, we were struck by the fact that the charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen a simple, characterless, insensitive Ann and why someone, someone, said nothing bad, forcing Sir Walter to just shut up. <br /> <br /> The decisive kiss, usually our favorite moment with the girl, was painfully tightened. As they approached, Ann continued to open and close her mouth, which on the screen made her look as if she was chewing gum before her lips finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The sweetest thing of last night was candy and a half-hour exchange between mother and daughter about how bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> What a pity It is to destroy such an enchanting and exciting story, filmed in one of the best landscapes of England. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Jane.
