I saw this film on the weekend, and, although I was impressed, as always, with the beauty and polishing of the films created by the Church, I was disappointed that this film was so short without informing the participants and leaving many questions to the investigators without an answer. <Br /> <br /> In the film, 70 minutes of the vignettes from the life of Joseph Smith. This is not a real biopic because there is no real coherent narration. Most of the episodes are related to Joseph doing good deeds, playing baseball, racing and laughing with children, often in slow motion. What a wonderful, just folk guy who was Joseph, eh? Look at him, who beats the rugs for his wife Emma. Well, what about the rugs of their 33 multiple wives ?? Not to mention polygamy. A clear omission. <br /> <br /> And it is in such omissions that the film is interrupted. He provides too little information and makes critical members of the audience think, WHY Joseph gets pitch and feathery, WHY he is thrown in jail and WHY this crowd wants to kill him? The culmination of the film, of course, is the journey of Joseph and Hyrum to the prison of Carthage (passing by the present United Nations of people looking from the doors of Nauvoo). But WHY is not mentioned. Nothing that Smith suppresses the newspaper Nauvoo Expozitor and orders its press, destroys it for revealing the secret doctrine of polygamy. The audience is left to wonder or suggest that this is just a more baseless persecution of the Church. No mention was made of the fact that Joseph was charged with high treason for declaring martial law and calling the police in Nauvoo. <br /> <br /> Of course, I didn’t expect that this film, shot by the Church, will present the recent rough copy of Joseph Richard Bushman’s The Rough Stone. Rolling, but I was surprised and puzzled by how little matter was actually represented. <br /> <br /> And even worse, what was presented was often inaccurate. Two examples jumped at me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows how Joseph reads from gold plates bound with two rings, which were actually hidden away from the place. It is well known that Joseph made his translation, with his face buried in his hat and peering at the stone of the seer. The second inaccuracy occurs in the prison of Carthage, where the mob is storming the camera. Church history reports that Joseph had six shooters, and he even shot several times before jumping out of the window and giving a Masonic distress call (as reported in Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Perhaps a demonstration of the reality of the shootout would have destroyed the heartbreaking mood that the filmmakers created, but by omitting it, they were wrong stories and could not show Joseph as he really was: with arms and able to protect themselves. In fact, the film gives the impression that Joseph was a good guy, but at the same time was something like a cake with milk, which everyone beat up, was thrown into prison and eventually killed in cold blood. He was far away from that; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured many difficulties and efforts to put what he believed into. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, but know that it is cotton candy. Then take the meat and potatoes by reading Bushman’s Smith Smith biography, Rough Stone Rolling. <br /> <br /> ps. The works created by the church do not have titles, but experienced eyes can highlight a pair of familiar faces. Rick Macy is great in the role of Joseph Smith Sr. and Bruce Newbold, beloved as Thomas in "Finding Faith in Christ," here is a naughty Methodist minister who could not show Christian love to a young seeker of truth.
