I love all the books of Tom Robbins, so I was very interested to watch a movie based on one of his books. I knew that there would be no way for the film to capture at least half of Robbins' magic, but after watching the movie I never wanted to read the book again. In the film “Even the cowherd boys get the cyanosis” is not the eighth part of the content in the book, and it seems that more attention is paid to the love relationship between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than to anything else. Along with the incredibly weak storyline in the film, I think that the best characters could definitely be chosen to play characters. The only actors in the film who, it seemed to me, played their roles corresponding to the descriptions of Robbins in the book, were friends of Julian in their five-minute video at the beginning of the film. Those who did not read the book could enjoy the film, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins this film was just a disappointment.
