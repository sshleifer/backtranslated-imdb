I saw this film about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. I fully realized how terrible it was to be happening, so I can only blame myself. But, like most, I did not believe all the negative. Being a fan of Sandler, it simply seemed incredible that one of his films could be so bad. I figured they were just Sandler haters. I could not be more wrong. <br /> <br /> We have a comedy in which there is not one funny second. This is actually quite achievable. You would think that in a 90-minute comedy they could accidentally stumble upon something even remotely funny. But no, it's just terrible. It's not “so bad, it's good,” it's just bad. You can't laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that at least makes you laugh, but they never come. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie "The Ring"? Where do people watch a videotape and die 7 days later? If this movie were on the videotape, people would die instantly, with their own hands, and they would have a smile on their face when they realized that their agony was over, and that would be the first smile since they hit the game. <Br /> <br /> You might want to watch it, just to see how bad it is, not able to curb your curiosity. Not. Please do not. Believe me, I do you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world who think that Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those who have not seen it.
