I do not often give feedback on one star, but the computer does not allow me to do negative numbers. <br /> <br /> Introductory headlines tell us that we are already in deep water. Although this is a low-budget film about exploitation, 17 producers are credited. Not. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, the abusive husband Kenneth returns home to his family in a prestigious gated community. House pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger), allowed the children to lose their balance all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Is it her children or grandchildren? This is Christmas Eve. Della goes to the mall, a long scene that could be cut. In order to bring home the idea that male aggression is rampant in the universe, she chases football players in full shape, playing in the pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Of course. As a bonus, she sees a car with a deer driven to it. <br /> <br /> While in the scenes behind the wheel, we get some real tension. It's raining and the traffic is bad. First, we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then, later, Della tries to drive and talk on her mobile phone at the same time, at one point fully turning around to check the cluttered back seat for a phone charger. <br /> <br /> She wanders around the mall, sees an old college friend trying to buy things, but her credit card is declined - damn it, maybe her husband is angry because he’s ruined, but it's too hard for a script . <br /> <br /> In the parking lot. Much of it faces the most ridiculous gang in the history of films. One white boy (Lucas Hass is watching his career, going down the toilet), one black, one Asian and one Hispanic. Imagine the company Up with People, gone into trouble, and you will have an idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a gun, it gives them an attitude. A policeman comes to investigate the noise, and they shoot him in the head, shooting more than once. In the parking lot as many people as possible, people everywhere, and no one notices. <br /> <br /> Della runs away in her car, and instead of choosing a police station or a well-lit safe zone, she goes to a construction site, where she kills all four bad guys one by one, just using the tools (literally). <br /> <br /> BASIC spoiler ahead. <br /> <br /> She is going home. The car rolls out and it goes through the pouring rain. He checks the children, goes down the stairs, and when her husband angrily asks what she got from him at the mall, shows him the gun and shoots him at close range. <br /> <br /> An experience with four punks was supposed to lead to personal power for Della. Instead, we know that her children are likely to spend Christmas in a foster home or in a group house, because the staff will gather them while she responds to kill one charge. Four punk can be classified as a justified murder in self defense. My husband has a different story. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that I saw it by telegram. If I saw it in the theater (did he get any release?), I would be furious. I’m just sad to see how talents like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas waste themselves on trash like this. <br /> <br /> However, one very good thing. It was written and directed by Susan Montford. Miss Montford has not received a single letter or guide since she passed through this poop. There is justice in the world.
