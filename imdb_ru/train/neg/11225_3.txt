This documentary is a reconstruction of the last few years of Betty Page's career (Page Richards). Teasing Tennessee was the most recognizable queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950s and was fetish photographs, captive and cat-fights "girlish clicks." Irving Clo (Dukey Flyswatter) in his movie "Movie Star" told Betty what to do in front of the camera. In the famous photographs or “bachelor parties” there was no nudity, but, nevertheless, Klau was charged with distributing obscene materials, and he was ordered to destroy them in order to avoid prosecution. Not surprisingly, Betty had a cult following the peak of her career. The girl next door with dark black hair, blue eyes and an hourglass figure, wearing a fetish costume or not, would have been mesmerized for decades. In the end, it was said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page will disappear and devote her last years to religion. This film could actually be much better; but good enough to maintain interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is awesome in itself. Bra, panties, garter and hose will not harm her image in the least. Also in the cast: Jamie Henkin, Jan Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simon. Keep in mind that this film can change the heart rate.
