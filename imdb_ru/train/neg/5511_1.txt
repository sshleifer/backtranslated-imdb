I have to agree with the very first comment: this film sucks very, very hard. Despite the very large cast of B-list, the cover of this film (for those who donâ€™t watch it on Comedy Central on a weekday, which is probably the only show this film will ever get) is trying to blame Dangerfield, but on in fact, it's just a paycheck for every 80s comedian. Randy Quaid? Check it out. Ed Begley Jr. Check it out. Lisa Simpson's voice? Now she can say that Maximum Overdrive was not her only terrible click: double check. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this film is that it was so lazily written with the jokes already told. Nothing in this film outside of its existence is funny. You better watch the paint dry. This is, of course, material for direct viewing of the video, which still believes in the old adage: throw an old star on the cover and you will get money back from the rental. Given that the video rental days are changing, consider one of the latest examples of garbage disposal. <br /> <br /> This film is used only if you have trouble falling asleep. It takes you there.
