I watched this film as a preview of the Matthew Barney art exhibition. It certainly prepared me. I almost missed the exhibit and, looking back, I probably should have. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent results (Bjork) and rich and colorful photos, the content was mostly boring and predictable. Gee, I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to figure out what the divers did. The film was basically a silly mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial images of modern whaling technology used for mocking hunting / harvesting. The film "peaks" with enough shock art to turn the belly. <br /> <br /> What's the point of the movie? While others may argue that this is an anti-whaling industry, it can also be argued that this somehow justifies whaling. Personally, I think it was Barney’s attempt to “awaken” the audience through his anal, fecal, self-destruct and cannibalistic fetishes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: unless you really understand Barney’s art, don’t bother to watch this movie. The message is unclear, the pace is slow, and cultural references are pretentious. If you love shock art, you would be better off filming one of the many Undead movies or tracking down an old copy of Hastler and filming fecal cartoons.
