Thank God, I watched it from a friend and did not pay for it. The plot is terribly transparent, and the entire film resembles an episode of a television show. If you have any knowledge about computers or electronics, be careful. You will feel the film insulting your intellect. <br /> <br /> In addition, the actress turned much music vj Amanda Walsh shows the worst acting I have ever seen, with the exception of porn. She was lucky that Matt Lanter is really decent. He is the one who wears the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate that I spent almost two hours of my life watching this movie! Too bad they called it a sequel, because I was a fan of the original, which was pretty good.
