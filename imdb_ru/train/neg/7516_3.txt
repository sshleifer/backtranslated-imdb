I rented it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent room creates a clumsy story that does not bring real benefits, but at least it is good. Director John Kiis takes the simple idea of ​​a fake haunted house with a real danger inside. In most cases it should be a deaf dunk, but this little nasty stall is pretty fast. The cinematography is above average, and acting is mediocre at best, but the story and composition are terrible. Slower scenes drag on forever, and the panic is too small, and between them there is no real climax of the film. In the beginning, an eerie mood sets in, but it loses its brilliance before any horror happens, and I get bored to death and cook another sandwich ... The cover is attractive, and I think it's worth renting it if you are looking for mindless low budget wood, but if you like a good story and a rich end, reach for something else.
