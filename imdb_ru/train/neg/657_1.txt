PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> director: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> Starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> story: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Shah), who was a little in love with her. Now she is preparing for her graduation party with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they begin to die one by one, because the killer escaped from prison, and no one bothered to warn Donna, because her prom night is too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> Pros: I got some good laughs because of the terrible dialogue and stupid movements of the character. <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that a person who is strangely obsessed with her (she doesn't seem so great) escaped from prison. Their reason: they do not want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOL <br /> <br /> cons: Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of slasher. I can usually have fun with the bad ones. I even like PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated as PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a stupid PG-13 rated slasher film has nothing to do with not enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I had a big problem with the story. I like slash movies that don't even have stories. At least they can be interesting. We are talking about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to catch up, destroying her prom and killing all her friends ...? Then there were stories that, I doubt, worried someone. Claire (Jessica Stroup) fights with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I don’t care. This was supposed to be a lifetime function, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a terrible movie with horrible scenes of death. I don’t even care that it’s not so bad, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, original PROM NIGHT) weren’t such bastards, but they still had effective killings. Here, half the heroes die in the same hotel room behind the scenes, a woman gets several stab wounds without stabbing wounds and a close-up on the bad actor’s face when he screams in agony. I am sure that 10-year-old girls were terrified, but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated characters. There was an unrealistically sensitive Donna Bobby guy (Scott Porter), and I almost guarantee that you will never meet such a sensitive guy in your life unless you are gay. Then we had the annoying friends of Donna Claire (The Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davies), as well as the sign of meanness Chrissy (Brian Davies). If you thought that the characters in the DEATH PROOF are annoying, try watching this movie. And don't start me off with Ronnie (Collins Penny) and the DJ (Jay Phillips), who gave me memories of Asher’s performance in the movie “She’s All.” <br /> <br /> Add to all these predictable plot twists a terrible soundtrack and a great deal of disrespect for the original material, and you have a rather smelly one.
