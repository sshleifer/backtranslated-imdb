With the exception of cheap dirt, this exercise in the frame on the video in incompetence was difficult to pass. He has the typical blood that can be expected in a zombie film, but there is no atmosphere that would require it to be worth it. <br /> <br /> What's strange, this German amateur video and the Peel version is called English! Dubbers seem to be American fans (German pen-friends?!) Who can't decide whether they want to play straight or turn it into a comedy. One character (a white German, of course) is called a black guy, who apparently speaks with thick ebony! â€œDo you know, Komrad?
