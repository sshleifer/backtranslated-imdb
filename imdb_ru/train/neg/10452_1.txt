I saw 10 pm. the show and I must say that in this film, nothing special was not. Although I did not leave the theater, wanting to return (since I no longer pay for films), I really did not find any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines and such that made me laugh, but basically the film seemed to consist of a runaway fan service younger (in mind than age, as this film is rated R) for a male audience. Fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well. I know that you all want to hear Samuel L. utter his shameful phrase, but let's be honest, this is a lot of hype for very little feedback. The only really awful part of the movie was CG, which looked very digitized and didn’t fit well with live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I am a reasonable person, I knew that I was going to the theater that I was not going to see “Casablanca”, and I am at least grateful that this film is an original (unintelligent) idea, and not some That alteration or franchise. However, to be honest, if you are not part of a cult, following which you would probably better spend your money elsewhere and watch a movie either in the second run cinema in a few weeks, or rent it in a few months.
