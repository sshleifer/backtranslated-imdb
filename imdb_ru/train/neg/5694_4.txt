I'll be honest - the reason I rented this film was because I was a big fan of Kyle Chandler (especially from an early edition). Since he usually plays a good guy, I wanted to see him in a different role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also attracted me; The hired killer (Tony Greco, whose Mr. N. Chandler) must kill a person at random before he is entrusted with the life or, rather, the death of a witness who testifies against any of the “families”. The films were not at all what I expected. It was painful, I hated the end (if you saw it, you would know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. It was mostly dirty and made little sense. Yes, it was a film about the mafia, and yes, the weapon really unfolds. But the film has more than that. This film acted as if he did not have time to go into details - just deal with him and understand him. The game really made up for it - James Belushi was quite funny as Rose. Cheryl Lee made Angel seem as believable as she could have imagined. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as an agitated newcomer to the "family." If only the script paid homage to the actors.
