Strange ... I like all these film crews and movies with dark humor; but I didn't like this one at all! This is terrible, terrible and, of course, not at all funny. Pity can not make the whole plot of the film, disgust, too. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fill the film; it could be removed. It should have been in another shorter format, of course. Maybe I was expecting too much from the film crew — for example, saving the film, lol. It is also filled with overly used clichés of characters and situations ... I don't understand why people liked it ... "Poetry", "hope"; No, mom, did not see anything like that! ^^ In general, he is empty and rude, pathetic and hopeless. Oh my gosh, this ........
