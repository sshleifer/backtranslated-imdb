This film was very poorly written. The characters had no depth. They should never have made a movie about it. My 11 year old son could have written a better script than Hyun Ray Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor who did not suck was the zoo security guard. He was the only funny and believable of them all. <br /> <br /> I like movies and I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was on my list of losers number 2. Number 1 being Demonic. <br /> <br /> For those of you who really thought it was a good movie, you need brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the movie were not even dragons ... so why did they call D-war?
