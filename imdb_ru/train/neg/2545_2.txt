There is laughter in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent, and he was funny (before he decided that he was a serious actor). However, what worries me in this film is how uncomfortable all characters are. With the exception of the two main passages, all are assholes. I mean, these losers in a small town are as clumsy as possible. You just look and think, dude, these losers must be unemployed. Moreover, an American factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slut. It made me wonder if this film was shot by Japanese nationalists. Oh, of course, in the end they all got together, but I just didnâ€™t like the journey there.
