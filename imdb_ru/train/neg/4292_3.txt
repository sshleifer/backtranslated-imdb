I generally like to watch Bert Lancaster films - especially when he needs to go crazy with his impressive presence on the screen, like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was sometimes also his greatest weakness, since he rarely, if ever, underestimated ANYTHING. And this lack of subtlety really prevents Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was supposed to be a kind of showman, but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. It is assumed that she is smart, but does not seem so when Lancaster rag rushes across the screen! In addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen, and itâ€™s too obvious that this film is based on a play. It seems that it was filmed mainly on the sound stage, and not on the wide-open West, as it should have been. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is very overrated.
