I could not wait to see this movie. About halfway through the movie, I could not wait for it to end. All the (white) actors showed their lines, as Woody Allen just said: “Say so ...” Then they pronounced their lines on the screen, as if they were trying to emulate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know, as Will Ferrell actually says, and he doesn’t stumble over his words, like Mr. Allen. The comedic part of this film was as boring as a tragedy, and definitely never fun or even entertaining. I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of Woody Allen, and this film has definitely not turned me on. I think his letter was as bad as its direction. This movie will be one of the worst 10 films I've ever seen.
