Former actor in decks and cute boy Rob Lowe in a film in an American high-security prison. I had the feeling that his character would be popular for all the wrong reasons, such as Tobias in the first series of OZ, but PROXIMITY is not a movie, it’s more like the movie “Man on the run” as a ROOMER. It also extols the themes of punishment and justice, when James Coburn is cast in a cameo role as spokesperson for the victim justice group, but any reasonable discussion about how society should treat criminals is completely ignored, as the film degenerates tired old stamps. shootouts and car chases
