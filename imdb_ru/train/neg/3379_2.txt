I recently bought a DVD, forgetting how much I hated the version of the movie “A Chorus Line”. Every change of director Attenborough, made to the plot, failed. <br /> <br /> Due to the fact that the relationship between the director and Cassie has become so noticeable, the whole ensemble premise of the musical floats out of the window. <br /> <br /> Some music numbers are expedited and rushed. The hit song of the show completely loses its meaning when it is passed on to the character Cassie. <br /> <br /> The overall setting is very shy. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give him 2, because some of the great numbers can still be used, despite the attempt of the film to squeeze out of it every piece of joy and spontaneity.
