A really disgusting, vile film, with a bit of real humor. <br /> <br /> The fatherâ€™s character is especially vulgar (deliberately, obviously), and depicted in the most pitiful, sloppy way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this film terribly distressing, absolutely without redemptive traits. Honestly, I wish I had ever seen it. <br /> <br /> I consider this British attempt a painful and gross embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Those who liked this film have an ability that I completely do not have: it is joy in manifesting profound depravity and poverty. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves.
