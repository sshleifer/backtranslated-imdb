The battleship is sinking ... His survivors, hanging on a nearby rescue raft, sit there doing nothing, while we reflect on their thoughts for a series of long memories. <br /> <br /> Although the name of Noel Trusar is only what you notice during the credits, everything that is cinematic in it is because of Lin. And from a technical point of view, it is very good. David Lin just KNEW films from the beginning. There are many moments when the learned dialogue of Tvard takes the second place, and the visual sense of Lin takes the central place. Try the soldiers to get off the ship near the end, and the whole scene; the track shot in the direction of the singing of the hymn, the scene in which we are in the house that was bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It is completely wooden, showing no emotion, character or humanity. One can see in his eyes that he is not really listening to what the other performer is saying, he is just waiting for them to finish so that he can hurry with his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <Br /> <br /> His episodic, slightly repetitive, and memories overwhelm the story: there is no central story that they promote, just give a general idea of ​​the characters. Nevertheless, his interesting film is worth seeing - and a good debut for Lin. This is not a very deep or insightful film, and this is definitely a propaganda film, but also a demonstration of the editing skills of Lin is all about how the parts are connected.
