This is one of those horrible sex movies that could not be played somewhere near the theater. Women run, dressed in scantly dressed bunny outfits, an extremely fat woman - the main part of tasteless jokes, and they all work in the restaurant of a dirty old man who has an eccentric (Jim Hanks, who of course Brother Tom) he was "laid down." Hanks is really good, but this film is worthless and does not make sense. One must wonder why this was done at all? However, due to Hank's performance and a few interesting points (but no more than a few), he got a stellar "2" out of 10. I think I was good, though.
