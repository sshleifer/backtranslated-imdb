I can't believe that none of the official reviews of this film warn people that there are two rather offensive scenes of sexual abuse. As if our culture takes this behavior as simply sexual, but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that he doesn’t seem to condemn these attacks — for example, a woman who is under constant attack and pressure never makes men accountable for their actions like no one else. One man is prevented from completing the attack when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is only articulated with "you cannot make a woman love you", and not "you should never force a woman into force, you jerk" ... From the female point of view The film is a disappointment. This kind of “throws a bone” to women, allowing them to be both experienced fighters and leaders, but the film is much more determined by romance, which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality should include an imbalance of power when men dominate. the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use his martial skills to try to repel attackers. She doesn't even make them apologize - rather, she seems apologetic. In general, a depressing and frustrating film, with excellent cinematography and several cool scenes of struggle, but not nearly as good as Hero.
