Broken is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. Not a slasher or filled with blood. A lot of broken glass and mirrors in this sharp thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis. A successful radiologist, Gina McVeigh (Lena Hadley) falls into a strange world because her life seems to be getting out of control. Being present at the birthday party of her father (Richard Jenkins), the guests are stunned when the mirror falls to the floor for no apparent reason. Everything becomes really strange when she becomes a witness of how a woman spitting walks down London street in a car identical to her own. Gina sneaks into the apartment of his twin and finds a photo with his father. She leaves and gets into her head in a collision. Then her boyfriend is mysteriously not the same; rather, itâ€™s hard to trust her family and friends. Is genie beside herself? Is she in a parallel world? Her nightmares are getting more horrible ... is she broken? <br /> <br /> Kudos, if you can figure it out ... it won't be easy. Editing could not be more difficult. Lighting is doubtful. Other players: Melville Pupard, William Armstrong, Michel Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
