Yes, I'm just going to tell you about it, so don't read if you want any surprises. I got this one called Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas horror on a DVD called "Silent Night, Bloody Night". While Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had great potential and were very close to being good, this one was not so good. It started quite interestingly, watching the villain (if you can call him that), watching the children of the neighborhood and writing in books who is naughty and sweet, but after a while you are looking for some action, but this film does not. You need character development, but it goes beyond, and you still never know what the hell guy snaps. After about an hour, he kills three out of four people, while the whole crowd looks terrified, and the guys he kills, not even his goals, they just laugh at him. This is one of the many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock down the naughty. Then he tries to kill this other guy and tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace. He quickly gets stuck and barely manages to get out. Then he enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by strangling him in his bedroom. He can't kill a guy this way, so he grabs a star from a tree and cuts his throat guys. What the hell was a tree doing in the bedroom? Oh, yes, the killer before the murder stopped at a party and also had some fun. Well, that's all, with the exception of urban residents, pursuing him with torches, unresolved role with his brother and the melody that he wants to play. What is it all about? He went on to talk about something that was never really explained. How will this end, you ask, well, since I have spoilers, I will tell you. He runs off the road in his van and continues, well, let's just say that it was lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
