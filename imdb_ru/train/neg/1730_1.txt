First, I would like to point out that I only know about the show because my younger sister always watched it. I find it the most annoying TV program. There is nothing funny in these jokes, and the preserved laughter is unbearable. The show will work much better if you shoot it in front of a live audience. Thus, the laughter will show how "unfunny" the show is. However, I pay tribute to the acting talent of the young composition. However, it hurts me to think that they will watch the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The show goes well with the annoying general voice and style of CBBC speakers. Why today's young people need to scream so much, I can't do it. It's all.
