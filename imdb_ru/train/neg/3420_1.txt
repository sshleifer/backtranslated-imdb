I first saw this movie around twelve o'clock on Saturday night. This is really the perfect time for this. I have never, NEVER seen a film that is more predictable and steeped in stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action movie, don't watch it, because you may lose the desire to live halfway through. However, if you want to laugh, please look! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my pleasant Saturday evening. What struck me especially was that every scene that would be expensive to do was copied from a Discovery documentary or an old special television film about the US Army. In addition, I was struck by the fact that they did not make the slightest effort to make the production look real. Afghanistan, as I recall, is nowhere near the sea, and yet with one click Dick runs away from the sand castle of terrorists with his jetpack and climbs a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the film, Dick throws an Islamic terrorist into the wall. In slow motion, you can beautifully see the long hair of a Korean stuntman swinging the air when they crashed against the wall. Gotta love this. I recommend that you watch it with friends and with a lot of beer, but only then you will understand why I got so angry that I spent 6.99 euros on the box.
