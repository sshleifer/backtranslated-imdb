It is incredible that such a scenario, as a cliche and completely absurd, can make any screen even small. The dialogue in this film makes catwoman seem like a classic of high culture. Billy Zayn plays a bad ass playing the harmonica; Elvis pretends to be a scumbag, a martial arts master who plays the life of a former former football player who became a gambling addict, played by the winner of the bright NBC Star of the Next Action show. His performance is cold as ice and not cool. The movie takes place in Vegas, and since people play poker, the writers believe that this is the perfect place for a movie about a guy who tries to survive 24 hours, against an omnipresent, rich player who offered his goal of $ 2.4 million if can. do it every other day. And so begins the hunt. Hunting with smelly impressive explosions, settings of the construction yard, stupid cinema and one-liners containing the word "bet" or "gamble." The female mix is ​​also thrown into the mix, but for what reason I have no idea. Yes, but do not worry, fans of "NAS" losers also make their memorable cameos. The end of surprise will knock out your socks if you like predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should reconsider his decision to sell even more. I would like him to give me back these two hours of my life.
