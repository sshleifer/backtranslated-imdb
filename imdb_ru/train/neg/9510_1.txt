Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films of 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and turn it on and fails. When I watched the movie last January, I was so disgusted that I walked and talked on a cell phone with my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie. I heard that there is a director's cut on the DVD, maybe I'll check it out, but this PG-13 trash movie is s *** and the worst kind is s ***. Maybe, if there were some T & A in the film, everything would have turned out. But the gags are lame, and the game is terrible. Worse than the movie "Troma".
