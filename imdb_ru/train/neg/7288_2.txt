NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long is not necessarily good. This film is incredibly long. However, not good. Scenes were drawn too, too far. Sex scenes were unnecessary, and often too long. A film that was edited before 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but alas, it became so boring that I could give it only 2 out of 10. This is well below average. <br /> <br /> Some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays the whole family tree. The guy who played the great-grandfather is not at all like him, but the grandfather, the father and the son (who gives us a constant unnecessary voice-over) is all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same main head with an ox head. No one seems to notice that each of these children looks like a clone of the latter, although their photographs are being photographed at every turn. This video is insignificant, but if the film did not last 3 weeks, it would not be so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany has even been whispered for the longest time about the Jews who are surrounded and sent is ridiculous. Some word would reach them, and the thought of trying to escape was probably discussed. An uncle in France would surely send a warning to try and get them to leave. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this film are completely wrong. You spend forever telling us about it, and the development of relations between the main characters is very short. Suddenly ... people fall in love and almost instantly ... married. Then with the children. Then we draw things for 6 centuries and forget about the development of relationships. This again would not have seemed so much in a two-hour film, but over time we did not get anything. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending was just a bad one. I don't want to spoil it to anyone, but you won't like it either ... unless you're a sadist. <br /> <br /> The director / writer must be tortured by the need to watch this bloated trash on a weekly basis, I mean an endless cycle, oh, they are the same thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this film, I mean that, in my opinion, Istvan Sabo models his directorial career after it. A long, protracted film that completely destroys any substance in the film. A brief description of the "Summoning horses" and "Sunshine." <br /> <br /> Sunshine, the perfect title. If you begin to observe when the sun is shining, it is likely that after leaving the darkness it will be good after dark.
