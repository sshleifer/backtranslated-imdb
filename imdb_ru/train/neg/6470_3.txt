Disney goes to the well too many times, as anyone who has seen the original SMALL DRAWN will clearly feel torn off. Celebrating the birthday of Melody’s daughter, Ariel and Eric plan to present it to King Triton. The celebration quickly fell through Ursula's sister, Morgana, who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to get the king's trident. Having stopped the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean, while Melody grows up, wondering why she cannot enter there. <br /> <br /> Scary and horrible is what describes it directly to the continuation of the video. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you are watching seemed to come right into other Disney movies. I think Disney can only plagiarize on its own! Do not tell me that the penguin and the walrus do not remind you of another duet from LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include a rematch between Sebastian and Louis, the royal chef. They played awful under this! The climax between Morgana and ALL seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I don’t give anything, but after 75 minutes everything looked incredibly cramped and too complicated. Disney's embarrassment, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better left to rent and laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the continuations that Disney is going to sink later.
