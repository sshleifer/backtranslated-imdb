Otto Preminger directs this light like feathers. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widower David Niven rest in the south of France with a psycho Milen Demonzho. All is well until a friend of the Deborah Kerr family appears. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of Kerr too difficult to resist. Seberg is okay if Niven loves her and throws her (as he did with all the women in his past ... including Demongeota). When it seems that she becomes the second banana in the life of Niven, Seberg takes revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from the point of view of Seberg and skillfully combines black and white with more sunny color scenes. Georges Perinal's cinematography is staggering. The film shows some of Preminger's least authoritative instructions, although he rarely allows any close-ups, making it difficult to understand what the actors really feel. Arthur Lorenz wrote the screenplay, and he is full of acid dialogue and funny scenes (mostly with the participation of birds-crazy demons). Seberg feels well, but at least Niven is attractive ... and he does not show any chemistry with Seberg or Kerr. Preminger is really mistaken with this casting. This role seems to be especially for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Jeffrey Horn as the potential fianc√© of Seberg and Martita Hunt as his stupid mother. Juliette Greco, playing herself, sings the title song at a Paris nightclub. Great titles Preminger regularly perform Sol Bass.
