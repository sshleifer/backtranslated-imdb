The film was supposed to be shown here in Bangkok, with all the fanfare, and even in the theater it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the author of the plot simply does not hold water. Something is definitely missing. In my opinion, people should have a reason why they look at it, besides the historical view of the past. The accuracy of the story is not what we are looking for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film simply lacks content. The only way to make this film right is to somehow make changes so that it becomes a legend, and not just a story. And in the legend there are certain elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, for example, the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. This is called the central theme. <br /> <br /> The film is not able to answer, why should I watch it anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some strange legendary flying elephants, a psychic king, or an eccentric king, such as King and I, would be beautiful, something would add significantly to the appeal of movies. I think there was no attraction other than a simple vanilla film. <br /> <br /> As soon as you get the appeal, we will focus on this story. From a marketing point of view, we call it “must see.” Hearing the name of the film, people will say: “Oh, I have to see it.” Where is the appeal to Kingmaker? Why not just redo the name and call it "How not to be a king"? and make a black comedy of old Siamese days in the style of "Doctor Strandzhelov". It would be much more interesting. Similar to the narrative, the experiences of the king's weaknesses from insane first person would make the film extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Most modern films have an attraction, such as Spiderman, X-Men, these names speak for themselves. If they do not have familiar characters, then some other films, such as “The Island,” themselves turned when advertising asks: “Do you still believe that there is an island?”. <br /> <br /> Or for the film that says “How NOT to be a King”, you can ask the question: “So you still WANT to be a King?” <br /> <br /> Parhat
