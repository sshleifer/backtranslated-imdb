Do not forget, my friends and I watched the movie by the same name. This is nice, although obvious in the plot and direction - you know where the film goes in the first five minutes. My main statement in the plot is that, although it remains tolerably consistent, they never explain much of what lies behind the characters. An alcoholic father, an overworked mother, a weary sister ... this is a bad family, but apart from a casual mention from a sister, there is no solution. I was also confused about the scene with the bottles ... it seemed rather random. <br /> <br /> The letter is a minor concern ... the children were not bad actors, but their script left a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a pretty niche movie was discarded because of one, a special effect, an unsuccessful script and a clearly obvious plot.
