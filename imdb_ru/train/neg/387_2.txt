One wonders if at any point in the production of this film there was a script <br /> <br /> that made some sense. Was the draft of 3 hours <br /> <br /> and was it cut off in a disjointed mess that persisted? <br /> <br /> Why would someone finance this mess? I will say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a handsome young man, and he does what he can <br /> <br /> with dialogue and dramatic (?) Situations that are given to him. But the characters <br /> <br /> come and go for no apparent reason, there is no continuity <br /> <br />, and the action, cinematography and direction (to <br /> <br /> Let's say politely) is amateurish. “Do not sleep” is an unfortunate choice of the title, as it will probably turn out to be untrue if someone actually tries to really watch this movie.
