This film is probably one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. The length was not long enough to include a good storyline. In addition, the death of adoptive parents was simply ridiculous. Does the mother suddenly die from falling through the shower after stumbling over a figure, and dad is shot by a policeman? I see where some kind of originality could be what they wanted, but it could be better. In addition, the lightness of all this made me want to hit the stop before it was all over. After hearing the whole name of Lucy and finding out that it was “Lucifer,” I wanted to shut up. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. This is a male name. This should be given to a male character. Overall, the film was a bore, and could use a better plot.
