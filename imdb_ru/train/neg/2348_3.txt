Ashley Judd in her early role, and I think her first major role, shows her real rebellious character in this slow feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a means for political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> <br /> Being a committed feminist in real life, she must have treasured this scenario. Not surprisingly, Left Wing critic Roger Ebert loved this film; it is also right in its political lane. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers, I am glad that Judd has risen from this moronic fluff to better roles in films that entertained rather than preach rigid liberal plans.
