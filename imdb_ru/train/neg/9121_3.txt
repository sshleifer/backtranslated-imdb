This is not a comprehensive horrible comedy, but it is very boring. He has almost no laughter, and he is wasting his production values. Toward the end, there is one sharp moment when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "sworn enemy" and tells him: "You were my only worthy opponent, and now we can start all over again." This scene, however, along with Burt Kwuk's funny cameo at the beginning, are the only memorable parts of the film. (* 1/2)
