Disappointing movie. The performance of the actors is weak. The sets are ok, could be better. The story is also weak. The consequences of the battle are terrible. The sound and quality of the film is trashy. The history of the Kazakh people is told very badly. This film was supposed to include more Kazakh actors in the lead roles. And also had to be in the Kazakh language. Kuno Becker and Jay Hernandez are Hispanic. I do not understand Since when Latin Americans played the Turkic-Mongolian people. This film is a shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibrahimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. Director Cech apologizes since he is not of nomadic descent, he cannot know the true spirit and history of the nomads.
