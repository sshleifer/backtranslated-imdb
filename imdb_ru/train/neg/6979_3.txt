I also watched this film, and although it is very well made, I found it heartbreaking and would not recommend it to women who have small children. The horror on this mother's face when she sees that her child is about to be brought down. The train is really heart-rending. And the sad thing is that she dies internally. In the end, she returns to the Applasian Mountains. All the money in the world, which she earns on the manufacture of dolls, do not hide her grief. I remember her desperate face as she pulled off her money, trying to heal her child. I am surprised that this film is happening in Detroit, because when I watched it, I thought that people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also a route for the poor of the mountains.
