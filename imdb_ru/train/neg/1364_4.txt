The more I think about it, the more there was nothing tempting in this film. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory may have made it <br /> <br /> worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as 4 of <br /> <br /> 10. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I met the director. he seemed so ignorant of what he was doing or what he was doing, and, as far as I can tell, he didn’t care about the film. even he agreed that <br /> <br /> he really didn’t know what he was doing, and he was forced to do certain things because it was digitally captured. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was trying to fit into the formula that he built for himself: “All 9 people must be connected in some way. <br /> <br /> Can we get from point “A” to point “B” to get from the <br /> <br /> prostitute we see at the beginning and return to it at the end. 10 minutes <br /> <br /> for each character’s relationship with another person. This <br /> <br /> makes you feel suffocated by two immense, poorly drawn characters <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I just remembered one redemptive part of the film .. Steve <br /> <br /> Buchemi, there’s one scene where he’s awesome. that's all. as I say <br /> <br /> ... 4 out of 10.
