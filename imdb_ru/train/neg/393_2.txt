For those who crave the remake of the 1989 Slaves in New York. What is there, seven of you? Here it was ... was. <br /> <br /> In this dissatisfied film there are diligently stupid characters (well, they are club kids, you're a big jerk!) that are held in their hands. The big question seems to be, how long can a young adult remain underage? Three people wrote this "story"? My God, it was easier to come up with citizen Kane. Instead of returning viewers, this film should simply embarrass anyone who was the scene in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a fifty-year-old woman envies a handful of self-absorbed children from different eras is a world as only twenty people could imagine. A strange sidebar about the library is not the story that can be expected from the Breakin 2 equivalent: Electric Bugaloo from Parker Posey. Her "I'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper crumbles at her hysterical. Joke Posey is always fun, but there are projects that are under it. I slept before he crossed the 40-minute mark.
