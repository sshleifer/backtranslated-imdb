If at least the cruel and protracted deaths were intended to have a history in order to justify their inclusion, but the script was just incomprehensible and just silly. <br /> <br /> The story has not gone away; the story did not have a clear succession. It was just a bunch of lingering meaningless scenes with a smelling thread and a really stupid ending attached, as if to say ... "the end * squeaks * of you, my haters and my few defenders who watch my garbage." <br /> <br /> I don’t understand, the killer in the mask, who never took off the mask in prison, the place of rape in prison, which was supposed to be the guards who raped and killed the ugly deformed serial killer and nothing else? no explanation, no punishment, really weak main policeman who was a waste of an actor like Pare, who did not try to remove the guy who killed his police officers, tortured the child, the woman and the dog and sent them to you to watch the video. <br /> <br /> Policemen who, for some unknown reason, all together (individually) roamed the night in the dark in their farmhouse, like a bunch of poorly written teenagers who are killed at one time as a bunch of idiots, and no other policeman hears as they die in the dark one by one, and just continue to wander for no reason until everyone is killed in turn. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, for no reason or explanation, there was a bunch of terrible real scenes with snuff animals, he remembered, watched him masturbate, it was a comedy for him ... what was it? No, Ball just thought it needed to upset animal lovers. <br /> <br /> Then Pare, believing the word psychopath, let go of his family if he kills himself ... a more gullible, stupid cop who you have never seen in the film. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I try not to hate his work completely. I'm trying to find a reason to explain the art of horror writers, but this stuff is ... sheer nonsense. <br /> <br /> Ball, what do you do more? I hope that you will understand this, because I know many more worthy people who cannot dream of getting a budget, you earn their films again and again. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see Boll at his best check “Mail” was actually all right.
