“Creepshow 2” is just a pale imitation of the original, created with a small purpose, except to make money on the title of the previous film. He even reinforces the shortcomings of his predecessor, which was often predictable and hard. However, the first time was enough thrill to compensate for its periodic lulls, which led to uneven, but generally quite entertaining efforts. The sequel has a few worthy moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more obvious. From time to time, it delivers, but most of the time, it just lingers there. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all stories revolve around a common theme of revenge and simply desserts. The wooden Indian comes to life, taking revenge on its master's killers. Teens are devoured by a water monster. The hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist. None of these premises is bad in itself, but they lack inspiration at all. There are few surprises and no panic. This is an example of a textbook of unmotivated filmmaking. It does not help that this cheap film suffers from a flat directorial style, although, frankly, there was nothing to work with. In the end, the second story is better, but not by much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performances are fine at best. George Kennedy, as the ill-fated owner of a department store, does an adequate, if not particularly inspired job. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, does a good job with the role of a motorist who feels guilty and arouses sympathy for her plight, despite predictable, excessive material. However, most of the characters are quite subtle in general. <br /> <br /> It would seem that “Creepshow 2” would be better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned to write a script based on more stories of Stephen King. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini turns into a good, bloody work. So why is the film frustrating? I guess Romero really didn’t want to make a second film, but was forced to do so for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror, clones, robberies and whatnot, so this one was certainly inevitable. I can imagine a guy who hastily writes a script, takes his salary and runs away. I guess he had to do what was necessary to finance his own projects; We can't blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (of ****) <br /> <br /> New World Pictures released
