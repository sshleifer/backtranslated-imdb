The story of amazing disinterest kills "Psychics" again and again. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (like the crazy Fulchi cinematography work, which is usually a ransom factor in his films), and no understanding of the uncertainty is found anywhere. It is packed to an unbearable degree - by the end you will not scream with excitement, but will be covered with boredom (and, as I may have, an uncontrollable desire to fall asleep). Speech by Jennifer O'Neill deserves attention in the best film. Carefully, Fulci gorehounds - nothing special happens in the "Psychic". <br /> <br /> 3/10
