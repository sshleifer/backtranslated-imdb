Sparkling saddles! This is a battle between two estranged brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of which can mentally kindle a fire; they agree on differences in childhood, and Debra Winger is in the center of attention with love interest. Directed by Glenn Gordon Caron (gifted from the television program "Moonlight") stifles the dark texture of a comedy in Vince Gilligan's screenplay with such an attractive presentation that the film resembles a recording from an enthusiastic student film about a $ 15 million grant. but in a shapeless style that doesnâ€™t distinguish anything from the characters except their strange eccentricity. These are not even characters, but plot functions. Barely released into cinemas, the film is a disaster, although, strictly speaking, it is an example of style, not content. Winger is the only outstanding cast member who looks really puzzled. * 1/2 of ****
