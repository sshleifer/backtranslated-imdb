Given its popularity, I found this film a huge disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie. In the end, this is one of the most famous martial arts films of the 1970s, but I still could not understand why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talkative film with episodes of episodic actions. My biggest problem with the film was that there is no character in the story for whom I could be ill, because the alleged hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and he cannot hide the glaring flaws found in the narrative. I know that this should not be high art, but I found the film boring. Definitely not the best example of this favorite genre. His cult status eludes me. I recommend you skip this.
