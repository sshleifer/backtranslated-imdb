I rented a dubbed English version of Lensman, hoping that since it was written based on famous novels, it would have some content. Despite the fact that the film had hints at the content, it basically did not rise above the level of the children's cartoon. Maybe the film was a poor adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the duplicate version. Or maybe even the original novels were easy. But for some reason there was not much there. <br /> <br /> I noticed many details that were derived, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise imperfect. Some examples: the initial scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 “stargate” scene and the images of the Star Wars hyperspace. The robot on the harvester looked like the anthropomorphized R2-D2. <br /> <br /> He begins to try to borrow his comic embossed Star Wars style, but fortunately (humor doesn't work), it gives up. on comedy and plays it seriously. In this sense, it transcends the Star Wars franchise, which began with a clever sense of humor and eventually worsened to the annoying stupidity of Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> Agricultural details appear to have been drawn by someone who has never seen a farm. The harvester was driving through the unclean middle of the field, dropping the silage to an uncleaned crop, instead of working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto the rows already collected or into a truck. Corn (maize) poured grain trough, but farmland was painted like a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When the time came for Father Kim to face his fate, there was no dramatic weight. to the stage. This could be partly a mistake of the voice actor in English, but the drawings also did not show much weight. Kim's reaction to this scene was also unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed a very weak reaction, although they obviously should have been close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler; his name is not revealed to the place of his death.) It seems she quickly forgets him. Someone expressing sympathy shows more feelings than she. I think the voice actor deserves much of the blame in this case; Chris’s drawings have at least a hint of feeling. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the villains do not carry out their orders. The leader of the villains often punishes these failures with a pitiful death. I cannot say whether it was taken from Star Wars or from an earlier source — perhaps from Lensman’s books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where a spaceship crashes. When he falls to the ground, parts of the ship break down. But so many pieces fall out, that by the time of landing there will be nothing left of them. <br /> <br /> Although in most cases Chris looks like a competent, tough space hero, there is a scene where she screams as an incompetent damsel in distress. Someone strong enough to survive Henderson's death so quickly, at least, will be able to shout: "Help, he got me, and I can't get my gun!" Instead of just screaming. <br /> <br /> The character with the greatest individuality (almost too often) - D.J. Bill. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, JJ. in american graffiti. I wonder if he sounded good in the original language? <br /> <br /> Two planets in the film exploded. The explosions were not spectacular, and seemed to be inspired by Star Wars. To its credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely different from the main weapon of the Death Star. The dialogue had a good, interesting explanation of the reason. Many other explosions in the film looked good, but not the explosions of the planets. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very funny, as if borrowed from a video game from the late 1970s. Some images look like primitive video games, and some influence from the Throne is also noticeable. On the other hand, sound effects are often quite decent, although this underlines the cheesy sounds. Art is also good, especially when it keeps away from the often seemingly computer-generated graphics. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a story. If the film tells a good story, it can avoid many production flaws. But the plot here was quite lightweight. A naive boy tries to help someone on a crippled spacecraft and gains great power, which he does not understand. He and his group of very virtuous companions are fighting against a powerful, inexhaustible evil enemy. He makes friends, finds out about his special strength and grows into a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous enough, he can even defeat an evil enemy. Details along the way may cause this story to rise above simple outlines, but there is a little more in this film than in this one. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is just a children's cartoon. But then, since it seems that the main target audience is older children, perhaps this should not be something more.
