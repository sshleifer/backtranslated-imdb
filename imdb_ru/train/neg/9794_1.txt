I really have no idea why some people find that Power Ranger television shows are even remotely interesting. The costumes are completely ridiculous, and the people playing them also look completely stupid. There is absolutely something interesting in the power rangers. This is simply more expensive television advertising designed to sell very trashy plastic trash to unsuspecting children around the world. From the notes it is clear that he is banned in the country of New Zealand, and from what I have seen, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it is terrible and funny.
