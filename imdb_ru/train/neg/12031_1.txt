First of all, this film is not a comedy; unless you really push yourself, you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the film is slow and boring. The game is not bad, but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you will laugh a lot more if you read this, instead of spending time on this film. Religions and dogmas are not the best source for creating a good comedy, and this film is nothing more than confirms this rule. There is a similar story comedy "Home Teachers"; It was a few good moments. My last comment: do not waste your time and money to watch this boring and boring movie.
