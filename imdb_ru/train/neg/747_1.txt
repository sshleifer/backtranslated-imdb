Finally, I thought that someone was going to pay tribute to the classics of G. G. Wells, and not another version, created not in that place or era, but based on the book. Well, it is definitely close to the book, and this is the only plus to this mess. <br /> <br /> This is 180 minutes (yes 3 hours), the book is only about 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the courage to come here and say, “If you can do something better ...”, I would say, “Yes, I could,” and I would never used a video camera or was in any theatrical school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid good money to bring this shit to the UK from the USA, do not make the same mistake as me.
