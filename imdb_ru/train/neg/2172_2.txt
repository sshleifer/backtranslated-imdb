The lower part of the trunk, an unimaginable and almost invisible remake of the ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows the exact plot of the Filipino film STRYKER and is much worse! Bad behavior, dialogue, effects, duplication, pace, action sequences ... The list goes on and on. Italy made literally dozens of robberies of the Road Warrior in the early 80s, some good, some bad. This is the worst for today, no competition. Not only was the mood of the film completely gloomy and unhappy, the experience of watching this movie took one and a half. There was 1 (one) good prosecution sequence at the beginning of the film, and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding. But EVERYTHING about the movie smells serious! To really enjoy the blast, go instead to a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK or ESCAPE OF BRONX. They are much nicer than this garbage.
