At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to record the deed for descendants. For good reason! The super-sultan left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, there is no sharp analysis of the signs at the crime scene. Holmes stumbles fifty yards from a conspiracy. In the end, the dastard himself managed to cope with the old frail, which would make the heart of Charles Bronson to swell from six bullets in a basket with bread. In the subsequent pursuit, the pursuer grabbed one of Watson's shoes. Do not dare to take up the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film. Killer Holmes and Watson, flee. Come on, in late Victorian London, this changes the pace a bit. A little law on six guns :-)
