The animation looks as if it was made in 30 seconds and looks more like cartoons, not characters. I have been a Scooby Doo fan since the series took place in 1969. I didnâ€™t really think about Scooby-Doo cartoons (I'm talking about TV shows, not full-length movies), but some of them were pretty cool, and I like the fact that most people find Scrappy Doo annoying, but this series is pure trash. As soon as I saw the animation and heard the characters (and I use this term fluently), I cringe. In addition, Mystery Inc. It was a team, and without the whole team complementing each other, it seems as though I open a box of chocolates to find someone who has already eaten the best, and what remains is that no one wants, What's new Scooby Doo was better than this one. If you're going to shoot a Scooby-Doo series, turn on the elements that made the series last so long. The whole set of characters and high-quality animation. They need to put it back under the stone where it came from.
