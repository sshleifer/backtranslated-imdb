After buying a DVD in the basket because of the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I inserted it into the DVD player, and everything looked good. Good animated menus and lots of extra features ... but when I played the movie itself, it let me down. This is the worst thing I've ever seen, and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The commentary, which praises the film here in IMDB, is actually from the people who made the film. So do not believe if you do not want to spend your money!
