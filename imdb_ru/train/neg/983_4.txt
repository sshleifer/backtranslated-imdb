When, in 1938, Marlene Dietrich was named box office poison by one of the few actresses called so professional newspapers, these were films such as The Garden of Allah. How a movie can be so stunningly beautiful to contemplate and to be so tastelessly boring, I can't do it. In addition, Marlene, if she tried to expand her product range and not play sex sweat, stuck in such an old-fashioned story, I do not know. <br /> <br /> “The Garden of Allah”, one of the very first films in modern technology, was a novel staged at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens, who then collaborated on the adaptation of the game with Mary Anderson, who participated in 241 plays in 1911 -12. Then he got two silent screen adaptations. The story of a monk who escapes from a monastery in French Tunisia to see some of the things he lacked in the world. He faces a similarly protected woman who was not married and spent her best years caring for her sick parent. Now she travels in the desert, and they meet in the train. <br /> <br /> Of course, the woman is Marlene, and the runaway monk is Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what was in the head of David O. Selznick when shooting this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman could make it enjoyable for the public. But you can bet that the 1936 film ad, when they spent their money on a ticket, expected Marlene to become a modern Salome, not a saint with that name. The audience still remembered Rudolph Valentino, and you can bet that it was some kind of desert romance and seduction that they had expected. <br /> <br /> As for the monks, you must remember that they support themselves in their monasteries and in this particular case. one bottle of special wine from which Boyer turns out to be the one who has the secret. The monastery will have to rethink its economy if Boyer leaves. Monks are a sincerely devout group, but starting from the head of Charles Waldron and beyond, they have the right to be a little concerned about their personal interests. <br /> <br /> In any case, it refers to a multitude of religious platitudes. a couple of leads that are really not suitable for parts. Especially Marlene Dietrich. I would watch this film with an eye to a special color desert cinematography and would forget the plot.
