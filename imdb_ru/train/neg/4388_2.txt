Oh, man, I know what you're thinking: “With that name, I won't be mistaken!” Uh, yes, you can. I also liked the name, but I hated the stupid child who played "Satan's little helper", I also hated my mother, sister / daughter and her boyfriend - I hated all these people! Dude, it was painful to look at it sometimes! The ONLY reason he doesn’t get 1/10 is that, given the low budget, they did OK. But, my God, I hate these actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I think they saved a lot of money just by using Halloween masks for the killer, and the costume of Jesus at the end was also really stupid. Oh, agony, do not look!
