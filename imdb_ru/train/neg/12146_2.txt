This apocalyptic zombie film tries to be angry and shocking; but MASS FEEDING becomes unsuccessful as some hard-footed zombies stalk the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus virus is being suppressed by government newspapers and television stations that are being manipulated. A pair of brave but stupid souls on TV channel 5 believe that their audiences are given false hope and do not represent a real danger at hand. A reporter (Rachel Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberin), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risk their lives and health to show "live broadcast" to show death at hand. Do yourself a favor and donâ€™t look. This thing is obviously with a very low budget and faces a feeling of bad play in high school. It is terrible to act, and zombies, thirsting for flesh, are almost ridiculous. Also appearing: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. Feeding the masses should be left to starve.
