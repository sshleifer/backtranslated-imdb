I recently stumbled upon Nine Dead and read current reviews, thinking that I could handle a regular movie. This film, however, was slightly below average, but watchable. The screenplay was poorly written, and the acting was average for a Level B film with a couple that stood out as pretty good. The plot borders on the plot of So, teach people what they did wrong in the situation, and try to make them value life more, but this is where the comparison really ends. The nine dead tend to have a heart and a purpose for simple ideas that are not new. The main mistake that I discovered in Nine Dead was a slap in the face to the viewer of memories that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and completely inadequate ending that people would not see in a bad way, Except for any spoilers, I saw the worst of bad movies, and even they didn't end it badly. Decent click, bad game and end ...
