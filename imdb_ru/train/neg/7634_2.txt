This is such a film that shows the flaw in French cinema when it comes to creating thrillers. The director’s desire to “sound American” is so vivid that you won’t be fooled for a minute if you haven’t seen the serial killers movie since Peeping Tom. <br /> <br /> Two male policemen (or one and a half, more, as you will see), horrible murders, the plot is more complicated than complex. Charles Berling was unlucky with the genre (see the strikingly dull l'inconnu de Strasbourg a couple of years ago). The scenes with his pregnant wife, who is supposed to be a counterpart for another noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot, are some of the worst shot. Add a hot love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get PG 12 and thus attract a huge teenage audience. A violent and absurd conclusion, followed by a quiet epilogue that could make a good commercial for the Cote d'Azur Silence of the Lame.
