It's funny how the studio thinks it can make a continuation of the classic Christmas story with a completely new cast and expect it to come up. Of course, they used different actors for Batman, but in this case, Batman was a classic character before any of the actors put on his cloak. In this case, you had a classic character wearing light-colored horn-rimmed glasses, dressed in Ralfi, who wanted a red bb gun rider for Christmas ... Somehow we have to forget him and take on another little boy who doesn't look like to the original ... If I didn’t know that it was a sequel, I wouldn’t have guessed it from the cast ... except, of course, Charles Grodin, who is trying so hard to emulate Darrin McGevin that you are constantly reminded that the original was much better ... br / <br /> In the end, it could b work, if they made the film better. They had to look for sympathy or simply ignore the original and not try to copy its appearance. This is just a cheap imitation. Ralfi does not cause sympathy, just the desire to seem that his character shoots him in the eye or dies.
