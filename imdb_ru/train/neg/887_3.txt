After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology-based film based in New York. Unlike the original film, the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly — by the time you think you’ve made history, this ends in too many cases. And they often start and stop, and then start again with intertwined stories. As a result, there is no name that would indicate that the story is complete and less formal in its structure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while “Paris, Je T'Aime” hit or missed (mostly hit), most of “New York, I love you” was miss. The stories were usually much more sexual in nature, but also much less sweet - and often rather terrible. It was a surprisingly boring and uninteresting film with several exceptional stories - and perhaps the often depressing music made him seem even more. Now see, it was good quality music, but its gloomy tone really made me feel like cutting my wrists! One of the best was the story of a young man who drove a girl in a wheelchair to a graduation party, a couple telling about fraud near a restaurant (although this was in the first film), and a naughty old couple. It's all so sad because I loved the first movie so much - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they tried, but just didn’t like it very much. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is not really a complaint, but I was amazed at how many people smoke in the film. For a recent film that was unusual in our anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you receive a DVD, two segments that were not included in the film will be included as add-ons. One consists of Kevin Bacon (dressed in cool Fedor) who eats a hot dog .... and absolutely NOTHING anymore for almost ten minutes. The other one depicts a teenager who is filming the whole world, including a very unhappy couple.
