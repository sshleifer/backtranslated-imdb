This film was bad from the start. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to get a large amount of body. The game was terrible. The killings were very bad. For example, when Ellie flooded this toilet, I think it was in an abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie comes, and Molly and the other guy in the cabin, you see Ellie, so Angela must have gone after her. What really attracted me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin, and Angela took the guitar string and bit it. One was a terrible game, and two - why don't you just turn around and hit the bitch?!?!? Then when Molly pursues Angela, if you have a laugh, why not just turn around and stab her ??? So stupid. This movie sucks ...
