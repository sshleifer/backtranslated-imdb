So, I'm a real Wicker Man fan, and I usually donâ€™t like British films remade by Americans, so why did I experience the most painful movie events? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage, and I had some moment of madness? The movie was terrible! The piece at the beginning of the crash / fire had nothing to do with the film at all, and the policewoman knew where Edward was going, so at the end, when the two girls visited the mainland, well, this would not have happened all this would have been investigated. The story behind the woven man has not really been investigated - and I think that staying in America did not really help the whole pagan topic. This film was slow and did not contain atmosphere or expectations. I have to say that the best bit was at the very end when Nicolas Cage caught fire! Now I am in such desperate need to see the original again in order to clear my frustrated soul. I can't help but emphasize how disappointing this film is, please don't watch it if you are: <br /> <br /> A) Do not like American rework of British films. B) Love the original? C) I hate Nicolas Cage
