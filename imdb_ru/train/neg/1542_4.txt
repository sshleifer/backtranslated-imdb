was this Tim lugs the first acting role in the movie? the character, Leon, is funny enough, but soon after that the sexual jokes and humor become too stupid to listen to them anymore. Some films can do without sexual jokes, and base their audience on knowing this immediately after the appearance of advertising. some movies that do it, american pie and scary movie. The terrible film was stupid, and the American pie would not have been without sexual jokes. The only role, except for Leon, who had some kind of humor, is Ferrell. the character was really stupid, and that was all; stupid humor — that was all I was looking at. the film was fine and nothing else. I really don't understand why people who want to leave the show always get a movie based on the character they played on the show. the parody lasts about 5 minutes, and if they can make a film from a 5-minute parody, then what is the world going to? Molly Shannon was a superstar, Cherie O'Terry had a scary movie, but she wasn’t the lead and she’ll have an elf. but it was good, but he made some stupid film, but I can't remember, and Mike Myers with the world of Wayne. Why does a crazy TV team never get a movie deal? I saw only one guy break through, but only in 2 movies and TV shows with Andy Dick. but this guy relies on a comedy to continue his life, funny or not. This film is not very good, but with a positive mood. what a waste of film and people. (D D-)
