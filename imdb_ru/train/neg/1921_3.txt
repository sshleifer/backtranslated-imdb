For some strange reason, the movie world is driven by fashion. Someone makes a film about killer sharks, and then suddenly the oceans of world cinema are overrun by giant squid, octopus killer and sea monsters of all kinds. The man is pursued by a former lover from hell, then each character of the film is pursued by a policeman from hell or a roommate from hell or a nanny from hell. Then, when a large Hollywood company launches a large budget blockbuster about a tornado burdened with currency, other film producers jump on the bandwagon, the fact that they have no budget to cope with this does not stop them. Twisters night is an example. What struck me about this television film was the fact that he was trying to hide a budget deficit by shortening the commercial breaks. Every time a tornado appears, Camara stops at the actors' frightened expression, when they shout things like “Oh my gosh, he moves in that direction” and “Run for your life”, then the screen fades to black, eliminating the need for producers to increase the budget of special effects. Unfortunately, the NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget had to be increased to include the best actors. Actors are by no means bad, but they are not impressive and do not have the skills to carry a film that is controlled by a character. Where are Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word on the TWISTER clone ..... Yes, NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER, but TWISTER had been promoted for several months as the 1996 Summer blockbuster, and nott him a rushing feeling that makes me believe that it was made and released to link it with the hype around TWISTER
