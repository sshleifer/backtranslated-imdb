it's not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. it is so bad that I found it quite enjoyable. acting, oh my god script, you gotta be kidding me. as you can imagine, the writer comes up with such things as: - a child who makes fireworks at school, fireworks are SO powerful that when someone hits him, they fly a hundred yards back and explode. - the girl got into the cashier, the killer is trying to break the door. she gets a drill, but the wire is not long enough. first she makes an extension, oh, horror, and then, when she finishes, she drills the door and drills the head of the killer. WOW - and there are many more such examples. Oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
