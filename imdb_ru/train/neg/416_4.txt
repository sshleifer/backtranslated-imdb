(some spoilers) - as if you don’t know how it will end. <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. Very good publicity, a director like Paul Verhoeven, and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue, plus a very interesting topic - invisibility. All the prerequisites for a good movie were fulfilled. Unfortunately, these things did not matter at all. The film was very very weekly, without waiting and terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> It’s all a matter of a group of scientists who have discovered invisibility. After successful animal testing, Kevin Bacon decides to test it for himself. As soon as he becomes invisible, he completely changes, realizing the benefits of invisibility. From this to the killing of a very fine line. <br /> <br /> Dummy is a bad movie. He suffers from a disease that many new films have: special effects. From a complex topic that could lead producers to a good, tense psychological thriller, Verhoeven destroys everything, focusing only on special effects, without worrying about the real value of the film. I have to admit that this is amazing, probably the best I've seen since the days of the Matrix, but this is not enough to make a movie good. In fact, this is the problem of today's films. Like Verhoeven, most directors only care about exciting scenes - and nothing more. There are very few exceptions, and perhaps “The Matrix” is the only film that combines absolutely unbelievable special effects and a great plot. <br /> <br /> After the “Starship Troop” “Verhoeven again disappointed. Instead of a great movie, HM is cr * p. There are only two reasons why you can watch this film: 1. special effects 2. a joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I won’t ruin this moment ...) <br /> <br /> OK, so what happened to a movie? Everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- It doesn't bother at all. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- This is too predictable. You know from the very beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only cares about the consequences. <br /> <br /> - A lot of cliches. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bad guy wakes up several times before dying. <br /> <br /> --- As with any poor-quality horror, the first rule is to allow characters to be separated as much as possible. Every time someone is in the lab, the ideal sacrifice for Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some gaps in the plot. Example: Bacon must scan his finger first to enter the lab. After he is invisible, how can he do it? <br /> <br /> --- Ending: absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shu beats Bacon on the head, Bacon falls to the ground. Then Shu and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking around. This is normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, they "kill" him again. And then Shu shouts “I heard an explosion” (happened a few minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. Did she not hear this explosion some time ago? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene in which you can see microphones hanging above the actors. Come on, Mr. Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! <br /> <br /> So what about Hollowman. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
