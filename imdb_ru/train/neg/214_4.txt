Considering that in this film there was a serious and rather successful launch campaign, I would expect that something would be worth the smell ... from the initial scene (in which two brothers “sensually” caress each other, lying naked in bed) this going fast down ... nothing to attract attention, not one mind-blowing thing all over the plot, the game baaad baad (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising topics, but the script does not analyze either of the two in detail (keep in mind that a possible excuse for creators who say they were aiming for a thin film would be funny if only thin ...). Too curious onlookers will not get any interesting scene ... at this point, which could save part of the film ... so you can imagine how bad it is. You can say a lot more ... but please watch the movie yourself ... I am an egoist and I would like as many people as possible to spend about 1 1/2 hours of their life ... like me :(
