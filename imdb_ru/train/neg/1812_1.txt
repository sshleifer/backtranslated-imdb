Go and rent this movie now. It will be on the bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust. No one touches him through the years. It may even be a special $ .50! It costs ten bucks, I swear! Buy it! There are not so many films that can be compared with this - a celluloid version of the sticky liquid that forms at the bottom of the trash can after several years. Yes, I gave him a “1”, but he really deserves much less. Scales 1-10 were not designed with this in mind.
