In fact, these young people were so unpleasant that I could not wait for them to be killed, including Clarissa (Joanna Canton), because I considered her the most annoying of all. <br /> <br /> But I knew it would be a mess from the first minutes when teen Christina opened fire on a priest and nuns with Leslie Gore playing in the background. She had nowhere to go, except below. <br /> <br /> Even the prostheses looked fake, and the “blood” looked suspiciously like Hawaiian punch, although it later took on a red gloomy look to match the silly Halloween make-up they were all wearing. I am sure that all the GOTH morons there will appreciate this nonsense, since she will like this group. It certainly did not appeal to me. Blah ... <br /> <br /> And even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbo can't save this stupid horror movie from itself. She still looks hot though. I am glad that she takes care of herself, because nowadays we don’t see her too much. <br /> <br /> However, this is a step forward from Dante Tomaselli (2002 )’s winding HORROR in the sense that it has a somewhat consistent plot, so I’ll give it that much. This and a small Boston terrier named Boozer also raise it a notch. I like what Boozer does with Clarissa at the end. It was the only good scene in a stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films must have been in despair when they shot this film. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
