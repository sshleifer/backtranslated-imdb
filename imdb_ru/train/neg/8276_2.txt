I knew that this film would not be amazing, but I thought that I would give him a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought he had potential. Unfortunately, many of the dialogues in the film sounded very fake and stupid. I think that Aqua Fresch gave some money for the production of the film, because they seriously missed some hints everywhere. There is a shot where the sign Aquafresh sticks out on you, which you cannot but notice. Perhaps they should focus on writing and acting more than the number of times we can throw Aquafresh products into the film so people are not annoyed. The film had its moments, but I am glad that I did not spend 9.50 dollars to watch it in the theater.
