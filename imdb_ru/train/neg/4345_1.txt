Deceptive ads ... I saw a commercial for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power, which reads "From producer Scarface and Carlito's Way." ALLOWS TO GET THIS DIRECTLY ... Michael Bergman didn’t produce Scarface, in fact he was the “assistant editor of the room.” for Scarface. Not to take away talent from Bergman ... but, in my opinion, he should have learned a little more. I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate when we are blatantly lying. As for the film, at best he was poor. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzmán should be ashamed of working on this film. In general, this film did not cope with the work by filling in the gaps for the Path of Carlito. Obviously, this project was an attempt to make a quick movie a pretty good movie.
