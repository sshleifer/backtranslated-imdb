Lee gave “100 years of horror” for Ted Newsom and talked about cinema werewolves. He said something about the fact that his only brush with lycanthropy was "Howling II", then he said: "The less said about it, the better." Indeed, he was right, as this film may well be the worst in his entire catalog of on-screen presentations. Joe Dante's first Howling was an innovative werewolf film with its incredible special effects and a sense of style and plot. It was a film to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, the filmmakers for some strange reason thought that they needed even more contrived sequels, and not what worked the first time (see CHUD, then CHUD II, to illustrate this point). This film is many miles from the first on every front. There is nothing wrong with that. It looks cheap and pitch black in most major scenes. Lee - the only actor in the film, which is worth mentioning (well, I'll also give way to Ferdi Maine). Lee looks confused when talking meaningless dialogue and doing funny things (look what ends up with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what this thing is, which is a bit more insightful than the two leaders who leave America to go to Romania. The story is not worth exploring here, and you can bet that a very small story is worth mentioning when you need Stephen Parsons and his band Babylon to play most of the movie at the beginning and end with this terrible noise. Sybil Danning is here, and yes, she undresses once, and then we get this scene again and again and again, ”one reviewer said 17 times (I counted ten, but maybe at that moment I was so bored). I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves zero - the three I gave are 1 for Lee and two for Miss Dunning's contribution. Ugh!
