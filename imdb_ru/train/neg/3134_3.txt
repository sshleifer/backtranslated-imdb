The "fallen" fall under the category of waste of life (WOL). I am sad that I am not having fun two hours older now. My other family members also watched this film and threw humiliating comments on the screen and rooted for the mummy. I was sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this film, except that it can be reduced to 25 minutes, so it can take a 30 minute interval on TV without losing the plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients, but when served, is mild with no flavor at all. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot, removing the mystic and replacing it with several people who want to disprove the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. Heroes are discredited and cast into the ear by their colleges. Later, after everything was spoiled by evil people. Heroes will save the day and prove to everyone that they are wrong.
