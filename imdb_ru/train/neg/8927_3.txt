Miron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) changes the sex of the doctor (John Carradine is mortally drunk) and goes into the role of Myra (Raquel Welch). She then decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and continues to teach the history of cinema at an acting college run by lecherous John Houston (do not ask) and part with a happy young couple (young, handsome, healthy Roger Herren and Farra Fawcett - yes, Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> They shot a wonderful novel by Gore Vidal, which was irreversible, and, naturally, tried to remove it. They also hired an English guy with a determined anti-American attitude and hired a group of actors with dubious "talent" (Welch, Reed) and embarrassed old professionals (Houston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, May West) who left him. all together and .... SURPRISE !!! Absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The film received an X rating on its release (it was downgraded to R), mainly because of the truly tasteless scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren), and the scene in which Welch trying to have sex with fawcett. <br /> <br /> The film is very scandalous ... the scenes are skipped everywhere, people say and do things that have no meaning. This is not good at all, but I have never been bored. <br /> <br /> The action is changing very wildly ... Reed is terrible ... very sad. Houston chews landscapes again and again in nausea. Welch is not really as bad as Myra, but her features don't make sense, so you never know what to do with her. West is hardly in the film (blessing), and it is really kind of painful to hear a woman in almost 80 years breaking into sexual jokes. Roger Herren (whatever happened ...) was very young, handsome and not as bad as Rusty. Fawcett is fine. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s hard to find something to say about this ... you just look at it with a grain of salt. Need to watch a movie - believe it !!!!
