The main drawback of the film is its boring script. It moves back and forth between the vignettes of Betty's story and the re-creation of short Clow films. Despite the fact that the recreation of Kloo is done well, there is no need to recreate them almost completely. Paige Richards, though not an amazing actress, generally does a decent job. And sometimes she is very similar to Betty. You should also pay special attention to details. Suits and clothes are great, as these are some of the given directions. The sets are usually rare and feel the stage, but feel the era. Sometimes it is surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the whole image a bright, retro-style atmosphere.
