Can you say to yourself: “Don Johnson as Elvis? Could this work? Is it possible? I think this is a terrible choice, but perhaps I should have an unbiased look. Maybe I will be surprised. Maybe he can handle it? ” "<br /> <br /> NO! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he is a terrible Elvis. He’s too low, too weak, voiced, too harsh ... well, you already imagined how bad it will be. Add to this a hockey black wig, tight eyeliner and mascara, and this is a big fat embarrassing mess. <br /> <br /> The best I can say is that since Johnson plays decently, and his imitation is far away, after a while you don’t even think about him as Elvis is anymore.You see him as some other crazy pop star. Then, at this level, the film Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally played as a high, beauty queen Linda Thompson, but she is attractive by herself and plays a role with the honesty, elegance and intelligence that we used to expect from everyone her roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be some kind of doping to stick to doping abusing doping. <br /> <br /> This story is nothing new; we heard it many times before. If you are looking for new information or understanding, you will not find it. She is told as a love story - unrequited: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
