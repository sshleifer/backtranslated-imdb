I also saw this surprisingly bad piece of “anime” at the London fiction festival. If you need to watch this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few bottles of beer, then you can get some pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> I found this dialogue ridiculous, and in my view there was an idea about Cremator. The animation is terrible. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. For producers, it would be nice to hire at least one person who does not suffer from color blindness. <br /> <br /> In fact, nothing more to say, this film is failed at all levels.
