Now I had the best intentions when viewing this. I like some of the work of Tony Scott, and my friend told me that this is a great movie, even though I heard about it from other people. But it was just hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott tried too hard. It was just too much. Let me clarify. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley replayed, and not in a good way. The people who performed well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen time simply could not save the film. <br /> <br /> There were several scenes that popped up in their originality, but somehow it seemed that they were written by someone other than the main author. Some melody was used about 4 times, which really began to fail after the second time. I firmly believe that I will not use the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> In addition, editing really went with it, as the cutting speed is quite high. Oh, and Keira’s repeated echo of some lines just sounded silly when he heard him in the second, third, fourth time, and so on. <br /> <br /> In fact, my opinion is that if you want to see an action film that is quick and “somewhat” funny, and you don't care what I mentioned above, you might like it, < br /> <br /> (On the other hand: I am not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
