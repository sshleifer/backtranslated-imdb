I sincerely view this film as another bad effort from the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny, but then when they change their role in society (men do what women usually do, and women do what men usually do), the movie falls. It becomes boring and not at all funny. They give a lot of things without giving reasons, and the end of the film is predictable. I did not like the way Roberto Angel played his character and his little one. I went to the cinema in the hope of seeing a good job, but I was very upset. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
