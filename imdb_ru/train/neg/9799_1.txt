Power Rangers, the absolutely horrible children's show of the 1990s, still continues to disturb young children with its full fun and terrible settings. <br /> <br /> This show was not fun, it was an occasion to teach children to show violence in children, how to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> Toys are another demonstration of how to promote a brutal TV show and the like. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to understand what was the purpose of this absolutely ridiculous show. <br /> <br /> Thus, it remains one of the worst children's shows ever created.
