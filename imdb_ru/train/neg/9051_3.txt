I was so excited when I discovered that it was available! I could not wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It’s like a rarity CD from your favorite band that you found in the back of the rack at your local record store. Being a hardcore fan, you were sure that it was a valuable discovery. But as soon as you heard it, it became obvious why these dogs never made it to the real album. This DVD is recommended only for "final" who should have everything that Lynch did. "Six Men Getting Sick" - visually interesting, but short and repetitive. He lacks the strength of the later work of Lynch "Grandmother" - it is simply immature work. It is tedious and looks like a student film. But it was the 70s ... I wonder only if you hope to conduct a psychoanalysis of the director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of its images and trademark sounds. The “Alphabet” is forgotten (in fact, no! I don’t remember it at all!) "Cowboy and Frenchman" is just stupid. "Lumiere" - the only one standing in this group. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story, comparable to his best work. I had to watch it several times. But it works in less than 2 minutes. It is hardly worth renting or buying a DVD.
