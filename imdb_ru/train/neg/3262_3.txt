Shortly after the release, I was fortunate enough to meet with George Pal (and I still have an autograph with his DS: TMOB poster) at the convention, and I asked him why he decided to make the film Camp. Before he could answer, two studio journalists intercepted and gave me a lecture about how the studio “knew better” and how “no one would take such a film seriously”. I read Bantam's reissues for a few years thanks to a friend (the 1970s ComiCon participants will remember Blackhawk and his group? I was with him a couple of years later), and I had high hopes than what we received. <br /> <br /> Flaxes insisted that no adventures would ever be taken seriously, and therefore the “camp” was the only way out. Several other fans jumped towards me, and Pel listened as best he could. At the end of a small event, Pal approached us and apologized, wishing he could do more and better. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS are cheating on lies, and a year after Pal Spielberg and Lucas died, he proved that Doc Savage could easily have become the next big film franchise ... if not for the scam. <br /> <br /> Rip out the memory or history of the Doc, and the film will have cost 6/10 of rating as nothing more than a meaningless popcorn seller. <br /> <br /> But to destroy such a legacy was no less an abomination than to kill a child in a crib. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still appear on the screen and experience the inevitable comparisons from the uninformed Indiana Jones, but this must be done with all seriousness and seriousness in order to regain the glory we must expect from the First American Superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second scenario for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it is much more serious. Yes, the shots were taken at the same time, but mostly they were shots and very few with the actors. And, yes, there is one sheet of Ron Eli who jumps over a brick wall and shoots something over his shoulder with a specially made bronze pistol. Eli wears a rag over a white button down shirt with a bronze tie and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... Comes next summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the studio frauds that accompanied George Pal in 1975 in San Diego to the convention were, beat idiots on the head and call them what they are. At that time, they made pens and Fu Manchu in stripes and baggy pants made of cloth and carried Paramount briefcases.
