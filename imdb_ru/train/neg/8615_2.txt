This film was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had hard times to watch it to the end. I saw this guy Rodney in the movie "Natural Born Killers", and it seemed to me that he was damn funny, but this movie was crap. The “jokes” were not funny, the actors were not funny, nothing about that was even funny. Do not waste your time on this! The only positive points in this regard were beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon, who, I am sure, tried my best, but the script was too awful. That's why I rated it “2” instead of “1”, but this is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen.
