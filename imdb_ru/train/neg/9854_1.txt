This documentary (or, I would say, modeled) is a perfect example of how ridiculous people can be when they have complete enthusiasm for something like that. Honestly, I hate cryptozoology. This is unconscious, it simply destroys it. However, some of the positives in this were visual effects (the dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this layout was completely fake and it really disappoints because it came from scientists, so this is the reason why it deserves 10 , not 0. An example of false information could be the idea of ​​hydrogen: it is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but in such proportions this is not possible, so in this case, you need a good explanation of what actually happens in the dragon's stomach . There are many substances in nature except hydrogen, but it is not necessary that the animal fly out loud and hydrogen does not appear from nothing, therefore this is impossible. In any case, in fact there is something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is harder to find than gold, and I cannot explain how dragons survive depending on this. Ridiculously, they represent dragons as creatures with little chance of conquering planet Earth, but at least this explains why they became extinct. Cryptologists probably call themselves scientists, but this is not true. People like them are lying, as in this mockery, and, worst of all, some people buy them. But I do not think that a person who cares about Science will believe in dragons after seeing this. These fake scientists are wasting their time.
