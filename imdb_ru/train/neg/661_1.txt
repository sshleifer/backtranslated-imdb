Good. So I just came back. Before I begin my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted this film to be liked. I know that in the past I had negative emotions, but I was hoping to be surprised and really love the movie. I did not do this. <br /> <br /> It’s not just the fact that there are every imaginable horror cliche in it. And it's not just that they turn every little thing into a frightening jump (go to a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding?). It just wasn't scary. One thing that surprised me: there was more blood there than I thought it would be ... that says little. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that Lisa’s mother throws a house to Donna. She enters .. goes upstairs. The camera shows the father who died on the couch. Creepy. She goes upstairs to where the aforementioned baseball bat scene takes place. Finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could she say? He had no blood stain on him). The killer comes, Donna hides under the bed, mom dies. She runs out into the street screaming for help. The killer behind her: "I did it for us." The transition to a session of therapy. It embarrassed many people - everyone asked if her family really died or she imagined it - and she mentions how nightmares began to return. Dialog is filled. <br /> <br /> They quickly begin to pursue. Few scenes in the cabin, they go to the hotel. Of course, the killer was already there (for some reason he ran away 3 days ago, but the police / family were not informed while he was already there). This is followed by more filler. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about what is happening in the film, because I do not want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who is dying, Horror_Fan has already posted a message about it. But on the themes of death: they were not so exciting. People in the theater laughed out loud (an experience I had never experienced in horror films, even in Stranger Bells) during several of them. One, in particular: the guy from the bus, who gives the most fun "scared" person I have ever seen. The only death with any blood was Lisa, and it was quite a bit. Her throat was cut, blood (if you can even call it that — it was almost black) splashes onto the curtain. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to hit her several times after strangling her to death. Hmm, ok? The film was one of the most cliches I've ever seen. Let's see here .. be sure to close the mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Check it out. In fact, twice (you can say that they fought). Required backup to the killer. Check it out. There is also a scene with a background, but you all saw it. Oh, you say you want to scare the flying birds? Well, you understand! (Yes, they managed to include one of those here). And, of course, the scene "we have security at all the exits, but he still ran away." Should I go further? I could. <br /> <br /> If you say that the characters are not stupid, are you kidding? “Oh, even despite the loud alarm, literally saying,“ PLEASE WATER THE BUILDING, ”and three of my friends were missing, I'm going to go upstairs to pick up my clothes.” These characters were among the most inappropriate and stupid characters. The only pleasant character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the film. “Oh, I just realized that the psychology teacher is here! I have to leave my strong guy behind to run away to warn her! Oh, shoot, does the elevator slow down? I think I'll go up the stairs and run to the construction site! Ugh. By the end of the film, they all deserve to die. The only death that anyone felt remorse was Donna's boyfriend (I don’t even remember his name - is that bad?), And by that time the audience was completely exhausted by this unceremonious cliche. <br /> There were SOME positives - the acting was mostly decent, and that was good. But that's all. <br /> <br /> I would give 1/5, and this is generous. Just for fun (and believe me, the audience had a few people) and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Yes, the reaction was bad. Very bad. After the end of the film, people were seething, and then the hum was very negative. Expect bad legs for this.
