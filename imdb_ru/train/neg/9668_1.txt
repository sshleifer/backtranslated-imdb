1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland recorded by German cameramen with the naive cooperation of the Jewish community, combined with archival footage, clips from international newsreels and excerpts from relevant cultural films for depicting world Jews as fraudsters and parasites. This “documentary” interprets Jewish life in terms of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. Frank, cinematically unique expression of racial hatred. Personally, I find this film scary and extremely offensive. One can only hope that such pictures never reach the screen.
