I just stumbled upon this movie on the surf channel. My first reaction was: “God, not again!”. Nowadays, playing retard is so fashionable that it has become pretentious and frankly contemptible. although for some reason I stayed and looked until the end. perhaps it was my faith in the actors, in the hope that they would give me a reason for joy. <br /> <br /> and of course Ken and Elena can act. In addition, the film progresses to something better towards the end and actually makes sense. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with her character. Jane has a disgusting side that she uses to keep her distance and reflect pity. on the other hand, she has a soft side that just looks for love. The only thing that surprised me even more was the character Branag ... it was the triumph of acting, the film itself is not something unique. in search of pure entertainment, you can skip this. this is sean penn seriously! oh god it was a bit harsh, there are a couple of jokes in it ... but not for escapists.
