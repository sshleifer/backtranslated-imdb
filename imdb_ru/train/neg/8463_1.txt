No script, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Burke Burke Burke ... <br /> <br /> Give me the budget to do this ... In Belgium we make ten films that win all prices in Cannes with this. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw such a NULL film was Hypercube. But the script was better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know whether the director was a school film graduate or a police officer? <br /> <br /> The best in this film was the word "The End." <br /> <br /> Why allow selling it? 1ç expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy it. <br /> <br /> For me to pay for it was my BIG MISTAKE of the millennium. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Next time I’ll break my arm, but I’ll buy this type of shit.
