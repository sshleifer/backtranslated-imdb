Richard Dreyfuss is indeed in this film, but in a rather small part. He is NOT an “obsessed” director - he is a business manager / accountant of the group. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. In advertising Sondra Locke no erotic scenes, unless you use the term "erotica" quite freely. I would not consider the film without Richard Dreyfuss as the main character. I could, however, understand that the famous anthem of the 60s, "Susanna" by Leonard Cohen, had an artistic influence. In addition to a summary of the lines from the end of Ulysses by James Joyce and an interesting visual reference to the end of the Seventh Seal by Ingmar Bergman, I found this an unsuccessful attempt to mix symbolic elements and moods perpetuated in films such as “Last Year in Marianbad” and Un Chien Andalou. If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric artistic troupe, there are many excellent films, ranging from “Bye, Bye, Brazil” to “Cecil B. Mad”.
