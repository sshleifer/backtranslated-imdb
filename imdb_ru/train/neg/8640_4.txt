I watched 3/4 of this film and wondered why he got such horrible reviews. It was quite easy to watch (at 3 am). He had a good casting — Kevin Dillon’s role in the role of a serial sociopath killer was very plausible — he was both characteristically and frightening. The rest of the main characters were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> This is your typical film about stalker and suspense. A married couple cannot become pregnant, so they seek help from an infertility clinic. The donor-sociopath of "genetic material" is fixated on recipients and, in the typical form of a stalker, interferes with their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the film was pretty good ... we see Conan growing more and more obsessed with raising his child and creating an ideal family with his mother. Of course, he can't do it the way he planned. A good storyline. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just awful. I am quite tolerant of films (especially at 3 am!) ... but I was just amazed at how poorly written the final was. I actually scoffed at myself loudly! <br /> <br /> In general, not the worst movie I’ve seen, but I couldn’t watch it again (if I don’t miss the final). The only quality that can be rethought here is the role of Kevin Dillon - one of the best serial killers in history. <br /> <br /> Try to watch other channels before watching this ... But, if nothing happens, I would try .. =)
