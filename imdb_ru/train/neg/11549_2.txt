Although there were some funny moments, I thought the film was rather lame. The longer he ran, the worse he became. As soon as the action entered the Monument Valley, I found that I could see more magnificent exits than the increasingly stupid and flimsy interaction of characters. <br /> <br /> The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent. She first enters into a deal, then finds out the truth and releases on bail. Then she comes back again, then leaves them again. Then she came back again. There is no obvious motivation for any of her decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes and a lot of missed opportunities. I would have to say that the paintings were much smaller than the sum of its parts. Apparently, people who liked Repo Man liked this one. Searchers 2.0 is not suitable for The Searchers.
