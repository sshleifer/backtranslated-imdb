This film is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee cannot save it. A bad story, an even more meager screenplay and just a bad guide make this film a truly outstanding horror film, the outstanding part is that it is the only horror film that I can. Honestly, I would never watch again. Because of this garbage, the Plan Nine from space looks like Oscar material.
