The plot = Melissa is a new girl in the city, she is fifteen years old, and in a week her birthday is coming. Because Melissa is beautiful, every boy in the city wants to meet her, but the few who manage to interest her die mysteriously. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason I wanted to watch this movie is because Dana Kimmel is from Friday. 13th part 3 was in it, which is not a good reason to hurry and watch a movie. When I started to watch it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a very good slasher, it is really boring and boring and just will not go anywhere. After more than an hour, only three murders occurred, and the story did not actually develop in any possible way. <br /> <br /> The film is well shot with pretty good photography and good directing, but just like with many other slashers. In the 80s the film suffers from darkness. Although acting is pretty good, and Melissa's heroine is easy to sympathize with, even if she is a complete slut. <br /> <br /> The storyline is not completely nonsense, but itâ€™s too boring to interest you, the only things that interested me were Melissa, which was stunning, and Dana Kimmel, whose really cute and cute in this film. <br /> <br /> In general, a rather boring slasher that will not go anywhere, I would definitely not recommend it to Slasher fans.
