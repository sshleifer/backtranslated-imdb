Glory to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent every day in the dressing room for hours to watch the role of Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars in the 1930s, and I wonder how many people today — besides lovers of classic cinema — know something about it. He has been a giant in business for at least ten years. He could have won an Oscar for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, since he won it for Louis Pasteur a year earlier. My own opinion is that, although he tended to replay a little, I still think he was one of the great actors of the Golden Age. Whatever role he plays; You were chained to the screen, watching him. <br /> <br /> Unlike the role of Pasteur, I thought that this story gives up too much of what we have seen in the last 60 years: to move overboard to make a liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress his contempt for the police or the military, and here we can say how "corrupt" these organizations are. The filmmakers simply adore when power is contested and won. In this regard, this film is far ahead of its time, since we have seen this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that the facts confirm this story. It also does not in any way detract from the achievements of Zola as a social reformer, eliminating certain evils. Good for him! I wish they would spend more time showing it than focusing on one test.
