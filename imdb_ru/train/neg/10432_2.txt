The terrible end - and I can not believe that Moore spent a year coming up with it. The smells of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetits, which, as Hubbard claimed, he wrote in just three weeks. It was disappointing enough for me to leave my discs from the first 3.5 years. So, the first 1.5 hours were filled with action, albeit absurd in the premise, and then it grew into a slow, painful, sofomoric dissolution of the series. It is incredible how slow and long the last hour was. Should we have thought more deeply? If I wanted to get a lesson in materialism, I would reread Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. It is absurd to think that 38 thousand people will give up everything for the sake of a “new start”. Absurd to throw in the disappearing Karu, and the reappearing Baltar and the Six. Absurd to throw in Mitochondrial Eve. Just absurd.
