I checked it on a DVD for a buck so that I can smile easily when this horrible movie unfolds. every time you think it can't get worse, it inevitably happens. The game is absolutely terrible. the plot doesn't make any sense at all. The name "cold revenge" in the American version of the DVD has absolutely no relation to the script. The scene of the action is so obviously taken at first sight. There are a lot of mistakes during the conversations, indicating that there is simply no intention of doing another take to at least try to make this film tolerable. I don’t remember seeing the worst movie, and sometimes I’m getting bad — well, except that you can stop it with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, albeit a bad one? Unstoppable deserves an award for the best picture on the Oscars compared to this piece of shit.
