The endless madness of smart visual ironies does not necessarily create an attractive film. Half of the film "Blonde Wig" has never been filmed, perhaps because of too much indulgence to its creators. <br /> <br /> Half Wong Fay (with a very playful, if you look at Karen Carpenter, Fay Wong) has much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the element of the story “the girl meets the boy” fades into the background of sly ingenuity. Character development is uneven. Emotions are not enough. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Chonking Express effectively uses Mung Jung Yun Wong Fay (Cantonese version of the Cranberry hit Dreams) Fay Wong also recorded a Mandarin version called Zhen Tuo. Both are on the CD, although only the "Mung Jung Yun" can be found on the official film soundtrack.
