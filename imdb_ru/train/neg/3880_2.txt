I can watch a good movie from time to time. I saw some pretty sick things. Nevertheless, this is one of the few films that I find grotesque, simply disgusting and disgusting. I like bloody movies when they are funny. I like it when they have a lot of creativity. The blood in this film is not creative. It hurts. It's disgusting. This is completely unpleasant. Because of this, this film is certainly not entertaining. A horror movie, but it lacks panic. So pretty much the only reason this film can be watched is blood, but this is the most unattractive and ugly aspect of the whole film, and that says a lot. Acting is terrible, the plot does not make sense, and the music is really annoying and TOO TOO electronic sound. All this pulled me straight from the movie. Virtually the entire film is one big long and depressing test. There is this guy who had an accident in the shuttle and woke up in the hospital to find that his skin was melting and melting. I guess after that he goes out and eats human flesh to slow the melting process. There is some strange plot in which the old couple is chased by a dog, some dismembered head goes with the flow, and the ending in which a person is killed by a current. There were times when I tried my best to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole film that I thought was even interesting was the scene at the beginning when the nurse slowly ran down the hospital corridor. If you like ugly, nasty and unattractive horror movies, then this one is for you.
