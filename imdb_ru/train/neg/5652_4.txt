This is a good movie ... but this is the type that makes you watch your girlfriend. The story is not bad ... it just makes an hour and a half so long. It's hard for me to spoil this movie, because I really like his idea, but it was too long and thin in history ... too bad. The main character never seems to change everything so much from start to finish. I mean, going through something "life is changing," and he can barely smile. I really thought Mac was really good. His strange quirkiness did not allow the film to become a complete disaster. Maybe I just do not “get” this movie. If anyone can explain this to me, I would like to be informed.
