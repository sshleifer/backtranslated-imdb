Without repeating what was said above about this film, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this film ... the cast / location and work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom, etc. ... It was vague the shadow of "Do not look now" about the storyline from the beginning. Staying in a different environment (again in Italy) to reduce the heartbreaking losses ... or maybe that is how I saw it? Consequently, I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and told us that we expected what would happen to this family in a foreign European country ... and I sat there and sat there ... and guess what? in fact, nothing happens! and I mean nothing !! You do not even give the opportunity to penetrate the characters, as they are so one-dimensional and empty. Because of the pace of the movie, you can believe that something had to happen to turn the entire movie upside down ... Flirting the eldest daughter with the local boys Vespa had great opportunities to take the film in a different direction, the vision of the youngest daughter her dead mother turned out to be fruitless and senseless exercises, fathers' attempts to be seduced by one of his students felt ridiculous, considering his age. It seemed that the script was made the last time when they decided at the last minute to destroy any intuition in history and went on to minimize it, but to no avail. When loans started to roll (unexpectedly), you can't help but feel overwhelmed by the time spent watching this pile of rubbish.
