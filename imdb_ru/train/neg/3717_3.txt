Chris Rock, obviously desperate for a cozy stellar vehicle that would pass his appeal to a white and main black audience, updates the popular 1978 comedy Heaven Can Wait ”with the city’s agenda. He plays a struggling comedian who has got into a car accident, whose soul is removed too early from his body - therefore, his angels need to find another body to put him in, and only the body of a white businessman can come up with it. Rewriting such a boring and sentimental film like Heaven Can Wait, only shows that Rock was at the box office (it was a purely corporate move, organized by the most hired Hollywood players). Why not strive for something more sublime or more memorable than the silly comedy about reincarnation, which ends with Apollo's Evening? The stunning cast (including the usually reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and the stunning Frankie Faison) do everything they can, but Rock seems awkward and unsure of himself. * 1/2 of ****
