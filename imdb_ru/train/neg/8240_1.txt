Do not waste your time watching this! If you do not want to study it for all the wrong things that you should not do to make a good movie. I am not the one who usually watches the movie, but this film is personal. I spent precious time that they cannot return. I feel obligated to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this shit. If this was a student project, I would say not bad, but only during the first 15 minutes ... after that it is annoying. screams, bad sound, bad video (a good operator could do this much better). and yes, what's with the blair-witch effect? no budget? I was hoping that everything would be better, but it is not. Now, how the hell does that deserve 4? 2 more true, but 1 for a waste of time! I told my world.
