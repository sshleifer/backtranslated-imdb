Resnais, wow! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the task of creating a French musical of the 1930s in bright colors. The opening voice-over with old, decorated headlines was a nice touch. Then the camera diaphragm opens (as with old handles) on a black and white display. The camera retreats (more precisely, upwards), unexpectedly showing us the surprisingly bright colors of an elegant table service for tea drinking. This is all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music begins. A rather banal and memorable diddy with an unconvincing chorus of three girls talking some kind of nonsense that has nothing to do with the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can't blame the subtitles for that). These characters whistle through the door and are replaced by a large number of people who break into an even more forgotten song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tothou appears, and we hear our first noticeable dialogue 15 minutes after the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that Resnais intended to start with such a gaping waste of time and music cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to throw the pins on the screen and fall out. I suffered. <br /> <br /> This is not much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no acquaintance with any of the characters. We do not even see their faces in half (since Resne seems to be too eager to showcase expensive landscapes to take care of real people in front of the camera). People run on the stage and beyond, like moths, around a lamp, and we, the audience, cannot focus on any particular person or plot. It's as if you took every episode of “Brady Bunch” and put it in a two-hour film. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me look while I was doing (1 hour) was that I was looking at the camera technique, the lighting and the scenery, which I admit was excellent. But is it enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I will try to see the end. Oh who I am kidding I have more important things to do. I am sure you too. Skip this.
