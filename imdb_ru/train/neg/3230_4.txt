I just finished watching the experiment with the guinea pig and the devil. I have to say that this film, although with a very good FX, better than I expected, was NOT a good film. I honestly can not say that I liked this movie at all. Of course, this is an effective way to be shocking, realistic, perverted by 43 minutes of torture, but I found it very boring (and not as bad as I had hoped). I also found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and lounged, trying to sound harsh all the time, which spoiled them even more (and I am sure that there are some people who will agree with me on this subject). Now I saw a guinea pig 1,2,3,5, and the best of those, in my opinion, is a guinea pig 2 - Flowers of flesh and blood. I will not say much more about the Devils experiment, except Great FX, the descent acting from the girl, annoying fucking tormentors, in general, I give him 4 stars because of FX because they are amazing.
