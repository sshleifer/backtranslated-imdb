If you’ve ever seen Brian Avenet-Bradley’s movie and compared it with the feedback he gets on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are fake. TRUST ME: you will be bored! People from the production team write their reviews themselves (sometimes they even admit it). But this is not enough: they also constantly press "no" when a negative commentary to the film appears. That is why negative critics always stand behind cheaters. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad game, bad lighting, bad script, bad final. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley can be a pretty good businessman. Otherwise, it cannot be explained that he finds people who are still funding his films. (Well, they are cheap, but nonetheless.) But as a creative person, he is a complete failure.
