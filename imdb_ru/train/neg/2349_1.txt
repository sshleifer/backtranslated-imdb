There was a great movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is completely unable to convey the great charisma that Biko possessed. The great crowd scenes of Attenborough are ridiculous. The Soweto massacre was not like this: three neat lines of children (some make wheels!) Happily march into the guns of the soldiers. After Biko's death, the film quickly turns into a farce. If the fight against apartheid was something, then it was a fight of blacks, but we all must somehow be embraced by the salvation of the white man and his family. I am sure that Donald Woods was a decent man, and he will be the first to say that Biko is important, but he is not. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire, and she seems to be completely unaware that she is in South Africa at all. altogether. Wood's family dog ​​gets more lines than a black maid. When the family flees from one woman I watched the film with - by the way, one of about a dozen black people in a big full movie theater - whispered: “This is like the sound of music.” She had a point of view. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a film by well-meaning, albeit somewhat inept, white liberals about the struggle of radical blacks. Indeed, South Africa needs well-meaning white liberals, as it needs a hole in its head.
