The film is about a group of filmmakers who want to make a documentary about a new kind of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of films, including some evil animals or monsters, I thought that this could be my film ... it is not so !!! This should be more of a guide, how not to do it! There is a lot of casual humor in him, and an evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene he goes after the main characters * roll *, his legs are clearly waving in the air! It looks funny! Good for laughs though. If it was only because of the lack of talent between the actors, embarrassingly stupid dialogues and a funny idiot crocodile, it would at least be a good laugh, but it gets worse: I think the people responsible for this film would notice it may be, so that they, although they adhere to the old idea of ​​“sex sells” ... In general, I mean FULLY for no reason, one of the main actresses shows their breasts to the beast. And somewhere in the beginning there is some sort of meaningless "cosmetics". This is the last ingredient that makes the film absolute rubbish for me. It's incredible how people actually spend time producing such garbage! If you are looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
