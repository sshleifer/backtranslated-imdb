I am probably one of the few who actually read the book of Stephen King, on which this film was based. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see her version of the film. After watching the film, I was completely disappointed. The only thing that this film has in common with the book is the name and the names of the characters. In the book, the character Schwarzenegger presented on the game show. The main goal is to survive. But he is not in the arena. He settled in the city and must escape from the villains of the game show (I think you would call them) that are completely different from the characters in the movie. This premise has built a lot of tension and suspensions and ended with a climax. The film was absolute bullshit. This was not a cinematic quality. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he messed with it.
