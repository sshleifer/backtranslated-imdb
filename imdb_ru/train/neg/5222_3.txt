This is a really bad movie. What for? First of all, the story is bad. This is an artificial story that unites all kinds of things that have no meaning. It just seems like the wrong experiment. Secondly, the actors can not play realistic. They can't even speak like an actor should. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do with this now?
