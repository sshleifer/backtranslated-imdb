This is one of those films that I could watch only once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialogue, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Of course, it was 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that such actors as Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, VS Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there were faces screaming for recognition, which was not) The film simply stuck together without unity. Much of the spirit, humor and continuity of Lewis Carrols is missing. What a pity! This is such a wonderful book. I would recommend the 1951 Disney version.
