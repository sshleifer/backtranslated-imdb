Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) killed his child, and his wife was brutally attacked during the invasion of the house. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) is trying to help him survive post-traumatic stress. Then Archer finds himself face to face with a man (Til Schweiger), bound and gagged with a chair. He is told that this is a man who killed his child and attacked his wife, and he can do whatever he wants with him. And there is a large set of tools to help him ... <br /> <br /> At first, the film is interesting (and shows real restraint regarding blood and blood), but every minute it becomes more stupid and has some unlikely plot twists and turns. It all ends with a final turn, which was so old and stupid that I was shocked when someone would even think about using it. As such talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer got carried away with crap like this, I donâ€™t understand. It gets three stars for the action, but the stupid plot and really incredible twists make this work hard.
