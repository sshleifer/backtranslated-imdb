This movie was at times funny, damn it, sometimes it was even funny. <br /> <br /> The main idea I got from the film was that women are responsible for all the problems of the man. Every time a woman is portrayed in a film, she is lazy, dissolute, or blames a poor guy for no apparent reason. I do not think this message is useful for women or gays. <br /> <br /> But this is a comedy and a work of art, so this is just someoneâ€™s point of view. Even if I do not agree with this, they are still entitled to it. <br /> <br /> Funny movie, but some comments made by others are just stupid. The best movie of my life.
