This is a bad film, it seems that there are only 5 policemen in Hong Kong, they didnâ€™t use weapons there, and it makes me feel like a Jackie Chan movie. All the time they used weapons to point only to the suspect. When they finally use their weapons, when they kill each other, what a funny movie. In the film, all the good guys died for no reason. <br /> <br /> They have a plot line of the film sucks too, the story here and there jumps and misses people. But if you wanted to watch a bloody film, I think it is just a normal type of film, I think that a zombie film made in the USA is more bloody than this
