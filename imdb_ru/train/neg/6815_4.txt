The eight Gene Rollin films I watched are also perhaps the strangest; The intriguing plot (as it is) at first seems too fragile to even withstand its balance for 84 minutes, but somehow it manages to get confused in the process! The future female vampire (poorly dressed, as promised in the title) is held in captivity in a remote castle and appears only to “feast” on the blood of willing victims (who are obviously members of a suicide club). As if unsure where all this would lead him, does the author-director eventually have a human villain ?? is actually the strange father of the hero with a blank face ?? ridiculously revealed as a mutant (?!) from the future! The heavy pace and fabulous atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical for the director (as well as off the coast at the climax {anti}), as well as a flock of Nubil beauties. Personally, the most enjoyable thing in all visually attractive, but intellectually meaningless novel was to watch as familiar actor Bernard Musson (starring in the last six films about Luis Bunuel) from time to time skips through him!
