Has anyone edited this movie? Or was it just a DVD release with huge thirty-second intervals between scenes? I'm fine, I fell asleep watching this for the first time. Then I fell asleep a second time and a third time. The plot isn't really the worst I've seen, but it's close. Acting is not the worst I've seen ... but it is close. Production .... well, I can honestly say that this was the worst thing I have ever seen in my life! Not trying to be angry, but Unhinged could use something else. <br /> <br /> Please do not think that I hate horror movies or even that I did not like this movie. I just felt that I was laughing at the movie much more than I was laughing with it. The terrible moments were not too badly made, but it could be better even with a limited budget. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed awkwardly developed or ignored all together, the completion of the turns was pretty bad, and the exposure lasted forever without exposing much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
