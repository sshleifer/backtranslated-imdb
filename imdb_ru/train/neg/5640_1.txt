I am a big fan of Willem Defoe, and really was looking for this film (I needed to get a DVD from the Chinese region 5!). But this is really one of the worst that I have seen lately. <br /> <br /> Acting (except Defoe) is terrible. Defoe and Kolagrande OBA wrote and directed it (although he is not credited as a director), and they have NO visible talents for writing or directing. (Stick to the current Willem; Hyades, go out of business, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing happens. With the exception of a number of completely unconvincing, completely without plausible motives, the actions of these two people (who have just met) in this house. Sleepy Colagrande, I didn't give a damn about facial expressions, NEVER changed. And the sex scenes are completely unconvincing. I actually cringe twice on one of them. Ugh! They are definitely not erotic at all, and yet this is the only time the film doesnâ€™t put to sleep. Then he is busy pushing you away. <br /> <br /> Just awful.
