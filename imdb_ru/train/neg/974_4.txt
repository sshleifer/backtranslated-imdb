This film sounds as if it were interesting and interesting from its description. But for me it was a bit of a disappointment. Very slow and difficult to watch and see what happens. As if the filmmaker took the individual pieces of the film and threw them into the air, and they fused together depending on how they landed (definitely not in sequential order). In addition, nothing was filmed. I watched quite a lot of different Korean films and noticed that the good part is well done and requires some thought from the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood film. But this one puzzled me endlessly. I watched the movie a second and third time, and he still didn’t do anything for me. I still do not understand what the director was trying to convey. If it was just to show the typical worldly part of a person’s life, I think he would succeed. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this film to anyone.
