Scotty (Grant Kramer, who will act in the big B-movie “Killer Clowns from Space”) agrees to help three middle-aged men learn to “engage in dialogue” with the girls in this bad 80s comedy. Not bad, as in the 80s, which meant "good." Bad as in bad. Without cute characters, including, but not limited to, a child who looks like the strangest guy from Friday, 13th part 2, a girl who leads men and then hisses when they want to touch her, and a sign of greasy carelessness, because in the end, what will be the comedy of the 80s without a fat slut ?? Well, this one has two. This film is largely the bottom of the barrels of the 80s sex comedies. And then a continuation followed, thus deepening the said barrel of proverbs. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Eye candy: too much to count, you even see a strange-looking child, imagined with tits in place, think “Bahlor party”, but not so funny and VERY anxious. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
