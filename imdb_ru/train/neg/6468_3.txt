It is good that “The Score” came to Marlon Brando as a farewell performance, because I would not like to think that he goes to “Free Money”. Not that his fans should remember him. <br /> <br /> Brando in recent years is more like Orson Welles, and Free Money is the film that Wells would have made in search of funding for his own work. Brando is the head of the local prison, which in America, when she is in a small rural area, is usually the largest employer in the area. This gives the one who responds a lot of influence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has one weakness that he indulges in with his two twins, also known as daughters. Even when they both get pregnant from a couple of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden, their hearts still belong to the pope. <br /> <br /> Not to be afraid, because Brando is ready to give them work in the prison where they work. in conditions not much better than those convicted. What to do, but to commit a robbery of a train that passes through the settlement, each time carrying used money that will be burned by the Treasury. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Free Money has a few moments of humor, in most cases it is far from the talents of all participants. Some of them include Donald Sutherland in the role of a no less corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, as well as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and the rest of the actors have to work with someone who many rate as the greatest American actor of the last century. If not for the presence of Brando, but 40 years ago, “Free Money” would have played a race in the red state of America, where the population could see how they were being saturized. <br /> <br /> Or a weak attempt was made to satiate them.
