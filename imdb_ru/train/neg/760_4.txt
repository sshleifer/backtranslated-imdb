An unfinished and unremarkable “new” Colombo, who sees a man in the Mac attend his nephew's wedding only so that his bride will disappear on the wedding night. Colombo is investigating ... <br /> <br /> And this is all: indifferently drawn and wonderfully filled with a flat script, given that it was written by Robert Van Skoyk, who wrote Colombo’s very pleasant story Murder under Glass in the prime of a detective story; there is not even a murder to talk about, and the greatest ingenuity provided by the scriptwriter to Colombo is the narrowing of the suspects from the photographs taken at the wedding, including everyone who was there! <br /> <br /> Deprived of all the possible features of Colombo, I thought I was watching the episode of Blues Hill Street. Insulting the history of the show with acting in the style of a soap opera. Very avoidable stuff.
