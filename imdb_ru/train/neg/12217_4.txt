When low-budget indies come out, you usually discover that you get what you pay for, and let me say that I didn't pay too much for Frightworld ... <br /> <br /> Writer / director: David R. Williams tells us a story about an abandoned amusement park besieged by the vengeful spirit of a murdered serial killer. Not a bad premise, but made with a bunch of low-cost errors. Camera work tries to be too smart for its audience, constantly using shaky quick cuts to hide the fact that they really have nothing scary or scary to show us. This becomes obvious immediately after we get acquainted with a potential killer and soon realize that (acting) is the most terrible thing happening ... After a painfully long sequence of names, we return to modernity, but the action remains the same. “Frightworld” generates a rather unique cinematography when it demonstrates the scenery from a funny house, but with a very long showing time the film cannot save the film from below the average indie hell. <br /> <br /> This is some mediocre nudity, but not too much for blood, which is usually the saving grace for films of this type. <br /> <br /> Fans of really bad B-movies may find something interesting here, otherwise it’s not worth spending a lot of money.
