Here is a good movie, but it is not. The basic idea is good: to study the moral problems that the group of survivors of the apocalypse will face. But the logic is so confused that it is impossible to intervene. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes (for obvious reasons) paranoidly try to catch the mysterious airborne infection that has destroyed almost all of humanity. And yet they wear surgical masks sometimes and not others. Sometimes they fanatically bleach any area affected by an infected person with bleach. In other cases, they seem completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> Worse, after surviving a few weeks or months in this new world of “kill or be killed,” these people constantly behave like absolute beginners. They do not accumulate proper equipment or food. They ran out of fuel off the beaten path forever. They do not take elementary precautions when meeting with strangers. And, having passed through the rotting corpses of the entire human race, they are squeamish, like covered debutants. You have to constantly wonder how they could survive for so long ... and even if they did, why would anyone want to make a movie about them. <br /> <br /> Therefore, when these worms cease to suffer about the morality of measuring their actions, it is impossible to take their overestimation of values ​​seriously. Their actions must first have some minimal meaning. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, we have to contend with Chris Pine’s dubious acting abilities. His depiction of the arrogant young James T Kirk might have seemed insightful if you looked at him in isolation. But in “Carriers” he plays on the same note: arrogant and with a head It is impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film * looks * excellent. It has a too sharp, saturated look, which is really suitable for the southwestern United States. But this cannot save a truly weak letter or subtle (and annoying) characters. Even if you are a fan of the end of the world genre, you must protect yourself from the agony of watching Carriers.
