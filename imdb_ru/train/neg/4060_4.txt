CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto and Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br / > (35mm and 70mm prints) <br /> <br /> A blind former journalist (Carl Malden) overhears a blackmail conspiracy near a genetics research lab, and then teams up with a reporter colleague (James Francis) to investigate a lab murder series unwittingly putting their loved ones in the care of a psychopathic killer. <br /> <br /> Burst into production after the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut "Bird with Crystal Sealing" (1969), Dario Argento conceived "Cat's Tails" as a hyallo-thriller in the same spirit as its predecessor, the outstanding the famous Hollywood actor Carl Malden — who just appeared in Patton (1969) —and rising star Francis (Valley of Gwangi). Unfortunately, the resulting film, which, according to an advertisement, was “nine times more intense” than “The Bird”, is a disappointing sequel, flawlessly photographed and stylishly executed, but too loud and aimless for general consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Francis are highly watchable in cute roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menzer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses a wide Cromoscope frame to convey the high-tech world in which Argento’s light-hearted scenario unfolds, but the plot, Euro Catherine Spaak (LIBERTIN), an asterisk as a romantic interest of Francis, is a little more than unnecessary stuffing. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with a black-gloved killer at a crowded railway station (edited with graceful confidence by cult film star Franco Fraticelli), and a night episode in which Malden and Francis are looking for an important clue in the tomb and fall prey to the treacherous murderous murderers. But, despite these flashes of brilliance, the film wanders aimlessly from one scene to another, gently boils, not even reaching the boil. Not surprisingly, Cat could not imitate Birds’s rampant success when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
