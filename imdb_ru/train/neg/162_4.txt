a movie that tries to be much smarter than its producers. the film twists and unfolds a myriad plot of "surprises" with a desperate attempt to guess the audience, guessing the curse of the "plot" with paired scenes that they thought would help him in this. this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just a dream walks through the film. The same applies to other "actors." The plot is pretty stupid and tasteless. That in itself is not such a crime, but by the end, the stunning plot twists and turns become very tedious and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the film does generate some interest in the middle. In general, it is worth a lazy clock on a really boring day, but don't worry if you miss it. <br /> <br /> pretty lame 4!
