It was a terrible movie! Not for the item, but for delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the film was released), expecting to see a film about the victory of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police harassment, without raising at the end. Previews and advertisements did NOT mention this! In addition, despite the fact that they played the whooper Goldberg, I remember that she was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews say nothing about it! (not that you expect it, but this is only a big problem). If I knew how depressing this film would be, I would never see it. Or at least I would be ready for it. It was a bait and switch ad campaign, and I will NEVER see this film again!
