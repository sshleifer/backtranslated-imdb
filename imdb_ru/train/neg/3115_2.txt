I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time I felt subordinate. The Night Listener is without a doubt one of the most boring films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nothing happened in this movie as never before - I didn’t like any of the characters, I didn’t buy it. to the whole plot of a mysterious type, no matter how it ended .... nothing. <br /> <br /> No comedy, no action, no thrill, no expectation, nothing. The main points (without spoilers - there is nothing to spoil): a person who rises through a window, a dog barking near a hotel room, a car driving on some uneven ground, and a truck giving a horn. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and hoped for a similar eerie role from Williams, but, alas, was very disappointed. What is even more disappointing is that I am sure that there is a good film somewhere - the idea was interesting, and I had to feel sympathy for the characters, but it just didn’t work for me. <br /> <br /> I could even give 1/10, but this score is reserved for a remake of producers
