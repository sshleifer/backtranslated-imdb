Polyester was the very first John Water film that I saw, and I must say that it was also the “worst” film that I had seen before that moment. <br /> <br /> Water's talent group included several people. which, I am sure, worked for food and was ready to say the lines written by Waters. Everything in the film is terrible: acting, camera, editing, and the story of a woman played by the 300-pound Divine Divine was just absurd. <br /> <br /> However, I have to recommend this film because it’s very funny and you won’t believe the shit that happens to poor Francine. Her son wipes solvents and stomps unsuspecting women's feet at the grocery store. Her daughter - the most depraved whore in the city. Her husband is clucking A-hole by a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine. <br /> <br /> Francine's only friend is playing Edith Massey, possibly the worst actress ever. Edith looks and sounds like she reads lines from a cue card and never saw the script before shooting. <br /> <br /> Despite all the suffering Francine, Waters is preparing an incredible Hollywood finale and everyone (who will survive)) lives happily ever after
