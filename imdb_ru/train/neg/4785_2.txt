With this terrible little wet film farther, there is so much bad that it’s hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First, this is an amazingly scary movie, even by American standards. A cliché dialogue, two-dimensional characters, Khokhum writing, and what a small story is neither consistent nor remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes in order: Balding Loser Guy (perhaps divorced, but who knows? This film doesn’t tell us) with a brave heart, Young hero (who doesn’t do anything heroic at all), Brave a small child (with a killer mile-wide stripe) and a Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with more muscles than brains). These guys are constantly fighting with the High Dread Reaper and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the film is full of evil little metal balls that fly around threatening people. Having a chance, they perform an impromptu brain surgery for those who do not have the sharpness of the mind to hide when they come to them. Booh! In fact, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but, again, it may be a lying ghost), who seems intent on helping our brave opponents recover their young kidnapped friend. <br /> <br /> There is no background for a character or even an introduction to any of the characters. It begins with some summary of the end of the previous film, but it does not explain much. If you've seen the first two films, fine. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they are connected, why they are not at school or at work, or why you should care about whether they live or die. Therefore, you do not. The only attraction is any spray. And they are not enough for you to sleep. <br /> <br /> Three raider punk, as stupid as the evil ones that threaten our heroes, are of potential interest / entertainment. But they do not get much time on the screen. They are off almost immediately. Then they are buried (why should someone take time outside of me), then they reappear as the Zombie Evil Raider. Just to be insulted again, literally in a minute. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film mainly consists of Caspar, the Friendly Ghost, appearing and disappearing, driving around in search of places, and the Bald Loser trying to pick up a cat. teenager. There are no dice; even some gratuitous sex could not save this film, so good is never. <br /> <br /> The main villain named A tall man cannot frighten anyone older than 3 years; howls "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Why he, with his amazing telekinetic abilities and supernatural power of the upper body, does not just crush our heroes like beetles is not explained. Instead, he delegates work to his inept backward little minions who never manage to kill anyone before they are killed in hell. <br /> <br /> Cinema lovers who like such masterpieces as "Friday, 13th part of XXXXVIII: Jason goes to college," can find entertainment. The rest of us who have pubic hair, will be bored of our skulls.
