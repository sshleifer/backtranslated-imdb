I bought it on DVD for my brother, who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to watch it myself at the beginning of this week. <br /> <br /> This is a rather interesting part, containing two completely different plot lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was much more interesting. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had a lot of short unsatisfactory relationships. She literally stumbles upon Brian Kerwin (an ordinary married guy with children) after driving her car to his back. Being initially hostile to each other, he offers to take her home, as she no longer feels comfortable driving. Romance develops eventually, leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. I wasnâ€™t ready for what happens at the end, but the slow pace and routine of television takes the drama away from the plot. <br /> <br /> Another section tells about the old boss from the studio, played by Darren McGavin. This section is actually the best cast with Kenneth Macmillan, Lois Chilis, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss, but in the end, when they ask him to resign, they all understand that their career is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> Time passes, but not everything is so interesting, and I am glad that it was not bought for me. I'm not a Michelle Pfeiffer fan, but she, admittedly, was the only actor worth seeing in this film, and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. In general, although if you are not a fan of it, avoid it, because it is very routine.
