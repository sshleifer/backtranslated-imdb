The story is visible before, but it doesn't matter if you can come up with the correct storyboard. It is clear that the director did not spend his work on the storyboard. Along with this, the operator spent too much time tilting angles that do not correspond to the meaning of the film. The funny thing is, however, if you look at the movie's website, you can read that he specifically made the movie with poor viewing angles. Because it reminds us of the hunt. But I have never heard of hunting with bad camera angles ;-) She will have 1 star, because the story is fine. It is a pity that Ti West did not spend more time reviewing its history. Itâ€™s as if the film was more important than planning. Because you have a camera, it does not mean that you have to make a movie right now ... come. Anyone can make a movie, but not everyone will be as good. So, tip to West: Stop and tag what you want. Use your time to start planning, rather than taking pictures, until everything goes to the storyboard. You certainly have the ability and desire - so do not abuse your talent.
