Judy Holliday won a gold medal in 1950 in George Cukor's “Born Yesterday” film production, and from that moment on, her career was trying to find a material good enough to allow her to hit gold again. <br /> <br /> This has never happened. In “It Should Happen to You” (by the way, I can't come up with a more empty headline), Holliday makes another variation with a silly blonde who may not be so stupid, but everything in this film seems warmer and half indecisive . Even Jack Lemmon, in that I consider his first movie role, cannot gather enough energy to revive this reworked comedy. The audience knows how the film will end almost from the very beginning, so basically it just sits and waits for the film to catch up. <br /> <br /> You might like the Holliday; otherwise I would not bother. <br /> <br /> Rating: C
