This is the case when a group of people think that they are so smart that they have a story that corresponds to time. Remember the pervasive political conspiracies captured on video in the years preceding Watergate and a little later? Most of the films in which they tried to make money on the conspiracies created specifically for television “about such powerful, about stunning mind”, are actually stuck in their own view of the navel. <br /> <br /> I have never been a fan of conversation, which I find as outdated as the other conspirators of the time, but Coppola was loyal to his main character, and Hackman was a rather attractive actor to watch him. I mean, these plot films are mostly drowned in a pool of characters in noir-heroes. A lot of unanswered questions, a lot of disunity ... Well, to create a film about such non-visual bases, at least Bergman is needed. <br /> <br /> “The Next Man” is a great example of his time: one political soup served with an idealistic character and a terrible conspiracy that gripped his network around him. Not one part is interesting in itself, and in general it is not getting better. In fact, you can tell how bad it will be, from the very first episodes that accumulate “watcha that”, killing, without advancing the storyline. Directing a pedestrian in the worst possible form, since most of the film is one pompous cluster of scenes revolving around violence, which is naively presented before the eyes of the viewer.
