Honestly, before I watched this movie, I heard many people say that this movie was a disgrace. I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey appeared in this film and watched it themselves. Apparently they were right. I was very disappointed and wondered all the time during the movie - what the hell I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I didn’t expect much from Justin, as he really doesn’t belong to the film / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop asking myself the question, why the hell did they agree to take part in Edison. Honestly, their roles are pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you might think that if the players sucked, then I should pay more attention to this story. This is really a story, this is the essence of the film, but guys ... trust me ... this is not a film that you want to give credit to its story. Imagine this, a clever journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned how to become a “real” journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by one agent who still craves justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they beat the system with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> God, I couldn't even keep this up. Just the memory of the movie makes me sick. Guys, I advise you, do not watch it! Please save your money and time for another movie.
