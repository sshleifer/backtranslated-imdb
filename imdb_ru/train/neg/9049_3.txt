Presumably, the “social commentary” on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970s, “The Nightmare” is full of bad southern stereotypes, full of strange accents. This clumsy work is not only insulting to the feelings of most American southerners, but is also a disguised film “The Kid in Prison”, especially in its original version. However, acting is usually above average, and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, is good at making viewers hate him - although he looks somewhat awkward in a few scenes. There is also the role of changing the tempo for the late Robert Reed, who looks like a lecherous warden, and Tina Louise (formerly ginger from Gilligan Island) made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. My rating: D. <br /> <br />
