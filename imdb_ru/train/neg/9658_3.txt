My God, what an incredible movie this is! I was very reminded of a similar scene in the Mel Gibson film “We were soldiers”, when “The company is not lost, they are simply cut off”. And another scene at Pearl Harbor, when a British officer tells Ben Affleck, “If all Americans are like you, then God help the nation that is entering the war with America! <br /> <br /> Combine all 3 films and you will have enough BULLITE to fertilize the entire Sahara Desert. <br /> <br /> The story of the cut off battalion can be quite real, but the film could do without all this American propaganda propaganda related. The cinema heard moans during the aforementioned scene in Pearl Harbor (no joke either)) The Lost Battalion is indeed in its own class. <br /> <br /> "Americans think they are invincible," inspired by courage. " “I actually cringed and damn nearly escaped from everything that spilled out during this diarrhea disaster (film, which is) <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were well done (3 stars for that), but if dung, then wrapped even in bright colored ribbons, it is still dung. Writer James Carabatsos also wrote these other screamers: "Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Spine of the Broken Heart." <br /> <br /> Director Russell Mulcahy is also Australian. God shame !!!
