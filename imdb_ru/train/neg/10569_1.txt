I tried to watch this film in a military camp during a mission abroad, and let me tell you that you will watch something in these circumstances. Not this piece of shit though. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes set the tone for a weak porn-film quality action, strange out-of-blue plot twists and incredible situations and behavior. After that it gets worse. This film does not have the only saving grace, and yet it is not so bad that it was funny to watch. That's just terrible. I have seen quite a few films in my life, and I am not one of those critics who criticize know-it-alls, I mean that I will like some films to some extent, even if they are bad. This man. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this, my friend.
