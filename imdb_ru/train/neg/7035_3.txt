The extremely subtle “plot” of satanic rituals or some such mumbo-jumbo gives a hockey excuse to put together an abundant amount of sex scenes together. Direct vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest and some other types of sexual distribution - all this is in the center of attention. The problem is that the storyline is so boring that unrestrained sexuality becomes quite tiresome after a while. Who knew that a movie with a close acquaintance with a goat / girl can be damn boring? Ok, now I do. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line provides T & A (both are on display quite often); female viewers sometimes get a penis. <br /> <br /> My rating: D + <br /> <br /> Additional materials on DVD for region 1: Trailers for films “Pick up”, “Legend of eight samurai”, “Do not“ Answer the phone ” , “Prime Evil” and “Sister Street Fighter” (also on this DVD is the second feature film “Evil Eye”)
