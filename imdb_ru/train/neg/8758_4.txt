Not a film, but a compilation of performances that were part of the British invasion that followed the Beatles' dynamic entry into the music world. Some of these actions did not produce a big splash on this side of the reservoir, but many of them did. Among them are Hermann Hermit, Billy J. Kramer and Dakota, Peter and Gordon, Sota, Nashville Teens, Animals and, of course, the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to watch these young acts before they hone and polish their actions.
