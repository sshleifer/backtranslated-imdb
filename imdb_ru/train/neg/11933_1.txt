My baby makes better videos than this! I feel cut off from the $ 4.00 spent on renting this item! There is no date on the video of the case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, even worse, there is no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the film! The only date specified in 2002 makes an unsuspecting tenant believe that he is shooting a recent film. <br /> <br /> This film was so bad in terms of being outdated and irrelevant for any period of time, but exactly when it was made I was surprised that someone would spend time and money to advertise it as a video. This may be of interest to students of the 1960s counterculture, anti-war, anti-establishment, attuned, inclusive, and culture-abandoning culture; but when you read the back of the video, there are no hints that this is what you get. If you make the mistake of renting it, it's probably best seen on drugs, so your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching, I can tell you that after the first scene it does not improve; so, knowing this, I am sure that you will sleep soundly long before the end.
