The only reason I put 2 is because the filmography is so stylized in our day that there is at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid. It is like many other household feeds of the 21st century. The mountain is free and just disgusting. I was not worried about any of the characters, but I didnâ€™t care that some idiot had bothered to write this shit: I would have complained about the money spent, but my meeting and I left wisely after 40 minutes and went to the next theater to watch adventure and entertainment "Live Free or Die Hard", which probably received a much higher mark from me simply because I endured a full caricature of "Captivity" for 40 minutes.
