I cannot believe that I spent five hours of my life on this garbage. The previous five-day offer of this author was very pleasant, and I was really looking forward to it. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Surann Jones was the main culprit, as she mumbled or played her lines, but most of the other actors followed her lead. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Ann Reed, old men whose diction was exemplary. Do not the producers listen to the performances before they are broadcast to make sure that the dialogue is heard? As a result, I believe that I lost the idea of ​​what was going on, and since the original storyline seemed to transform into a standard thing between us and the Muslims, I soon lost interest. The ending was a complete anti-climax. Full dud.
