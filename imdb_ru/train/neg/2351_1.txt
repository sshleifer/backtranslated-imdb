I have no idea how someone managed to stay awake during this show. The acting was crazy and amateur, the story was old news, and the development of the plot (or lack thereof) always sagged for less than half of each episode. That's all that can be said about it, because there really wasn’t any substance in it. <br /> <br /> How can you people love such crap? It's damn stupid, it insults your mind. I don’t even know how to explain it further ... As if some of you would look mindlessly at junk like this, just because you like the way some actors look, or because for some crazy reason No I have not seen the same formulas in dozens of hits a million times. <br /> <br /> I just ... forgot about it. This show sucks, and, fortunately, it is gone forever. I would like them to start working on the demolition of OS Once and for all.
