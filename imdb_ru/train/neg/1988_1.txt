Well, I went through a terrible game. I missed the fact that Lil Kim blew up a few guns, and her hands or arms did not move, I went through the weaving, I received colored contacts. <br /> <br /> This is what killed it for me: In a scene where four roses sat at the table and argued. Lisa-Ray and Monica Calhoun get up and then Lil Kim gets up to stop fighting, saying, “Wow, wow, wow, wait. Let's relax here for HOT SECOND. ” I'm a fan of the western movie genre, and I've never heard anyone speak slang like that in any of Clint Eastwood's films. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks that this film deserves more than 1 rating, please tell me another movie? it's worse than the "gang of roses." <br /> <br /> I passed.
