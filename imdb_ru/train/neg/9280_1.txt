To be honest, I don't know what's funnier, this horrible remake or the comments on this board. The masterpiece review made me cry, it's so funny. In any case, this film is one of the worst films ever, and, of course, the bottom of the barrel to continue. The name “Omen” in the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO, but this is a blow to the face of the other three, especially the original. There are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite guy who caught fire from the juggler at a mental fair !! Good times ! This film is for the Omen series, which is the “Scary Movie” for the whole genre. Avoid if you are not looking for a laugh.
