It should be the most stupid, most stupid, most backward monster film of all time. This is a complete joke that it even surfaced in movie theaters. This is like watching a Loch Ness monster in rural America. This film deserves to be thrown into the toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. People involved in this debility heap of garbage, you need to lobotomizirovat. Wait! Maybe I trust them too much. I'm sure they were lobotomized before shooting. How else can one explain the absolute and absolute folly that this bucket of shit contains. Do not waste a minute of your life on this. Don't even waste your time sending feedback.
