This film is about as it sounds: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and (rather tamed) sex scenes! The film is not sure what it wants to be, and pretty much ends up in a mess. This is more expensive than in most films directed by Al Adamson, but this is not the budget level that viewers expect from science fiction films. The actors are pretty bad, and unlike most Adamson films, there are no former celebrities or actors. With music, everything is in order, but it is easy to understand why Cinderella 2000 was forgotten for so many years.
