This film was on television the other day, and I didnâ€™t like it at all. The first George from the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel ... completely awful. The new actor and actress who played the main roles were not good, they had to have the original actor (Brandon Fraser) and the original actress (I forgot her name), so this movie gets a rating of 0 out of ten, not the movie you can sit down, watch and enjoy. This is a film that you go to another channel or take to the store if you hire or buy. It was nice to see the monkey back, but it was not as fun as the first, they had to have a new George, how George grew up son, and still had Bredon and (like her face) in the film, that would be a little better than It was.
