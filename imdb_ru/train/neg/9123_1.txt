I have nothing to say about this movie. This could be a great tour for Peter Sellers, but this is one of the most tragic passes in the history of cinema. The fact that this was Sellers' last film makes it even more painful. <br /> <br /> The horrible script, direction and shockingly wooden performances merge terribly to make this film one of the most unsightly films ever made. > <br /> I so wish that in this pile of putrid gum I could find even a giggle or a laugh, but it is a lifeless, humorless disaster. True hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why didn't you stop at “Be There”?
