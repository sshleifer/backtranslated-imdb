I basically found that the Eden's Curve was very poorly constructed, which made it difficult to observe. However, there is something that I have to say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70s in the choice of settings and clothes. The back-to-earth philosophy and interest in sexual research and drugs, which was not sharply decaying, as was depicted in many later versions of the 1970s, were correct, as was the pseudo “don't ask, don't say.” A liberal fraternity of East Coast intellectuals, except that I would think that this is more a New England school than a school in Virginia, where, it seems to me, the “good ole boy” mentality still dominated even such elite schools like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that it was a time when homosexuality was not so strongly associated with tanners or transvestites, and I appreciated some homosexual roles that were not associated with these horribly abused images. I felt very regrettable that "gay culture" took certain standard forms in the 80s on the streets of Castro and Christopher, and this determined the movement and excluded a huge number of gays who were more submissive in their lifestyle. I rated the film mainly as a way to remember a more natural approach to our sexuality and personal relationships without a “scene”.
