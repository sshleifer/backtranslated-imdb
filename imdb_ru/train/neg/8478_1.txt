This film was probably the biggest waste of my life. The game was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any upset emotions. At the beginning of the movie she was to be discouraged. Instead, she shook her head, sticking her lower lip out. She cried miserably, without tears on the weeping scene. I was almost angry that of all the girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to snatch her. All others also suffered from excessive actions. It was annoying. It was also an insult to skaters. It took Jordan a month to train, and they left her as the person who makes up the Olympic team. Practically do not care about the efforts of these skaters, invested in their work. A pitiful excuse for a film, and a pitiful attempt to tie hockey and ice skating. Do not waste your life. It does not even deserve one star.
