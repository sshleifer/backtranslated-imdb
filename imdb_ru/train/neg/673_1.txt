... let me count the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. “Remake” only for the title, which pulls out every cliche from the directory on the slasher. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot is so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. Absolutely weak execution of all attempts at waiting or thrills. <br /> <br /> 4. Rating PG-13, which is not immune from blood, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is not terrible and not even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A set of characters that are so subtly written and stereotyped that we cannot take care of them. <br /> <br /> 7. The absence of any truly eerie atmosphere (as opposed to the original prom). <br /> <br /> 8. The dialogue scenario that is below the poverty line is a torpor. <br /> <br /> 9. Series of cardboard performances (not sure if the actors are guilty or the lousy scenario mentioned above). <br /> <br /> 10. An incompetent remake of a teenager who is not brave enough to try to have imagination or even show a pool of blood. <br /> <br /> These are not scary horror fans. /> <br /> BOMB is out ****
