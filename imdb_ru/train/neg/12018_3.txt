- The little hood is deceiving the local mafia boss because of the big money. Of course, the mafia boss wants his money back, and he doesn’t care who he needs to kill to get it. Punk attracts his friend and old thug to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If this sounds funny, it is. The very idea that this punk with an izodnoy dune on an izodnoy dune could hold one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is just silly. His friend may be good with weapons, but he is against a group of trained killers. An old thug is nothing but a comic relief, and no real help when he comes across a mob. There is also a story about how a friend’s father was killed by a Mafia boss many years ago, but little has been done from this and it doesn’t help the film. <br /> <br /> - Mafia boss Mr. Scarfeis is playing Jack Palance. I guess he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nickname on his cheek. Palance is as inefficient as the rest of the actors, and does everything it needs to get paid. <br /> <br /> - I recently saw some pretty good Italian crime / police movies, but Mr. Scarfeys is not one of them. Check out the Sadistic Syndicate or Revolver instead.
