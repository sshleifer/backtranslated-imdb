My brother is in love with this show, let's get straight. I fully agree with the people who said that this is a copy of Dexter Lab and Quite Strange Parents. <br /> <br /> I never liked the rather strange parents, I mean, some things made me laugh, but in most cases it is just annoying and not at all cute. This is almost the same as what I feel for Johnny Testa. Except that NOTHING makes me laugh in this show. The jokes are so stupid and meaningless, and, frankly, maybe it's just me, but children don't dress like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is awesome, but damn it! <br /> <br /> Dexter Lab, which used to be one of my favorite shows, and I still don’t mind watching it. What makes me feel disgusted and ashamed that Johnny Test made a joke out of this wonderful show! <br /> <br /> One more thing. . Dog. Is an. So. Annoying. He is louder and more unpleasant than Johnny! And a funny accent? What nonsense! I hate this dog to death, and I hope that it will die, because for children it would be better to see than to listen and watch the disgusting nonsense that happens in this show, and pick a cheerful accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your eyeballs to light up with wonderful fire and your brain burns in this show, don’t watch it!
