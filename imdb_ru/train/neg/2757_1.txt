I'm a guy who loves movies about guys ... I was looking forward to the dragon fighting the army with great special effects. It all happened, however, this film was the worst film Iâ€™ve ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was standard, but the image of this story was terrible. The scene transitions were the worst I've ever seen. Why would you go to the beach to relax if your life was in danger? The actions of the dragon-serpent were very poorly written ... and the possibilities of attack of the dragon-serpent varied greatly throughout the film, several times the main characters had to die. <br /> <br /> The director tried to instill a love story in the middle of the film in the most tense times this film obviously did not look after it was shot, I love movies, but I had to force myself to finish watching it, thank God, I did not buy it, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Don't buy it, don't rent it, just watch the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
