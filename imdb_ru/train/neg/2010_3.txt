Oh, this is a movie - I thought I was waiting too long to get the dog out ... I can't believe I watched it all. I think I was optimistic that everything would get better. A terribly disconnected dialogue, pitiful game and absolutely incredible events. Like Toby's mom, hanging herself while Coke has to climb stairs and descend into a room with a 24-inch ceiling and no chairs, counters, or anything around her fixed body, which she could climb to make The little girl who played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the entire film, and the puppy of the first couple was the close second. The storyline has the potential and with a good script and director it can be a serious creepy click, but unfortunately this is not the case. I fear more when I open an electricity bill every month.
