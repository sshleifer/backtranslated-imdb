.... may seem contrived ... but in fact there was a real story about a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife stopped, and she killed a wife who looked like a rape murder .. ..... <br /> <br /> In her delusion, she told everyone that a man asked her to marry him ... so she quit her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota ..... ..... <br /> <br /> The last time I heard that she was in a mental hospital, a security prison .... <br /> <br /> she still wore an “engagement ring tso. what she bought for herself ... and told everyone he bought it for her. <br /> <br /> The events occurred in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,, and the murder occurred in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> There was even a thematic story in the magazine “People” ... In the spring of 1988, I want to say on page 39. I remember this when I was in college. at that time, and my colleague met a man at the security hospital ....
