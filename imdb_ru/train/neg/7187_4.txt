Here we go with another slasher movie, “Good-Looking People” and “Act from All” were really good! <br /> <br /> Few children play phone calls, and the killer kills parents in front of children! 20 years later, when they are still friends, they go to a huge house, have fun, take drugs and have sex (without nudity) for at least half an hour of the movie! Again they start joking on the phone again! and then the killer returns, killing them one by one, and the killer is in a LARGE BLACK COVER with an ax, like in the film “City Legend”, <br /> <br /> The death scene is very strange, really strange. <br /> <br /> A good slasher movie in this part would have given 7/10, but a turn at the end of the movie made the whole movie kind of meaningless <br /> <br /> This turn killed me because of the movie, so I'm going to give it 4/10
