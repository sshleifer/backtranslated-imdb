God, it was terrible. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and thought that I was going to knock my eyes out at the manor of Oedipus Rex. Oh my God. This film deserves no more respect than anything made by a lover of high school films. please save your money, this film cannot offer you anything. if you don't like shows and sleep in cinemas. Well, you know, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. you will still be the only ones there. F @ ck is a slide show. <br /> <br /> You will be warned. <br /> <br /> I recommend not to watch this. <br /> <br /> Hello. <br /> <br /> How are you? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> enjoying this day? <br /> <br /> I like it. <br /> <br /> this comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daily movie. it is sad.
