I saw this film in a mysterious scientific theater when it was called “He Lives at Night”. This name is much less deceptive than “Batpeople”. In fact, it will be more accurate to be called Batperson. This film is about a doctor who studies bats, I think, because he wants to make the best medicine for rabies. This is not entirely clear. What is clear is that he and his wife are touring the cave, and a bat has bitten him. Why a scientist should make a trip to study bats, outside of me. Can't he come in by himself? Well, after a bite, he and his wife go on a honeymoon, where he begins to have seizures. They go to the worst doctor ever. The guy stays in the hospital and kills the nurse. As a result, the guy kills 3-4 people, and his wife stands next to him, and you should be rooting for him, and not because the sheriff is investigating the killings.
