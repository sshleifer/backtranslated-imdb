*** ATTENTION! SPOILERS CONTAINED HERE! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical view of what would happen to Madonna if she ever found herself on an uninhabited island. In this role, Madonna has no problems, and it shows. She's just Madonna, playing Madonna, and she can't even do it right. I know what you are saying, you are saying: “How do you know that Madonna really is like this, you have never met her!” That's right, I don't know, but we all remember “Truth or Dare”, aren't we? I know what Kevin Costner does. <br /> <br /> In 2002, you might think that Madonna somehow learned something from “crossed” ladies who also made their way through the Silver Screen. For God's sake, didn’t Madonna see the "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the world of cinema, HOW IT'S MADE !!! Mariah kicks Madonna’s ass on the curb with beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, you call it! All that we see from this view of the world of the Madonna is that it is the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there is something to say about Madonna, this is what she is consistent. When she was dear to MTV, she brought the world of women's fashion back 20 years ago. Now, in the film, she dropped the female roles in the film AND society 20 years ago, praising all the most hated, terrible, reprehensible, odious qualities that women thought were locked inside, qualities that they so desperately tried to prove that they really did not . <br /> <br /> *** HERE SPOILERS !!! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ... *** <br /> <br /> This is one good thing I will say about this film, and I was really impressed by this. They did not go to the "Hollywood Finale" - Madonna's character lives on. In the typical happy Hollywood finale, Madonna’s character would die on the island, and her long-suffering, depressed, whipped husband would be free to finally settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be the exact opposite of his late wife, and they both live long and happily. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is saved, and this poor victim of her husband is again burdened with the demon of his wife, and his life will again become a living hell. <br /> <br /> *** HERE REMAINS A SPOILER ***
