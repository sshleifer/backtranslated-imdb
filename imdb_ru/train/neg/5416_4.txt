This was the third attempt by director von Stroheim - it is rather rough and does not demonstrate exceptional talent for camera skills and editing, which he would demonstrate in a few years with his masterpieces Greed and Wedding March. In fact, we have three guns disguised as a Russian count and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use fake money at gambling tables and win a fortune. Part of this plan is that the count (von Stroheim) hint between the invited American ambassador and his “stupid” wife, courting her and hoping to get some money by playing on her weaknesses. He makes the mistake of taking away the savings of the maid, for whom he promised to marry. When she sees them together, she sets fire to the room (von Stroheim and his victim are on the balcony of the room). Here, von Stroheim first establishes his identity as "the person you love to hate." He is completely bad, and the shortcomings of his character ultimately lead him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is crude in its cinematography and montage, and you should not watch it if you are not passionate about the director. There is a funny moment: when he first tries to meet with the ambassador’s wife, she reads a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES, by Erich von Stroheim. It was originally presented as a 210-minute film that was shortened by the studio to 140 minutes and finally released in 70 minutes. Restore to Kino Video restores the saved frames (somehow damaged in most scenes) from an alternative earlier version to give us a 107-minute imprint.
