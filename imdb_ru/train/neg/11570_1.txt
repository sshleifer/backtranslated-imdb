The intention that the directors have for this film is very noble, but his story of his productions really made me realize that this might not fully understand how other directors would have done. bearing in mind his glorious 30-day television series, but considering in his statement on MTV "I bet" that confronts his seriousness in any matters that he documents, and also in his rather disappointing statement "give me more" hope highly unfortunately this film has disappointed me. as in the case of "supersize me" after a while, I asked myself what was the point of all this. the main statement becomes quite clear in half an hour, but the rest of the playing time is filled with rather meaningless things and repetitive things that have already been shown in one way or another earlier in the film, so it wears out and becomes extremely boring towards the end.
