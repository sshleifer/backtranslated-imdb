The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. It all starts with funny conversations at the bar and makes you expect a good, funny story to come. Well, I can tell you that will not come. In a few minutes, it will turn into a film that challenges your patience, as well as your sense of shame in front of the actors, to the extent that you probably will not be happy to witness. <br /> <br /> In an interview, I heard that the director wanted to express in this film a sense of loss of identity, which, he said, is experienced by most people in this globalizing world. I was amazed to hear this. I live in the same world in which he lives? OK, many people walk in the same clothes as me and listen to the same music and all that, but it doesn’t make me feel like I’m losing my personality. What does Chrzanosvka think that we are no more than the clothes we wear and the films we watch? Am I short-sighted or not? <br /> <br /> Well, my voice: a good start to the film saves him from getting 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
