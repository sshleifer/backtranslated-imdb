I don’t see it, it was one of the most stupid films I've ever seen. It's hard to be a Mormon sometimes when there are such films. what a sad look at mormon life. I can tell you if you have seen this film that this is not quite the case in the solo section. if that were the case, I don’t think I would cope with it. It is a pity that most Mormon films are made by a group of fans who have nothing to do. the game was so bad that my wife and I barely managed. I think you could say that there were all the signs of the film V. or are there any films C? anyway ... i just thought this movie sucks and was full of cheese. I would like some Mormons to start making quality films.
