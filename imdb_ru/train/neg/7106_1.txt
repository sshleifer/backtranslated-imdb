I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and I've only seen a few of them (and not one of Halloween or Fifteenth), but I can appreciate the frightening horror movie not because of blood. And I am sure that it is not scary. <br /> <br /> What's so frightening in a small plastic skull that appears everywhere? In all its manifestations there are distant setting shots, so there is no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that the skull itself is so scary, but ...) <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the third cousin Klaus von Bülow (John Hudson), who marries Donna Reed-like (Peggy Webber, who gives one of worst performances in history), which begins to see the skull and hear the mysterious cries of a group of peacocks in the mansion of her husband. Did I mention that her husband lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning? Oooh !!!! I wonder who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the same old plot about how a rich boy tries to kill and / or drive his wife crazy. If you want to see a well-made version of this material, try Reversal of Fortune. And by the way, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> With MSTing, everything was fine, but nothing special; combined with the short Gambi, however, it provides a good overview. <br /> <br /> Two stars for Screaming Skull; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Now I will paraphrase Mr. Von Bülow himself: “How bad is this film?” “You have no ideas!”
