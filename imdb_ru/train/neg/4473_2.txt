Dane tries his best and to the extreme with all his cries and madness, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. Too much. Calm down, pull yourself together and make us laugh. I did not quite understand his comparison with comics and rock stars. Just because there are both on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really interested in this when he was alive. He had some good jokes, such as the Burger King joke, where people shout during the trip. I also liked Reese's joke. If Dane hadnâ€™t acted so mentally, he could have been funnier, and I could give it a higher rating, like eight.
