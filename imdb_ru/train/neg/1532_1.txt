Although correctly warned, I actually sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give each film an even break, and because I thought that one movie could not be so bad. I'm standing fixed. Even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could not save this turkey from drowning, like a ton of bricks. Only once during this humor left a parody of a parody I laughed. Namely, during the simon says the scene. Other jokes are either poorly executed or simply unfunny. And some of them you really see for a mile. This film simply does not have what it takes to be a good parody, like an Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny jokes, B. good dialogue and the most important of all S. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has no D. none of the above. To call this film bad would be an understatement. AVOID THIS FILM ALWAYS YOU CAN! READ TO WARN YOURSELF!
