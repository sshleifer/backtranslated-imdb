Studying in the bad. Bad game, bad music, bad script, bad editing, bad direction and bad idea. Squabble pieces can't be more pleasant or unintentionally funny than this ... thing. By the end of the “movie” you wonder why they bother at all. Poor Malcolm McDowell, didn't he have enough money or something like that? Still thinking to see it? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you did not die of laughter in the first thirty minutes, by the time you see the city inhabited by cyborgs called "Cytown", you will see it. Avoid this, my cinema-loving friends. Avoid.
