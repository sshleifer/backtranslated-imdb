Well, the director is reworking LOVE ACTUALLY Director Nikhil Advani after his debut with KHNH removes his other half and waits. <br /> <br /> He makes 3 hours + a movie that loses his patience, time.etc The viewer looks like 3 hours sleep, they watch this movie <br /> <br /> Well, they had 6 stories, so it was necessary, but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Anil-Juhi, convincing but boring, do not the series show such stories? <br /> <br /> We have a Govinda-Shannon story that is fun and works well <br /> <br /> We have the story of Akshay-Ayesh again, but it becomes boring and soon it becomes more comedic and this comedy is too boring. <br /> <br /> We have a story of Salman-Priyanka, which is Worst, not just valid terms, it doesn’t make any sense at all. <br /> <br /> We have the story of Sohail Ishi, which makes you laugh, and from time to time this trick is triggered by the boredom that most other stories create. <br /> <br /> We have a John-Vidya story - a good story in all respects. <br /> <br /> But by the time all the stories are broken into n pieces, the viewer becomes bored and sleepy. Especially the culmination of the story of Salman-Priyanka. Nikhil Advani is all right, some of the stories are well processed, but sometimes weak Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs br /> Govinda’s actors are lit up, after he’d actually made you laugh and love him in this film, despite his age and weight, Anil Kapoor plays his part, although he looks out of shape and tired , John excels in his part, Ak ae Hannah replay for a change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan too excited, and Ishe nothing to do. Ajana Suknani resigns <br /> <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve an award for this film, which you are shocked? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not only play, he just says that he is asleep, and this fake accent, oh God, Priyanka touches such a standard that you feel that you throw something at her, it becomes better to the end of Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is fine, Shannon is fine
