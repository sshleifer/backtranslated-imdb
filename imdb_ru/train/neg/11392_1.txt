For years, I remember reading about this show “Trouble With Tracy” in a TV show. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am! I lived two hours north of Toronto, and we couldn't get a CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can't. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted, and what I wanted was to see what this "Problem with Tracy" was. Did she have a beautiful girl in the lead role? Was it nudity? Was there an unknown? Was it a comedy? It would be nice if there was any promotion of the show. At least I could know what was missing from me. But no! The mystery drove me crazy until CKCO, a member of CTV, built a repeater in Viarton, Ontario, and began broadcasting “Trouble With Tracy” at the same time as the CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6 am !! One Saturday morning, I got up and turned on the TV at 5:59, and finally I saw what the “Problem with Tracy” is. Yes, “The Problem with Tracy” was that it was Canadian content, and it was stuck in an innocuous “6 am”, so no one would ever see how awful it was. <br /> <br /> Talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died several years ago afterwards, but many claim that he actually “died” the first time he appeared on this show. When I first saw it on that cold Saturday morning and became disheartened back into my bed, a part of me also died.
