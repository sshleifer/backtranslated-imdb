What a waste of time! I tried to sit in the "Sky Captain ..." about 6 times, and each time, for about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - something else! This is a completely boring movie, a terrible game, a boring composition, and, of course, a new director, because it's tough. And I wanted to love it. I love science fiction, old cliffhengers, and I can appreciate the attempt at Flash Nod Gordon and Metropolis, but, my God, what a waste of money. I worked on Paramount Pictures, and I wrote to Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using a blue screen for screen tests. She told me that they would never have the interest or the need to do this. 10 years later, Paramount releases this piece of shit. Sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten her own advice when she gave the green light to this dog. Blue shot with effect, but not the whole movie. Let's not forget that neither Jude nor Jolie are amazing actors (but easy on the eyes). Paltrow's work reminds me of high school efforts. It is a pity - it could work red, but only under the guidance of an experienced director. The funny thing is that the director of Sky Captain will continue to work even after this recluse. This is commerce, not art!
