When I caught a glimpse of the name, I thought that we would get another trial hip slasher, but in fact I found that “7eventy 5ive” is moderately tolerable, and almost 80s it rises after an exhaustingly slow middle part. momentum for the last half hour, leading to an incredibly tasteless climax and a frank exit from the final. He won’t be rewarded for originality, because he is as systematic as possible, and his thunder is stolen in the form of thrills (usual cheap ski jumping), locations (solitary mansion) and motivations from other films. The glittering direction is off-screen, and the material is rather tormented by poorly realized red herring in its carefully thought-out graphics and fragile scenario. Sometimes it is ridiculous, but, nevertheless, I was entertained mainly because of its cruel and terrible cruel acts of violence against some rather unpleasantly annoying college students from a psychotic killer with a battle ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a catchy young actor, but the characters they portrayed were not particularly seductive. The always presentable Rutger Hauer appears in a short supporting role as the gray-haired detective. Slightly made, but small and easily forgotten addition to the crease.
