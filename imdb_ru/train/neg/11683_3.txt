Three plot lines and not enough linking them together, “Inside Man” was a very nervous and incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Despite some moments, the film began with what looked like a fast thriller, which quickly turned into a slow slider, quickly jumped between highs and lows and barely managed to gain momentum in the last 20 minutes. I pay tribute to Denzel Washington, he played his role extremely well, fully aware of his human side, and not just a typical “super-detective” with all the answers. Clive Owen also coped well with his dual role of "evil genius" and "criminal mastermind" (both in retrospect do not match). In general, each person individually created an excellent subsection. However, when the pieces finally came together and counted everything, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or summation of everything. It all ended with a very small amount of energy with which it started, with a lot of holes in the plot, tons of questions, and, as I said earlier, nowhere near the normal level of Spike Lee. I have to completely disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... this is not the film in which they play.
