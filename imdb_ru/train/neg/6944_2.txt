The premise of the film is that the son of Thomas Archer was killed and his wife was mistreated - and he is given a chance to take revenge when (after therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder) he is placed in a room with a man tied to a chair and said that this is the culprit . He is given a large table of tools with which to get retribution: drills, bats, nails, sledgehammers, torches, all you can imagine that someone might want to use to cause physical harm to another person. <br /> <br /> We go through too many scenes of torture before we learn that the Man who is tormented by the Archer is not the one who committed the crime. Then they create an uncomfortable union; who put them in such a situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when all is said and done, we donâ€™t care ...
