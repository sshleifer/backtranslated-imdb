Screaming skull (1 out of 5 stars) This film boasts quite cool opening credits (a voice-over narrator warning that free burial will be offered to patrons of the film if they die of fright while watching this film, a terrible skull shot coming out of a serene billiard and omnipresent scary music) but, unfortunately, from there the whole film goes downhill. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion ... warning his servants and friends that the new Mrs has a very fragile character because of the tragedy in her past. Well, very soon she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that everything is just in her head and ... well, you probably see where it all goes. You will understand what is happening long before our poor heroine ... because you probably saw the exact same story in hundreds of other films and TV shows (and also better). To add to the countless violations of the film, most of the cuts of this film (on numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to miss several key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window ... she goes to open it ... you know that she will see something terrible ... and then ... suddenly the scene suddenly makes her sob in the arms of her husband. So what did she see ??? I think we will never know.
