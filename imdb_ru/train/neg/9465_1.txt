From the point of view of acting, directing, writing scripts and artistic leadership, this film is simply not well thought out, and money is better spent on shoes for landmine victims. When we became so sad that they had to fill the children's film with sexual hints to keep the attention of parents. <br /> <br /> Dr. Suess is now rolling in the grave, what a “dirty ho” is - SHIT and fake erection scenes, etc., etc., etc. It is shameful how they trade for Suessa's name, to force parents to bring their children, to add profanity to try for teens and some sad parents who will not watch their child’s film if not T & A. Greed is greed and more greed. <br /> <br / > Compare this to classic children's films, and we can get an alarming look at the world turning into. These guys should hold Take an MTV video. How the hell did this movie get> 400 votes, and the ideal 10 was outside of me. (if it's not a family of directors)
