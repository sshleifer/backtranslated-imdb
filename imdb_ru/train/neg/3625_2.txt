This film is firmly from the 50s. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute has chosen this film as one of the top 100 American films of all time. I have seen almost all the films on this list, and this one is by far the most disappointing. Musical numbers (and there are many, many) are VERY long and boring, and have absolutely no connection with history. The end of the film has a horribly long ballet sequence, which, naturally, has no real relation to the history of the film. It must be admitted that it is very well done, the music is in order, and the dances are done with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the film. The protagonist of the film is extremely childish and unlikely and behaves impolitely. His mental age is about 14 years. If you want to watch a good musical made on the theme of the “golden age” of musicals, see “Singing in the Rain”.
