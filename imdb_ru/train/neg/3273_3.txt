Are dicks from hazzard a real achievement ?? a film worth 53 million dollars is worse than any episode of the 25-year-old television show. The plot is quite working, but senseless fun can rarely be found, and the actors are quite brutal: Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than the main character, MS. Sheriff Roscoe of Gainey is a soft gangster, the tedious Enos of Michael Weston, seemingly perfectly abandoned, Willy Nelson, seems to be just waiting for the check to pass, and Burt Reynolds is stuck in some purgatory where he is doomed to relive his old films while the little Boss Hogg player is a curious choice, to say the least, but he has one good point with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill. Do you know that the film has problems when Shann William Scott and Jessica Simpson have the most charismatic screen presences ?? But worse than the script or the cast is Jay Chandrasekar’s hopeless direction: seemingly born without the concept of comic time, unable to do much more than just two shots, and seemingly not understanding how to shoot a car chase, let alone about a couple of decent tricks in the film, he seems determined to destroy all the signs of life before they materialize. There are a couple of interesting postmodern moments revolving around the Confederate flag and Daisy’s stereotypical role in every episode, but no film that would placate you on those days when Hal Needham was in charge of this kind of thing (and bad) could not be a good thing.
