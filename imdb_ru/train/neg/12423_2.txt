Cage (1989) was another one of those low-budget “friendly” action films that were filmed in the 1980s, thanks in large part to films like 48 hours. and deadly weapons. These are the stars of Rab Brown and Lou Ferrigno, as well as former Vietnam veterans who run a local dive bar. Reb cares about Lou because he saved his life in Us. But Lou shot in the head and now he's pretty soft. Although he is huge, Lou has a baby brain. Once, some hooligans give up their wait at the bar, and Lou and Rebbe knock the pitch out of them. But payback is mom. They break the bar, leaving Lou and Reba with nothing. Until these two thugs appear in the picture (one of them is a really nice guy) who has a plan. <br /> <br /> The film is a waste of time. Perhaps, if they had done their best and did tough actions, rather than trying to mitigate the terrible situation, perhaps this could work. Alas, this is not the case, and the audience remains to hold the bag. Well. This is very bad, because you have all the elements for a great B-movie. Probably next time more luck. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
