I really didn’t like this film because he didn’t actually convey the messages and ideas that L'Engle had outlined in his novel. We read the novel in our English class, and I really liked it, I'm afraid I can't say the same for the film. There were serious differences between the novel and the adapted version, and this simply did not affect the creative genius of Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason why I gave him such a bad rating. Do not watch this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle lyrics, because you will be very disappointed. However, if you are watching a movie for entertainment purposes (or for educational purposes, as was the case in my case), then this is a good movie!
