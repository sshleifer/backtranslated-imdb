This is perhaps the most boring film in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this film with the actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I would prefer to see Three Amigos than ever to watch this movie again. It quickly went from the DVD player right into the garbage. I apologize to those of you who apparently liked this film, however, you may also like New Coke. I can not understand why someone liked this film, it is slow, boring and does not have a real plot. You wait 105 minutes for the film to start. I understand that this was done in 1976, but it was the era of bad television. Thank God, the disco and the Three's company, along with the glasses, stops and rollers in Bay City are gone. Oh, well, just my thoughts.
