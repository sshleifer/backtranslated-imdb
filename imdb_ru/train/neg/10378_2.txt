Although the premise of “Homes where evil dwells” can be intriguing, the execution is completely pitiful. I'm not even sure where to start, since I have so many problems with this film. I guess I will list a few of them: <br /> <br /> 1. Actions ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your film, do you know that you have problems? Not that it was of great importance to me, but it is hardly the names of A-List. Susan George may have been in several films that I like, but I never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this film, her acting is confusing. As for the other two, the less said, the better. <br /> <br /> 2. Ghosts ?? Ghosts or spirits, or whatever you want to call them, reminded me a bit of the ghosts in an abandoned haunted mansion in Disney World. And they are about the same frightening. And why should they be so obvious? Subtlety is not typical for the House where evil dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How predictable can one movie be? The outcome of this film is painfully obvious when you meet the three main characters. If after about 15 minutes you do not see where this film is going, you need to watch other films. <br /> <br /> 4. Comfortable Priest ?? What is the probability that the haunted house you are buying will happen to be across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes, knocks on the door and asks if you need help in removing evil spirits. Absurdity is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think about any positive points about which you can write. I guess I will give this point for the starting scene and the point for the architecture of the house. Is this a sure sign of a winner ?? the mention of architecture as the main thing in any film says little about the film itself. <br /> <br /> I'll stop. You should be able to understand the idea from what I have already mentioned. And I did not even mention the annoying little girl or the Invasion of Crabs or many other problems. Be warned, this thing is terrible.
