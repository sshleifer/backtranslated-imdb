Oh, what a condescending film! Filmed in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers, this film is trying to become a deep social commentary on contemporary American angst. <br /> <br /> Stereotypical, intelligent characters of various social and economic strata. Cross paths in their daily life. The plot is scattered and despotic. Many unimaginable plot tricks contribute to the promotion of the film, for example: shooting a car, an abandoned child left in the weeds, a gang of thugs frightening a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a child in a summer camp. <br /> <br /> And in all these events, the only constant is the generous help of sociological “insights” transmitted in the dialogue, when the characters compare records of their life experiences. One character says to another: “When you sit on the edge of this thing (the Grand Canyon), you understand that we are joking, joking ... these rocks laugh at me, I can tell you, and my experiences; this is a real humorist in this Grand Canyon. "And another character speaks about the significance of all this:" In this country, the abyss, the ever widening gulf between people who have things and people who don’t wear ... as if this big hole opened in the ground, as big as ... the Grand Canyon, and that which is poured out ... is a flash of rage, and rage breeds violence ... ". <br /> <br / > In addition to the terribly unnatural and forced dialogue, except for small, intelligent characters, except for a stupid plot, the pace of history is painfully slow. it is boring and careless. The tone of the film is smug and smug, in a scenario it is contempt for the audience. <br /> <br /> This was a draft of the film, approved by Hollywood suits who consider themselves to be all-powerful gurus, looking down from above. They think their film It will be a startling revelation for us, humble, unaware moviegoers, eager to learn about the real meaning of American social change.
