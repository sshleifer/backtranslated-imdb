Zu's warriors definitely should have been the animated series, because like a movie, it’s like watching an old anime on acid. The film is just starting out of nowhere, and people just fly around, fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons, until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something like that. Is this princess a god or angel, outside of me, but pretty soon this bad guy of the flying wind comes in and kills her, while the guy with the wings of a razor is struggling with some other mystical thing God / Demon / Wizard. exists, or is extremely difficult to understand, you need to be insanely smart to get this movie. The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal whom this god called for to fight the evil flying, the princess kills the bad guy and soon we have a very poorly set scene of the battle of Uwe Boll, full of horrible martial arts on the mountain or something like that. Even the visual effects are strange, some may say that they are stunning and colorful, but I will say that they are blurry and acidic, like (yes, that word!). I looked at how it was duplicated and with subtitles, and both were equally bad and difficult to understand .... who I joke, I did not understand it at all. I felt like I was watching an episode from the 30th anime of the 1980s and completely missed how the story began, or how I started to read a series of 5 comic books number 4, because I had no idea how this thing started where it went or how did it end, i lost i can honestly say that it was one of the worst impressions of the movie that ever looked like watching the movie "Inu-Yash" in drunk episode 134 ... yes, right, you didn’t you know what the hell is going on. The brain is trying to figure it out.
