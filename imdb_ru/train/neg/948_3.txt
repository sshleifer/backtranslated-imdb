I tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called “This Show of the 70s” I find nothing but a few haircuts and occasional mentions of disco, which actually resemble the 70s - the decade in which I grew up. From the episodes that I saw, most of the plots and jokes could be set at any time period. Remove the novelty (presumably) of the production in the 70s, and the show will be neither interesting nor funny. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of young people in America in the 70s, in my humble opinion, you could not do better than “Wonderful Years”.
