Just rubbish. I am a big fan of kuzaks, and this is the only reason I watched this film, but the only reason I can see their presence is a reprise, in full and less deep quality, of their exact roles from Gross Point Blanca. In addition, the role of films as political satire fails miserably, as it is too obvious for even the most retarded people to serve any purpose. And to declare it a satirical satire would be simply offensive, even for chimpanzees. Imitation is obviously the highest form of flattery, but seeing that this is not something next to Gross Point Blank and in the same league as the Spartans (see if you are an idiot) in terms of political satire, let's leave yourself enough alone and let this disappear into obscurity, which he absolutely deserves.
