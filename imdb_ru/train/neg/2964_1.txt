They laughed a lot - because it's incredibly bad - sorry, guys, but certainly one of the worst films I've ever seen ... I know this is a low-budget project, but in any case: the actors act like a game in soap, dialogue is absolutely shitty, and the last time I saw such strange photos was in a garbage dump at a youth video festival ten years ago. I really appreciate that people get together and make cheap films, but at least you need to achieve a certain quality. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the film were quite interesting and looked good - and the bill was really worth listening to. The DVD cover promised a lot, but it's the best this movie has to offer ...
