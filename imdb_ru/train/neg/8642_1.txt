I have to say that this is a terrible film, simply because when you see this film in the guidebook, it is listed as a documentary. Watching this, I began to laugh, thinking to myself: does this guy really expect me to believe that this is real? So I had to look for it, and now I see that it is a film, but now, since it is not a documentary, now it is a film with a bad game. Anyway, this is pretty bad. I actually did not reach the end. I had to turn it off. I am a police officer in New York and felt that someone was trying to mislead people, thinking that this was a documentary, with the intention of making money on a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So, I took it a bit personal. Maybe I was blinded by this, and it's not as bad as it seems to me. Everyone has their own opinion.
