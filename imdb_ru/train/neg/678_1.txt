All I can really say is that I am glad that I knitted my socks while watching a movie, or I would be very angry for spending 2 hours of my life. The game was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that were supposed to be serious when my husband and I laughed out loud. I highly recommend this movie to people who love making their own version of MST3K.
