Average viewers looking for a sense of internal consistency in the film should probably give it a pass. This creates the same feeling as looking at a curious array of individual images that seem to have something to do with each other, but never merge together. <br /> <br /> Although this insulative approach to creating a kind of cinematic editing may appeal to several students or critics immersed in the inner language of modern filmmaking, it is totally annoying and indulgent for us, ordinary people who have just fallen out of a lunatic . Openly avoiding accessibility may be a deliberate sign of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but it seems to me that Andy Warhol has been warm. The only redemptive characteristic I find is related to production values, and they simply do not intend to cut it all themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions in which you watch, listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to support all the wonderful and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. Calligraphic titles suddenly start to roll as soon as your interest starts to move. I get the same big yawn and frustration, reading, as it seems to me, very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film, which never lead to anything truly understandable. Ideas and images without any external context - not my idea of ​​fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a man in the street wandering the streets of Hong Kong in search of a bowl of chop. <br /> <br />
