Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> In fact, few films are “so bad that they are good,” and Zombi 3 is not just bad, it's terrible, unforgivable Poor in many ways that you may need a completely new language just to describe them all. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is a film that was attributed to Lucio Fulci, which even by its standards has absolutely no consistency, meaning or reason. However, we cannot blame Fulci, because he was not the director, but Bruno Mattei, who doesn’t even have a sense of Fulci style to help move the film. Mattei seems to have brought little to the film, but is stunningly inept. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I am ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every useless Zombi 3 minute. It does not have redemptive features - in the famous genre for thin characters, weak history and lack of film making skills, Zombi 3 pushes the boat, but This is even funnier than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> “Action” begins when “Death 1” gas is stolen from a military base and damaged during escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why did the American military decide that the creation of cannibal legions of the living dead would be a good idea? All these and other questions will not be answered in Zombi 3. .... <br /> <br /> After he disappeared into the hotel, the infected thief went crazy with all the green plasticin growing on his face before what will he be tracked down by the army, which will somewhat foolishly decide that the best way to get rid of his body would be to burn him, sending Death to the atmosphere, with the result of which ... zombie birds! Someone attacks people and turns them into zombie people !!! (If zombies are cannibals, why do zombie birds not attack other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we meet our “heroes”, three horny soldiers and a bunch of girls. There are also a couple of other guys with them, but they are not important - NO ONE is important here. It will be difficult for you to remember someone's face, not to mention his name or to find a reason to take care of them. As a result, they are hiding in the same hotel as the thief (“a week ago this place was buzzing with life, now it is buzzing with flies!”), But there is no escape from the undead. <br /> <br /> Point out that you will either be completely absorbed or turn off this damn thing. The scenario is so terrible that even the greatest actress in the world could not save him, so just the same they have some of the worst - and not only human characters, the zombies playing here are always low. There is no consistency in how zombies behave - some are reeling in a respectable style, others are fully involved in fist fights or attacking a machete, not to mention zombies who can still speak (the trick that gives the film TWISTING). They die from shots to the chest (and not to the head) and even get knocked out with a good left hook. How can you knock out zombies ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on the poorly done action of the 80s often makes it look like an episode with a V ... <br /> <br /> Zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, apparently, for hours in ridiculous places, expecting some poor Juice will pass by and get scared of their lives. They hide in bushes, garages, in huts, on roofs, in water and even under pregnant women. At some point, a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. Kill and eat her? Not! To push her into the water, these zombies and their stupid sense of humor! <br /> <br /> Although there is a lot of blood. The extremities are cracked, wounds ooze green pus, and there are many ways to eat meat, and people get wrinkles on their face. Nothing compares to the original piercing in the eyeball, but if your makeup is bad, your bag will not let you down. <br /> <br /> All this, and I did not even mention the terrible music, the inexplicable flying zombie head, the scientist, whose action actually manages to stand out as REALLY bad, or the final scary twist ... In the ingenious turn of the original a zombie-infested radio station, Zombi 3 gives us a real DJ zombie !! "He went over to their side!" the cry of our fleeing hero, before swearing to continue the fight against the undead in the sequel, which, unfortunately, never came. <br /> <br /> “Zombie 3” is rubbish - for the world there will be no loss if every print is destroyed and all records of its existence are erased, and yet I feel that my life has become richer because I saw her. <br /> <br /> I said richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
