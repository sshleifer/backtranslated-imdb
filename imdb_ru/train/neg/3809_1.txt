This show is just annoying !!! I feel sorry for the actors for trying to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the track of laughter trying to hide sad jokes, and the track "Awwww" appears at the most unnecessary moments. Overly dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also this show is a city of cliches. If you look at the word “cliché”, it will sound like this: “Full house”. In each storyline there is a "life lesson" that you need to learn at the end. Luscious speech does everything better and even is able to make the most stupid child suddenly realize that GASP is so bad that it is impossible in real life. I do not know how someone could watch this show without offending the behavior of the characters or the track of laughter. I scream on the TV and say: “This is not funny / sad / cute” If life were like this, the world would fall apart.
