I hired a hybrid at the weekend. What a disappointment! Silly unsuccessful attempt to tele-movie. The guy they got for leadership was completely weak, and when he ran (he did a lot), he looked like he was eating these mint sweets ... with his back! The contacts with the wolf he wore were great, although I feel that the actor relied too much on them because there was nothing threatening in his play. A wise Native American Indian must be one of the most rocky hegs he has ever seen. Let's talk about sour cow! She once smiled at the whole movie, and I think it was because she had sex. The sex scene was also lame. They might also show inflatable curtains if you can dig it. <br /> <br /> And one last thing, and this is my big hatred of pets, on the cover and on the DVD menu, the losers lost in digital form. cool sharp teeth on the guy. They were nowhere to be seen in the film. :(
