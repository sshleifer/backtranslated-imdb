This film was badly damaged by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or, as I must say, Stephen Co-boring! As before, Seagal is too good or too stupid to overwrite its own lines, leaving someone to imitate his voice for frames, where the sound should be looped. For a few films before that, he also did this, but I do not think about it! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script may use some work, but parts of this movie look like a real movie! Of course, everyone says that this film is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better if Seagal had not become his caricature. Do not worry. Anything over a dollar is too much for this! I sincerely think this is the last time for me and the Seagal film. What made me understand this for so long ?!
