"Wild tigers I knew." It will only be shown in big cities, to be sure. This is one of those films that are so frilly that there is no point except for the director! I hate them! And all these oh-so-alternative / artsy people are MADLY trying to find "metaphors" in what EVIDENT is. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, no history, morality, chronology and nothing funny or even touching. For me, it was a bunch of scenes, gathered together, which had nothing to do with each other, and were designed for the "show" to show how they could become "fancy" and "visual". It was an ATTEMPT in more OTHER teen films about anguish, but she did not reach the mark at all possible levels. Then loans roll! I was waiting for this to make sense! I was waiting for the "good part". I have about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called art-house films. It will not be among them. You will be very angry with yourself for having paid to watch this movie, and even more so for its purchase on DVD.
