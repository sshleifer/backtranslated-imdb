I really have trouble evaluating this movie. He sent brilliantly, it is clearly a lot of money. Gere and Dane are intense (although her onscreen personality might use a bit more certainty and sharpness), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, this is one of those truly horrible films, in which one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes, and, yes, one cannot help but wonder how many copies will inspire such a film. /> <br /> From a purely artistic point of view, this is 9, but I really have to ask myself who these people give their money to make such a film ....
