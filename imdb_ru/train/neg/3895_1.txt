Once upon a time, evil people made a film about a guy who was shot in space, allegedly to go to Saturn, but in fact only for some shots of solar flares, and then his nose is bleeding, and before you know it , he is in the hospital, tied up from head to toe, and then an overweight nurse comes in an inappropriate shape, and is eaten up by a guy whose body is supposed to melt everywhere, but never seems to lose weight. then NASA. or at least one guy from NASA gets upset about it and calls another guy to hunt him down, but the guy who was sent to hunt the melting guy must first go home and eat the soup, and his strangely shaped wife forgot the crackers , so he can't have crackers, and then he has to go out and look for a melting guy with a Geiger counter, and it doesn't work, so he really only follows the tracks of half-eaten corpses, and then there is something about a sheriff, two ugly old men in a lemon grove and a woman with a meat grinder . d some kind of industrial enterprise with a security guard happy with the trigger, and since I can't tell you how the movie ends, all I can say is that Jonathan Demme is out there with some kind of guy with a stupid By the name of Burr DeBenning, and if there is justice in the world, everyone who was associated with this film died a disgusting violent death and could not make more films, and the world lived happily after and after - the end!
