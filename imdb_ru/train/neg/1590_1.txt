HA! So this is a movie that included the Stars of the Next Action. Well, I am glad that I did not participate and did not win ... <br /> <br /> Isn’t it funny how you can just look at the first 10 seconds (!) And make a decision? about the movie? I mean, come on! Just look at these names! I watched this film (or part of this “TV show” since it was created for television, and we could not watch it all) one evening while serving in the army, and the audience with me was a typical mix of middle guys who occasionally watching TV shows like Las Vegas only for girls on the show. so the bar was not very high, the most popular film in my group was Girl Next Door (and this was not because of the great script; D. But the complete lack of originality, action, scripts and almost the whole film) still makes the film good, it makes it pretty easy to switch channels to Las Vegas (or was it CSI? I don’t remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group. And this is rarely (!) For God's sake Do not make this movie! If it's on TV, then yes, watch it. And think about it. My conclusion is good, since Joel Silver really produced some of the best action films (Die Hard, Matrix 1, to name a few). I can only say that the producers do not give the film its quality, they give money to directors. And to sell this film just because it is a Joel Silver film, it’s just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws of the team that really did it.
