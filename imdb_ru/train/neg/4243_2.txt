The funniest scene of this film is probably when our rescuers receive their medals, tablets and whatnot. So, the basic idea is that the police outnumber these gangsters by about a million to one, but they are powerless, because the weapons of the villains are slightly larger. I guess the police patrons just bounce off. They decided to make this documentary-style film with fake interviews and everything is serious, what's wrong with these guys? They talk as if they were armed with folded newspapers. Well, I admit that it is probably still dangerous to be in the line of fire, even when the situation is so favorable, but do not go crazy. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes to decide everything anyway? I would say that it is very long when you are surrounded and you are allowed to shoot. They are like ten feet away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they go and buy more weapons themselves in order to strengthen their heroism. And then, yes, you have it, one of the policemen really hit someone. The bullet was probably distracted by a lamppost or something else. I laughed
