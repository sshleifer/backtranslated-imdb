When I rented this film, I had very low expectations ...... but when I saw it, I realized that the film was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... it could work for the Disney movie (except for the murders), but this is not a comedy, this is a ridiculous masterpiece of stupidity. The name is right, except for one thing: add a stupid movie after Dead Men! I give him 0 and a half out of 5.
