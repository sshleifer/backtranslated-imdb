This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I looked at it mostly out of painful curiosity, since I loved the novel, and I wish I hadn't done that. I turned it off after a little less than an hour, although I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I would like to have. He ignores the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors. If the film failed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes (which would have been impossible), I would never recommend it. This is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I don’t think, as many say that it’s so that the “Bell” is not necessarily amenable to processing, but this concrete performance could have been done without. I would almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it right.
