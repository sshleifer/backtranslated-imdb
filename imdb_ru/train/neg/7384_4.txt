RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshal Lawson (Stephen Seagal) appointed to France in the reconnaissance mission together with three new young fighters of the strike team after disobeying a direct order from above. However, at night, before they should strike, they were all found ruthlessly murdered by a murderer with seemingly inhuman strength. Due to the fact that the French police are investigating themselves, he himself is looking for the perpetrators in order to uncover the corrupt faction of the military who are engaged in a deadly new drug that changes a person's DNA and gives them a terrifying new force. <Br /> <br /> poor coverage. Bad name. Poor intervention in post-production. And a bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But I must say, I do not think that Attack Force is his worst. I know this will make me unpopular with most other reviewers here (maybe not Stevei!), But I think most of the criticism comes from all the bad news that was before the film, and not because of the actual quality of the film itself. br /> <br /> I must say that nowhere have there been so many rewrites or copies as it seemed to me. The duplication was (which made him sound like Martin Sheen's groin problem!) It was pretty awful and quite frequent, but not used for such a large segment of the film as I thought. The plot went pretty smoothly, and also considering that all the jokes with the original finished film called “Harvester” continued. Also, as another reviewer noted, the film has a pleasant gothic look, a new touch to Seagal's film. <br /> <br /> The absolute, deadly flaw, however, was the complete and complete absence of any exciting action. , with just a few bad shot scenes of wrestling for any fun. <br /> <br /> Although, to be honest, I would prefer to see it again than Flight of Fury, Today You Die, or Kill for Killing. **
