My 7-year-old daughter liked it, because Disney executives recklessly figured it would be so. That's the problem with Air Pals. This is strictly by the number of children's films, filled with carefully calculated attractiveness, a pair of politically correct morals and enough humor to avoid the terrible rating of G. As a parent or even a 10-year-old child, you have already seen it all before and have achieved more success before. Think: “101 Dalmatians meets at home alone,” and you get a general idea. I think that a good children's story is a good story. Air friends, about the same as the original recycled paper, do not meet this standard. This is not the worst video your child can watch, but there are megatons of the best.
