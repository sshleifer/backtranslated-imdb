It reminded me of SOO much of Michael Winner's shitty “Dirty Weekend” with his terrible English feeling of low budget. <br /> <br /> First, I must say that I am a fan of both exploitation and serious film. I appreciate, say, “Crazy” for his ineptitude and “Last house on the left” for his pure unscrupulous cruelty. And any number of inventive and increasingly violent Italian exits. <br /> <br /> It was just pointless. It seems like the British budget director thought: “Let's remake“ I spit on your grave ”, without making it too gloomy, now that horror is again in fashion with the Hostel. <br /> <br /> It all just does not stick together or there is a point. What's wrong with the rapists' daughter? Why bother about a man being an expert in security cameras? Crappy.
