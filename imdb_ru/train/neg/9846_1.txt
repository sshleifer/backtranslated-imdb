You may be tempted to rent this film because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most meaningless films in history. I kept waiting for something funny, but nothing funny appears in this film. Even the film industry has recognized that this is a very weak film, and did not even try to promote it. Amazingly, this has ever been videotaped. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract forced sellers to appear in this film. I also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to make other bad films. Of course, this film is a waste of money used to create it, and a waste of time watching it. Of course, there are high school students who can write / produce a film that will be the plot.
