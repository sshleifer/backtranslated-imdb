Some of the films you take for a pound turn out to be pretty good - the 23rd century films released dozens of little-known Italian and American films that were great, but although Hardgor released some of the Fulci films among others, most of their shit products, like The Chronicles Zombie. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say about this film is that it is not as annoying as the Stench of the Flesh. In addition, it is a very clumsy anthological film with the technical competence of the house of Lego, built in this way. <br /> <br /> This was seen elsewhere, but you really need to worry about the film, which includes a preview of the film. action in his credit sequence, so that by the time he gets to the zombie attacks, you've already seen it all. <br /> <br /> Bad movie fans will have the ball, watching 18,000 continuity mistakes and diabolical actions of the cast (especially a hitchhiker who was so bad that made me laugh a little), and praised Hardgore for imbued with the spirit of things, releasing such a bad imprint that it seemed to me that I was watching the beaten home video of the hike. <br /> <br /> Horrible, terrible things. We all did something similar when we took up the camera, but common sense prevails, and these films hang somewhere in our closets. Avoid.
