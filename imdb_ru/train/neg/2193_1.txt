The mad girlfriend of a scientist is beheaded, and he returns her head to life. Honestly, this is the plot of the film. He is trying to find another body for her, which he is looking for in this dirty area of ​​the city in order to find that perfect body. For some reason, he has an ugly monster in his closet in his cabin. The vile style of the film is ridiculous. No one in the film really can act, including the head. A monstrous monster is a masked man, and you can really tell. The plot is slow, weak, and the final is so poorly made. Look at the version of this movement in Mystery Science Theater 3000. Believe me, guys, I would not watch this movie by itself.
