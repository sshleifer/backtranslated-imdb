You can fight historical inaccuracies, but this film was just too much. Virtually nothing was even close to the truth, and even for that era it seemed silly. <br /> <br /> In defense of the ford on an old talk show, it was shown that he was working on a story as the real Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old, old, told him the story in his own way. Earp told the director about the stagecoach and how this was supposed to happen during the stagecoach arrival, therefore, despite what other historians claim, Wyatt himself claims that he was deliberate. <br /> <br /> In this film, Earp is portrayed as an honest man, as well as his brothers. History does not say exactly what they were or were not. Most people like to embed a bit of deceit and lawlessness in their characters, but this is nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them, because law-abiding quarrels take place in the OKRORAL. People who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the old West you did not have time to think about many other things. <br /> <br /> Characters that do not exist, characters depicted dying on the Corral, who really did not, all make this film weaker. It is further weakened by the Mature, who really did not make a convincing Doc. He may be the worst choice of actors for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that old films were closer to the era and closer to the truth. In the end, Ford did receive first-hand information from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> He is also weakened by so predictable events involving a Mexican girl. In those days, Hollywood was very pro-Nazi and was willing to predictably kill brunettes to show its patronage to Hitlerâ€™s idealism. This happens in most films before the eighties. However, this is not an excuse, and it reduces the cost of art. <br /> <br /> Actors playing in their ears succeed, and Brennan is always delighted. In fact, the mature may be the only acting back side of this film. However, this is the weakest of the old OK Corral films.
