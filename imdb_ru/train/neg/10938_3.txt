I did not expect much from this, but I was still disappointed. This was my least favorite production of Halestorm, which I saw. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I only laughed at 3 or 4 jokes. Is it funny when you see a fat guy eating donuts and falling again and again? What happened to the janitor in heaven? Fred Willard was cheerful with some of his collaborations with Christopher Guest, but it didn't work. They must have spent the entire budget in order to attract to this "famous" actors, because there was no budget for coverage. It looks like it was captured on a video camera, and most of the scenes were very dark. Do you really need so much film to show how someone actually shoots and makes a basket, as opposed to cutting and editing a ball that makes its way through the basket? I try not to be too critical of low-budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, go to a real church basketball game instead of this film.
