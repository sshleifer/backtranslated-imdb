I saw the movie, and they screwed me up, because the movie was stupid and boring. I thought that Ram Gopal Varma would justify his work, but, unfortunately, he failed, and the whole film was spoiled, and they messed up "Sholai" The cast and crew were bad. the whole theater was asleep while watching a movie, some people ran off in the middle. Amitab Bachan plays poorly, I thought that this film would be the best hit of the year, but this film will undoubtedly be the biggest failure of the year. no one pays tribute to their work, including Ajay Devagan. This film does not deserve the audience. I bet this movie will fail. <br /> <br /> "Finally this film sucks"
