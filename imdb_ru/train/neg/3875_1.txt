I've seen a lot of stupid plot lines in my time, but this is one of the worst. After being infected with any disease in space, the astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. Then he becomes enraged, killing people (as it is behind me; I just watch them, I cannot explain them). This is such a film that should not have been made in the first place.
