It happened on a copy of it. Not mine, and if I had spent my own money on it, I would have found those in charge and demanded it back! All I can say is a terrible student film. Any understanding of the film’s environment is missing. Acting terribly, the story would have been rejected from the original “Twilight Zone” series as unoriginal and unconvincing, and changing the tone of the main character's reaction to the “ghost” is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that the “glowing” reviews of this film belong to friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even fun. <br /> <br /> Amateur in extreme conditions! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
