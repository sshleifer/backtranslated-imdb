I have not seen this film for years, but I decided that I would comment on it anyway, mainly because the memory of the fact that I don’t like it so much, burned down in my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was not originally a prize, but at least it had the following differences: 1) Sam Pekingapes film, 2) famous Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) was a relatively painless way to blow off an hour and a half of time. <br /> <br /> For comparison, the 1994 version is just a piece of vanity for the then red-hot Alec Baldwin and his soon divorced wife Kim Basinger. McQueen and his then wife, Ellie McBride, also broke up shortly after their version of the film was made, and one could imagine Baldwin at their marriage counselor arguing whose stupid idea to make this film. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it and get out of the way - Alec Baldwin has never been and never will be something close to Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake so irritated me was perceived arrogance from Baldwin, who can afford to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the title role. As someone else points out, the vision of the 1972 film by Pekingpa was a satirical piece, intended to be a kind of parody of the action-adventure robbery genre. In contrast, Baldwin, Bassinger and company seem to be trying to bring a more serious tone: only the slimy, unprincipled characters, the villains of Michael Madsen and James Woods, look like real people. <br /> <br /> The film is also obviously sneaky energetic and unlikely at a fundamental level, which is difficult to put into words. One viewing was more than enough, not only because there was nothing new in it, but also because of how skillfully it was done. The Peckinpah film was actually a stylish little entertainment that had a high spirits, where this version is a freak that takes too long to make up little or nothing. There is no artistic necessity in its existence, and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make it difficult to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> So I don’t know, perhaps it was one of the films that helped initiate a wave of meaningless, artistically meaningless remakes with a large budget, relying on the then famous actor / actress, which in itself is not very good thing. I would always prefer to see the director, at least try to come up with a new idea for the film and fail with something original. This film only made me want to pull my eyebrows, and it showed that over the next 15 years since its release, Mr. Baldwin became widely known as one of the biggest assholes in Hollywood. Thank God for “Team America” for putting him in his place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
