Not at all impressive. “Twists and turns” are all quite predictable, if you have seen any films over the past ten years, and several rather interesting parts (where someone uses contextual clues to make a decision) are few and devoid of great effect, since the “secret” has already been shown before these tips have been explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, varieties) <br /> <br /> The game is quite decent. The story is just not very interesting. The whole “still awake” premise is negated by astral projection (not kidding). <br /> <br /> The scene of the operation is initially tense, a little unpleasant, but then it becomes completely banal. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, but not remembered. The least interesting role of Terrence Howard to date, as far as I saw. <br /> <br /> Generally boring.
