I do not see this movie. Bad effects and stupid blood effects. A complete waste of time. I was hoping to see a lot of cool killing and hot chicks, instead the director used animal killing videos to shock you, the observer. Disgusting. The killings are pretty lame, mostly suffocation. One woman, he puts the worms in her mouth, the other he puts on her face raw hamburgers and strangles her. Btc = btc broiler, new sandwich "killer" burger king .... haha. I do not think that this film relied too much on the real facts. I mean, he was not a real killer of BTK. He didnâ€™t carry a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and, oh, yes ... also a dead cow head. Go and figure it out.
