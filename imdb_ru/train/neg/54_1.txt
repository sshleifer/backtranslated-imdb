The only good thing about this film is a picture of Goldie Hawn standing in her little French-cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from taking off her meager little cotton top while she giggles and coos. Ooooof! Her loins vie with the loins of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen, and this shot almost killed me. I forgot about all this, hidden in the naughty “Roladex”, until I saw it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred its middle in this scene, good grief, reminding me what a hot beauty woman Goldie Hawn was in 80 x Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
