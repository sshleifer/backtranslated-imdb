I do not know how to describe this film. This is definitely one of the strangest films I've seen in a long time. Sometimes it is very disturbing, but in other places it is boring. The scenes of dental torture are very carefully thought out and can attract anyone who loves blood and spray. I found myself holding my teeth during some of the above scenes. The cleverest thing in the film is that he plays with our fears, and therefore the “Dentist” is very disturbing. <br /> <br /> The film’s humor is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you are a fan of strange and strange entertainment and teeth that are drilled into dust, then this is exactly the movie you were looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and feel that you are attracted to something, try it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a bit strange for my taste)
