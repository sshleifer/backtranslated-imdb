Funny concept, but poorly executed. With the exception of pretty good makeup effects, this is nothing special. There are obvious problems; for example, after it took weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to have gone from normal size to fatally thin in a few days ... and as soon as he is fatally thin, he remains almost as fatal thin for what seems long. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film has much more serious problems than the cinema: the quality of a budget television show is definitely low, and, basically, the acting skills are quite pretty. awful around. Robert John Burke, it seems, is always trying to find some strange snarling parody of Charlton Heston, and it is literally painful to look at her ... The only thing that is scary is that Lucinda Jenny and Kari Vuhrer are worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I put this movie as high as it is is that as soon as the movie takes over its last 1/3 or so, and the character Joe Mantegna takes over, the film develops a funny, harsh sense of slaughter with cheese, and crazy gang schemes to torment completely disgusting gypsies are quite fun to watch. The ending, if predictable, is also mean. Avoid unless you are king-o-phil or REALLY set to think about the voice of Fat Tony from the Simpsons, terrorizing the gypsy camp.
