The monster from the enemy mine somehow made its way into the small mountain community where he settled. He is hunted by a woman who has become a vigilant who wants to destroy him. This female killer, who looks like a refugee from the Motley Crue video, rides a motorcycle and tries to save a group of children who decide to spend a Big Chill weekend right in the middle of a monster turf. The decapitation and the large amount of blood in the first place helps to divert attention from the story, which is similar to the bad version of “Dr. Moreau's Island” (and yes, it is worse than Val Kilmer).
