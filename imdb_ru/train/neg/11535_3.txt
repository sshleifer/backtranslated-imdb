Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, purposeful, professional woman who raises the working class of Dane Dyer to a fun night. After a stupid accident in the village they are subjected to brutal attacks. After recovery and after a chance encounter with one of the attackers, their thoughts turned to the idea of ​​revenge ... <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that the “straightheads” were terrible. Cruel, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I didn't really like the phrase, I would call the Straightheads an obscene video. Of course, this was the film that would not have been released without a budget right on the video in the dark days of the 1980s. Honestly, I don’t know how the "Straightheads" got a movie release. <br /> <br /> I'm not a prude. I do not mind sex and violence in films, but they should be married to a film with a) a good plot or b) a good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straight-headed" had neither one nor the other. No progression in the plot or characters and too much remains unexplained and unspoken. Fortunately, the "straight" did not go quickly. It lasted only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because here an interesting film appeared with a particularly interesting twist of the plot in the last third. How often do I say this, but it would be nice if everything was done correctly. What a disgrace. I really like Jillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were hiding in this movie. It is especially undervalued (and still especially appropriate). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good British film about revenge, rent or buy Shane Meadow's Dead Man's Shoes. This is a small masterpiece. Last weekend I was supposed to see him "This is England." Ce sera sera ...
