A very strange, but sometimes elegant film about exploitation, without a real story, but benefiting from his stunningly delightful lead actress and a few pleasant, terrible makeup effects. Daniella is a beautiful 20-year-old girl who carries with her an injury of rape at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations make her believe that she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who is said to have been a werewolf. She kills her son-in-law during a night meeting and goes to the hospital. However, she again runs away and randomly devours more and more men while she is on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. All this is also nice to watch and listen to (really great soundtrack), but the lack of plot and continuity is rather annoying. Fortunately, the leading lady Annick Borel rarely wears clothes, and she fills boring moments while dancing naked by the fire. The film is too long, too strange and too forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end when, suddenly and unexpectedly, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to convince us that his film is based on real facts. Yes, right...
