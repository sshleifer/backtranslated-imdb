“I'm curious” is really two films, one of which is the sexual experimental side of Lena, and the other is her curiosity with politics / socialism. Whatever the intentions of the director, they are not really related to each other. The director should simply stick to the romantic side of Lena and make a separate film for politics. There is a strange mixture of political / military rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, smacking breasts and pubic hair. The film is more like a fictional documentary than a movie. In addition to interesting sex scenes, you will be bored watching this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the nude / sex scenes are overdone. If you want to see real porn, I’m sure there is a better choice. Pervasive nudity is a major distraction from any conspiracy. I think the cast did a good job however. They played their role plausibly. There is a bit of excess I’m so used to seeing in American films at this time.
