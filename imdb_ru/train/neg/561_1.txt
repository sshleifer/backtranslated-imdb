Well, I saw this movie yesterday, and it is - unfortunately - worse than you might have thought. First of all, the plot is idiotic, does not make sense at all. The script is full of intentionally fun conversations. The audience laughed many times. And the expectation is very low. The actors play so-so, except for Sharon Stone, who has a few good moments, but also terribly bad acting moments. The saddest thing is when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says something like “I want to give you a beep”, and it looks like a very mature woman who behaves rudely and is not sexy at all. Erotic stress from BI1 completely disappeared. From a technical point of view, Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than regular DVD, but at a much lower level than the original movie. For example, the scene of crazy fun is bad. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoven, and it shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his show. The script is made by people who do not correspond to Joe Östershas. There is no replacement for Michael Douglas in this. The film looks cheap and badly edited from time to time. Sorry, but my first thought after I left the theater was: "Why the hell did they not make this film before and with the original talents behind the success of the first film?" Everything on the original movie is like Citizen Kane by comparison. The First Basic Instinct is a classic, and it was a kind of breakthrough in popular cinema. It was defiant, sexy and controversial. It was the best performance of Sharon Stone in her career. It had a particular Paul Verhoeven style. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an unintentionally funny film, a poor director and a confident winner of the Razzie Prize in many categories. It is a pity that they made this film.
