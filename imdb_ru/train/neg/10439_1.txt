I would like to think of myself as a fairly open person, and I donâ€™t really (!) Like the film, but this one is without a doubt one of the most disgusting and lousy films I've ever seen! <Br /> <br /> I have no idea what's wrong with people who gave him such a good rating (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings) ... the only thing I can imagine this is what people must have voted during one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. While they were fools / stoned 2. They got cash for votes 3. At gunpoint < br /> <br /> I can't believe that I spent 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life on this miserable excuse for the film.
