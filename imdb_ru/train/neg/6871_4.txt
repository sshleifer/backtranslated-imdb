Great concept went wrong. Bad game, even worse writing ... After watching the first two episodes, I wondered why this happened in the second season. Characters are forgotten, bad spelling, sets are just fine. The special effects are simply sad - much better was done in the same period of time - where does the money go for this? The first episode begins interesting, and then quickly goes down - the admonition of the whole show is just silly. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of fiction and a fanatic, but this show just didn't work. As I said at the beginning, I'm really surprised that he got to the second season â€” much better after one season was canceled (for example, Jake 2.0). This show was just bad.
