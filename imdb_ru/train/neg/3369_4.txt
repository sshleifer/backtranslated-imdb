Well, my goodness, I am disappointed. When I first heard the news about the remake of the 1963 Robert Wise film “Ghosts,” I was afraid that it would be destroyed because of the abundance of visual effects the size of summer movies. But deep down I had faith. Of course, with such a talented actor safe and sound ... De Bont and company will not spoil the film, whose original was a fantastic and frightening film that understood the subtle art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now !! ?? My fears manifested ... a promising movie went wrong. Yes, the design of Eugenio Zannetti is awesome; the film is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never do wrong. But the script checks whether the actors are good and asks them to perform in the form of an unnatural dialogue, which is only talked about in the cinema. In the end, the always wonderful Lily Taylor is the only performer who runs with some dignity ... and that is just barely. But the crime of all crimes is that horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination, feel this terrible fear of fear of the unknown. No, we have some visual effects to show us what we should be afraid of ... and you know what? No matter how wonderful they were implemented ... the visual effects seem silly. And the culmination is a phantasmogoric mess ... but long before that everything went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything in Ghosts has been overdone and exaggerated. I am afraid that in this old haunted house there are no real thrills or creaks ... only groans. Take a look at the original. <br /> <br />
