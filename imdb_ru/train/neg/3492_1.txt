I don't buy kung-fu movies for the plot. I buy them for fighting scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fighting scenes, but not vice versa. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but it moved too slowly for my taste. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre fighting scenes, lasting only a couple of minutes apiece. The last fight was a little longer, but at that moment I was so bored that I did not even pay attention to it.
