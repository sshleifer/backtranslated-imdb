A huge hit after the release among the Australian audience, it can still be funny today, but its excessive political incorrectness and rude, awkward humor can make it a bit irritable. It lasts too long; part of the content <br /> <br /> could have been saved for the sequel, Barry Mackenzie is holding it, who still desperately needed new things. Of course, his attitude towards the Australian guy is funny, but also annoying when the film is delayed. Some say that Crocker’s songs are the best beats, and of course they are original, but “funny”? “The Adventures of Barry McKenzie” will be an important milestone in Australian cinema, but we must do everything we can so that foreign audiences do not perceive most Australians as Barry McKenzie (or, for that matter, Mick Dundee!), Rating: 5/10
