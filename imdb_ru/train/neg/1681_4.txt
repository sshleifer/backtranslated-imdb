Freeway Killer is a madman who shoots people on the freeway, shouting mystical songs on a car phone. Police believe that he is an occasional killer, but Sunny's solar heroine, played by Darlan Flugel, reveals a pattern. The ex-cop, played by James Rousseau, does the same thing, and they join forces and bodies in search of a villain who has done away with his spouses. Also in the film with Richard Belzer there are moments in this film, especially if you like car chases, but for the most part this is really a bad film, see if you really are bored, and you have already seen “Fellow”, “Joy” or “Disruption” otherwise stay out of the highway.
