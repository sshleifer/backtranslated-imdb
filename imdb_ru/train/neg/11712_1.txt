The only reason I remember this film is that it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 years old, and my friend was 18. We were at the age when the militants were our thing to enjoy the most (well, 2nd place). We left feeling so offended that we wanted to get our money back, but time never returned. <br /> <br /> Editing is what killed this movie. As the truck is being attacked by an increasing number of vehicles with rocket launchers installed, the film completely insults the viewers â€™intelligence as these villainous bad guys in 4x4 VW Bugs fire missiles at the truck. Please, rockets on a truck that is known to transport plutonium? Worse, this VW manages to get 15-18 shots from 4 rocket launchers. You will see 2 of them fire on a VW with four rockets, cut off the truck with the last one attached, a second later return with two rockets attached, launch another one, then go in front of the truck, and now it returns to the full set of four rockets. <br /> <br /> We did this in the hope of a great completion that never happened. Looks like they just ran out of money and they stopped. <br /> <br /> Just funny.
