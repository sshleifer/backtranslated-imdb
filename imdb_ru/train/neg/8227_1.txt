I will keep it quick and sweet. Five girls on the way home from a football match decide to take a short path that will lead them along a deserted, forested road. Of course, only good things happen to them, and they arrive safely at their destination. <br /> <br /> Good, no. Soon, they are hunted by a deranged chick, who has serious mental problems, and this is followed by 90 minutes of obvious boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope to never again see any of these actors in the films. Their screaming, shrill voices caused me a headache, and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeated phrases and meaningless hysterical screams. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror movies I've ever seen ... and I have seen a lot.
