I was looking forward to seeing this film for a long time, after seeing “Return to Paradise”, which I found gritty. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about this was the unpredictable finale, which I think was partially stolen from Return to Paradise. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like the character of Danes, and at first I found her very annoying. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything realistic in the film. This could have been done much better, for example, one could pay more attention to prison conditions and sheer horror. It was too fun to be realistic. There could also be more action and tension. <br /> <br /> The best in this film is the “tragic” ending. I could not predict this. But by that time, I didn’t care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
