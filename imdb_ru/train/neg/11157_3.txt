Hip Erotic. Wickedly sexy ... whatever. This is the "Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. A policeman saves a girl (a waitress!) From a big monster and calls herself her "protector." Lead actor Ryan Alosio does a pretty good job of imitating Kyle Reese ... in the police station there is a massacre ... the bad guy has muscular red eyes ... and he even has a dialogue in the spirit of "You said yourself, he will never stop. Never. A terrible script written by a first time scriptwriter who, thank God, hasn’t sold anything since then, and it was all shot together by the famous bad director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a strip bar (always a good sign ), and the angry biker guy bursts without visible cause You are being chased by three policemen. One is black and (shocking horror!) He is killed in the first five minutes. The film goes uphill for the next hour or so, and then is picked up a little with some decent action sequences before rounding off all it's with a terrible ending. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the actors look like competent actors do everything they can with a bad script and a director who is willing to accept less. If nothing else, they seem to learn how to act in this film, and Alosio, along with some of the supporting cast, shows signs of talent. The Dark Wolf in its human form is played by the giant Kane Hodder, known for his numerous images of Jason Orhis in the films Friday 13th. He is quite decent, especially considering that he is not used to acting in roles. <br /> <br /> He became famous among the groups of lustful teens behind the scene of lesbians on the roof between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who shoots her kit a couple of times in the great traditions of former actresses 'Power Rangers'. And it’s quite obvious that the editor spent WAY too much time on this scene ... in any case, the main ransom feature is that the physical effects of the werewolf are pretty good, and the wolf’s design is not bad at all. But CGI is bad. Just bad. I mean seriously, if you cannot achieve some level of realism - why bother? Just add a little extra money to your makeup! Besides the horrible script, there are moments in this film, many of which are unintentionally ludicrous. Good laugh, if you have nothing better, but just do not spend money on it. You are welcome.
