I was clearly displeased to see this film at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I have been attending this festival for more than 5 years, and I, of course, have seen some bad movies on occasion. However, First Bite reached a completely new minimum in the film. Despite the fact that he was filmed in beautiful places, with rare, graceful close-ups of fabulous food, the film distorts an excessive amount of plot twists and unnatural characters, until I practically asked for it. <br /> <br /> The main actor, David La Haye, was completely unable to show any character development throughout the film, portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end. Additional plots, such as eating disorders, were developed so poorly and did not fully fit into any context that the film was showing until this point. <br /> <br /> The theme of mysticism was used as an unsuccessful attempt to hide a film that does not achieve anything, does not go anywhere, and completely disappoints.
