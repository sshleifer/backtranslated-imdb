You can not refrain too much from this, knowing that it was done in four days, and I still expected it to be a camp. (Actually, this is not so bad. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take themselves seriously, the rest of the actors play him half straight; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The funny story actually paid attention that shocked me; I assumed that the whole purpose of these ultra-low-cost horror films was to satisfy the most sexual fantasies and not give a damn about history, but they use many words, such as "technological" and "physical" in the script, to get their point through . (Although it is possible that the story is important only to explain why there are so few actors.) No one cares about this stupid storyline, and in the film only mockery of cults and homoeroticism with a soft core (which is not so cool) are interesting. I would have enjoyed it more if there were just random murders for no reason. The film is grainy, with television quality and acting level. There are several “sexy” scenes that are fine - the boys wriggle in their boxers in bed feeling good; or be tied up and make orgasmic faces when wine is poured over them - and some of them are quite funny. And I liked the excavations of L. Ron Hubbard and the deliberate irony of the story of religious cultists told with intense, cheerful overtones, but it still did not do any good. 3/10
