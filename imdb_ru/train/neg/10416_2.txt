Before watching this movie, I would say that I liked everything Katie Bates did. Now this is all - minus one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his game. Someone should have told him that the “poor” is not synonymous with dirty, ignorant, or cliché. The same is true for Randy Quaid's stereotyping. The only redemptive trait is Henry Thomas, who is not strong enough to carry this dirty mess. If you like the country, you will enjoy the scenery. This is the best I can give. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of both independent and unusual films, but this is just awful.
