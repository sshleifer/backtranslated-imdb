It is simply invisible. If there is a story around here, it is so deeply buried under horrible characters and terrible operator work that it is indistinguishable. There is a group of vampire hunters who do their job, and dead vampires have little aliens. They jump out of their heads and talk like Speed ​​Gonzalez. If you can imagine an alien sock puppet, covered in blood and blood, screaming in horror when a cowboy kills her with cattle, well, that's what you get. These people are loud, unpleasant, cruel and just very annoying. In addition, there are antihuman people who stand on their CGI spacecraft, being so incredibly pompous that they cannot be taken. These people make Hillary Clinton seem like an extremist by comparison. They are friends with some vampires, or with someone else ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there is the work with the camera. Remember how everyone hated crap at a thousand cuts per minute from the recent Rollball remake? People who made this movie love it. This is enough for three really wacky nu-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. For comparison, the Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
