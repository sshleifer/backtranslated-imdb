This is the film that upsets me the most. Great cast, great director, great plot potential, and all this destroys the script, which leads nowhere ... and says nothing during the trip there! There is no depth here. No depth of character, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, tension or common sense. We know what is happening, we are told how they plan to solve the problem, they solve the problem, throw a surprise at us near the end, which cannot cause any concern, then they suddenly end the film. Wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Glenn Ford heads the UK (and one French) actors who are fantastic and do an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they were given. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton in the role of “Old Charlie”, which gives beautiful pieces of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film. I also thought that the film looks great ... all the shadows and fog ... a very snuff film. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the actors are doing everything they can, the direction is pleasant, it is still not enough for me to recommend spending time watching the movie. There are much better films of Glenn Ford: "Big Heat", "Gilda", "The Case in Trinidad", etc.
