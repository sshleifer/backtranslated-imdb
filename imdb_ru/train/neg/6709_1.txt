I am having fun easily. I liked Hot Shots and Naked Gun and their many prequels, even when most people found them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most of the films of Paul Shor. Honestly, I only saw one movie that was bad ... and that was it. It has been a long time since I saw him, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking: “This is a stupid film. Why did I see this? ”To be honest, this is the only film that I cannot recommend.
