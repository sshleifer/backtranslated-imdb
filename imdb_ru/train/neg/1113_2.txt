Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and not named Topper? Go to hell! <br /> <br /> This parody makes a gross injustice to the greatest of cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young compared to old ones, with blond hair compared to gray ones and kills people, but does not shoot a gun from their hands. Is this a real Hopalong, please stand up! <br /> <br /> One of the worst films ever made and, believe it or not, the man who brought us the saga of the grandfather!
