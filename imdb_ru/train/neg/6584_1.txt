Being the only film I could see at this year’s Nordische Filmtage in Lübeck, this year’s festival will be remembered to me as a record one. <br /> <br /> This film, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of shit! Sorry for the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actors are not the best. But even the best actors would not have saved the film. For example. plot: after the first 15 minutes, it became absolutely clear that John was ill, the neighbors' girls were not real and that he had killed his first girlfriend. The so-called “sex scene” was nothing short of disgusting (to beat each other until blood flows for me, has nothing to do with sexuality), but, unfortunately, these were not the only disgusting images that could be shown. Everything else was copied by other directors, for example, Lynch, but, of course, without their genius. <br /> <br /> So, to sum up the whole movie and save time and money of other viewers: the guy loses the girl, the girl returns home, the guy kills the girl and goes crazy after that, the guy imagines hot, but crazy neighbor girls , the guy has a very disgusting sex with one of them (or he thinks so), in the end he realizes that he is crazy, and his girlfriend and her new lover are in his apartment all the time .. ... bad story, bad actors , photos that make you vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point h and the fact that you understand how well you understand Norwegian, if you have learned Swedish) - at least one advantage of the evening - and you cannot choose 0 points here).
