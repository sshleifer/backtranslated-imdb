California worries I believe that there is no reason for this story. It is not interesting and has no social value. Technically, the film is very well made, the performances are first-class and first-class. The story develops in an intriguing way that arouses interest. But in the end this film becomes sick and disgusting for decency. I don't recommend California to anyone.
