“Envy” is bad for a number of reasons. Yes, there are incredible characters. It's not a problem. This is what they are unlikely, and we do not care about them at all. The War of the Roses showed incredible characters, but because of the right ideas, we grew up, at least, to interest in their fate, while in Envy, the introduction is subtle, the characters are never believable, and the plot only worsens the situation. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply disgusting in his role, and I am his fan most of the time. Stiller campaigned to release this video right now, and now I understand why. The film suggests that he is “best friend” with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we are given shots that seem to show that Stiller hates Black. I thought it would grow into some kind of one-sided relationship (a la "The Cable Guy"), but this would not happen, instead Stiller insists that he is his "best friend", and I was embarrassed when he seemed to relate to Black as, well, in general, "poo". The plot of the film is ridiculous, but it does not matter, because it must be an exaggerated story about morality. Unfortunately, the message is lost in a mess. Walken plays well, but Black is unusual and annoying (and I usually find him very funny). No, this is not a horrible film, but I still can’t believe that Barry Levinson (Rain Man, The Sleepers) is responsible for this - this is not one of the worst films of all time, but he certainly can be much better, I would like Ba-Pu-Rize to exist - so that we can make this film disappear forever ...
