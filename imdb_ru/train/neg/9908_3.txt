I gave these 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open and left unexplained, and also because of the disgusting scenes when someone eats extremely disgusting, plus the scenes with a decaying corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above should have been shown in such a graphic form. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film, as it is, concerns three interrelated stories, none of which is satisfactory. . <br /> <br /> Bounty Hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is a character who combines all three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First we have Dylan McDermott, who looks damn good, like a wanted criminal who runs to Mexico to escape the law and the bounty hunter when he drives through the border town and sees a sedan girl with the sad face played by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of the girls from Hemingway, not sure which of them is playing the western wife on the lone border that approaches the neighbor woman, an attractive red-haired woman, who, as we will soon know, takes too long was in badlands. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what is happening to him, and the final scene of the film is completely beyond rational understanding.
