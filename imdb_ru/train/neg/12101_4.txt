I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I did not care, his delivery. He simply acted as an asshole in a poorly edited, invented campaign to slander minors. Edit slices are abundant, etc. The camera will focus on it, and you will see 2 or 3 editing slices within one or two minutes of the dialogue. Add a no-no movie to a series of shots with a constant boom. <br /> <br /> This documentary touches on a topic with so many points of view, with so many interesting stories that it’s so easy to make a film. To find fault with religious fanatics is just the same as finding a backward child. It's so simple, it's just wrong. I mean, how hard is it to make these people look like bags of nuts? To make them contradict each other, you simply let them read more than one or two verses. I really like it when he jumped back between people of the same religion and showed that they completely contradict each other. <br /> <br /> I just think he could have done something more creative. The part in which the neurologist spoke about brain activity was never disclosed. It would be interesting to show a scan of people during religious seizures compared to drugs, sex or ???? He could play more on women who were all happy with the play “Passion”, which in the new film “Rob Zombie” more resembled the scene of snuff. More could go down in the story of John Smith, the founder of the Mormons, who had a rather colorful past. Delve into science against. religion. One of them is a very methodical, very strict process of increasing the credibility of the theories. It is built on itself from a solid bottom upwards, a new layer on top of a more proven layer. A huge burden of proof is required every step of the way. The other begins at the top and comes down to undeniable claims. Is that so because good ?? I said so. <br /> <br /> Done right ?? Would I say turn it into an original HBO series ?? every week I come across another religion. <br /> <br /> This was a sensation about one thing. I must have been blind. Good ol GV Bush ... no wonder he was elected. He had a religious majority. And well ... now this blind leads the blind. <br /> <br /> Bill Moyer ... Well, what can I expect from the guy who gives out in the sutra on Newport Beach?
