The hood of the living dead and all the other films that these guys made were looking like they came together and shot it with their buddies who had zero talent one day when they were bored (the lines were not rehearsed or convincing at all) . I believe that 95% of amateur films and 90% of home videos are better than this film (although the similarity between them justifies the comparison). "Hey, let's see if people are stupid enough to buy our movies!" Hope no one else was. I apologize to those who participated in the film, as this review is somewhat rude, but I was a dope who read your fake reviews and bought the film.
