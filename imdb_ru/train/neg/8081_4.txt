One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it becomes a satire, is that it must be somewhat believable. I think that a bomb against matter will cause much more damage than for what it is intended for. But I will leave it to physicists who might see a solar crisis. <br /> <br /> The Earth is in crisis, because solar flares are completely out of control. They are approaching Earth so much that it becomes unseasonably hot, as if the whole Earth was the Valley of Death. The answer is a bomb against the matter that the spacecraft will have to take in the sun and blow up there. It will distract flares, say, in the direction of, say, Mercury, provided that it is not in direct orientation with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who will deliver it, except for captain Tim Matheson and his team. This is if he can focus on affairs, and not on the runaway son of Corina Nemeke. Taking care of the personal side of family problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson’s father and Nemeka’s grandfather. <br /> <br /> There is also a villain here, Peter Boyle, who is the CEO of a multinational corporation, which in this crisis is trying to control the global food supply of survivors. The idea that he may not survive is not part of his thinking. He does his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> Sunny crisis seems to be a bad mix of 2001, Space Odyssey and Journey to the bottom of the sea. It seems that Boyle takes his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, obviously he is the only one in the cast who understands that he is in turkey and replays accordingly. true blue and boring. Except, perhaps, the deserted rat of Jack Palance, who finds Nemeka and takes care of him. <br /> <br /> The key point here is that the film was made by the famous Hollywood flop movie provider Allen Smith. The film earns as many as four stars per cast, and it was just in time for Thanksgiving cut out.
