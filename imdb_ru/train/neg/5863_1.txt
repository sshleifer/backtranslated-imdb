I really can not believe that this film is not in the worst 250 IMDB, it is absolutely terrible. When I first saw it, I remember talking about it in college class, and two other people saw it too. We all told other students not to see this, because it was so terrible. By the time we finished, some wanted to see it simply because they could not believe that everything was as bad as we said. Don't be like them, just pass by. I am sure that everyone associated with this film would also prefer that you never see them in this film.
