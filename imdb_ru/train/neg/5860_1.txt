It is difficult to accurately put into words the horror of this film. A completely new vocabulary must be invented to describe the complete absence of something, even remotely recognizable as “humor” or even “entertainment” in the “Rabbit Test”. So, as a small contribution to this future work, I would suggest the following word: <br /> <br /> “Hubiriffic” (adj.) The combination of “hubristic” and “terrific”; Previously, Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redak have greatly outgrown their meager abilities to have fun in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness. Trying to assemble a plane! a comedy with a moldy collection of jokes (Note to Joan: German doctors have not been funny since Vaudeville), separated from the graves in the Catskills - this is bad enough. But at the heart of this cinematic crime is River's uncut style, which is best described as “ugly,” and a set of “past and future” that are so eager to please them that they outplay even the weakest flashy jokes. <br /> <In this Sargasso Sea of ​​Juice - the unfortunate Billy Crystal in the debut role in the film as the unfortunate protagonist of the film Lionel. Watching Crystal in this photo is very similar to how a blind man walks through a minefield; in the end, a discreet reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition, since a cheap joke, after a cheap joke, hits him in the face. <br /> <br /> I can only guess about the audience that really might like a rabbit test. Cabbage, shellfish, and slightly backward lizards are all likely candidates. But for self-conscious, thinking people - I would enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach into your eyes before I would recommend Rabbit Test.
