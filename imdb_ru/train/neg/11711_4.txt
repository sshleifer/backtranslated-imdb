A good movie, with a beautiful leading lady, but a terrible leading man. Stefan Jenkins, who plays a husband, is really a bad actor. Joyce Heizer, on the other hand, is the saving grace of the film. She is the best actress in the group. <br /> <br /> NOTE * The first comment from the guy who praised the movie (and, according to his account on IMDB.com, wrote only ONE review - and guess what movie?) is clearly a plant. Although the film is well shot, it is by no means subtle, gorgeous, or any other hypobolic descriptions used by the reviewer. <br /> <br /> “The Art of Revenge” is an honest film, but it's a big tease. He offers all sorts of sexual situations, but he never gets through it. How to watch Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with all the edited “naughty bits”. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole is a bit out of focus, and the final and much of the third act is really a big mess. Of course, the twist ends, as each film now finds it necessary to have a twist-end. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
