I just didn't get this movie ... Was it a musical? no ... but there were choreographic songs and dances ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious drama .... no, the acting was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Is Whoopi Goldberg a quality serious actor ... Definitely not. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me not to fall asleep in this rambling film. The message of apartheid and "tribute" to students who died during the student uprising is celebrated. But as entertainment it was very bad, and in documentary style it was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but honestly, I hated him
