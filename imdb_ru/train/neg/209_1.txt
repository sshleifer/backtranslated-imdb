I could never watch “Happy Days” after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew that I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie was Scott Baio (skateboarding!). Jodie Foster in her first “adult” role turns into her usual professional performance, but this does not justify this boring mess. Two hours from my life that I will never return! There are no interesting characters, an incredible storyline, dubious editing and terrible cinematography, but, worst of all, I could not care less. The story of California teenagers of the 1970s, when children live a miserable life, and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste your time watching this horrible film occasion.
