The space camp, which unfortunately was planned during the Challenger accident, deserves such good luck. The stars scoff at acting when Leah Thomson actually turns sideways when asked for more than her usual innocent smile with wide eyes, apparently to hide her useless attempts. Sometimes the movie is funny when it starts asking too much about you. A little boy holds in his closet a multi-million robot that breaks down when he is given too many teams of hordes of shining fellow hostels. This battered and unattractive machine, Jinks, plays a major role in the ridiculous premise of the film, which seems to be part of Short Circuit, part of 2001, by the Airplane team. I will not bore you with this, suffice it to say that you can only laugh when confronted with it. Having said all this, it is pleasant to observe, as in SeaQuest, Saved by the Bell. Romance and technology, be careful, as incredible as each other. Also, if you're a fan of the eighties, you can't miss him for the fun performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie from Temple of Doom) and, obviously, Leah Thompson. In addition, Joaquin Phoenix makes a cunning turn as a kind of imitator Guni, who is friends with Jinx. Do not come close to this film if you are not a fan of garbage.
