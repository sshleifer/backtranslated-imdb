During the Christmas holidays, a group of college friends stays to help prepare the dormitories for demolishing and replacing apartment buildings. To make work a little harder, the killer, dressed in Chuck, wanders through the halls of the hostel, hunting the group in various violent ways. <br /> <br /> Registered as one of 74 'videos of nastiness. 'Dorm That Dripped Blood', listed on the UK in the 1980s, had a good reputation created before the first viewing. The term "dirty video" recalls some images of sheer blood, violence, sex, etc. Everything that a horror fan dreams of. So, after listening to all this information, I settled in Pranks (alt. Title), expecting an unpleasant slasher experience. and that is what he was trying to be, but failed largely completely. Visually, the film is not great. Cinematography, blood (except for a couple of scenes) and a general direction all fail. It's just not nice to watch. A non-original script is missing and often adds random things for no real reason (for example, the discovery of a murder). There are several cool scenes of death, including a rather pleasant melting of the face (as seen on the poster), but this is all for the positive. The action is pretty bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer is not cool and not scary, and he suffers from one serious mistake that any slasher should always avoid: it's a bit boring. In general, for a film made by several film students from the University of California at Los Angeles for $ 90,000 (which will be twice as much as today), “The Hostel with dripping blood” is not a complete mess. He has a couple of good things, and that is pretty watchable. But, as a slasher, it looks at the level of such films as “House on Sorority Row” and “Chunks”. It just can't compare. Do not expect much, and at least you can have fun. I hate to say it, but this is one of the few films I have seen that would actually be better with the remake. , and yet, they go after great works, such as the Black Christmas. Well. . <br /> <br /> Required elements of horror: <br /> <br /> - Subgenre: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some awful cool killings, and blood is fine for the most part . but nothing special. In addition, they hid some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> Sex / nudity: a little unattractive (for me) nudity, but not much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): No. The killer’s final monologue (s) made him / her rather reluctant. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Pauses: a scare or two jumps, but not too effective. <br /> <br /> Mystery: I suppose so, but I just didn’t care, and it’s as obvious as the nose on the killer’s face. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> The final verdict: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Nonsense! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
