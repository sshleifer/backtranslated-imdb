I saw this “hot” movie when it was released in 1986. He had an “X” rating for a short scene that included oral sex, but he played in popular cinemas (it was a “feature film”). Presumably, this is the first film in which the respected actress shows a clear sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story about a high school student (Federico Pizalis) in love (understandably) with an older woman Marushka Detmers. As mentioned earlier, Detmers is very beautiful with a good body, BUT she also gave very good results. Pizalis was (to put it mildly) rather poor. No wonder he never made another film. However, despite the infamous sex scene (which is obvious, but rather short), this slow and boring story missed me silly. Good game Detmers only helped a certain point. Basically, I looked at my watch, patiently waiting for them to finish. If it did not have that sequence, this film would have been forgotten long ago. Bored and slow. You can skip this.
