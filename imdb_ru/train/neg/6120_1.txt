There are three kinds of bad movies - cheap, boring and tasteless. the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> boring movies are simple, well, boring — if you don't leave fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Tasteless films do have their own advocates; but the fact remains that they are masturbating for very sick people. <br /> <br /> really cheap funny movies are really funny, because the filmmakers so desperately wanted to make their own films that they went too far from their own. abilities and resources available. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is simply dull and tasteless; fortunately, fate and lack of funds and skills save her, making her seem cheap. this movie is funny, and maybe it will be the last really funny-bad movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I first saw this in the theater, may God forgive me; I laughed so hard that I rolled out of my seat, and also with most of the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Derek and her husband, the promoter, viewed this film as, in part, a satire; unfortunately, the derekam clearly lacked any necessary resources for this; therefore, the "satirical" element manifests itself as the impression of some schoolgirl about the impression of some young gay about the impression of Frank Gorshin that the wanderer in Batman is trying to pretend that he is crimson - he does not fly over our heads, he has no idea where there can be any human head. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some, presumably, serious moments in this film - it should be an action movie, remember - which are so startlingly stupid that someone wonders if they splashed spoiled milk into their eyes. <br /> <br /> Regarding Derek’s infamous tendency to open his chest - I can’t imagine a less erotic nude photo gallery, it looks so strange with such broad shoulders that I can. ” I have no idea what anyone has ever seen in it. <br /> <br /> As for the plot - whatever it may be - well, it is not; Derek is chasing across Africa, and one god knows why. then her father - Harris - pretends to be playing in some kind of manic puppet show, and, of course, there is a jerk who seems interested in advertising, not knowing that the subject has changed - perhaps because he did not see the script - obviously no one has. <br /> <br /> minor camera work, shoddy editing - if not for the three-sided chimpanzee, the film would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> like this, this is a real honk.
