I have no idea that the San Francisco assholes invented this stupid conspiracy, but apparently they need to give up any drugs they take and put their analyst on dangerous money - NOW. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a plausible story if you think that the sequence of alien abductions in Brian's Life is plausible. <br /> <br /> This film is slightly larger than the left piercing stream. If the United States and the USSR abandoned nuclear weapons, the result would be the removal of the only real obstacle that kept them from participating in the war. No matter how bad Korea, Vietnam and other wars of that era were, they were “proxy wars” that fought to keep the superpowers from direct participation. <br /> <br /> This film makes me wonder how realistic it was when a group of high school students went on a hunger strike against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As if someone would say: “Mr. President, some children in the High School do not eat!” And Ronald Reagan replied: “My God! I'd rather review my defense policy! ”That's right. <br /> <br /> Like this movie? Would it not be better if the Soviet Union collapsed because they could not support their massive production of weapons ... wait, it happened!
