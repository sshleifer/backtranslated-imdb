This television film shows that bad films exist. The only reason I saw this was covered with KTMA MST3K. This is the Super Bowl in New Orleans Superdome. Nevertheless, football is not played at all, and we see that almost nothing is visible behind the curtain. With many stars in this film, it made no difference. I really do not know why I watched it.
