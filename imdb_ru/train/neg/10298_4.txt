Lynn Ramsey shoots images, and Samantha Morton can cause feelings with a gesture. So to expend forces on the disclosure of their talents in this mannered, ambitious lark. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can't revive Kallar. Her attempts are too cunning and stagnant. Repeatedly her camera lingered on long, silent shots of a painful actress, as if only one worn look of Morton could provide character. We are in the full varholian hell of self-indulgence: for a film that has minutes to save the bugs crawling on the floor, you might think that it can do without the help of its main character. But how will this be if she rarely speaks? Without the inner monologue of the novel, celluloid Morvern Kallar is nobody. No wonder Ramsey often undresses Morton. <br /> <br /> However, the first ten minutes were so impressively removed and edited that my hopes grew. Give the film so much: he knows how to make promises, if not how to fulfill them.
