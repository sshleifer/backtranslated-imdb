It could have been a good episode, but I just had to turn it off. The British representation was terrible to watch. Did the creators ever go to Britain before shooting? At least set foot in England ?? I do not think that any Brit had such an accent except for the comedy parody of the Royal Family! Also with two English boys ... well, I donâ€™t think that any English boy has acted, spoke or dressed like any English child in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harry appeared in public. American filmmakers. In the UK more than 1 country. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland ... that is, more than 1 culture! I can cope with stereotypes, but it was so bad that I could not watch them. The fire looked cool though!
