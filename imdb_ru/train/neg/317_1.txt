It was the worst movie I ever tried to watch. In the first 15 minutes there was nothing that could interest me in this film. At that time I was on vacation, and I had enough time to devote myself to the film "just for fun." The condominium where we stayed had this film in stock - they had to buy it in the store for $ 1 or something like that. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this is not like any other film he has shot. It started with a bad premise, and then it got worse. This is not even funny. <br /> <br /> I watched a lot of movies, including those I didnâ€™t like. But if you decide to spend time on this film, do not say that I did not warn you.
