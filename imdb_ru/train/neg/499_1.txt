The horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft gothic flicks of every night from 10 pm to about 4 am, but their “fright” factor is very limited, if it exists at all. In fact, I’m sure that winning a lot of millions of pounds will be more frightening than anything this channel has to offer. <br /> <br /> The bloodsucker heads dance, deserves special mention, because I feel the undeniable low of the channel, full of minimums. I can't even begin to tell you how bad this film is, but in order to complete the minimum 10 lines required by this site, I will at least try. <br /> <br /> First, the name is misleading and has no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact, the film could be called "Toothbrush" or "Wallpaper" for all that it has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpapers. <br /> <br /> Miles around there are no bloodsuckers, and what's worse, there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they shot two different films here by mistake. <br /> <br /> A more appropriate name would be: "An excited Italian leads five people to a terrible castle and tires us silly for ninety minutes." Yes, it fits better. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible and terrible dubbing, and the guy who plays Seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as in his character .... terrible. <Br /> <br /> The only salutary grace of this film is a small but slightly interesting scene of lesbian sex, two small and very interesting scenes of heterosexual sex, and the added appeal is that each female character shoots her own set. Bonus <br /> <br /> Otherwise, avoid this birth. No vampires, no dancing, no scenes of cruel or terrible nature, and no path on the land of the Gods. I will never, never, never watch this again. <br /> <br /> Not a single word of lies, this film could not put you make a movie for life.
