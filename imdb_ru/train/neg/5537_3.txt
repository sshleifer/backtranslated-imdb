What kind? You did not know that Scooby-Doo fought with zombies? Well, you may also be unaware of this short film filmed by director Victor Halperin, who also shot the White Zombie four years earlier. That would probably make it the second zombie movie. <br /> <br /> No, don't look for Dorothy Stone to bare her breasts, as you would expect in most zombie movies, and don't even look for any brains to eat. You know, it's 1936. <br /> <br /> What you see is typical for that period - a lot of talk. <br /> <br /> You do see Dean Jagger (Twelve minutes) Watch high and Bela Lugosi’s eyes, but that’s all. Zombies in Cambodia, really!
