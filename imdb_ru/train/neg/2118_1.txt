What can I say about Seven Pounds ... well, I watched the flight from Seattle to Tokyo, and since this flight was long and boring, the film definitely did not help. Will Smith's character, Ben Thomas, is almost completely unattractive even after his buyout at the end. More than two hours of film take off most of the screen time with random garbage that just builds the plot as slowly as possible. In the defense of the movie, the character Rosario Dawson adds a bit of life to the film, albeit a bit. I don't understand how someone could actually cry during this movie, when all I wanted to do was turn it off. In addition, Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the end, arguing that killing himself with a jellyfish is the most stupid way to die.
