Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great films? These days are reminiscent of ever more distant memories. <br /> <br /> Although “Hollywood Murder” is not at all terrible, it’s an ordinary and surprisingly boring movie about friendly cops. This is not a very funny comedy, but an action movie is not particularly exciting. An oversupply of plots cannot mask the weakest of the main storyline. <br /> <br /> At least, Ford seems to enjoy more than his last few projects, and he can carry the film most of the time. Hartnett is quite adequate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford in terms of chemistry. <br /> <br /> In general, “Hollywood Murder” is pretty fun entertainment, but hardly. Take Ford away, and it's not even that.
