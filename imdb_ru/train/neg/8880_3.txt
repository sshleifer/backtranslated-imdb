This film was ok. but it could have been much better. There are some terrible moments, but they are not enough for me to want to watch this movie again. There are several scenes through which you can quickly go forward and not miss anything. The biggest disadvantage is that it is so predictable, and that is why I rated it so low. It is watchable, but do not expect anything good.
