The film is so confusing religious ethics and ideals that it can not create a consistent argument against the death penalty at any level. Representing the legal execution of a convict for murder as a catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film raises the killer of his parents to the status of martyr for Christ. For some reason, according to the plot, God is outraged by the fact that society decided to rid itself of a fanatic who killed his parents, set fire to them while they were sleeping helplessly in their beds. Yet this same god is not indignant at the actions of the murderer. The protagonist, a non-religious pregnant suicide woman, ultimately gives her life to a defiant, but unbelievable attempt to save this convicted murderer without success. In other threads of an underdeveloped conspiracy, Jesus returns as a powerless and broken tramp to symbolically unleash the wrath of God. The modern vague incarnation of Christ not only deprives him of his strength, but also mocks the messianic ideal of all religions. He is not able to affect humanity forever and rolls around the edges of life without emotion, waiting for humanity to destroy itself. Meanwhile, with a little help from Jesus, a mentally unbalanced pregnant woman acquires the ability to transform into her newborn soulless child, who somehow saves all of humanity from the wrath of the omnipotent. I also interpreted this as a statement in support of abortion at some levels. In this film, in which an attempt is made to weave a lot of religious themes into a thriller, one cannot express any religious idea that I could clearly interpret, with the exception of ridicule over people's beliefs. This raises many questions that he does not even try to answer. He ignores the religious values ​​of his audience, trying to portray a stupid version of their performance. stupid
