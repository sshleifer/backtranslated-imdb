Characters are clich√© and predictable, each of them is either pure white or evil. The game is too crap to be fun, excessive. This is doubly disappointing if you are a Bett Davis fan, because her character is not the typically funny Bett Davis character; she only frowns thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> In general, neither I nor my wife found the film interesting, touching, or enjoyable.
