I would like Spike Lee to choose another name for his film. Summer of Sam creates the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer David Berkovitsa. Is not. This is a sandy, down-to-earth portrait of the street life of New York in the hot summer of 77, when Berkovits terrorized this city. <br /> <br /> The film tells about several young fictional characters in the Italian-American region and their reaction to the threat of the son of Sam. There Winnie and his wife Dionna; There is Richie, Ruby and several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters do not like. They are usually annoying, and sometimes unbearable. Lee then uses their high energy, chaotic life, which is filled with anger, lust and total turmoil. Between Vinnie and his wife there are at least two protracted fight scenes, extra disco dance scenes, countless parties ... Again and again, I wondered: where is the film's editor? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with all this mass, the film misses a chance to convey any real sense of fear or fear arising from the Son Sam’s threat, which is too much in the background. Lee more successfully demonstrates another threat that arises in the neighborhood with groups of warriors. <br /> <br /> Act equally well. This, combined with the disco music of the 70s and the generous attention to costumes and production design, makes you really feel that you are in the Italian-American area of ​​New York in 1977. <br /> <br /> However, the atmospheric authenticity of the film is not enough to make up for the rambling, bloated scenario about the life of extremely annoying people.
