I could not give this film a bad rating or a bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Tony Collet. The film has the potential to be a thriller, and there are some small disturbing elements that lean toward the psychological, on which the film might focus a bit. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a night DJ telling stories that face personal problems: his lover is leaving, and Gabriel has something like a narrator’s block. One day, he gets and reads a story written by a dying 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and parental abuse. He lives with his foster mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Tony Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins to be friends with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist. I will not go into details, because I do not want to spoil the film, but I will tell you the following: it is quite predictable. A fascinating atmosphere for storytelling and good performances of Robin Williams and Tony Collett, who, it seemed to me, were key characters in the film. Collette, without a doubt, one of the most talented and lovely actresses. Her ability to use the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very strange, and I hope to see how she wins the Oscar (damn, I think she could get a nod for the best supporting actress if the script was a little better) . The film begins as a psychological thriller, but predictable. If you are interested to know the ending and turns of the film, then watch the film, otherwise I would shoot another predictable thriller called “Hide and Seek”.
