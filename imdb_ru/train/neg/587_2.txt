This film distinguishes itself from the mediocre documentary “The Miracle of the Human Body”, boldly, albeit strangely, deciding to sicken the viewer. In one scene, the camera approaches a giant 50-foot pimple when a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of him. In another case, the chamber is submerged in a swamp with half digested food and stomach acid, when parts of pasta salad fall from the esophagus and fall into sticky liquid. In the final round of power, the camera sends the viewer on a painful journey through the forest ... teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately, I did not invent anything. Watch this film if necessary, but: bring your vomit bag and don't eat pasta salad beforehand.
