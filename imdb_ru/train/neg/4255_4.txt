The film begins with a beautiful lady in tattered white clothes running through a stereotypical Eastern European city. we know that something follows her because she continues to look after her. and soon we see that she is being pursued by a mysterious man in a black cloak. then we understand that this man is actually a vampire hunter, and he is chasing her. but look, what is her reflection in the shop window ??? no, it's just her identical twin vampire! but unfortunately they both get it. <br /> <br /> after this brilliant and surprisingly funny return to the old films of hammers of the 60s and 70s (in the credits twins are indicated as evil twins, which, of course, is the name of the last part in the Karnstein Hammer trilogy) pretty much dying. <br /> <br /> The fact that there is a small plot includes Dracula (which conveniently changes its appearance every time it is reborn, so the manufacturer doesn’t need to hire the same Dracula again) to come to the morgue, students -Medics understand that he is undead and think ... wow, what a possibility, maybe I just ignore all these films that say that drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and use vampire blood to find a cure for our disease idiot obviously, this is a mistake, and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> New concept, but terribly torn out of hand. The film continues to create amazing situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, medical students are trying to bring the fight back to life by placing it in a bath filled with blood in a secluded traveling country. mansion The house itself is scary enough to be in the center of the film, but will we stay there? No, because they decided to take the vampire to an abandoned pool. sigh. In this film, there is a real problem with “honors,” as I mentioned earlier, before the initial scene came straight from the hammer, and this home scene would be ideal for a movie like a hammer, but the film quickly shifts gears and turns into a medical horror <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they introduce so many characters that it’s almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them. There are medical students and their “friend”, similar to a wheelchair professor, all medical students: arrogant, boring, hungry for money and stupid. how they got into medical school simply amazes me, unless the medical school was supposed to fit its large amount of muscle mass. and then there is a vampire hunter who remains mysterious in the film. hey, I can respect this, but it would be nice if they didn't set it up like a movie about him. then you have random priests, policemen, and learned types. so many people introduce themselves, and then are quickly forgotten, until they need this person to either save the day or jump out for a cheap fright, which quickly becomes tedious. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a lazy movie. No real scares, just a few predictable jumps. Customization for them is so complicated that it is fun. For example, a bath full of blood. it's so obvious that fights will pop out of dark blood. and yet we have to wait too long to get to the inevitable scare jump. after that he kills one of the stupid and big medical students with breasts. we all know that she will become one of the undead. but what do others do? bury her in a shallow grave near the house. take a breath so you know who will jump on you when the cops appear in the house .......... <br /> <br /> Oh well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will take a hint that it’s impossible to make a scary movie about vampires and just be in the atmosphere, and then we will get a whole movie that is as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
