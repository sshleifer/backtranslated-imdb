Horrible game, bad storyline, cheesy makeup, and this is only the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen the worst movie in my life, after 5 minutes I decided to rewind to see if something redemptive happened ... It is not. (In addition to a good shot in the chest) The film, apparently, was shot at some furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the shooting sites. You even see this red chair in several different “places”. If you are going to make a film, at least rent an office building and an apartment, and not some kind of warehouse that resonates with the dialogue of your actor. A small office space and a flat for a month are much cheaper than a whole warehouse, and both are more versatile and believable) If you spend your money on renting these people, I hope you get it with a return guarantee ... you will demand your money back ... I spent only $ 2.99 to rent this tonight, and I feel ripped off.
