It has been said several times, and last but not least, that watching a film by Eric Rohmer is like watching a paint dry; it seems that Monsieur Romer is outraged by this (he does not deny it, but then as he could, he just takes offense at this) so much that his new film, which may also be his last, “Allah Allah”, is set so far back time, which seems like a dry observation. Those wonderful people who gave you Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema, have already called it one of the best films of 2007, so this should give you some idea. Reality is not on the agenda of Romer, so in the 5th century in France, in one extreme case, there was a castle that would not be out of place in the Loire Valley, while the only other dwelling we see is rough wooden hut. Nymphs and shepherds are involved in the story, and, as he often does, Romer shot her with unknown people who were just passing by, so the overall effect is that the annual school game at a school for students with special needs was filmed on tape . Someone almost feels like saying: “Come back, Godard, everything is forgiven,” but even this sad statement cannot make me say these words.
