I'm sad to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors, locations and genres, that is, with Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC, and a political thriller, but “The Sentinel” is actually very low. As if they had a great idea, they signed the right cast and took some great city shots, and then took a vacation, allowing the rest of the team to improvise the rest. And I would like to blame for this yet another tasteless performance of Basinger (I not only feel that she is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I still feel more than ten years later that she was the only one and definitely the only bad actor the film to win an acting Oscar for "LA Confidential".) But she was not the only problem. Sutherland, whom I love as Jack Bauer on '24', plays Jack again. I miss his old days "Time to kill" or "A few good people." Douglas definitely took a break in acting and called it. Plot: Someone, some traitor to the Secret Service, wants the president to die, and Douglas (accidentally) substituted. Does anyone believe him? In fact, there is no spoiler here: as soon as they come up with this section halfway, it's over before you know it. And why did someone (and) want the president to die? Will it be shown in the sequel? Too many holes in the plot, too many doors open and never close and too predictable "Guardian." If you watch only one film per year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who is familiar with these types of films or even saw only one episode of Law and Order will be recognized in the first few shots. It was terrible? Not really, the cinematography was good, and despite the fact that Sutherland played Jack again, he still got it.
