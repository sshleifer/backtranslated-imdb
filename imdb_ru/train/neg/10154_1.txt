how this movie could have 5.5 this movie was a piece of skunk with ** t. At first, the actors were really bad, I mean the chainsaw, Charlie was so backward. because at the very beginning, when he poked his head into a wooden hut (it turned out to be about 1 quarter of an inch thick (it is really cheap, like a fragile piece of wood), and he didn’t even think he could cut it, threw it) , the person who made the set sucks like * when delivering things for them to build with. the only good thing about this movie is the idea of ​​this tv. show. Bottom line: DO NOT spend your hard-earned money on this piece, which they call the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0.3
