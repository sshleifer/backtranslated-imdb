This summer I looked forward to various sci-fi and thriller films, but I was very disappointed with this film. While some people came out of the film, I decided to stay, only to laugh with other moviegoers at acting, lack of expectation, a ridiculous ending and a difficult story line to understand. I was almost as confused as the main character of the film. The only film redemptive quality was the soundtrack. This is one of those promising star films that they later regret. Looking back, I wouldn't even rent this one, let alone pay more than $ 5 to watch.
