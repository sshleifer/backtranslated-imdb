Washington Square is a flat, shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of masterpieces of James. Moreover, his simple, hopeless story seems inappropriate to turn it into a film (although William Wyler with his "Heir" in 1949 gave an excellent version of the novel). <br /> <br /> In any case, the film completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, but nevertheless she is a healthy, intelligent young woman, and she is not as naive as it may seem. Her attachment to her father is worthy and respectful, without any painful sides. For three quarters of the film, Katherine (Jennifer Jason Lee) seems mentally retarded, poor thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) becomes smart, realizing her dignity as women and all that. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland added two vulgar scenes to this story. First, when Catherine has a nervous child, well, problems with her vesicles. The second scene, when we see in the background a kind of brothel under the open sky, where prostitutes pick up their clients for tents and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is known that the writer was extremely decent and modest, even by the standards of the Victorian era. I challenge anyone who finds any kind of rudeness anywhere on thousands of pages of the great literary work of James. I was really particularly annoyed by these two scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the director needs reasonable freedom to adapt the novel. But if the director completely ignores or misunderstands the art of the author (here Henry James), I see no reason to use his work to create a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is adequate to the film: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. Washington Square is definitely not a recommended movie.
