Over the course of several years of searching for half decent movies that can be rented for my children, I developed a sixth sense to notice truly audacious, direct-to-video efforts that really hurt to experience (for anyone over eight). I threw the ball at this one, and the children spent half of the movie, asking me "why did she say that?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes hurt from scrolling them every minute or so, since the characters really did not do well with seemingly random plot changes. And the next time someone decides that the lack of a sword skill is simply “bringing realism” to the film, follow him using a blunt butter knife. "Prehysteria!" was a cut above it. Arrgh.
