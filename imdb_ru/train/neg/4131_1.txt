This film should be nominated for a new genre: a complete mess! With the exception of a few giggles and one or two bloody scenes, this film is a waste of time. Calling it "Campi" does not even mean. "Campi" means fun, which was not in this film. You spend the first half of the movie thinking, “It should get better, right?”. In fairness, this is so, at the very end, when it is finally explained who such “brother / sister” is and what they want, but by that time you don’t care, because you are wondering what the second half of the film is, what exactly is Mr. Onorati and Miss Pakula were made to strongly remove someone from IT to get stuck in such a terrible film. <br /> <br />
