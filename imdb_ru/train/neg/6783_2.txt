It seems that there are surprisingly many reviews from 8 to 10 stars from people who have never written an IMDb review before or after. Given the very low average rating given to a film by other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I admit it, I thought the concept was pretty sweet, and I was glad to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony on Angel, getting work, but it didn't take long for the sheer horror of this film to make itself known. <br /> <br /> Acting: the leaders seemed competent enough, but everyone else? Awful. <br /> <br /> Story: A shelf with holes large enough to drive through a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: does not exist. <br /> <br /> Humor: Do they really think that people will laugh? Oh boy <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK. there were really beautiful women in this movie. Not just the three main female characters, but right across the board. As if the producers were hoping that the scenery would be so distracting to the male audience that they would not notice how terrible everything else was. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hands, this could be a pretty, but darkly ridiculous camp classic. It was not even close.
