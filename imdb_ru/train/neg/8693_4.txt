I am from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and have lived in Arlington for several years. This film is far from looking like Arlington. I saw the mountains in the background of one scene! Texas has no mountains. I guess this happens when the film, which is supposed to be in Texas, was shot in Canada. Accents are also very bad. They had to get actors from Texas to play the roles. In Hollywood, many novice actors from Texas. The film is really sad because it is a true story. I pray that the murderer will be found and condemned. One good thing is that before her death, we now have Amber Alert to help quickly find missing children after their abduction.
