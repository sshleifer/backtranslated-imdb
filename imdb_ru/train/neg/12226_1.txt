I know, I know, Plan 9 from Space - the worst movie, or maybe Manos, Hands of Destiny. But I can't mess with these monkey movies. Of course, they are bad. How can they be good? But if you are talking about films with respectable production value and a talented bank, then T. rex of all turkeys should be “Yentl”. All insidious deceitfulness, all self-confidence, stained everything that Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, culminates in this film. From his lonely peak of horror, "Yentl" looks back at "The Star Is Born" and at "The Mirror with Two Faces". There is nothing more like this. What emotional roll back Streisand pulled to make this film, I would prefer not to speculate, and what audience she played, I can not imagine, although I bet that the likelihood that you are not a member of it is nine out of ten. /> <br /> Nobel laureate and saint keeper of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged that Streisand did with his story that he publicly cursed it. This is a tribute to the incomprehensible vulgarity of Streisand, that she not only did not commit suicide, but also continued to make more horrible films.
