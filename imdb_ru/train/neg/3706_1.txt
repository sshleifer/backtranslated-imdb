I thought that the whole joke of the film would be to see some rich white guy playing the role of Chris Rock, and then see how Chris Rock reacts to people's reaction. Instead, you just see Chris Rock himself, and people don't understand him. Perhaps there are 2 scenes in the whole movie where they use their trick. It should have been much better.
