TV pilots, you do not like them? Quinn Martin tried out this film after having achieved success in a bunch of other detective television films, but this film does not go anywhere except in the area of ​​the MST to which it belongs. Roy Tinnes - Diamond Head, who receives an order from Aunt Mary to find Super Spy Lovejoy, I mean Three. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much more. The tree is a bad guy, despite all his disguises, because of which he looks just like usual. There is more unnatural fiber clothing than you can imagine (this was required in the 1970s), and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why it did not go to the series? You understand, it's pretty brazen. Again this is fun for MST, but not much more !!
