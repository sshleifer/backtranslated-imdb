Pet Sematary, although a good 80s horror film, with a good director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian film ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King copied almost all the ideas of this director (the film "Zeder" was made before King wrote the book). <br /> <br /> Cat, earth, everything was copied, this is a case of plagiarism But, being Stephen Kind a famous American writer, it’s quite normal that he can get away with it, obviously, this is due to the huge difference between the films of this type of Italians without a “budget” (and partly this is shit in itself ...) but the original idea, I repeat, is Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
