** SPOILERS BELOW !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever pays tribute to me THE Worst Movie of the Year ... which I have seen. This movie is GARBAGE right! There are so many bad things in the movie that you can't help wondering how bad it is. This film had so much potential to be good, but ultimately did nothing. The characters were as stupid as possible; for the whole movie you just ask yourself "why are you doing this?" or "what is your goal?" ... that's how illogical and stupid characters are. We have nothing to do with them, so naturally you really don’t give the rats anything for their fate ... you can only laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> For example, “whore” (Marcy) ... was she so excited that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in it ... it’s almost as if the filmmakers needed an excuse to give her a virus, now! Ugh. <br /> <br /> - Does anyone really go into the woods and drink tap water from the cabin, WITHOUT Looking first? <br /> <br /> - Why didn't Bert shoot the patient? from the very beginning? The movie would have ended like this ... besides, they still killed him. <br /> <br /> - Why did they decide so long to finally leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? “No, I’ll just wait until my two friends get infected (one moment from death) to finally get out of there. <br /> <br /> - What exactly was the reason for Paul's attempts to catch fish from the Hermit's body, only to get into a polluted body of water and get infected with a virus? Pure stupidity! <br /> <br /> I swear common sense was not a friend, much less familiar with these idiots. I don't think that was the worst ending movie ever. At first the children ask the cashier in the store what this rifle is for, and he replies that "this is for the blacks." At the end of the film, 3 young blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag, no less) go to the store .... come to find out that the cashier cleaned them for use for hunting. Then he continues to give them all the pounds and handshakes and joke with them, as if they are his home boys. <br /> <br /> Well, what the hell was the point of this?!?!?!? How tasteless could be what the filmmakers thought to put into the film? I, like the Negro, of course, was offended by the original Niger commentary. It was a tasteless, meaningless remark. My question to the filmmakers: what's the point of ending with black children? Did it make me forget the original racist comment made earlier? To smooth out the relationship with black audiences, making fun of it? Well, for example, I did not find this pathetic attempt at humor to be ridiculous. The whole film was a joke ... A PATHIC attempt at filmmaking that should not be given during the day. Did Peter Jackson really think this film was so good? What movie did he watch? <br /> <br /> ZERO * of **** stars .... if I could give it a lower rating, I would. Please, friends IMDb'ery, do not spend an hour and a half of your precious life on watching this filth of the "movie". This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
