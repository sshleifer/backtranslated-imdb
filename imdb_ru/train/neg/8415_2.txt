Dreamgirls follows the path of Chinese water torture in the form of endless musical montages, trashy games and poor director choices. (Seriously, Mr. Condon, do you MUST do old Billboard counts? See how it goes up the charts, and here’s a passing Billboard ad to show you again .... and again .... and again)
