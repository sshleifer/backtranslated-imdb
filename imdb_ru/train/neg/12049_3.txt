The box that says “To Die For” has fallen into me - a reckless guy and a promise of laughter and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Arkley (Simon), who was light in the eyes, but did not laugh and was a little sexy. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, were supposedly together for several years, but not a single character is interesting enough to take care of, so it’s hard to imagine that they care about each other. The error seems to lie in the script, and not in the performances; both actors do everything they can to give. <br /> <br /> The ending is juicy and unsuccessful (well, not completely without result; I felt relieved that it was all over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a funny movie about gay relationships and AIDS, “parting” is much better.
