I just saw it in 2006 at the Vancouver International Film Festival. The synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to check it out. I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that I wrote poorly, it was boring. I will not take away from the actors, because with this bad scenario they can do little. <br /> <br /> The first bite was a clich√©, but not irony, but seriousness, not funny. The film would be better if Hunt Ho went with a sense of horror. Instead, he took himself seriously, and this led to a boring film. I can not recommend this movie. It was too long and generally just weak.
