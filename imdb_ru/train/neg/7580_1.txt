It was a terrible movie. In fact, Jane March was a North Korean North Korean spy that Kim Jong Il sent to do something terrible for American troops in South Korea. She becomes a servant in the American military family, they all consider her brisket, although she looks whiter (I think the actress is 1/4 or 1/8 of Southeast Asians, not Korean) and a teenager. families start to hate her and end up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the US military are depicted in Korea is completely insane. Of course, the screenwriter and director were obviously white men who had never spent a single day in Korea before this film and were not going to show any real outlook on life in Korea either for Koreans or American soldiers, but instead simply tried fulfill their pitiful aziophile fantasies without any relation to how incredible he made the film. Anyone who has ever been to Korea will know that this is complete trash. In the end, the North Korean spy Honhel is killed in the obvious way of "paying for his sins." A very bad movie made especially for television.
