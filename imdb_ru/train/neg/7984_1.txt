Too many secondary storylines without primary. Too many hot buttons are pressed without any reason, they managed to fill this boring film that says nothing, with all the elements of drama that are there: death, divorce, problems with money, problems with parents, suicide, psychological problems, abuse drugs, adoption, refusal of love, problems with traveling, sex, misunderstanding of generations, robbery, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, “true deep love” ?? You might think that it would make an interesting film, but damn it, no ?? all these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention the fact that the “super-deep” (and super-long) lecture for the child at the end of the film is complete nonsense. It's a pity. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention: the actors, they are all pretty good. This is what kept me from turning off. Too bad that their talents were wasted, the film is also well shot: light, movement, etc. Each episode is all in place. It is just a value that is missing.
