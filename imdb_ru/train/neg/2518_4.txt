Think of a darker version of one of these children's shows, such as Power Rangers, and you have this 1990 film Robot Jocks. The film, where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena, and the one who comes out of his country wins. The robots are huge and look like a few better versions of those that were on these shows, mainly because they are less colorful, therefore, although this film is not very good, itâ€™s not so bad to watch. As I recall, in this battle there are two fights with robots, one of which ends badly, and the final fight is over. In the process of identifying a traitor, the plot rotates, but in the end the plot is nothing that stays with you for a certain period of time after the creation of the picture. The fights themselves are like gigantic toys in a frenzy, but it's still somewhat fun to watch. This film would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices, such as giant robots and a tournament. So it is worth checking once, but probably no more.
