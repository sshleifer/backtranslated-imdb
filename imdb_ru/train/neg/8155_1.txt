I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles (for example, “Goodwill Hunt”, “Fisher King”, “Garp World”). These are my favorite movies about Robin Williams. But “Grab the Day,” although well-played, is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and certainly the worst movie of Robin Williams (even worse than Death of Smoochy, Club Paradise, and Aladdin on ice ”). <br /> br /> Every good story will have its ups and downs. This film, however, is one giant down. I don't need a nice Hollywood cheese festival, but I have to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and complete hopelessness. This film reminds me of “Love Liza” (which is actually worse), because it seems that the only purpose of the film is to see how far one person can fall. Answer? What's the difference.
