I am shocked that there are people who liked this film ... I saw it on Tribeca, and most of the viewers laughed at him in scenes that were not supposed to be funny. I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience, but, frankly, the plot for this film needed a MAJOR revision ... it didn't even make sense, for one second the characters ask themselves what exactly they sniff ... Scene they hopelessly addicted and figure out how to do it ?? In addition, the ending just took the cake ... I'm not going to spoil a great conclusion ... but it pretty much blends in with the rest of the horrible story / script ... watch this movie for a comedy, if necessary ...
