Thank God, it was blown up, or we could enjoy pleasures such as Skate Fu, where we can see how Brian Boytano performs triple loot and chops bad guys into ribbons with his razor-sharp skates, but I digress. One thing that could help this turkey would be a little T & A from Miss Agbayani. This is not how the world would see anything new (at least the part of the world that saw its Playboy spread.) I really believe that porn would have suited her “talents” much better, although Aubrey Hepburn could not stay afloat this sewer. One explanation for the presence of Kurt Thomas could be a traumatic brain injury, perhaps due to too frequent a failure in haste. It is good that the IOC was not so diligent in doing "doping" as it is now, otherwise Kurt would probably have been deprived of medals. Avoid at all costs.
