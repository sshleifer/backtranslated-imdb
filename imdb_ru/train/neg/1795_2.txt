I had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of the test audience, and the only thing that kept me in place was the ability to fill out a survey after watching. I felt that the biggest problem of the film was the lack of a main plot. Instead, it consisted of (too) a large number of sites competing for the screen. As a result, there is not a single character that is sufficiently developed for the audience to form any kind of affection. What the director and producer couldn't do was show us why we need to take care of what happens to the characters. In fact, any subplot and characters associated with it could be removed altogether without serious damage to the film. (The time won would allow the development of much-needed plots and characters.) Simply put, the hungry bachelor club's plate is overflowing with side dishes and snacks when a snack is required.
