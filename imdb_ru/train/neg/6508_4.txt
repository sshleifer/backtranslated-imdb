This is a breakdown of the old Frankenstein background. The famous scientist died as a result of a strange accident, and his father, a famous surgeon, saves the brain. It is then placed in a robotic body of its own design. His brother, an electrician genius, gives the "colossus" an impetus for the transfer of thoughts into motion. The whole project fails when the creation goes berserk. <br /> <br /> No special effects have been developed. The script is missing. And it's funny that it's not a bit scary. Well, very young children will think it is good. If you are awake at three in the morning, and it begins .... at night, at night. <br /> <br /> The main characters are Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolf played the Colossus.
