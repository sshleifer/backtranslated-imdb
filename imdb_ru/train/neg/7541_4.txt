great mystery, but from there the film goes down the slope. The start is a car accident, and the woman and her daughter are burned alive in front of police officer Edward. He is injured because of this and is noticed that pills appear. A mysterious letter appears from an old friend asking for help to find her missing daughter. Thus, Ed travels around an island commune consisting mainly of women. They do not like strangers. Lots of filler when Ed shows around the city looking for a girl. This made the movie too long. Finally, the end gets a little better when we learn about the crazy rituals that a woman performs, and finally, about the sinister plan being prepared for Edward. <br /> <br /> In general, the story is not very well written and too long. <br /> <br /> FINAL DECLARATION: I would have missed it.
