Jean-Claude Van Damme is trying to save his career by creating a sequel to the Universal Soldier. But this film saved him? I think he goes to hell after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute we see the inside of the object, where you can see the bad guy from the movie. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the action (details follow). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme with a dark-skinned girl (I don’t remember the name .... well, in any case, it doesn’t matter) trying to escape from some muscular men. Of course, they are the new Universal Soldiers. More muscle, less brain (like in the movies). After some time, Van Damme fights with Goldberg, but then the “mission” is interrupted. It was just a test (This is a film for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme is working for the government on the new project “Universal Soldier” (who saw the first film might think that this is the most illogical thing that the character of young Van Damms could do). But this is a sequel. And the "story" must come up. Oh, I forgot. He has a daughter. It is very important for the "history". <br /> <br /> In 20 minutes the supercomputer will hear a conversation about its completion and exit from the project. Of course, the cube is angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the object, BUT the computer sends several soldiers hunting him (He wants Van Damme to be a soldier - because he is the best (right?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters who has always been a stupid suggestion to the audience before he was offended. Funny? Yes, like the whole movie. <br /> <br /> After some “story”, Van Damme tries to save his daughter (from his wife, the reporter in the first film). It came to the final show where Van Damme fights with Bad Boy, and you can see the most expensive scene of the entire film (please see for yourself. It's too funny to say). <br /> <br /> You will see that this film is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So don't watch it. But if you do, keep a bag with you!
