Watching "Croco", I would really like to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this film: flat main characters - absolutely no development, for example. Kroko is a metaphorical German problem child who remains a pure metaphor without any capacity for positive participation, despite several plot chances to do so. Not inspired actors, not developing plot. I assume that the film tried to conduct an environmental survey, but to no avail: the camera seemed shaky, not motivated. The pictures were low contrast, gray and dark - I'm sure that intentionally, but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social environment. However, the story had a certain potential, it could be a good story.
