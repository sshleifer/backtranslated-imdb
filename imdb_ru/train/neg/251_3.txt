I was so excited to see this movie, finally reading a book this week. My 13-year-old son was also looking forward to it. I rented it and snuggled in to enjoy the classic holiday story brought to life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This film deviated from the book more than excusable. George S. Scott is a great actor, but in this he seemed to be completely in character only 20% of the time. The rest of the time it was rather flat. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was done in the 84th, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked like a very high-quality B-movie, especially a meeting with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left one of the most touching parts of the story: “The Spirit of the Spirit”. A Christmas gift sends Scrooge on a world tour of the world, observing people in the darkest circumstances who still feel the light and love of Christmas. <br /> <br /> I admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "reformed Scrooge" at the end. It was a refreshing image. <br /> <br /> I would like Bob Cratchit to be a little more ragged And Tini Tim ... oh, don't even turn me on to bad child actors ...
