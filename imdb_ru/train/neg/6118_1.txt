This is not a very good description of the epic of Tarzan. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to boast of his beautiful wife! Bo Derek at "10" was at least a humorous film, and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than soft porn. If you like it, then transfer to it and skip everything else! This film (like Bolero) again became for Bo Derek a means to show his terrible game. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but her poster is more exciting than this film! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; it was one of his few mistakes! don't waste your time on this movie ... buy a book instead.
