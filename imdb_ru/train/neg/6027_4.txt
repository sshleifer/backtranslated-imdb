I grew up as a Baptist and I know the story that this film is trying to tell, although I no longer believe this story. I pay tribute to the film for being as good as a regular movie of the week for a lifetime. A softly interesting, mediocre game, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is juicy, and it is a little melodramatic. And all the remaining people should be the most ugly pure non-Christians. Not a single curse from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man running the United Nations said “nuclear” as “nu-lur-leur” like Bush. Is there some kind of Christian code of honor that obliges Bush to say that he too is called by God, that all Christians must hide their ignorance by incorrectly pronouncing this word just like him? LOL! After that, it was really hard for me to take the film seriously. After the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the film began to be felt as packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. In fact, I was looking for something that would make me think, but I did not find it here. If you are looking for meaningless entertainment, stop here - it's good to kill on a rainy day. But if you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
