I have seen this film many times (and recently read the book on which the film is based), and every time I see it, I just want to slap all four of them. The fact that they have nothing to do with the fact that Tom Hank’s character switches to his D & D (M & M ops) character :) (“Oh, he just plays the role of character”) outside the game session. This and the fact that after three months of therapy, let's just destroy all of this and feed it with delusion! It is these people who give the role-playing games a bad name. <br /> <br /> In addition, the banal "love ballad" and music "Cat on the piano" and "Stop us if we are too annoying" is almost enough to put the teeth on the edge!
