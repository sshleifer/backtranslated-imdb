I hate this show! Has there ever been at least one redeeming quality, one amusing highlight, or one storyline that “did not” make the ordinary viewer drown in a bowl with wet cornflakes? <br /> <br /> Voices. Oh, those terrible, pitiful voices. It is akin to repeatedly dragging a set of thin cutlery across a dusty board, each character is clearly annoying with his ability to piercing nose vocals. Cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel, Vicki sounds like a stereotypical obstinate, and Timmy's dad makes every line sound like a bad imitation of the host of a game show (Guy Smiley comes to mind from Sesame Street). <br /> <br /> The animation is terrible; even the producers "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at a terribly bad illustration on this show. Each character has fangs, a square head, or a head three sizes larger than his body. And what about the fact that the characters speak every line with wide eyes and grin, as if they are posing for a photo shoot with the president? Then, there is the fact that every character in the show is completely moron. Since the refined grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson and Buddy Lembeck, from the fame of “Charles in Response”, did not depict the characters so unrealistically stupid. Usually “unreal” is synonymous with “not funny,” and this is most definitely the case here. Since the “Naked Gun 33 1/3”, there have not been so many farces based on ignorance ... and at least Leslie Nilsson was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the show (and this is the same in every episode, so much attention to the spoiler here): Timmy wants something with his two “Honestly Parents”, something goes wrong, there is always some far-fetched reason why he cannot immediately change course and wish for damage, and then everything works out just fine in the end. Yes, and note, Timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about wiki, and continue to use it at every opportunity. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that a children's show containing a subtle message that it says almost nothing about an abusive babysitter is probably not a good idea. <br /> <br /> If you are writing an article and want to give an example of how much the quality of cartoons has plummeted, “Perfect Strange Parents” should be a great start. A vivid example of how producers assemble a useless product aimed at children without much effort, simply because they know that someone will look at it somewhere.
