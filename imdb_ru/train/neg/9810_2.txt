It’s hard to criticize this film because I don’t like the story itself, and no good acting would save it. Think "Raising Arizona" with a middle lane. The action is quite bearable, but Jennifer Tilly, as usual, is confused (although this is not enough to make this good film about the camp), being somewhere between “Unhappiness” and a sarcastic employee of DMV. The rest of the actors eyebrows are constantly connected in horror, either from the tension of their parts, or from the tension of the whole useless exercise. A real humiliating few hours of film. Darryl Hannah spends most of the film crying too much to be understood. I would like to tell you how it ended, but I went out, sorry.
