I do not understand this. The film is clearly a good budget. He has very good cinematography. It has a good tempo, good editing and pretty good guidance as well. Then WHY OWH, WHY they didn't hire someone to do the final script correspondence so that it wasn't damn stupid, and WHY, WHY, WHY they hired such lousy actors who can't get out of a paper bag This movie could be good. In most cases, it looks good and VERY good, but in the end, you understand that the film was not good at all. <br /> <br /> So I would say that this is a good movie, but a bad one. Pity really. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come alone, really!
