De Niro Scorsese's worst collaboration in this terrible agonizing mess. Scorsese is absolutely not in his element in this film with horror, suddenly a loud ringing of the telephone and slamming door tricks that seem ridiculous and embarrassing from such a master. The cast here is completely in vain, and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Nolte plays the most stupid lawyer in history who believes he can protect anyone! The psychotic of Bowden De Niro is nothing more than a typical psycho-killer from the 90s movie. The scene with De Niro and Lewis in the early stages is very awkward, and the climax continues and continues, and we should all be more than tired of the psycho-persecutor who will never die. One of my worst movie impressions. Rent the original 100 times better. <br /> <br />
