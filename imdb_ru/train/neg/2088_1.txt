What a terrible show. Science fiction fans seem to be watching something more regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional, such as Firefly, lasts one season, and garbage, like a remake of Battlestar Galactica, spawns. This side effect is pitiful in all aspects of the show. The game is young and boring. Characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything that has ever been in a bad science fiction series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than a prime time soap opera. The direction is crappy and the sets are terrible. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and effort. This is one answer that should never have been made.
