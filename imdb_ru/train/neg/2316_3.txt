For many years, reading about how good this film is, as he introduced Ruiz among French critics (especially the crowds of Snoopers Kayers), when I finally watched him about a year ago, I found him rather disappointing (but I think my expectations were exorbitant ). Filmed in rich black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for television, and, fortunately, just an hour), is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator when they reflect on a series of paintings ( ) and try to find out if they contain any clues about a hidden political crime. (The horrible Kate Beckinsale Uncovered movie has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot about this film in reviews, but I would say that almost any Borges story is more interesting than this movie.
