Solve yourself. Personally, I found it as fun as getting a spine from Stevie Wonder. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's a comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two options to look after your children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drink vendors, were ordered to instruct two children from a development center run by Gail Sweeney (Jane Lynch) to avoid imprisonment. One of the losers is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a fifth-grader with dirty lips, and the other is Ogi (Christopher Mintz-Plass), a shy young man who plays in a fantastic medieval world. Wheeler and Danny are desperate to give their charges an invaluable insight into life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with her dry analogies of wit.
