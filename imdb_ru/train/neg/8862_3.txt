From the moment Christopher Lee puts on punk-style sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know that you have a nasty spirit in your hands! This film had potential. Under the whole draft there are remnants of what could be turned into a decent film, if not an interesting one. However, the final product is a real mess. In addition to unreasonable nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II turns out to be a ridiculous excuse for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives him credibility, but even he cannot raise him above the level of crap. <br /> <br /> Never having seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to take him face to face. The value of the fact that this is a true continuation of the events in the first part. We start at the funeral of one of the characters from the original, and in the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes who are ready to fight with the werewolf coven. The film is moving quite well, and there are not many dead spots. Action there; it's just not filmed well. One of the highlights is the music of a punk band called Babel. Although their song sounds quite often, it is quite catchy. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of problems with this film. Firstly, acting is worse than pitiful. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that’s it. The two main characters, Rab Brown and Annie Macinroy, lack almost everything you would want for such characters. The letter is miserable, editing is unnecessary, and the direction is amateur. There are a couple of good special effects tricks, but cheese chees away weigh them in quantity. Sybil Dunning is a pleasure to watch, but her acting is less than satisfactory. Judd Omen looks like the role he plays, but his voice and actions are not convincing, to say the least. Most of the dialogue is conducted in an incomprehensible language, which may or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea of ​​this story. I always enjoy the stories of true believers who fight against seemingly invincible forces of evil. One scene in which a small group of good guys walk through a dark forest and shoot a bunch of werewolves, even exciting. View. Perhaps a larger budget or better director could make the rest of the film more attractive. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog. <br /> <br /> Note: at the time of this writing, the censors on youtube.com have not yet removed the final credits from the Sybil Dunning ribing. from its top several times while the song Babel! Catch while you can!
