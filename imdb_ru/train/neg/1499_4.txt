Tourists travel to Ireland for a school trip to learn about the druids. What they encounter is a horrible story about cannibal killers. <br /> <br /> If I were to sum up the Evil Breed, it would be a low-grade celebration of blood. The film combines Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn all in one. It's bad that there are so many inconsistencies in the film to track down that he loses any “fun” that could be watched. There are a lot of random "horrors" nudity in the film ... although the film also stars four porn stars, YUP four, so there may have been a lot more. The breed also exhibits a good amount of blood. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a terrible start, with a ridiculous dialogue and terrible game. This is given in the horror film straight to the video, but it is not. I can not understand who the main character is, as one woman who “lives” at the end is not so much in the film. Speaking of the ending, this should be one of the most random and fake endings in the history of the film. It does not make sense with the rest of the film and completely changes the view of the film. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie to believe it, because there are quite beautiful scenes of death. I remember two deadly scenes, one of which is an inbred killer pulling out the gut of a naked woman through her breast ... yes, her breast, do not ask me. Another identifier is when a guy gets his intestines, yet again, torn through his ass. Does it kill a guy? No, the killer continues to choke the guy with his guts. These scenes remind me very much of Dead-Alive, each of which has the right amount of humor. I also felt the Evil Dead, with meaningless references to horror films and Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when a female character in the closet screams about her life, and the killer is desperately trying; y to enter. <br /> <br /> Although there is not enough blood and nudity for film quality for poor audio and visual perception. When the teacher gets out of bed and descends the stairs, her steps are so loud and heavy that it seems that she was wearing boots. Really distracting. Like the succession in a movie with one inbred killer? And also which character dies at what point. I could not say whether Jenny was a breast implant chick or Gary's sister / cousin ... I do not remember. Like a random nude chick with a dead baby hanging on her body, still attached to the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> Awful editing is also distracting, the opening credits are too fast and disorienting. He really had a bad start, and he got better, but the final simply returns the film to a terrible level. If there were better production values ​​and more faith in this film, it would not have been horribly exterminated to death. Stay away from this movie, unless you are happy with a terrible bad movie with a decent budget and decent blood.
