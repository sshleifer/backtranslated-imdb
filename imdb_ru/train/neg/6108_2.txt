The ape-man Tarzan is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time, and, like this earlier film, it has little resemblance to the literary character of Burroughs. But while Tarzan of 1932 was shortened to a speech by Tarzan-Jane, this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keefe, does not speak or even grunts. He uttered Tarzan's cry a couple of times; it looks like he was taken from an earlier film. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan plays the role of the second banana for Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather, as the third banana for Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. There is no point in this movie except to show naked Derek. <br /> <br /> Two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad. Another evidence that no one cared. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, in this film, Tarzan has an orangutan side impact. Maybe he arrived from Sumatra with Indian elephants, which are also on display.
