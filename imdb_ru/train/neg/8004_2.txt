First let me say that the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks great, and the CGI is intelligently made. It is a pity that the rest of the film causes such disappointment, <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /> <br /> From the opening scene that we we can see that this film is anti-American, usually this kind of stereotypes would not bother me (we, the British, get enough from Hollywood), but there’s nothing subtle about making Americans stupid jerks. It goes through a point of realism, and your left wonders if Yankee raped the director’s mother. <br /> <br /> The terrible scene was really poor, and the part of the film where it starts to fall. <br /> <br /> Here we meet the Olympic medalist Auntie and a drunken uncle, who enter the memorial and start accusing the father of his daughter's death, and then beat him before they all cry on the floor. This is hardly a realistic connection during a crisis! <br /> <br /> All viral nonsense is ridiculous. If Americans know that there is no virus, why do they spend time, money, and resources on investigating? A US government agent orders a brainwave of an innocent Korean, making Americans look evil (or stupid), it was not helped by the fact that this guy had a cross-eyed comic effect. <br /> <br /> A film about a monster hunt. US and Korean special forces are instructed to find a creature, although they are invisible throughout the film. The only people who hunt a monster in all of Korea are the main family and the occasional tramp who appears at the end to save the day! Naturally, several American / Korean agents try to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> Sister was only included in the film so that she could make a vital shot at the end. It was a cliché, you knew that it was going to happen, but, even worse, she really messed things up to that part! and my last annoyance, how the hell did this kid survive at the end? the monster swam with his head under water for about 5 minutes! why the monster did not eat children in the first place?
