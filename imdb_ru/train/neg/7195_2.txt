Disney did it again. The company, in which "Mr. Magu" and "George of the Jungle" were filmed, made another film, which almost does not look like the cartoon on which it is based, and does not preserve the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and the film about its existence might have been a dream then. Now that this film exists, I was very disappointed, even outraged. <br /> <br /> First we have characters. <br /> <br /> The gadget itself has gadgets that made him such a funny character in an original cartoon (with well-done special effects accompanying them), and he even has some of the naivety of the original Gadget, but he is now more competent and the crime is expected to resolve on its own, while Penny and the Brain are just watching. /> <br /> Penny can do little; while she played a major role in the cartoon, discovering a crime and stopping it, and sometimes being captured by agents of the MAD, it is now simply introduced and forgotten, although she, at least, sneaks into the Claw base. <br /> <Claw - a version of the film of Dr. Claw, who was a rather sinister man with a rough voice, who wore metal gloves and sat in his chair, his face was hidden from his eyes when he stroked his cat and watched various crimes. Now he is just a man with a claw for a hand, without a riddle of the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat exist in the film, but rather insignificant for him. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the cartoon were not spared in this slaughter. The famous expression "wow!" was mysteriously changed to “Wowser”, and now the Gadgetmobile gadget looks different and communicates. <br /> <br /> There are even product endorsements everywhere. Why "Yahoo!" advertised on the sign? Why are there Gadgetmobile buttons for M & M or Skittles? <br /> <br /> The cartoon fans will hate it, others may find the film below par, and when all is said and done, this film is another attempt to make some quick dollars from another old show.
