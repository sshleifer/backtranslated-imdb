This shit is like drying paint. I am so disappointed because I so wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> There’s simply no point in this movie. If this had never been done, no one would have noticed or cared. He was criticized because of all the big names in him, but if there were no one in the film, no one would give this film any love. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was at that stage when halfway through the movie I was watching Vanessa Redgrave and I thought: “Hurry and die already!” It's like “Joy Luck Club” without any damn joy. This is “Ocean, 13” (nothing but a loud cast) of films about mothers and daughters, and absolutely anti-climatic ... oh, until everything ends. <br /> <br /> I’m sure they’ll all be nominated for an Oscar ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to take part in this junk.
