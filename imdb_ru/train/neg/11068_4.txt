Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer, tangled movie. Of course, I had a few bottles of beer while watching the movie, but this does not explain why I am so bored because of this movie. <br /> <br /> His memories are confusing and annoying, and no real storyline from the beginning and the end, the only thing that made sense in the film was the explanation of the text at the beginning and at the very end of the movie. The intermediate material that the film will be is just boring images and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see the real killings, all just insinuations. Sometimes you even get the feeling that Dahmer is dreaming about it, but you know that this is not so because it is based on a true story, and it really happened, at least in most cases. But what happened? It is not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t encourage people to waste time on this film. I did not like it, and I felt deceived when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
