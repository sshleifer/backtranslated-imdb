This is one of two post-apocalyptic fantasy films made by Albert Piun in 1993 - and this is a bad movie. Apparently, all his energy went to the "Nemesis", which was an entertaining nonstop fighter and looked much more expensive. "Knights" - clumsy and trashy, fantasy, too often reminiscent of a video game (new opponents appear constantly and must be destroyed as soon as possible). The only thing that saves this film from the trash is Katie Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but certainly a brutally efficient fighting machine. As for Chris Kristofferson, given his age at the time (58), I hope his understudy was well paid. (* 1/2)
