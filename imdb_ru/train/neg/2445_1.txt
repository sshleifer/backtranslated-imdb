Hello, does anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you are one of the viewers of this film: join the fan club! This film was incredibly bad, and I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think it needs to be seen, it is bad in a good way. Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this film, but it must be in the top 10 worst films ever made.
