Obviously made to show the famous stripper of the 1950s Misty Ayers 'acting' talent. It is a pity that she can not act. <br /> <br /> A boring little story about the sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers), drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets a handsome Tommy Cole, who immediately falls in love with her. He wants to help her escape, but can he? You really don't care. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers just slowly undresses to underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little tale filled with a bad game, a cruel “comedy” (I never thought that prostitution was funny, but what do I know?), And the terrible dialogue voiced after that. I admit that a turnaround took place at the end, which I did not expect, but this is not enough to get through this. Also Ayers' attempts to act are hysterical! This bomb. Avoid.
