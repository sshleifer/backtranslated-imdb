Well, the crowd of film festivals surely enjoyed it. But your average popcorn lover, who spent ten or fifteen dollars to watch a movie these days, will probably wonder why he or she made such a choice. If it says “Copolla”, it is automatically a great material, right? Wrong! This is a neat deception of film fans. But it's awful "in." I worry when filmmakers care more about entertainment than about the public. It is interesting as a cinematic souvenir, and it has a chuckle or two. But as soon as he goes on his way to the movies and on television, the dust will accumulate on the cans with the film and the tapes in which it is stored. Hardly either epochal or epic!
