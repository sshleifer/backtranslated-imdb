I saw this bomb when it hit the cinema. I laughed all the time. What for? Because the stupidity of this seemed to make me go crazy. Looking back, I understand that in the whole film there was not ONE funny thing. At least nothing intentional. It's very funny that Lizzy is chewing a piece of nurplex and becoming a giant, carnivorous demon ... but her little little dress is completely intact, despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than when she first put it on. Or a movie in which a person can be shocked by a defiblator and only lose consciousness and return to consciousness without ANY medical care. And don't let me start with the ridiculous fate of the "villain" who, they decided, they need to create a "conflict." Yeah. <br /> <br /> To a person who complains that Disney is only persecuting children, the obscene parts of this film seem to refute this statement. Do we really need Daryl Hanna to blame Jeff Bridges for filming weird videotapes? You do this if you are Disney, and you have no idea of ​​making the film attractive to the public of eight people without writing a more intelligent script! I’m totally convinced that Disney pays for a rating board, so movies can get away with murder and still get marks for families. <br /> <br /> What a waste of DVD format.
