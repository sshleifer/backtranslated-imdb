I think the biggest disappointment in this film was that, until the very end, I expected the casting instructors to break in and apologize for how bad the cast was. When you consider a powerful plot, magnificent scenery and efforts to create beautiful scenery and impressive images, it is a shame that little attention was paid to acting. <br /> <br />
