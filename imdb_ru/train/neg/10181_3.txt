This movie is so bad, it's funny. Scott Bakula plays the role of head coach, but it doesn’t matter, the big black guy who plays 1st base is important. First, he must be at least 75 years old, but he still plays in low-league baseball, and secondly, he starts the film in the outfield, despite the fact that he cannot walk, let alone run . Bakula’s coach brilliantly encourages him to first refer to the fact that when he tries to run, he stays in the same place for too long a period of time. Backula shows a more brilliant coaching strategy at the end of the film, (SPOILER), he says to his star player “in the center” to hit a home run, clearly “in the center” regarded it as a good move. He ran to the house and won the game for his team, a team from the lower league that played the Twins, who were the main ones in the film. Now, if Tony Muser, the royal family manager, were as smart a trainer as Bakula and told his players to just make a home run at every beat, the queens would never have finished the inning, not to mention the loser.
