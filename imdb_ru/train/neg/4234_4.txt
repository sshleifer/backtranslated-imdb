This is not the best slasher movie ever, but it's pretty funny. The plot is lame, but the killings are not so bad. I have to be honest, if you do not follow the groups that are represented in this film, you will not find this film as funny as those who do. I knew someone who watched this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film, but you have to understand that it was made during the time off the road, between playing with children and drinking with friends behind the scenes. ..that is not taken seriously. This is the best cheese in its punk performance and with more than 100 murders, most of which are terribly awful, this is a funny movie for friends to watch, drink and have fun with!
