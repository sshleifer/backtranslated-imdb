This is one of the worst action films I've ever seen. This is due, in particular, to actual improbability (as, for example, an obvious agent who pretended to be a bank loan officer, while at the same time making it clear that he is talking to someone by telegraph or in a scene where scientists assume that entering the room in which the Virus was released, although “he did not find a viable host” does not mean that he will never find him), cheap sets (the bank looks like it is poorly designed to resemble a dungeon) and bad behavior. This is the story of an organized criminal group that successfully stole a capsule of a deadly virus. However, the chief postman, who decides to remove him from the bank safe, does it at the same time as the bank robbery collapses, the same FBI agents were notified, and at the same time a terrible earthquake broke out. It is needless to say that the consequences of an earthquake are in many ways more erratic than one. However, the results do not make for a seductive action movie, but instead, one that was obviously a z-grade junk from the beginning of the film. (Perhaps that is why some screen shots on the package look like they are created using computer graphics, and not as actual screen shots from various episodes of the film). What the hell Ron Perlman did in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was embarrassed to be in him just as I was supposed to watch?
