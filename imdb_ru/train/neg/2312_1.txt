This is one of those films where I would like to stay at the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is quite frankly boring. The fact that there is a story is very contrived, and you will most likely have to guess about it. The film indulges itself with pretentious camera technicians who seem to intend to trigger a migraine, and makes it look like a student film. Did I say that is already boring? If all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the film, I would not care, because I did not have an emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this film, but it was about that. This is the first time I thought about getting out of the cinema during the show, but I still believed that it was supposed to be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Such a film with which you could threaten naughty children.
