This film was like a bad indie with talent. The plot was stupid, down to the end. It reminded me a lot of things about the home video market in the 1980s. I would like to give him one, but there were short moments when you could see the actors really tense up to make it worthwhile. I think the worst thing was that the underwater scene was delayed in the dock. Underwater lighting seemed to come from nowhere, and whenever someone we were supposed to take care of was about to deplete the air, this air reservoir appeared. I would have avoided this if there was nothing else on the shelf. Have a nice day.
