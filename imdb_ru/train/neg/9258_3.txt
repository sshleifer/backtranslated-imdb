Unfortunately, someone decided to promote the best horror films of all time in my book. This bad copy steals a lot of material from the first three films, to the point that it even copies information about how people die and what will happen in the future with key characters, and basically tries to squeeze three films into one and fails. It does not even create a good scary atmosphere for one (with the exception of the strange exception, when impressive choral music brings back memories of old films). <br /> <br /> The only thing for which we can be grateful is that there was no omen B.
