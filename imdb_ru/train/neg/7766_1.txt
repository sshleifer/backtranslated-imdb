<br /> <br /> As in other episodes of this series “Made for Television”, which tells about the many adventures of the sea legend, the superhuman infallibility of Horatio Hornblower destroys all the chances of waiting. <br /> <br /> Since little Wesley Crusher has destroyed many seasons of the NEXT GENERATION, Horatio Hornblower invincibly saves every situation. Every smart decision inevitably comes only from the mouth of Horatio Hornblower. Undoubtedly, the main problem of Hornblower in this series of films, it seems, is that he suffers many erroneous characters above and below him in the chain of commands. The perfect creature makes for a boring story. Our hero is so strong that even those who are trying to help him cannot do anything right unless Hornblower directs and controls their every movement. <br /> <br /> What is the point of telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will constantly win in everything every time? What is the point to watch such a story?
