This film is not so bad if you compare it with the first two sequels of the original. It is directed by Martin Kitrosser Friday the 13th glory. The game is really very bad, but the blood and special effects help make it interesting. This is one thing that I like about Screaming Mad George (the make-up artist for the film), its effects are so unusual and bizarre that they make you watch a bad movie to see how crazy they become. The film is actually not so terrible, but in the center there is an EXTREMELY nasty eye game in which a toy larva participates (what!?!). Mickey Rooney is visiting, and he is probably not too passionate, but he needs money at the time, maybe? If you liked the strange 4th edition (my favorite of all 5), you will probably like this one. I liked it more than the Matrix! Enjoy.
