I arrived at the NEW PORT SOUTH, waiting for a surrogate film about the Colombian school massacre, similar to "The Elephant" by Gus Van Santa, and, of course, the synopsis in the television guide, which says that the rebel-sociopaths from the number of school students made me Such an impression, but this very boring movie. where little is happening, consider yourself warned <br /> <br /> The story of Maddox, a high school student in Chicago, who decides to retaliate against what he considers an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is signed, and the actor who plays him, Blake Shields, cannot embellish any flaws in the script. You have the feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam, or bin Laden, but he never faces anything more than a cocky, cocky teenager, and it is impossible to believe that he can rally any students. The implication of the fact that you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime just to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious, and this means that “New Port South” is a completely unconvincing drama that should not be left out of your sight.
