Not to be confused with the supernatural thriller above the average "The Sentinel". Sentinel was a boring film for me that didnâ€™t give a consistent action, as some critics on the other side promised. It seemed to me that all this is Halfassing, and only there to earn some money, because it was very similar to a film for television. Sentinel is a rehash of some of the best films, such as In The Line Of Fire, which have no originality, and I felt silly when I ran around Michael Douglas, in my opinion. The main problem, in addition to its lack of originality, was to be a bad pace. I was often distracted, trying to watch this film, looking at how much time was left more than once. Not only a mistake with Eva Longoria, who could not convince that it was worth licking. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas, as a rule, a reliable actor, here, obviously, passes through the movement. He does not convince, as a man on the run or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also turned off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is only fine, nothing more. He tries to look rude, but he managed to be softer than anything else, and, frankly, he didn't seem so interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She did not convince of her role, and was a clean eye candy. Kim Basinger is pretty awful as the first lady. She looks bored to tears, and her role is garbage, more than anything else. In the end, Martin Donovan plays an important role, but this is not enough for me. <br /> <br /> The result. "Sentinel" - another political thriller that missed you to tears. He is too old, too tired, and most importantly - lack of effort - sucks. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
