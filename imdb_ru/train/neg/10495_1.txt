I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know that I would not have the courage to walk away even 5 feet from the crocodile. <br /> <br /> But in this film, everything is bad. Joking, jokes, people eat, and a parody of the president - all this makes the film one of the worst of all time. <br /> <br /> This is a really bad movie that you need to stay away from. All the "jokes" are so young that you laugh, because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you are wondering whether the scriptwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Crocodile did not ask the crocodile to eat it after he saw it.
