This movie is just awful !!!! Slow action, slow achievement of the essence and wooden characters, which simply should not have been. The best part was the Iron Maiden show, singing in some kind of video in the theater, that's all. the final was worth a look and wait, but that was all !! The characters in this film almost put me to sleep. Avoid it !!!
