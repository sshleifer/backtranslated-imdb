This film is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete. One thing that people have forgotten is that the reason the original won such recognition was strictly related to the fact that it had to make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the restroom. I am not a negative type of guy, but a person playing in this film ... without comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante, and I wish I had spent two hours of my time and wasted my money on this film. I still love the original and will do everything possible so that this film does not spoil my opinion about it.
