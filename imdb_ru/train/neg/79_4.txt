The original book of this book was released in the 1950s, but it is not suitable for TV shows, because most people look in the style of the 1930s. Ironically, the train at the end of the train was a train of the 1950s, painted to look like a train of the 1930s, so the Metro can play this game. Hanging the storyline on the March of Yarrow plot was weak, but in the 50s there were students who started to think about the world around them, so I think making them think about the poverty of the marchers is almost the same. All the things that Jupp was supposed to serve himself were also weak, but they had to add something to fill the time. It would make a decent half an hour show, or they could make a movie and make it a longer show better. Obviously, this episode is a victim of style over content.
