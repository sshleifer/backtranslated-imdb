Enough is enough ... sometimes they just need to stop making films based on a concept that has long died. Tremors first film was great. The second was funny. The third is nauseous. The series was depressingly awful. And this film only puts the stake even deeper. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is another excuse for cheap computer effects and dolls, now we have a series in the Wild West, in the 1800s, and they fight graboids. Like the first time, they must learn to defeat them again and again. Slightly entertaining, I suppose. Otherwise, this release for video, like Tremors 2 and 3, goes too far. Oh, and I continue to wonder how there have never been a record of these events ... did they just forget to record this unprecedented event? I think something like this would be historical, so our friends in the first movie would not be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Such films, which destroy the original, just drive me crazy. Avoid this trash.
