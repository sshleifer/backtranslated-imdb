It was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community, something that could get up and scream in the global media to pay attention to it, because we were not stuck in the marketing trap with our options for creating excellent open source tools. code After the basic version was loaded (a fan here on a dial-up modem), in the end I got into my first riddle. Media Player, Mplayer Classic and winamp could not open it on my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine could not open it on my suse-server. Mplayer managed to run it without any complaints. It will be difficult to spread information about this if ordinary users cannot even open it ... <br /> <br /> The Film. A beautiful soundtrack, great lighting, camera work and flawless texturing. Everything looked real. And then the two main characters moved ... and started talking ... And the film died for me. Everything, except lip synchronization and real animation of the two main characters (except for Proog in the dance scene), looked smooth and completely alive. The two main characters were so weakly animated that sometimes I wondered if there were any games on the market with cut scenes that imply less realism than this one. <br /> <br /> Any shot in the film is fantastic .. like a shot, and a great thing if none of the actors move. I'm so glad that I really didn't recommend it to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Yes, the final fantasy had a clearer and more ingenious plot. <br /> <br /> This film would have received 10 stars if it were not for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen.
