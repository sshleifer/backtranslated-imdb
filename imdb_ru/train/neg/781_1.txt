This show was absolutely terrible. For one, George is not funny, and his children are small curious babies. He also treats his mother without respect. As a Latino, I am very offended by this show and the way characters are depicted. <br /> <br /> Plus, dysfunctional family life was made to death. This time I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times? I thought ABC would come around and pull this piece of debris out of thin air, but unfortunately we will have to go through it until they "jump from the shark." <br /> <br /> In my opinion, they have already done.
