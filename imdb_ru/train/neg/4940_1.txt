This show turned out to be the loss of 30 minutes of precious hard disk space on the DVR. I did not expect much and actually received less. I not only expect this show to be canceled in the second episode, but I cannot believe that Geico will ever again try to use the advertising campaign of the cavemen. I would rather spend the night checking my daughter's hair for lice than watch this piece of trash. Interestingly, what did ABC convey to this show to fit into the autumn schedule of 2007, perhaps to a reality show in hospital, crime and cinema with the participation of AFLAC duck? If I could not express my opinion about this show, let me clarify the situation and say that it is not too good.
