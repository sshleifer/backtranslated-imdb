Drew Barrymore continues to see his alter-ego throughout the city, and it really starts to become a pain in the ass. <br /> <br /> After Dee rents an apartment with a hack writer, her meetings with “the other Drew” become more frequent. The dude-writer feels that he is obliged to pull the “real Drew” out of her stupor, so he does his best to help, including seducing her, as soon as he has some free time. Not very interesting and even less scary, but Drew, as usual, is sexy, especially when she gives a finger to a group of rude builders ... yes, Drew, it's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene, perhaps, where Drew wounds his real mother, Jaida, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
