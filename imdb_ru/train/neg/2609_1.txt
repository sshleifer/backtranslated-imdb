This film has not given anything new or worthwhile. Seeing this, my wife and I agreed that the studio simply produced it and could care less if it was interesting. This is a good example of the film “for concepts only” - they have a concept about the film, and other details are not important, because execs I KNOW that he will receive $$ only on the basis of the original concept. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the release of Cruella from prison and his release on parole. She no longer hates puppies, but was programmed to adore them — she simply could not hurt a flea. It does not last too long after her release, and she returns to her old habits. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the film were minor characters. Eric Inactive, like Waddlesworth's voice, the bird made me hate him - and this is HARD, considering I'm a die-hard Python fan. It was obvious that he did this because they gave him a lot of money (there could be no other reason). Tim McInnerney, a servant with low self-esteem Cruella, was funny on the Black Adder show, but here he is completely wasted and unmixed. And it must have been worth a few bucks to get Gerard Depardieu, but he was completely wasted. There were other supporting actors, but considering how poorly written the characters are, I try to get them out of my head. <br /> <br /> In general, you better let your children watch TV than let them see this nonsense.
