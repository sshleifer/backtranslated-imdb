“Semana Santa” or “Angel of Death” is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find the killer who shoots people with arrows. Mira has an Italian accent that fluctuates from time to time. Couldn't she just speak English? All other characters have a Mexican / English accent that is distracting. The dialogue is very bad and its delivery is wooden. The cinematography looks beautiful, but this is not enough to save this deception. THIS FOLLOWING PART OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> During the climax, it seems that the villain is about to escape, but then he goes back down the stairs to get shot and do a cool trick on the railing. It simply shows that this script has no originality. TO AVOID!
