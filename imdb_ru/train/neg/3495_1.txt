I watched the episode. Yes, I have experienced all the unhappy experiences, and I must say that this comedy brand is one of the worst you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin, famous in the family. Now imagine that Peter Griffin is a woman (admittedly, slim and without glasses), except for the fact that he now lacks what made him jovial. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know that he is an idiot. Sarah doesnâ€™t have a single true character or acting ability to handle her. Maybe these are banal, formal jokes that attract her comedy even lower than her character can perceive herself. Maybe it's the lack of believable foil. Her insensitive, fanatical person can appeal to insensitive, fanatical people, unlike the mass appeal that Steven Colbert has insensitive, fanatical character. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. She lacks what is needed for the satire genre, not to mention the world of comedy. What is missing Sarah Silverman, it is noticeable. And when you do not believe in it and identify with it, it is no longer funny.
