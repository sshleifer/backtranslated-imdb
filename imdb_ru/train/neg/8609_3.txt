If you’ve seen Rodney Dangerfield’s previous films and performances, you’ll find out a few jokes made in this weird thing. Written as a comedy series, this film cannot evoke any cute chord, from the self-help doctor who is always played by the sadly-sliced ​​liver of Molly Shannon to “I'm fat and therefore funny” by John Lynette. The 5 wives themselves are pretty enough, and if it were made as a pilot for a series of action adventure, it could work. Instead, it looks like a male fantasy, which is trying hard not to be politically incorrect.
