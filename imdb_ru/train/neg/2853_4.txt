Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) - Mafia boss, leaving a mental hospital, in his world of gangsters. How can a director play the cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very great), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle McLachlan, Bert Reynolds, Bill Idol and make such a loss of time? This film is not a funny comedy with a constellation in the cast. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Prazer em Matar-te!” (“Pleasure killing you!”) <br /> <br />
