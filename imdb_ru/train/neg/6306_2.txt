Working in a video store, I watch a lot of films and sometimes try to watch some not very big films. Proud was one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling the story of a ship with mainly a black crew during World War II had a certain value. However, in less than 10 minutes of watching a movie, you will find that the main purpose of the film was to talk about racial tensions in World War II. The main story of the ship, his team and their exploits in the war. This main point is driven into you to such an extent that all this happens throughout the entire film. I pay tribute to the people who served in the Freemason USS for their triumph in the face of disasters and for the difficulties they faced. The film was supposed to be made by focusing on the achievements that these people made for themselves, the navy and for their country, and not making a film whose focus is racism during World War II.
