Brides die at the altar, and their corpses disappear. No one knows why or who, but the investigative journalist (Luana Walters) notes that each bride was dressed in a strange orchid, and she goes for an interview to her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and an injection to his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell), the fluids of young brides to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Disappears an interesting premise and a rather short lead time so that it cannot be boring. Unfortunately, despite the fact that it starts quite well, it begins to stretch to the middle of the road and becomes quite boring with its clich√©s and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There is something good in this - Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and brilliantly acting; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, suave, aloof and very creepy countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> It has a little gothic atmosphere and decent plots. <br /> <br /> But in general, she just could not keep my interest throughout the whole picture, and for that I must evaluate it badly.
