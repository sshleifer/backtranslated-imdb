My headline above says it all. Let me clarify this. If you’ve seen BBC’s “Planet Earth” that I’m sure most of you have, then you won’t like this movie. And I have all the disks of "Planet Earth", I saw the rating of this film very high and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. <br /> <br /> Alas, I went to the theater, and the film began, I saw that it was a Disney film with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs at Planet Earth. <br /> <br /> The film went on and on, went on and on, my friends and I continued Recognizing that all the scenes were from Planet Earth. <br /> <br /> We were very very disappointed because I think that 90% of the footage is Planet Earth. I say 90%, because some scenes I did not recognize. I have a feeling that I just don’t remember them. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is in fact a collection of different videos from different “Planet Earth” CDs with a narration aimed at Children. Yes, the story is pretty childish. Let me give you an example. When they show polar cubs leaving their mother, the narrator says: “Polar cubs are not like human children. They don't always listen to their mothers ”(I don’t remember the exact words, but here’s how it’s so) So, in a nutshell. This is a compressed “Planet Earth” for kids!
