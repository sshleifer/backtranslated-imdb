When the film begins, the narrator warns us that the screaming skull is so terrible that you can die of fright - and in that case free burial is guaranteed. Well, I don't think anyone died of fear after seeing this film, but some may have died of boredom. Screaming Skull is a film in which Ed Wood looks good. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, “Skull” tells about a rich but nervous woman who marries an ominous man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. After she was installed in his house, she was tormented by a half-mad gardener, a poorly executed portrait, peacocks and, ultimately, a skull that rolls around the room and makes her scream a lot. And to her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams pretty well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, her ability to do this is the culmination of the film. The plot is pretty transparent, to say the least, and although the actors are really fine, the script is terrible, and the film is so boring that you are ready to run with a cry. True, the thing lasts only sixty-eight minutes, but it all feels much longer. Add to this really awful print quality - that's all. <br /> <br /> There are films that are so bad that they are interesting to watch. It’s true that Screaming Skull has a few howlers, but the film draws so much that I can't play anything but an occasional giggle, and by the time this is over, your head will start spinning with anguish. If it were not for Peggy Webber's cry, this would be a sure cure for insomnia. Skip it. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
