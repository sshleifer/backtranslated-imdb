Just a warning ... This is the worst film I have seen in recent years ... I could not watch it until the end ... It is a waste of time ... I am very sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a film. There really is not much to say about it. Awful game, incredibly bad lines, history, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see what a movie should not be. Just to tell you one scene: the police are looking for Snipes, and they surround the building with helicopters and cars, they shoot inside the building, but still they whisper so that Snipes does not suspect anything.
