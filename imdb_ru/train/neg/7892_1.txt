It began with an interesting premise. I always liked the materials of the civil war and the ancient secret societies. The more the film moved, the more I understood that this was a film at best. In the second half, he quickly turned into the film “C”, then “D”, then “F”, then “I wish it was not a rental, so I could put it in the microwave!” the game in all cases was terrible, only the majority. A letter, however ... I never read a book. Maybe the book is well written. The script was written by a 10 year old. It was ridiculously small, the dialogues were gray and uninteresting, the characters were as interesting as a 5-pound bag of fertilizer. I really hated this film, like my wife. I am a Christian, and I have no problems with films that promote or support Christianity. This film did a great disservice. Awful, terrible, worth nothing. If you like it, I highly recommend Superman 4.
