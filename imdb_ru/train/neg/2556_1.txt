Well, everything was said about this film, and I hate it when I write reviews, where everyone else has said what should be said. But the fact is, I've seen millions of films and am working on writing reviews of all the films I've seen. So, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The game is stupid. This is really stupid, as the news presenter expresses her sadness for the plane crash. The nun is a good, albeit professional assistant, who comes to take care of the child. The three main murders in the film are so weak that you wonder how stupid the creators of this film can be. Don't they understand that even looting can still be scary. We do not see how our grandmother was killed. Dentist and his assistant made me feel that they deserve to die, you just do not sympathize with them. And Uncle Tony dies in the garage so that it can work better. We just hear his cry and see nothing!
