There is only one thing that is important for the full evaluation of the Indian Runner. Unzip trousers. Look inside. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? Well, you do. <br /> <br /> This film has everything a man needs: blood, weapons, car chases, gentle women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, pyrotechnics. left out? - oh, yes, blowtorches. <br /> <br /> As a woman, I sincerely hope that Sean Penn regards this as an attempt "when I was a child ...". Since he wrote and directed the thing, he is almost exclusively responsible. The unequal cast (Viggo Mortensen, as usual, brilliantly demonstrates how the work should be done), trying to save Penn. Late. Lines and actions there. Even a dedicated, skillful acting game cannot change them. <br /> <br /> I found this film stupid, stupid and predictable. The dialogue reeled - Sandy Dennis respected me for trying to breathe life into a wooden mother's monologue without maternal authenticity. Then she dies. After a while, the father of the main characters, played by Charles Bronson, does the same. Their absence is barely noticeable. <br /> <br /> Periodically noted pyrotechnic products, etc. It seems that they enliven the events and frighten the viewers with the thought that something significant is happening. <br /> <br /> If you are a man under 25, you can adore this movie. Plan to return to him in 35 years. Think you still like it? <br /> <br /> I don't think so.
