Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon finds out that his uncle is going to see his new wife and child, Ollie. The problem is that they do not exist - Ollie obviously invented them! Therefore, he and his boyfriend can find a woman with a child who agrees to pretend to be his family. <br /> <br /> This is not a completely unique idea, as I have seen, at least a couple of other quiet shorts with this exact plot. The best of them was Bobby Vernon, don't call me. This is much better than ONE TOO MUCH - probably a lot because it was done a decade later - when the comedy became a bit more complex and relied less on meaningless farce. Now I am not against physical comedy, but in some farce films people start wildly shooting weapons, beating and strangling each other, etc. With a little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TOO MUCH, this is exactly what they do. None of this makes sense, and it looked like they simply had no ideas for the plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a milestone in entertainment. Not enough to win to earn it, unless you are such an obsessive silent fan as I am.
