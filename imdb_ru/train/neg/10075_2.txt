Sorry, but even Adrian Zmed from TJ Hooker's could not save this sequel. I watched half of the movie, thinking it was a fake original. Then this wild and stupid scene on a motorcycle appeared (note that this is the only film led by Patricia Burch); and I sadly realized that they were trying to be serious. I enjoyed the fact that the opposing gang, which had lost its “wheels” due to its playing habits in the original lubricant, had to use motorcycles in the second film. Being disgraced by this poz character Carrington, I would not like to see what they will resort to later: maybe Mopeds? <br /> <br /> I also never bought a hackneyed topic: hunk-australian-boy-cannot-fit-dominant school-ergo-go-for-tough-guy-stupid biker-look-out. It was a Disney story that became a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> It looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by putting Michelle Pfeiffer with chewing gum into a musical. The only thing I removed from this film was the idea of ​​how many points out of ten to give him.
