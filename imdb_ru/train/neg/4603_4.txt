I was stunned when I could not see this film, when he showed it at the Philly Film Festival last year, so when I saw that it would be broadcast tonight, I turned it on as I could. So was it worth the wait? Well, let's go back, since I haven't given you a plot yet. Sean Crowley is a young man who does not know what his life path is. Enter the duke (George Wendt), who presents him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray completely scored, asks Sean to remove the guy that Sean followed. And it continues from there. Which brings me back to the question. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the build-up was pretty good, and George Wendt stole the film for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But this is not so cruel as it seemed to me, and somewhere in the films during the performance, the ball not only falls, but fumbles in a different direction. I know exactly where it happened, but I can not say without spoiling the film. But it goes without saying that this happened. The ending of the film also does not save. Poor Stuart Gordon, nothing can be as good as Re-animator or Castle Freak. <br /> <br /> My rating: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw her: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari VÃ¼hrer shows his ta-tasas in one fantasy then in the next one, more ta-tasa, and she goes down and ... Oh, my God, my eyes, my eyes !!!!!
