Can I get my $ 13.00 back? I would rather see "Hydroelectricity is coming to North America." Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice that comes from the mouth of each character, regardless of age or gender. To hear this voice again, I would have to take at least $ 150 an hour. And I do not take insurance. It was scary to watch Will Ferrell turn into Woody. But I do not think that creative casting is enough. We need to wait until they have a story before they bother to make a movie. Unless he does it for the money. And if so, why not just reissue the All-Rap version of "How are you, Tiger Lily?"
