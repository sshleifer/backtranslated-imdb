I found out about this movie because it included Jew Ben Chaplin from Game On. Game On is a funny British sitcom, and he apparently left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and play a major role in this film. Thank God, he failed. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy in which Jane Garofalo plays an ugly woman who uses her neighbor Uma Thurman to meet with Ben Chaplin because she thinks that Ben Chaplin will not like it because she is ugly. The film is just bad for many reasons. The plot is incredibly predictable, from frank pieces of slapstick to serious clumpy pieces: this is just the montage where all three are having fun, and then a bit of photography. These two scenes made me cringe! The character Jenin is disgustingly arrogant (and, judging by her role as a comedic hero and archemist, this is in real life too). She argues that the film is "antifeminist", although in fact it is just realistic. Men most often pay attention to the person. It is interesting to note her hypocrisy. She was a feminist and "comedian" for many years before taking on this role, and then suddenly decided that the film was bad. I assume that she hated the idea and the script of this film before it was released, but she made sure that she was silent so that she could pay for this parody of the film. I mean, come on! She acted in this for the sake of God! What this film really was was anti-men, if anything. He portrays men as stupid animals, whose brain is in the groin, and men do stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman Noel’s character. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things in this movie, such as the character of Ben Chaplin. The British man, whom every American girl finds cute, and Jamie Foxx, who is Chaplin’s black best friend, and of course, Fox had to imitate his accent several times for good measure. Is this the best writers could think of? Gosh, they have never done this before, with the exception of every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film. There is also a really awful phone sex scene that is just grotesque and proves how cheap a movie is. All other comments here say that Janine Garofalo is not ugly, but is really beautiful. Hmm, I watched the same movie as they? Of course, she is not a caretaker, and the only thing that is good in this film is what she was rightly called ugly. Although, having said this, I also do not see the attractiveness of Uma Thurman: she is lanky and haggard. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things about this film, if you have never watched it: <br /> <br /> You will know what the final will be; <br /> <br /> You will find the telephone sex scene painfully awkward and; <br /> <br /> You will be bored in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
