No matter what rating I give to BOOM, this is only because of the gorgeous photos from Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts Elizabeth Taylor (her downward phase) and Richard Burton (his error phase). Tennessee Williams wrote “The milk train does not stop here anymore” and is supposed to love this adaptation of his game very much - but obviously he was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated him, and Burton needed money. <br /> << when it finally appears. <br /> <br /> It is so obscene that among Taylor fans this is probably considered the thing to be seen. But if you can get through it without drinking in your hand, you will be well ahead of me. Unfortunately, this film marked the end of Taylor’s serious perception of an actress, even after he won two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally disastrous, and critics called it a BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
