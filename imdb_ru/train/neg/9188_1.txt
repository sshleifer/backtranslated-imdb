This is the only film that I saw, shot by Uwe Boll, I knew that he was probably the worst director ever to make movies based on video games, and also that “The House of the Dead” is one of the top 100 IMDb. I still wanted to watch it, because I'm a big fan of the game, and I wanted to see what the movie has, which makes it so bad. After watching, I agree that this is crap, the film had no history. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless girls without brains (for some time I wondered if zombies or girls were dead?), And then at night zombies jumped out of nowhere and started attacking people later, the woman started shooting in them, I mean, it takes up one place, and then another every 5 minutes. Is it comedy or horror? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the final credits, so I didn’t manage to watch it all, and that’s good! The film is an insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, please do not make more films. Thank!
