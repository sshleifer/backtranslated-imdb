On the Steve Irwin show, he's fun. He doesn’t even try to be funny, and he’s just like that, but his film wasn’t even what I would call a film - I mean, when that guy on his car tries to kill him, he just says, “Oh, this is one nasty bloke! and looking straight into the camera. He put his face too hard in the camera! And then when the guy falls off the car, don't you expect him to die? And Terry had the worst game I've ever seen! For example, when a crocodile almost ate Steve, she just says "Steve." She didn't seem scared or something like that, it was just “Steve”. I mean, I hate to sound mean, but it was not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin, but his film was too stupid.
