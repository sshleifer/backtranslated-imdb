Die Sieger strongly recommended becoming one of the few good action films shot in Germany. I watched it last night and must admit that I am deeply disappointed. If this is supposed to be the “last best hope” for an entertaining and sophisticated German action movie, then nothing much remains. <br /> <br /> Die Sieger tries to be sexy, bold and violent, but it's nothing like that. The characters are wooden and stereotypical, and whenever they do something unexpected (which does not happen too often), they act against their nature. It makes it difficult — almost impossible for me — to follow them or even identify yourself with them. <br /> <br /> Most of all I think that the film is a very bad cast. There is not a single character I believe in. Maybe a senior special forces officer - but that's all. Those people who are trying to look or act as special units, as elite police officers - I do not believe them. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is not so bad. But I think it is badly said. You do not know the bad guy at all - for example. And when, after the “very dark” show, Carl Simon (good guy) asks his already dead opponent “why? ... why? ”I asked myself the same question, knowing that Dominic Graf would not have an answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can achieve more, even with the militants.
