I did not agree with any theology from the “Left from the Back” series, but nevertheless I found that the books were being compressed, and I read 8 of 12 of them. Indisputably good to write and interesting story. However, I did not have very high expectations from the film. There was no way for mainstream Hollywood to take a Christian TV series and create a film with a large budget. So it was done independently ... and it seemed to me that I was watching a really long TV show. It simply did not feel like a movie; this movie had no “experience” if anyone knows what I am talking about. So the film suffered because of this, and the low-budget, bad special effects became another distraction for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I feel that Gordon Kerry was terribly mistaken for the role of Nicoli Carpathia. Reading the book, I got the impression that NC was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero trace of accent. So I introduced myself to someone like Pierce Brosnan in this role. Instead, they found Clay Aiken's pencil neck, which looks like an employee of the month from Best Buy, and gave him a really bad fake accent. So here I lost a few stars. The film is simply unconvincing when the main villain does not look and does not sound as it should. <br /> <br /> Acting was fine, but nothing special. Some scenes - for example, one of the conversion scenes (I don’t remember which one) - were real sitters for me. And some Christian rock music or something like that was really inappropriate for some scenes, for example, the one where Kirk Cameron prayed in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, this was not the case. bad movie, but he just didn't do it for me. Stick to the book, guys, this is much better.
