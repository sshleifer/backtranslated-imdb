What a trash ... I can't even describe how horrible this movie was. This rating is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you liked the first ginger shots. The first one was well written, well directed, well executed ... a brilliant film with fantastic aesthetics and atmosphere. The second was “alrite” - worthy as an independent film, but clearly not up to the level of the first ... Third - an insult to the series, period. I rate movies: 10, 6, 1. This is so bad. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, it really happens in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and Be Fitzgerald ... everyone is confused with some unfinished Native American mythology. The sisters have no real history, progress, or even a clear relationship ... They just try to survive and be “together forever”. This is as deep as possible. <br /> <br /> Struck by the fact that the girls agreed to be in this pile of shit after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, and one more thing, the staging of the action was terrible - people appearing from nowhere regularly, like girls, turn around, and there is an elaborate installation by candlelight with a mystical Native American woman just sitting there going to enter to speech. The sets were terrible, could not avoid the fact that everything was obviously based on the set, which really did not help. In addition, there was always snow outside the camp, but inside there were no traces (.. on the set). <br /> <br /> Aaaaaa, so bad! I really hoped that it would be at least as good as the second.
