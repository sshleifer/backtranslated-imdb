Even after more than 20 years, the Ninja Mission has become the worst movie I've ever seen. Scandinavian ninjas silently step on the scene, shoot from their disgustingly noisy automata with wild energy, and then silently leave. Wow, how do we find these silent invisible killers? Just follow the shells and smoke! A terribly bad dialogue (or was it brilliantly and simply poorly translated?), Not an Asian in sight, but a whopping 3 Asians among the film crew. The plot is funny, the acting is almost absent - again, the ninja can not act! Save yourself - avoid looking at all costs!
