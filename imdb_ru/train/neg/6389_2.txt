I had been waiting for almost 25 years to watch this film, thinking that it might be an undervalued work, because the animation of that time was no longer of the quality it once was. It starred the best villains of all time, based on a series of favorite children's books, and they were produced by Disney Studios. What could be wrong with that? It turns out almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not all. Vincent Price in the role of Rattigan and the chic account of Henry Mancini are two saving graces of the film. The price is terribly pleasant, and Mancini is more professional than the material deserves. They bring a class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the film, although filled with inappropriate adult situations, still suffers from a completely boring script, mildly generic dubbing, horrible songs and lazy animation that would not be out of place on any of the mid Disney shows 1980s on Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment for me. Surprisingly, this film was almost modern with The Secret of NIMH. Having spent some of this, the independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD did in its endless playing time. <br /> <br /> An additional star that does not allow it to be “terrible” goes to Price and Mancini,
