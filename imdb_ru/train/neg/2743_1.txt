I have to admit that I did not finish this film because it was so surprisingly stupid and not worth watching. I watched it in a room full of children, who also did not laugh at stupid and rude humor. Directed by Bob Dolman, it seems so obsessed with sphincters and genitals that redefines the real story with which I grew up. THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM FOR CHILDREN! Besides the fact that the content is so rough, the film is just stupid, it has a bad flow and there is no reason behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read a book when you were younger and loved it, do not waste your time watching a movie that spoils it so badly that you are angry. Buy your children a book instead.
