We saw it on a shelf in a local video store, saw "Coppola" in the credits and got excited. It was the only time this film aroused interest. I could never understand whether it was an attempt at an extravagant film failed miserably or a serious movie attempt failed miserably. In general, the whole production seemed incredibly curious. The sound was especially terrible, especially in scenes shot in a small bar; the dialogue was so trivial in parts that it was incredible. Very disappointing.
