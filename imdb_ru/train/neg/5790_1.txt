This movie is funny. He who says that acting is great and that actors are great has never even seen a mediocre movie. Acting is clearly terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I feel that all the other "floating" comments must have been made by people associated with directors. The storyline didnâ€™t impress me very much, but I just wanted to see the beautiful Oregon countryside, and there was some decent cinema - but the casting was something inspired, BUT. I think that this film also makes fun of the general noble supposition that something deep in the culture of the Indians was ignored and perhaps lost, and that its revival is worth and possible. It puts jokes in the wrong and too obvious places, and makes me think that it was written by the State Department or something else. Return to the drawing board. Even to suggest that this film deserves a place in the same classics district as Harold and Maud, completely mentally retarded, and along the same line of begging, claims and "jokes" as it thrives in this film.
