Well. it was not a surprise. many will tell you that it is blood. but they all say shiz, this film is very slow. <br /> <br /> He starts with a guy who makes a mixture, so as not to feel pain, he calls it "my son", there are some horrible scenes, but I found them kind of weak. With the same success, you can skip 40 minutes of the film and get on the scene with an eyeball, which was surprisingly impressive and disgusting. there are some really silly scenes in it. and they duplicate the beats and slap with a silly fake clapping sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. keep looking for bloody hounds. <br /> <br /> check it out if you want the 20-10 minute final scene to still not be amazing and have a random scene in which a guy tries to rape his mom .. that's weird.
