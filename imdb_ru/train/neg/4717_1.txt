And how it got into production amazes me. The main character is a disgusting demonstration that is not at all ridiculous. I can not stand the character at all. He is a stupid ass that has nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon in the last 10 years, no joke. Plots are poorly written and executed. The jokes are just as bad as in Disney's Sweet Life of Zach and Cody. I could not but like this show anymore, it is awful and should be canceled. Even the theme of the song is bad. The name is even worse. <br /> <br /> As if this show was written by a pair of 15-year-olds who base the character on themselves and think that they are cool, although in fact they are just arrogant in their work, as well as humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go far and fast!
