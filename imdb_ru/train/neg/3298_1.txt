When I heard that the dukes of Hazzard would be redone with acting actors and a solid script, I said, "Well, I will give him a chance, it will not be better than the first one, but we will see what happens." Well, I saw what happened I saw a gorgeous late 70s / 80s show that was a classic, mostly humiliated Hollywood. Itâ€™s very sad to see that Hollywood screenwriters can't come up with something original these days. Seems they take a great show with a big target audience and trying to "DELETE" a classic show. HEAD IN GOLLIWOOD .. IT DOESN'T WORK !!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could play a better actor than Sean William Scott (American Pie Stifler) to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider is definitely disappointed by the way his character was portrayed and taken advantage of. Also, get really, Johnny Knoxville, in the role of Luke Duke. How low can you fall ?? Trashy actor ass to play cute Luke. It makes me sick. I will also tell Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was a smart, sexy, strong, self-confident and good young girl. She was every little girl to follow! (I had a doll and a jeep - thank you very much !!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, 2-bit whore as Daisy Duke. Daisy has never been blonde. Why they had to leave her. Jessica Alba would play the Grand Duke Daisy. She can speak with a great southern accent, she is gorgeous, and would do a wonderful job. In any case, I would like to say that this film blew up something cruel. I feel that I was thwarted by paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and they have to get my money back. If you like the dukes of Hazzard (the original series), do not watch this movie. It will just upset you. CMT (Country Music Television) plays Dukes repeats all the time later at night. So set up your TIVO and go on with the real things, not the imitations on the big screen in Hollywood.
