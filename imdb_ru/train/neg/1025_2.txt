This is the only question that remains to me. Why is this film so sucks when he has such a great cast? Why was the writing so bad that the audience was completely unrelated to the characters? Why it makes no sense at all? Why did the studio take a beautiful premise and damn Hollywood, when all she needed was a good, clever story? What for? I never understand why movies that start off turn into a bunch of crap by the time they are released. For the sake of Freeman Spacey, who is the Oscar of WINNERS, I hope that this will never be released on the big screens in America. <br /> <br /> As a person with a bachelor's degree in journalism, the whole story is completely ridiculous. I just ... I think the script had potential, but the performance turned it into a cliche, and at the same time terrible. Simply. Not.
