What a terrible, HORRIBLE, movie! One of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I usually like films like this, the whole ones: “A guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes, but he turns out to be already connected with someone who is not suitable for him ....” I was expecting something predictable and did not mind. Movies are always interesting, mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this one! Every joke fails, and the "romance" makes me vomit. The title character is one of the most heroes of "please kill me" I have ever seen on TV. "Eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, rather bizarre and irritable. The “other person” is the most intelligent, mature person in this film, but he is also annoying. These are films with a sediment, a sediment, there is no way, not to waste the time.
