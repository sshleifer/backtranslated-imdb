*** THIS CONTAINS MANY, MANY SPOILERS, NOT WHAT IT IS IMPORTANT, WHY EVERYTHING IS SO LATE REGARDING *** <br /> <br /> My God, where do I start? Well, this is the first time I come home from a movie and say: “I have to get on IMDb and write a review of this NOW. This is my civic duty. ” Such is the badness of this film. <br /> <br /> * start a retreat * But let me say one thing before I begin. I'm not some kind of Harvard-art-major-film-noir-Veny (in fact, I was in college at the other end of Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, where real smart people go without rich dads and trust funds). that should put me right in the census group nerd-who-obsessive-love-comics-movies-movies, and yet I hated this movie ...). I prefer to watch high-profile cinematographic works that include “Dead Shards”, “Bond-Flick”, “Clerks” and “Grail”. I wish Titanic never sank, not so much because of lost lives, but so that we would not undergo this movie pile. And the only and only reason why I will watch a humorous French feature film is that there is a young and often upset Emmanuel Barth. For God's sake, I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of his several precious dozens here on IMDb. So I’m as shallow as they are, so I don’t criticize this film because I’m looking for some standard of cinematic perfection — that’s because Electra stinks like a three-week dead goat. * end of retreat * <br /> <br /> Well, there is so much bad that I should try to classify it. Here goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons why a man would like to see this film is to see a lot of hot Jar (I have no idea why my wife wanted to). I think that between this and Finding Nemo the latter was the sexiest movie. Do you know the red outfit she advertises dressed in every ad you see? You see her in her TWICE - once at the beginning, once at the end. Bummer. Otherwise, she basically looks like Morrissey, if he were a woman - a lot of puffed up and black clothes. This brings me to an incredible self-expression that JGar demonstrates in his game - from "inflated" to "inflated and weeping." My God, you might think that she was forced to meet with Ben Affleck or something like that. Hmm, wait ... <br /> <br /> BAD GUYS / GAL: They demonstrate about the same range of expression and acting ability that you would expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least next to the performance of JGar, it doesn't stand out too badly. The role of one guy is to stand there and be huge, the other is to stand there and get some things from him, and the role of a woman is to stand there and breathe and / or kiss people. They manage to accomplish these incredible feats. The main bad guy is playing the most difficult role of all - he should LATER a) seem evil and b) seem Asian. He does an excellent job with this. I think that was the fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain starts blocking parts of this film in self defense. <br /> <br /> SUBJECTS! There are as many surprises in this film as in the speech at the Democratic Party convention. Let's just say so - my wife, who was in the US for only half a year and speaks a little English, whispered it to me when a girl first appeared in a JG notebook, and I swear to God that I was not thinking up: “She goes to the house, to kill a girl. And father too. ” And this is BEFORE THE FATHER EVEN APPEARED ON THE SCREEN. Now my wife is not a fool, but Mensa does not want to give gifts for her, and she had nothing to do with Daredevil or the comic book genre. And she figured it out in 0.00015 seconds, without pushing or receiving prior information. Such is the blatant evidence of this film. <br /> <br /> RARE BEFORE IMPORTANT STUPIDITY! So, there is this big dude in the movie. He can take a chest with a shotgun and shake off the shot as if it were a nap, and he can strike Electra in the chest and just bend the metal (or melt it - or something else - more protective devices, thank God). But JG jumps on his head and he explodes? Achilles Noggin? OK! Such is the stunning stupidity of this film. <br /> <br /> Ack. I begin to feel a brain hemorrhage, so I have to stop. But you were warned. If you need to specifically trim your tires to not watch this movie, MAKE IT. And if Armageddon is going to come, please let it be> before <will be released on DVD.
