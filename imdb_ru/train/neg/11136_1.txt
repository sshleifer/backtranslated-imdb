This is only the second time when I felt compelled to comment enough on the imdb movie. The first time was probably the best movie I've ever seen, and that was for Memento. <br /> <br /> Darkwolf's vision at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I've ever seen. had the misfortune to see. In addition to two scenes with naked women, in this film there is nothing that could lift it from a pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> Let's see horrible effects, script cliches, a bad game and about 90 minutes. long. My wife and I laughed most of the time, not believing how bad. Surprisingly, I watched it to the end, as I did, I do not know! TO AVOID !!!
