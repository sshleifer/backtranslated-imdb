What else to say? <br /> <br /> I read all the reviews here, and most of them right now. However, one person even went so far as to call this film evil and that Satan spoiled it (or something like that). Evil?! Wow, what a shock, I mean, TBN basically made this movie. Please open your eyes. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was the lowest level of propaganda delirium, which occurred over the years. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the Omega code is how much money they spent to do it. If this film can be removed, we have no restrictions, and therefore we have no choice but to prepare for “Yentl 2” and “Ernest loses the omega codes.” <br /> <br /> For those of you who are in Bible stories, the new Dogma movie will be a pickup where the Omega code never started.
