This film was so poorly written and directed that I fell asleep after 30 minutes. The jokes in the film are banal, and although the plot is interesting from certain angles, it is too far-fetched and ridiculous at some points. If you are 11 or more, you will miss the movie and will be disappointed, but if you are 10 or less, this is a film that will catch your attention and be amazed at all the tricks (I can add that they are not well implemented) and I want you was a warrior. The actors in this film were not very good, and the music was very disappointing, because it seemed that they were trying to create tension, but it didn’t fit at all. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is excellent, 1 is terrible), in this movie is Game 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was ridiculous. When she did some of her “fighting” poses, I began to laugh out loud. I think that the worst in this film is definitely directing, for example, the role in which her enemy turns out to be a person who is wielded by an evil villain, how her voice becomes dark and angry, I think it was incredibly stupid, and as Teacher Wendy (Brenda Song) were all her teachers in the school, obsessed monks, which was pretty funny. So to summarize it all, a disappointing movie, but it's good if you are 10 or less.
