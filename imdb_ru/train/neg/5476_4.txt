I do not know if this is one of the original films on the SyFy channel, but this is exactly what it feels like. A cheap, low-budget action movie, which was probably made very quickly, it contains ludicrous effects, an inconclusive dialogue and one faintly star to give it brand-name recognition (it's funny how many children from 90210 make cheap TV films)). <br /> <br /> Jan Ziring plays Cortes, whom we know from history as a researcher who destroyed an entire indigenous population by conquering parts of North America. Here he is not played as a hero or even a sympathizer, but as a slimy opportunist; his character would probably have been killed if he had not been based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortez performs a brief geodetic mission, trying to find something valuable to prove that he deserves funding for further exploration of America. He and his people find a small tribe of Aztecs suffering from dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the true hero of this story is Lieutenant Rios, who turns out to be noble, resourceful and wise. He knows what needs to be done in any situation, which puts him in opposition with Cortez, as well as with a young, ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, a native girl who is supposed to marry a stubborn, intriguing shaman falls in love with Rios, heightening her anger at Spanish outsiders. So all this is pretty cliché. Dinosaurs are sent with relative ease. Despite the fact that events take place in a wide open area, the plot largely unfolds either in the forest or in the Aztec village in 95% of cases, so it doesn’t worry visually either. <br /> <br /> I didn't even recognize Ian Tsiring. They gave him a funny wig and an unconvincing accent, and he somehow disappeared into it. However, he doesn’t look or sound Spanish for a second, which makes the choice of actors wrong in all respects. If this film had been released theatrically, it would have been chosen for Razzie, without question. <br /> <br /> In general, forgetful.
