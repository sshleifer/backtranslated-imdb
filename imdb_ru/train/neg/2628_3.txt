Directed by Sydney J. Furi in Hollow Point created a masterpiece of postmodern absurdity, which challenges and constantly surprises the public. <br /> <br /> Sydney J. Furry dares to ask what happens to the weary traditional traditional paradigms of "conspiracy" and "characteristics" when you eliminate the crutches of "motivation" and "reason". <br /> <br /> As a result, I can say that my opinion about him could not be even higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this film makes any sense, law enforcement officers are absolutely incredible, and organized criminals are full of madness.
