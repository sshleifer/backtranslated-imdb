Think of this movie as a Saturday morning live action program from ancient times. It is difficult to please even small puppies, because they work like molasses! I can’t fully understand how terribly doing something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many movies about warrior wizards have repeatedly used the same old storyline, but this is very little, considering its appeal to little darlings. And who in the world would allow first of all to play the topless mermaid? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here’s another great gem for your 1999 TV season!
