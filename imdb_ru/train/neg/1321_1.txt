Richard Dreyfus is not a star here. He has about three 20-second cameos, and what does Gene Barry do in this entire film? I have no idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that makes no sense. The inept writer / director (the same dude) infected everyone with his talent with his terrible ... work. I received a DVD for a penny, so I can not complain! But it is strange! And it makes you feel exhausted and not in a very good way. It was in the 70s, and it seems that the director was on a bad journey and wanted everyone to experience what it was like to be in his head. He has a rather interesting and controversial concept, but, like a scratched record, it quickly plays foul. It has an atmosphere of "Manson's family on acid." <br /> <br /> I have no idea how another reviewer got everything they did from this movie? Maybe they worked in it even when? In any case, be prepared to lose more than 80 minutes of your life, which you will never return. Yes, it is so terrible!
