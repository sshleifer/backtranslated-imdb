First, winning their hearts, then their wallets, and then, when she no longer needs them, is thrown into the wastebasket, like used Kleenex fabric. <br /> <br /> Isabel’s first victim is no different than insulting her to keep Isabel off a raid on his bank account, husband Stuart, John O'Hurley. Later in the film, Isabel is very friendly with the former plumber, and now with the yacht salesman Richard Davis, Philip Kaznoff, that she, without telling him, makes Richard completely ill with love to conclude a contract for the life of her unsuspecting husbands.
