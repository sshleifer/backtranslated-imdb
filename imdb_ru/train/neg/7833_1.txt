I just saw the third week of Stephen King's Nightmares and Dreams mini-series; that is, I saw 6 episodes. I have to say that the stories are really weak. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, a collection of his stories that was published in the distant past. I remember that most of the stories were average and poor, but there was one that was really excellent, if not outstanding. <br /> <br /> I just want to say that this mini-series from the collection of The Stories of Stephen King does not mean that it will be good. In fact, if his previous collection of stories has any indication, then most of this mini-series will be on average bad. <br /> <br /> In defense of Stephen King, I did not read these new stories. Perhaps they are good as stories in the book and poorly adapted to television, or perhaps it was the fault of the writers in trying to write an interesting script. Who knows. In addition, these stories may have been made exclusively for this mini-series, and not for printing. Maybe this could be a problem. If Stephen King had presented these shit stories to the editor, I’m sure that the editor would immediately tell him to become more interesting, because, as it may, it’s just boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear from the whole point is that the problem is in the scenes / scenarios, and not in the actors and actresses, because there are several excellent people acting on it in this mini-series. <br /> <br /> Seeing this mini-series, I really appreciate these old “Twilight zones” series. Each episode was just half an hour, but it was exciting and exciting. I do not understand why this mini-series can not accomplish such a feat. I’m sure that this mini-series had a lot of money to make a good mini-series, but unfortunately, something shouldn’t have to click. <br /> <br /> For example, two episodes were shown this week. The first was a screenwriter who buys a picture painted by an artist who committed suicide. The author begins to see changes in the picture when he goes home. Feeling awkward, he throws out the picture, but she continues to appear next to him. In addition, the portrait of a man in this picture kills people and seeks to kill him. (I will not even mention the second episode this week with the participation of criminals and their booty, because it was even more boring than this episode!) <br /> <br /> This premise is interesting, and therefore the story should be good, but after watching it, I was disappointed because there were too many gaps in the story, as well as extraneous materials that were shown, which did nothing to help the story. After the last scene I have more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried for three weeks to get into this mini-series, but it was too aggravated due to bad stories / script. If it was a movie, I would recommend people to wait until the movie is released via cable or the like. I would not even recommend shooting it in your video store. However, given that this is on TNT, the cable channel, I would say, if you have not seen it yet, then try within one week. If you don’t like this week, you won’t like either the past or the future series, since they all have the same boring line.
