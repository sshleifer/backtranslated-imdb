- Bad stuff: this film is real shit. Bad tricks on the one hand, they looked so fake that I thought it was the “Twilight Zone”. Memories are pretty much useless. One part of the film, he thinks that anger on the window will make his life better. I want to know the director of the casting, and if he was tall, because the acting, even from adults, was terrible. The kissing scene in this movie even sucks. This movie killed a book. The book was great. I strongly do not recommend this movie. Even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: I don’t know what I can really say. There are some unexpected parts that make you move, but they are quickly knocked down by bad stunt work and acting. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: do not look.
