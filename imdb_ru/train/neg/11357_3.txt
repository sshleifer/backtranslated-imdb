1st good news. The 3-D is incredibly well made, and they do not go on the tricks of the trick. The film is based on a real story about the highest point of human history and even shows one of the real participants in this story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the main thing in this question: we are talking about flies. for krisakes! Flies with large human eyes, true, but, nevertheless, flies. Remember when I compared the Underworld movies to rats and cockroaches? It was not intended as a compliment, and I never thought anyone would take it literally. It has even less sympathy. Baby larvae? Ugh. In one of these strange fusions of Hollywood group thinking, this film was clearly on drawing boards at the same time as Space Chimps, as well as about cosmic creatures. <br /> <br /> Rent Apollo 13 and watch a 9-rating film about the REAL space program (RIP).
