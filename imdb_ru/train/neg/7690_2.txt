Anyone who gave this film a good overview, obviously had something to do with its creation. This film is a painful crap. The game is tough, the standard soundtrack is ridiculous, the direction is soft and strange of all, the teacher is actually not that attractive (making the student's glaring successes all the more awkward) The creative minds behind this garbage should disintegrate and spread to prevent further manifestation so concentrated courage I am sure that some starving children in Africa could spend the money spent on this project. Hell, the foundations would also see a more enlightened target feeding the addict; at least someone will get fun from it. For the sole reason that it did not give me a fatal illness, I will give this film two.
