Wow. I saw some really bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. This is the worst film I have seen in the last decade - without exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a US Army veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I found it almost impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt. ” authenticity "to be found anywhere in the film. Not as much as a small piece. It seemed that it was written by an 8-year-old child who pulled out all his ideas about war (and military behavior) right from the comics. The film was shot in Honduras, which should have been a hint, but even this cannot fully explain the terrible production values ​​of this broken piece of cliché. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical flaws, but it would take almost forever. From the shoulders of the ancient units that have not seen or worn since World War II, and tags of character names such as Col Collins (worn by Colonel Collins), which were actually written using an inverted mirror image of "N" the Russian alphabet (not the American alphabet) the list just goes on and on. Uniforms, equipment, plot and especially the behavior of the characters themselves - each scene was simply filled with ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies and completely meaningless cliches. /> Neither the storyline itself nor the characters were a bit credible or believable. It was all ridiculously childish, to the extreme. It was obviously a film that was intended solely for boys who had not reached puberty, and I almost I doubt that even they will find this film completely absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this film has absolutely no redemptive qualities at all. It's a waste of time. I strongly advise anyone reading this to pass by this rubbish; it really is not worth spending a minute on your time.
