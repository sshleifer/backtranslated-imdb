Spoilers ahead - proceed with your own caution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that as soon as Harry recognizes the identities of the three blackmailers — with relative ease — he continues to yield to their demands. And then the whole scene with the abduction of his wife, he decides to connect his classic car to explode (with money in it), which causes us to make a rather high leap of logic. <br /> <br /> Good, so he wanted to hide his affair with Cheney because of his wife’s participation in the DA campaign. This I can see, but why not hire someone to strike a little at these whims or even kill them when he determined that there was no actual evidence of blackmail (for example, Kini's body?) It was a rather interesting movie for the first 2 / 3 of this. After that, it seems to be falling apart.
