I will not mention a single plot, because, although in any case it would be very predictable, one noticeable plot twist is heard everywhere, in the comments to the film, in the plot summary here and even in a brief overview on my Netflix envelope, Maybe I I would have liked more if I did not know this. May be. This film has a deceptively good cast, most of which played a decent role in rather limited material, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren, as well as Tia Carrera and Rosemary Dunsmore in small parts. It was impossible to love William McNamara, but it was clearly intended. And there were some quick nude scenes with Callorian Lenore Zann. But none of this gives me the slightest recommendation. Do not any of these great actors really read these scripts before logging in?
