I simply clicked on out of curiosity and continued to observe - just like you are observing a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it is a fake, but I should not stop criticizing the terrible direction. , acting and dialogue. Seriously, it was rated as one of the worst films I've seen - it was more like an episode of Tales from the Keeper of the Crypt, and poor in this ... <br /> <br /> Good - a few criticisms (1) when the doctor had a heart attack in front of the monster (we never saw the monster attack him, so we assume it was a heart attack), then the army launches shells, rockets, bullets into the monster - which was in feet from the doctor - but the doctor did not touch not a single rocket and still alive (2) an army attack from a distance of about 100 yards, and we We see the use of a flamethrower - hell, these items have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and shoot the ceiling; the monster throws the child, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? Come on! (4) the monster looks like something from the Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene where five “good guys” (a priest, a girl, a doctor, a reporter and a child) look shocked, and we get reactions (along the line of “hand in mouth”) one by one - so naturally! (6) the general just runs away, from time to time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and does not listen (8) the game is terrible (9) I mentioned the rubber costume of the monster ???? (10) this terrible music, non-stop!
