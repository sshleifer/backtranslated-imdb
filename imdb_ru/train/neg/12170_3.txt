Not surprisingly, Pamela Springsteen cast her acting skills to become a full-time photographer; it is much better to have her behind the camera than in front of her. Although this film is not devoid of interesting elements (mullet from hell, etc.), It is outweighed by the disadvantages. First, Angela, the murder consultant, seems to be about the same age as the tourists. Having a older, more threatening camp director would do a lot for the film. And then you have the murder scenes. The budget was obviously too small to perform most of them properly (without puns), although it was certainly original to drown someone in the toilet in the courtyard. But in general, there are a ton of films that are worse / more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching.
