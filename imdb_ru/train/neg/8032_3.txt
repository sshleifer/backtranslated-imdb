It was a great cast with such loud stars as Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevi, as well as several lesser-known names with shorter roles. He also had Technicolor, one of the few films shot in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ......., unfortunately, I can not say much positive for this story. It portrayed the James boys in a completely positive light .... and Hollywood has been doing it ever since. Why these criminals always turn out to be “good guys”, I can't do it. This film fascinates them and turns their enemies - railwaymen into vicious people. The latter was exaggerated so much that it was ridiculous. Well, this is the world of cinema for you: evil is good; good is bad <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: here's the news - James boys were criminals! Really - look!
