There is nothing new here. All the standard scenes of a romantic comedy, up to a taxi, running to the airport to prevent a woman from flying away. The only thing that saves is the game of Alison Eastwood and some minor characters (blink, and you miss Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously had some fun. <br /> <br /> Turn off when the couple is blissful and you do not have to endure the inevitable pain of the plot.
