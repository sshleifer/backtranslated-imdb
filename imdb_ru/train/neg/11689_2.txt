I have never seen any of Spike Lee's previous films, as their trailers never interested me. I have seen and admired the works of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, and I have several of their DVDs. However, I was completely disappointed with this film. If this film is an indicator of Spike Lee's ability to act as a director, I would advise “get a job” and stop wasting the time and talent of other people. <br /> <br /> I wonder if other IMDb commentators watched the same movie as me? I can only assume, from their juicy love stories, that their adoration of Spike Lee blinded them to the banality of this work. I paid only $ 2.50 at the Second Launch cinema and still felt like I wasted my money. <br /> <br /> On the “General Information” page IMDb, everything is said ....... <br /> <br /> * “Taken in 39 days” - How can you expect to remove a large budget “ Blockbuster ”(as promised by the media) in such a short time? No wonder everyone had such a weak job. <br /> <br /> * “Ron Howard was going to make a film for the first time ...” - perhaps he would have made this project fair, if he had more time, well, of course. Although the letter was terrible, the premise had some virtues. <br /> <br /> OK! probably no. I'm sorry! This film was so full of miserable clichés, implausible scenes and lousy characteristics that perhaps he could not make much of it. (Hello, Ron! Be sure to thank Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster took off her role after three weeks." - And it showed! Her image of "Fixer", which eliminates people's problems, was as incredible as the script she had been given. Did she want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other scribes: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers would try to come to the door and tell the policeman in uniform what they are inside? robbing a bank, and is it better to stay away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When “Detective Fraser” (Denzel Washington) comes to the bank to check if there are still any dead bodies, how many bank robbers without a gun would they “let down” a policeman, (much less let the cop go) to the front door, letting the cop go after him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Later, Fraser claimed that he provided the robber with "every reason to shoot me." Why, then, in their short struggle, he did not even try to expose the face of the robber? It may have received the answer he was looking for ... a burglar would have shot him simply to prevent further identification. And why did “Steve, Stevie, Steve-O” (robber's accomplice) come and help for so long? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda, and they didn't want anyone to get hurt. But the police had no reason to think that they would not. For them, it was a hopeless situation. Why then, when two bad guys went outside to “pick up the pizza?”, They weren't killed. (First, how many robbers would have gone outside without using a hostage as a shield? Is this the version of "Spike Lee" from "New York City" or "SNL"?). Removing them would reduce the number of bad guys, ruin their plans, and the rest of the robbers would most likely give up. If not, then at least there will be fewer bad guys inside. (Give the special forces something to do or send them home!) <br /> <br /> * Which police department in this country would allow Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to just waltz directly to the bank and discuss what the robbers were Would you not reveal them first? She had no authority, no government authority; and besides, it was, after all, an “already” hostage situation ... add another? <br /> <br /> * Why did the CEO of the Bank (Christopher Plummer) simply not destroy the incriminating documents? a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! He could sell diamonds. <br /> <br /> * Who was this “schmuck” (character, not an actor) with an emphasis on Jersey, who, oddly enough, volunteered and said he knew the record was “100% Albanian”, but he could not speak on this ..... sir! DECREASE YOUR HAND DOWN! And his ex-wife! What she was "stupid" !!! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> * When interrogating suspects, why Det did. Fraser, constantly pursue people who were clearly not part of the robbery? (That is, telling an older woman that she could go, and then she could not, and then she could, and then she could not?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, seeing how bank robbers demand that the hostages put on the jump sets, could not determine their escape plan, including leaving the bank, pretending to be one of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * Toward the end of the film, it was shown that a false wall was built in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens was hiding “a week” ... where did the materials from come from? (drywall and studs). It was also assumed that they crashed into the sewer, so that he could relieve himself. Bank staff did not complain about the smell all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such a rout; since the documents “fell into the hands of a robber”, what kind of “help” did Mrs. White expect from the general director of the bank, seeing that he would now become the object of blackmail because of her failure? > <br /> * Last but not least, what did Denzel do with “Electric Slip”? SO SILLY! Should this indicate his “determination” to hold these guys accountable? He looked rather like a man who jumped on a cart trying to prevent a bowel movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> In addition to the mediocre plot; lousy script; bad behavior; and general pitiful direction ...... Poison, Poison, Poison. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this will give enough insight into the film to help others decide whether to waste their money or not! <br /> <br />.
