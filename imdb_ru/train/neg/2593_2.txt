American Pie: Beta House is in limbo between genres. On the one hand, this is a comedy without a plot and some really clever jokes. On the other hand, it is porn, it is a bit too soft core to actually include any viewers. In essence, Beta House is a collage of sex scenes — some humiliating, others just unsuccessful attempts at humor — with a couple of subtle plot points thrown into trying to cohesive. The characters are hardly even two-dimensional, most of the development relies on knowledge of the Naked Mile, and the “important” story scenes are so far apart that you wonder why writers even felt the need for a plot. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I didn’t go to this movie without expectations. I liked the three original American pie films, and I thought Band Camp and Naked Mile is a safe rental. I thought the “Naked Mile” was almost good enough to be shown in cinemas, and so when I saw the same characters return to Beta House, I was excited to see this release. I knew that there would be many scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in various forms. And I was fine with this, because in the past these scenes were backed by the plot and were well integrated into the plot. However, in Beta House, the screenwriters almost forgot why the formula worked in other AP films. They spent too much energy working naked and forgot to write a story. <br /> <br /> This film is disappointing and not even worth renting for one dollar. The jokes are lame, the story doesn't exist, and the porn aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about watching.
