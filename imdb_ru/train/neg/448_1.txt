What I hate about this show is how badly the presenters are written. These women do not have self-esteem or dignity. The whole plot - they rush on the guys. Amanda Bynes' talent is completely wasted. She was gorgeous in All That and her own show. Why they write her and Jenny Garth as helpless, reckless, desperate, persecuting men, imitators of the “old maid”, outside of me. <br /> <br /> Their plots and dialogue remind me of "The Simpsons," says Homer whenever his cartoon character Poochie does not appear on the screen, "Should everyone ask where Poochie is?". All the talk is focused on how to whine about some guy, and then whine about some guy. Sometimes they change it, and the guy whines instead. Then they come together or part at the end. 2 women either small, stupid, or sexual addicts. The only word I can think of is “sucks.”
