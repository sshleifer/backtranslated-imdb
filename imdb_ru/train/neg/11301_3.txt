Nothing will spoil a movie like a combination of a bad script and bad direction. This is the case with the Tomb of the Mummy. <br /> <br /> The script contains ideas from old, best universal horror films, such as Dracula and Frankenstein. Direction trite and stale. The game is mediocre. Even Haris Cheney is weak compared to Tom Tyler in The Mummy's Hand, and the producers are stupid enough to add shots from Christie Kabann's much better prequel and point out the weakness of their own film! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how bad this film was, and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as “The Ghost of a Mummy” with a much better script and best director. The result was probably the best film in the cycle of the four Mummy films, although not nearly as good as the original Carl Freund's original 1932. <br /> <br /> Shots Kabann raise this film to 3. "New" material is 2 at best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably glad to see their characters collide, so they no longer have to appear in horror!
