We should be suspicious to find that only two minutes before the glow, we were the only ones there. Only five people joined the film before it began. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that could buy this film. The game is terrible (especially Miss Hurley). The script is banal. The effects we have seen a million times. The direction of the film is the worst that we have seen. Twisting and disunited. Nobody laughed, including children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would be faster if my wife did not go for a hot dog !!! <br /> <br /> Donâ€™t waste your money on this movie. If you have nothing to watch in your cinema, buy drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and chat with people. You will spend much more pleasant time !!! <br /> <br />
