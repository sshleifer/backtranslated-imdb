Boy, that was one lousy movie! Although I have not seen all the collaborations of Burton and Taylor, I can say with confidence that this is the worst. This rich but sick woman (of course, Taylor) owns this beautiful island in the Mediterranean, managing a staff worn when this wandering poet, who utters platitudes, suddenly visits her. In fact, the whole movie is just a conversation, and most of the talk does not make sense. Even in 1968, no one could make the head or tail of this pretentious nonsense, and over time this becomes even more obvious. If it were not for the beautiful cinematography and scenery, this would deserve a negative assessment. The only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughter due to the stars.
