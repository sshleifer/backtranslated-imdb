Summary of plot: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped and replaced by an android twin, secret service agent Eric Phillips tracks her and reveals the arms dealer’s plan to create an invincible android army to kill world leaders. <Br /> <br /> I did not expect much when I first saw the continuation of the continuation of the low-cost science fiction hybrid of Richard Pepin "Cyber ​​Tracker". There was nothing special about this film, let alone the blatant robbery of both the Terminator and Robocop. This sequel is the same as before, with a full sequence of actions opening the film. There are many explosions, heavy shooting and a huge number of people, as well as some martial arts courtesy of the film star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The entire film resembles a series of battle scenes connected by a minimal plot. On the acting front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.
