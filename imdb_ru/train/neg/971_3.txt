After reading a few very good reviews of this film, I thought that I would share the clock with him, and, being very disappointed with the film, I thought that I would give my feedback. This is my first time when I was so naked. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would have struck horror out of the genre, as it is by no means terrible and not terrible (except for a few weak attempts. Unfortunately, this made me jump, and it worked for me. I would say that calling this movie a thriller because I was also not thrilled! A film about a spoiled naughty girl who lost consciousness several times. At this time she visits the house she painted, after each visit she decides to add something something else to the house to make it a bit more lively, and one of the features - this is a sad little boy who is also sick in reality. Having made friends with the boy, she realizes that her imaginary world she created is actually better than the real world she is in. Until she adds her constantly absent father to due to improper care her dad turns out to be angry, and her and the boy have to break out of their clutches. Think that this is an attempt to become a slightly softer version of the Nightmare on Elm Street, but more like a trip beach. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, my generous 3/10, I hope, will stop at least one of you from watching this gray!
