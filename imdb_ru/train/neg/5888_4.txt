I saw it recently on a faded old VHS tape and vaguely remembered. Looking at it now, it seems charming. <br /> <br /> When he was first released, almost everyone recognized him as a trickster of a gay teen exit. To understand what is happening, the mother reads a paperback book “1 Teen at 10,” the most popular book published at the time. David Warner considers him a haunting vampire hunter [= evangelist who hates gays], who, of course, hates himself in the closet. The list of jokes and jokes that were included to make sure no one lost sight would be too long to delve into it. Producers amused themselves good-naturedly and, without a doubt, hoped for enlightenment as well as enlightenment. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how the teenage audience will look at this film these days, in some places where there is education and culture, the terrible ordeals that gay teens had to go through were in the past . But I am sure that there are many dark and dirty corners on our continent, where everything is as bad as ever.
