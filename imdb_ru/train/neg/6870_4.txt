A friendly film about Sonya Horowitz (Renee Zellweger), the wife of devout Talmudologist Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy, Brother Mendel Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field in which she is already an expert in jewelry. He also begins a love affair with her, and then, when she spends time with an artist from Puerto Rico, he throws her and betrays her to her family, who closes her. There is a plot in which Sonya’s dead brother talks to her and, apparently, takes the form of a magical beggar, but why it’s not clear. Unfortunately, much is unclear, including what happens to Sonya, why she tells the Rebbe that there is fire inside her, and perhaps this is not from God, and what this means, and what the magical beggar woman tells her. To some extent, the story affects the plight of women in the ultra-orthodox community, and yet Sonia is not completely liberated. The concept of being redeemed by the love of a person of another race is not very well thought out. The name comes from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman, and, nevertheless, this bastard Sender quotes him Sonya. Zellweger struggles with his part; she was supposed to be a Jew from the Midwest, and sometimes her accent was flat, and at other times he accepted the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn. She is at her best when she is tough and takes responsibility, but ultimately the film is a mess.
