Some guy gets hit. Right on sight, this other guy shoots him. He has several bodyguards, and they kill the killer, but the reporter is interested. She goes to the hospital where they took the guy who was beaten up. She enters and drives one bodyguard into the corner, but he does not want to talk. I can not understand why. This is not how anyone else is interested. She is the only reporter there. In any case, her editor discourages her from working on this lame story. But in any case, she does. She goes to the killer's sister and mother. A few minutes after she leaves, they are severely beaten - someone blows up their trailer - a huge fireball. She then searches for a bodyguard from the hospital. She finds him hungover on his boat, but a minute later they both suck up an aquarium with scuba diving, because three guys are trying to hit them (and they blew up the boat - a huge fireball). A reporter and a bodyguard beat two guys who are trying to hit them. <br /> <br /> Over the next hour, another guy is interrupted by crossing the street, there is a shootout with several donations in the warehouse, car chases with debris and death, fake suicide, etc., etc. Lotsa waiters, everything types of slaughter. <br /> <br /> Great stuff, but the reporter and the bodyguard can't understand: why the hell was this guy hurt. What is the motivation? Of course, this can help us understand why the reporter is even interested. Almost through it all, she is the only reporter in history. No one else in the media cares. Even with all the great balls of fire and corpses. True, the original guy who was hit was not exactly a celebrity. His job was a bit boring. He was just a president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Yes, and the bodyguard is a secret service agent. <br /> <br /> Is it a spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be so. After all, there are no cameras here, no other reporters, no bloggers ... just another of these police crimes. <br /> <br /> So what is this spoiler? <br /> <br /> Let me think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yes ... First Lady. She was betrayed because the president was fooling around. And she gets away with it. Is she really sharp, huh? But how the hell could anyone understand this? Why bother someone? After all, only one reporter is interested. <br /> <br /> I give this turn "1". It was so stupid that I just had to keep looking. And it's just dumber! This is a real spoiler! But even though I told you, you have to see it in order to believe it!
