A complete waste of time .... This film is not a comedy, it is not a drama, it is not a romance ... at least, even a teen comedy !!! History ... it must be some kind of turn from one end ... but it is so disappointing! When the film turns over, I expect this turn to make the film even better (for example, Fight Club), but this turn makes the film even worse ... When I watch a teen comedy, and I don I do it very often, I expect lousy jokes and a bunch of nudity ... The jokes are too lousy and there is no nude ... You only have one ... it looks good, I must confess ... a girl, and nothing can be done! And she completely dressed the whole movie! Act badly ... like soap series ... Don't waste your time! There are guys with the best story and acting skills! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
