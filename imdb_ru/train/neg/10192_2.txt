One of the best wedding films you will see. Extremely smacking too much of his time period, so it was outdated before he went to the cinema. Ethnic stereotypes are a joke to Henny Youngman, except that they are just not funny. Molly Ringwald, what else needs to be said. Give you a hint about stupidity, it destroys a wedding dress for $ 10,000, because “It's just not me” turns it into this rag, with straps and puts on a top hat, and everyone smiles sweetly at her courage, and does not go around her neck. This is also a hell of a cast, look at how heavy Ellie Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
