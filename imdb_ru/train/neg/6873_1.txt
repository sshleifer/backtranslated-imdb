Telecasts in the early 2000s were between weak and bad. Before the advent of such labels as (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk), the television did not yet have the correct hit that could attract the attention and interests of the viewer of the 2000s. Names like (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) did not encourage you to watch and follow, or at least were not so exciting and interesting for everyone. time like what preceded them. (Special block 2) was no exception. In fact, this “Men in Black” meets the parody of the “X-Files” (as if they were special units 1). But even by this brilliant formula; it didn't work. It was promising; At the time, after decades of many X-files, there was some saturation in "supernatural" cases, so the natural spirit of teasing him too was disobedient (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). However, (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this, or the strongest when it comes to the comic science fiction show. It was very funny when, for example, every sexual situation should turn into an ugly disgusting one. He enjoyed this bad taste. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), like any perceived sexual attention, was lethargic. Of course, the show was funny, but overall it was unfamiliar work. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among other works (Evan Katz) as a collaborator and co-producer, such as (Seven Days) before or (24) later, this should be a low point! Despite the characteristic personality, most of the time it was stupid. Therefore, if this was the goal, then they really became one of the most stupid! And indeed, it would be one of the rarest moments to be grateful for the cancellation of the show only after 19 of its episodes!
