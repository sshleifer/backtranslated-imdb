Everything in this film is bad, history, acting, effects, but it's funny, funny, funny !!! Scott Valentine with a military uniform, which is ten sizes larger, is so bad with a constant attempt to frown on his face, as the Leader of a special task force is fun! “Terrorists” are as scary and realistic as “predators”, it’s so weird and bad in everything that it tries to make you laugh. The part where the giant T-Rex somehow got on board the ship and then somehow blown down was blown up, and you see that the metal pole sticking out where its head was is the perfect end. If you hit bad movies, this is a pot of gold, Mona Lisa from bb-bad !!!
