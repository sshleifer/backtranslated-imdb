How have I ever appreciated this continuation failure? All he does is throw balls! Worst of all, it doesnâ€™t even compare with the first release of the series! Comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the unintended laughter go? Enough action farce on the field lasts too long. Bob Wicker literally saved this one from a complete stop in nine innings. What's next, BASIC LEAGUE 4: RETURN TO A SMALL LEAGUE? Ehh, maybe! Leave it on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. It had three hits too much.
