I saw it on tv that night ?? or rather, I often switched to another channel to watch commercials when I could not watch it anymore. That was bad. Very bad indeed. Not so bad, just bad. How was it funded? Who thought this was a good idea? My actor friend auditioned and was told that he wasn’t good enough to play the bad guy, but I think they meant “save yourself and get away from this smoking heap @ # $%”. I can argue that the rest of the actors were given the opportunity. To be honest, the acting was difficult to judge because of the horrible fake American climbs. Shooting was boring. The action was awkward and unnatural. The dialogue was meaningless. Of course, the saddest thing was the ship. In real life, the Interislander ferry is a dilapidated boat, and on the film it is poorly erased. Instead of trying unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crew liner with pieces of tinsel wrapped around rusty surveys, I'm not kidding, they can change the script to explain or even celebrate the scuff. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Do not watch this movie, not even a joke.
