Unfortunately it was wrong. This film is smelly from start to finish. It was hard to watch because I watched Clarissa Explains It All every day at Nickelodeon. I used to love her. Then the next time I discovered that she had made a spread in Maxim, and she was great! I did not hear anything about her until I watched this movie by accident. I could not believe that she would even let me see something like that with her name all over. Everything about it was wrong, but it still seemed that someone on the crew was really trying very hard to save the sunken ship. It is a pity .. I hope that she continues to play, and I would really like to see her with a real actor in a real movie.
