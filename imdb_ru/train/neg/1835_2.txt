Start with the script. I saw cartoons with more depth than Envy. Every time the characters repeat what you’ve already seen, and it wasn’t funny for the first time, the film has more problems than, of course, Envy. A movie based on one joke should be going somewhere. Here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken would especially like to forget this bomb because his character is very weak. Ben Stiller was in some pretty good black comedies, "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex", are immediately remembered. Be sure that “Envy” is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning here, just complete nonsense. “Envy” deserves a low rating because, as with the subject, it stinks. - MERK
