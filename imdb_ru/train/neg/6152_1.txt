When many people say that this is “the worst movie I’ve ever seen,” they tend to say this about almost any movie they don’t like. Nevertheless, out of almost 700 films that I remember, this one has ever watched, this is one of the two that left me from a feeling of personal insult and anger. By the way, this is my first review of the movie, and I checked into IMDb just to go crazy with this movie. I went to see him when he was in cinemas (my two friends and I were there for 3 out of 5 people), and after 15 years I can't remember a lot of details, but my attitude to leaving the theater is still very clear. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler alert --- <br /> <br /> Oh, God, where to start. The fat loser left on the altar goes on a ski weekend, meets a blonde-haired bomb that interests him, takes him home to meet his family, they are all cannibals, and he is the main course, a pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape, kicks everyone butts and runs off with a girlfriend brother, they live happily ever after. Bunch. First, the jokes are so bad that it took me some time to realize that they were trying to be FUN, and that it was COMEDY. The special effects, which are few there, look as if they were made 15 years ago. The big dramatic finale was so hoarse and poorly acting that it was almost unbearable to watch (he knocks out the whole family of cannibals with a rake lying on the lawn that stand up to the style of Tom and Jerry when they step on them). I am sure there is much, much more, but I am not going to see it again for advanced training.
