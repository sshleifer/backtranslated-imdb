“I just watched this movie last night, and I don’t think I ever think about any of the actors involved, because this film will remain in my head.” <br /> <br /> Above statement can be considered good or bad. I mean, every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of “Few Good People,” and that's good. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Christie Swenson, I think of Tinseltown, which is LOOKING bad at both Aryeh Gross and the aforementioned Swenson and Perlman, I thought it would at least not be bad. You could say that the movie was made with a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana (where? Exactly.), But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. WRONG. <br /> <br /> This film is NOT funny or entertaining in any sense of the word. It is only there and lasts for 84 agonizing slow minutes. <br /> <br /> Paper-thin characters. You barely care for ANY of the characters, and since the presenters are two struggling Hollywood writers with a dream, and these are all two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this, you need to know about them. Well, two REAL writers know all about the screen versions of themselves, so they consider the audience as well. They do not even think about the development of characters, except for trying to link the story there with "Gilligan Island." <br /> <br /> The plot is unoriginal. Two guys live in the warehouse center, where one of them keeps the bed, and there also live about twenty people. The rest of the story is invented and stupid. Have you seen the "Favorite Mortal Sins of the National Lamphun"? The second story with Joe Mantegna about a television writer who cannot find a good story for a television film, so he creates it. Now replace the screenwriter on television with the screenwriter, turn Mantegna into annoying actors who have reached half his age, and take the comedy, and you have this film. <br /> <br /> Actors are trying. Christie Swanson in the film, perhaps 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the film. She is still hot, but it would be useful if she actually starred in a movie instead of constantly acting in CAMEOS. As for everyone else, I don’t think it was the actors' fault because they have bad material. <br /> <br /> Go see the movie “National Lampoon”, but stay away from this movie.
