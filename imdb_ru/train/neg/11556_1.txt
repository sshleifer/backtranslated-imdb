Oh, those Italians! Assuming that films about aristocrats with strange fetishes, castles, drowned in the gothic atmosphere, and petrified relatives trying to get an inheritance, are in fact interesting for everyone! If you saw one movie of this type, you basically saw them all (MST3K's favorite "Screaming Skull" also fits the pattern) ... and "The night when Evelyn came out of the grave," Numbers, and bored as hell. Even the juicy Erica Blanc is lost here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
