Primal Species comes from the B Movie legend Roger Korman, and therefore everyone who watches this needs to understand that this is a low-budget B movie, and he knows it. <br /> <br /> A bunch of jack-style terrorists, and killing a whole army, they think it contains uranium, but not ..... it has two Dinosaurs with a taste for human flesh ... Then the Crack team is called, which might as well be called the Delta Force. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not the Jurassic Park, and yes. Dinosaurs are never seen, because this is obviously a guy in a suit who is not too different from the dinosaur Barney - just a little LESS scary, but come on guys it was about 1% of the Jurassic Park budget and, as such, does everything possible. <br /> <br /> Does it deserve to be among the top 100? .... HELL NO !!! I think that almost half of the voters who put this number at 1 are HONESTLY, FEEL that it is much closer to 4 ... In fact, it is much better than a number of other films not included in Bottom 100, and The cost of production is similar to the production of the channel Sci-Fi. (again films that get too harsh time from critics here on IMDb) <br /> <br /> The script is the same as in film B, although none of the actors take it seriously as the script <br /> < br /> In general, this is a nice movie B - not for the movie snobs <br /> <br /> ** of *****
