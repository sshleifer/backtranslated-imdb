Blonde and Blonder were unfunny. Basically, it was a plagiarism version for Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used too much background noise and music. It starts very boring and is completely meaningless. Soon he will not gain momentum, and I feel more upset when this nonsense continues. Maybe the only thing that saved me from what I gave to this movie 1 was the last 30 minutes. It seemed to me that it was a little exciting and interesting, as it was coming to an end, but it was the only part. In addition, I could not dislike the characters of Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard a little. Even if this film did not cause laughter from me, it kept my attention. I would not say to completely avoid this film, but there are thousands of better films that you can spend your time and money with than Blonde and Blonder.
