I want to make a pun "Holmes with the doors," but I can't tie it all together. Relatively dirty and edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that simultaneously broadcasts Morrison ... but how modest is this film about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films constantly show it and skip graphic violence instead ... as someone famous once said about the double standards of American cinema: "kiss the chest, and this is X, strike this action PG 13" .. WONDERLAND is also on minutes longer, and at the end of the tasteless spiral, we were all happy to get out of the cinema. How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. Pixel violence and muffled colors set an ominous tone, but camera reeling becomes tedious, as if we were constantly staring into their nostrils. Taking a few tips from DOOR and TAXI DRIVER, it all becomes forgotten the next day.
