I rented the End Game, never heard of it, but I like political thrillers, so I decided to try. After some research into the film, I discovered that it was originally intended for film distribution, but instead switched to a DVD. Seeing this, I thought: "No wonder." The film is shocking for its lack of originality. The plot and characters are casual. I figured out whodunnit halfway, but the final was curved. I must say, I did not expect that everything would end the way it was, but this does not mean that it is profitable. A more predictable ending would be preferable to such a bad one. Perhaps the filmmakers saw how predictable the film was, and so they decided to add a zest â€” even the one that made the film worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want 5.98 dollars and mine 107 minutes ago.
