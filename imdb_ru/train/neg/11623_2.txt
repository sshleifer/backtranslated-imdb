From all that I read about the film, I was happy to support the film with a Christian theme. Everything about the film was made very unprofessional. Especially the inscription! Without a good film, there is no chance. The author / director said in an interview that he did not want to disclose how the title relates to the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I continued to wait for the story of a teenager / young adult to unfold, but did not. As a person who survived a divorce, I was very disappointed. This film would not bring me any consolation when I first experienced the emotional turmoil that a divorce can bring to your Christian life!
