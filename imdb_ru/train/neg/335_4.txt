Michael Jackson would claim a place for the most popular character in “Golden Child” and because he loves children. It didn't work (and why should it be?), So instead we invited Eddie Murphy to save the world by saving the Kid Midas. I strongly recommend that all future screenwriters carefully examine the meaningless dialogue of the actor in this bizarre comedy “Adventures - Adventures”, which is a step closer to Ishtar. What Murphy says or does may be best enjoyed, but don’t get me wrong with his exquisite comic talent; he doesn't belong in this film, and the same thing went for DR. Doolittle! Violence and visual effects in the aggregate are the reasons to designate it as a cult camp, and it would not make any sense, since the Hollywood and movie fanatics continued to profit from the guy. Speaking of visual effects, they were surprisingly good during the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential glory. Murphy will come to America much better for 48 hours, but this stale film is not my touch of golden honey for a sweet, crisp taste.
