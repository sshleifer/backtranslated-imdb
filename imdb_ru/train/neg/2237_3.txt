I got this DVD from a friend who got it from someone else (and it probably goes on ...) Even the DVD cover looks cheap, like the entire movie. Shots and fist fights with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors Iâ€™ve seen in my life, a very simple plot that made me laugh - to the pain in my stomach With very little financial resources, I have to admit that it looked quite professional. Considered as a film, it was one of 13 films from a dozen imitators that no one was waiting for. So: if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, watch this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
