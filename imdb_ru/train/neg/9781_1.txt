I don’t think I’m too far from the base, saying that this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I worked on a list of my favorite war movies: “The Longest Day,” “To Hell and Back,” “Bridge Over the River Kwai” (all black and white) that have good stories, rich characters, and a great acting game. I saw the best dialogue and acting in a high school student written in one action. The plot, however, is not a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It looks like a traffic accident, although I could not turn it off! The film does not need big money or great film sets, that is, “Twelve Angry People” and “Lifeboat” to be good ... so the budget does not justify. What were they thinking about?
