I sat, glued to the screen, chained, yawning, but attentively watching. I was waiting for the next terrible special effect or the next absurdly clichéd plot to show the full power so that I could learn not to make a film. <br /> <br /> It seems like when they decided to do it. In the film, the film crew watched every movie that ever made a science fiction / shooter / good against evil movie, watched interesting things and said, "Hey, we can do it. " For example, the only car parked a mile on a one-way road with a shoulder not intended for parking is the car that the protagonist has thrown at, an attractive brunette born with bile. The car shatters before it sits on it. The special effects were quite obviously my biggest problem in this film. But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility, and the lack of reason for so many elements! For example, an antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to harm in a strange way, encounters a lonely army truck carrying an important VIP. Unnamed guards with guns are getting out of the truck, you know, they are already dead. Then the guy defending the VIP says: “Under no circumstances will you leave this truck, do you understand me?” He goes out to find the beast that killed his 3 friends, he is beaten almost comically. Then, for no apparent reason, contrary to logic, conventionality and common sense, this stupid VIP VIP STANDS OUT OF A TRUCK !!! Much of what happened throughout the film did not make sense. A transparent acting game alienated me from the film, as well as bad camera work and things that just made you go: "Wow, this is incredibly stupid." Shiri Appleby saved the film from 1 because she gave the film the only element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, the sex appeal.
