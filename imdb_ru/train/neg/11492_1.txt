How can a large German television station broadcast such a mess? It's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - even the famous Gottfried John behaves very badly - especially in the double-murder scene - as an amateur .......! The screen layout is very, very expanded - perhaps to fill in 2 parts of the film. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The set is obviously very often a blue screen, for example, scenes on a ship with an unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, sound and duplication are very bad - perhaps the reason: different actors' languages ​​- but: other international productions deal with this much more professionally. Tip: DO NOT look - it's a hell of a waste!
