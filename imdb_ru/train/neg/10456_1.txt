I would give it a negative rating if I could. I entered this film without expecting much, but I was open-minded. All this is stupid! Snakes are obviously fake, and the first two things they bite are tit and Johnson. Oh, how original; if I was 12 years old, I would have laughed at it. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously, the worst I've ever seen. I was not entertained, it was not funny, I was not even bored! I was nothing. It was not even so bad, it was good, it was just bad. It's funny really. Please donâ€™t waste money on this movie. Don't even make this movie. I have no idea how he gets such a high rating.
