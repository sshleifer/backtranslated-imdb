Wesley Snipes â€” James Dial, a hired bounty hunter, CIA agent, and special operator with a bad ass. In his spare time, Dial puts on a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty. <br /> <br /> Enter agent Collins, his superior. Enter a new mission - kill a terrorist who is in custody in the UK. Of course, the United Kingdom, which is a Union State, is an excellent place for covert operations and murders outside the courtrooms. <br /> <br /> The murder is a great success, except for the fact that the escape plan failed. So Dial partner and his local representative are killed in battle, trying to escape from the police, while Dial becomes hot property, as London copters try to contact him and the CIA tries to get rid of him. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dial the Shelter is usually visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett) who likes to hang out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil power structures of the UK ... <br /> <br /> With the script, how do I need to say more? On the other hand, Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be it a pro or a crook), and the film is quite interesting. At the minus editing is very frustrating and has a throwing effect on the stomach.
