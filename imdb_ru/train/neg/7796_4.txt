Wow, this film is not only a “new lesson of really bad taste”, but also a lesson of “really bad filmmaking”. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of “Zombies” 90: Extreme Sea, but at the same time you need to understand when the film is terrible. In case you missed the storyline, the Zombie 90 storyline tells you about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that end up in the desert, causing chemicals to spill, turning the locals into disgusting looking zombies. The next thing you know, zombies all over the city who eat live people, while the silly-looking doctor and the government agent are trying to figure out why these people eat each other - hence the name “Emergency Sea”. Since then, all that we see is zombies, who, in the field of view of each field day - field day - are nothing but extreme and disgusting shocks and dismemberment, accompanied by endless buckets of intestines and blood. Since this is a German film, the film had to be duplicated into English, and when you are not laughing at crazy zombie food, the voice-over is pretty funny and interesting. As the user UnratedX * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER * noted, there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what is acceptable and unacceptable, and therefore a scene in which a woman who carries her young child rolls on a bicycle . some dude around in her wheelchair, and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. One zombie grabs a child and tears it into pieces, eating its organs when you hear the child crying. Wow, this is a new lesson for a really bad taste. Brutal I tell you, brutal.
