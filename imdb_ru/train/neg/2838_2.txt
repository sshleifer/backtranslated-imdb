Skip the mission: Galactica and watch the original episodes of The Living Legend. The network took parts 1 and 2 of the Living Legends and combined them into one plot with the terrible episode "Fire in Space." Although “Galaxy” has suffered from writing documents controlled by the network, and lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 series. Fire in space itself is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, look at Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival series Trek, and you’ll see a difference in quality between science fiction created on the web and scientific syndication.
