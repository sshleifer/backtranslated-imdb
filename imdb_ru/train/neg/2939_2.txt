As others have said, “No, Luciano” is a more appropriate title or response to the title of this film. For entertainment, a great opera singer should stick to singing ... not that he is a terrible actor. Just this film stinks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were good - a good family movie - but after that it’s just a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Having played the singer correctly, Pavarotti in the role of “Giorgio Feeney” loses his voice several times, and Dr. Pamela Taylor (Catherine Harrold) comes to the rescue. Then the singer falls in love with the doctor, the doctor slowly falls in love with the singer, both are arguing all the time, and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a winning smile and he is a nice guy. This is Garrold, who spoils everything, and after watching her, I am not surprised that she did not become a star. <br /> <br /> The film has beautiful scenery, good shots from San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I was bored and I don’t remember much about the second half.
