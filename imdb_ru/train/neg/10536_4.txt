William Cook and Paul Talbot talk about the role of the director and writer in this fascinating low-budget film about three boys, resting in the woods with their horror magazines. The legs propped up the fire and the schoolboy's joke back and forth ... and a wandering city tramp named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... from the skin of the face) wanders and sells four tales of blood in exchange for food and heat of fire. . <br /> <br /> One of the stories is an old repetition of the “Hook”, when two teenagers in a lover’s lane attack a mad assassin with a hook for a hand. In another story there are a couple of tokens who need to score weed. They stumble upon a guy who knows a guy who has great feelings. When they smoke a couple of bags, their skin turns gray and green before it starts to bubble and fall out. One of the best stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas who cannot wait for his mother to die and loves to tell his nephew and niece about Satan Klaus. The fourth tale of the fire tells of a greedy sailor who was upset on the shore because of an empty treasure chest and ending in pursuit of zombies in the sea. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets a point and really could be much worse. A bit trite, but interesting to watch, except, perhaps, a sailor's tale. The game for obvious reasons does not deserve a reward. Cast members include Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Drain, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
