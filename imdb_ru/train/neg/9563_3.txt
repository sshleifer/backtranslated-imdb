It is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80s hit. This is happening nowadays when we see that the base in Afghanistan is being destroyed by an unmanned aerial vehicle from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> This is where the movie jumps from a shark. UAVs are not armed. They may be, but I do not think that this has ever been tried for real. We will see the computer that controls this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We get acquainted with the "hacker" Will Farmer (he is well versed in chemistry and electronics, which does not make him a computer hacker) and his love interest, Annie). Will’s first attempt to crack not only a complete failure, his IP address also entered, and Annie guessed who it was. We also meet with Mom Wills, who works in a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Wills takes money from the neighbors ’bank account (Mr. Massoud), this is not a hack (he helped him set up an account), we get a return to the original film in which they decide not to play“ Global Thermonuclear War ” And play the Dead Code. The trail, which works in the RIPLEY office, is not on Will, but on Masoud’s computer, so all the evidence they collected was useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly why RIPLI shut down Will's car is not explained (does he only play an online game?), and also why it was necessary to turn off the electricity in the entire block in which he lived. Why the counter-terrorism agency considers this a viable goal is extremely doubtful. What about RIPLI activating your mobile phone? I think that no, he was not connected to a computer, and the message would not be played if he had not actually answered the call, therefore there is also a more bad "hacker" science. <br /> <br /> RIPLI agents arrive at Massoud's house. Take him away, and Will will be given an envelope containing a lot of money. Will the search for the number of the car that captured Massoud, not "burglary", since you will never see how he broke into the computer DMV. RIPLI agents who grab Dennis at the airport in search of Will have no right to arrest or detain him. Will's mother also did not "steal chemicals and bioagents." And even if she did, they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot or not. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why Will was worried about being arrested for a crime in Canada, because this is a completely different country with laws different from the United States. <br /> <br /> The computer became fraudulent, and all actions taken against Will, his mother, and Dennis, were not authorized by a government agency. The phone freak we’ll see “Let's do” is the first show of any hacker skill in the film, we also got a hack in RIPLEY that seemed too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> “The guy” who ran to Annie at the airport and also watched them on the street, it had nothing to do with RIPLI, and the ridiculous idea that RIPLI could track a cell phone while it’s underground , it was as stupid as the idea that a computer is lip-reading. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film, when Stephen Falken is mentioned as the designer of the replaced RIPLEY system, the project of Joshua. We find that the “guy” who faced Annie is Falken (unfortunately, the original actor did not play him), who faked his own death. <br /> <br /> We will also see the WOPR as “that will help them” beat the RIPLI, and they retained the same voice as they did then. Falken & WOPR are destroyed too quickly after they are hardly used at all (the same explosion must kill Will, Annie and the Russians. It is also unlikely that they will create an autonomous computer system that can fire or drop chemical weapons on the country from which it it works. <br /> <br /> The whole plot and idea of ​​“deactivation" is absolutely incredible. Such orders must pass through the president or the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So another idea is ridiculous and incredible. <br /> <br / > Will IP vs. RIPLEY is not engaged to Will, he simply contacts one of his friends, who proposes and implements the idea.It is too funny that Will will get a login only due to an increase in RIPLEY’s work temperature.The presence of Joshua as a backdoor in RIPLI (especially after he blew it pieces) - this is an incredible break and the screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas, and he wanted to finish this film and end it. Where it is terribly good, where RIPLE Y plays the Dead Code, and we see a countdown (says 17 minutes), and then RIPLEY says: "Disinfect 30 minutes, ”what the fuck is this, when they don't even have time for their own timer? The attack of the RIPLEY mission against Philadelphia is stopped (in my opinion, too easy), and she decides to attack Joshua through internal channels and redirects the rocket aimed at Philly to Washington, where RIPLEY is located. The idea of ​​Nuclear Exchange to make RIPLI understand what it does will not work (surely, she already knew if she had Joshua, as he had already learned this lesson in the original film?), This is another nod in response to the original film. <br /> <br /> The fact that RIPLI repeats the exact same words of Joshua from the end of the original film shows how many original ideas they could not come up with. <br /> <br /> If you want to point out bad and stolen ideas, the men are Randall Badat and Rob Kershner. This is a terrible movie and should be avoided.
