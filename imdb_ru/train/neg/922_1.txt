This film is exactly what you get, when you really strain your abilities too much, it’s like someone who has just passed a driving test there and then compares them to Formula 1 Grand Prix (I can’t add -in the USA, how everyone can leave the game). because of dim tires, and you can just win), here’s how short this film falls. Now don't get it wrong, I love B-Movies, about half of my collection is made from B-Movies, but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is. <Br /> <br /> The first story (for B-Movie) is not so bad, it has the potential to make the B-Movie brand, not to mention the 13th potential on Friday, but nevertheless , about the potential. But what really brings this film, so it's acting, I do not believe in anything, it looks like watching QVC, except that the speakers at QVC have a stronger tan. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say that I have seen the worst films, but I cannot.
