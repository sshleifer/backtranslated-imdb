I went to see the Omega Code with a group of about 15 other Christians. We all expected a good bit of Christian filmmaking. What we got was a painfully painful, lingering and rather boring attempt at a movie. He has good production values, but also a bad game, a weak script with a lousy dialogue and a lack of real sense of leadership. From the first 15 minutes, we all knew that it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some people in our group called this film the smell of more cheese than Anaconda. None of us could believe that the film lasted less than 2 hours. Bright effects and a clear movie can not save this bad, bad movie. I would give him 3 out of 10, and the rating is just so high, because I shot a disgusting “movie” Werewolf (1996) the night before I saw this movie.
