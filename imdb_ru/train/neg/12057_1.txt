Charles Bronson continued his recession of the 80s with what could be his worst film of the decade, if not ever. In it, he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down the pimp who kidnapped an Asian girl and currently sells her to the most saleswoman. This is a shameful attempt at action and, perhaps, the most depressing film ever made. Many people believe that the continuation of "Death Wish" is the worst movie of Bronson. The Death Wish continuations were not good films, but in most cases they were made intelligently and very watchable. Kinjite, however, is a completely boring thriller, which is accentuated by mean racism and abuse of children. This is really a rethought film, and all this is compounded by the fact that he is trying to preach the “Law and Justice” mentality, which is too overloaded to really say something. Indeed, the film begins with the fact that underage sex is interrupted with Bronson, and then anally raped a pedophile with a dildo. The Chicago theater, in which I watched it, simply suffocated from the awkwardness of this scene, only to suffocate from the awkwardness of the pimp who raped a girl in this film. It has no other meaning than to exploit, and in fact the film was not well-written enough to rise above the level of exploitation and deliver something that would work. Bronson seems to be more versed in things, but it’s obvious that this is too disgusting to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor in history, but in the end this is his worst achievement. The sequences of actions are also bad. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4- (Awful)
