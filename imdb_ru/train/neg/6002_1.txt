“Sundown: Vampire in Retreat” is rubbish. The game is terrible, the atmosphere is absent and the characters are not interesting. The only thing that is scary in this piece of filth is that the majority of IMDb users gave him 10. This is really terrible. No blood, no obscurity, no violence, nothing. Bruce Campbell ("Evil Dead", "The Intruder") is completely wasted, the cast is also terrible. Yes, some people may like this picture, especially ordinary society, but evil horror or hound fans will not like this piece of shit. Personally, I hate horror comedies, I prefer to watch serious horror films, such as Holocaust Cannibalism or The Last House on the Left. In my opinion, a true horror movie is supposed to be scary, overly bloody and disturbing, without the silly humor that usually destroys the whole concept. It's not scary, not terrible, not even funny, like a comedy, so do not waste your precious time.
