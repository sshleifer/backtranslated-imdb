Over the past 10 years, I worked in 3 different professional wrestling organizations, led many professional wrestlers (including 2 stars at Backyard Wrestling), worked on two different wrestling television programs and did offscreen comments and comments for many wrestling DVDs. I have NEVER witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity, lack of talent and skill, as well as the poor quality of production found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. Even listing it as a struggling video of ANY kind is a direct misuse of this term. Filmed with low dollar video cameras, this is essentially a home video where children play in the backyard fights. The sound quality is poor, the video quality is poor, and the game is terrible. The “wrestlers” wear improvised suits with hand-drawn T-shirts and ski masks, beat each other with various objects and half imitate the fighting moves. Sometimes "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes in the backyard trampoline. ALL act badly and are executed with a shameless lack of any fighting skills. In short, do not worry about this stinker. Regardless of whether you are interested in this DVD or have fun, or academic (as in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
