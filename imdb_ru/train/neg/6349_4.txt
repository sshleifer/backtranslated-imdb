Woody Allen made some of the greatest comedies in history, and I’d seriously think that Annie Hall is the greatest movie ever, but if I really think about it, I’ll probably think about one or two that are better, but it will be hard. He had, of course, several films that were not entirely good, but not as bad as, for example, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he had never had such a bad film as Melinda and Melinda. Not so tired and not funny, his films are usually witty and funny, but how did it happen, is this still our good old Woody? The plot goes around four friends who are having dinner together. Two write plays, and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to her friend. This is a young woman who suddenly breaks into a dinner party. We never hear the rest, because two plays begin to discuss whether this will be a better comedy or a tragedy. Than we begin to see two points of view. The focus is on a woman named Melinda, who has problems with both drugs and her ex-husband. In the tragedy, she is an old family friend who, after attempting suicide, decided to go to her old best friends at the front door for no apparent reason. Comedy about Melide, who stumbles at a dinner party after taking 28 sleeping pills. Both go to a wild whirlwind of events that never make sense or do not fit together, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some good speeches by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they cannot combine it with each other. They can't stop him from going further than most other films of this year.
