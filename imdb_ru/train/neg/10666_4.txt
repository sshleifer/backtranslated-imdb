I'm a big fan of the cinema of the 1930s and will watch everything that I see in Turner Classic Movies, which is new to me. So I gave it a chance, after all, this is the great Harold Lloyd, who vied with Chaplin as the great comedian of a silent film. I watched much less silent films of Lloyd than Chaplin, but I must say that I am much more fans of Chaplin. In any case, this film was so flat for me that I did not finish it. I can understand why his musical career was so limited that he did not have good material for work. After you saw that Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, Three Puppets, Martin and Lewis, Brothers Marx, and Laurel and Hardy are engaged in boxing deception (or violence in general), it is very easy to forget about it. It was also interesting for me to watch Adolf Mendju, because I really enjoyed him in Ways of Glory, but his role here also did nothing special for me. Perhaps they should have gotten into boxing earlier, because at least half of the film (at least it seemed so) was before it entered the ring. I can say that there are a lot of Lloydâ€™s fans here, and this will not be a popular review, but I have to rate it compared to what was there at that time, 4 out of 10. Don't watch it with anyone who is trying to love old movies since they can no longer look with you one more, very flat. As an alternative to someone who really loved it or is looking for more obscure comedies in general, I recommend Kelly the Second, shot several years earlier, the other one will not become a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelly and in the supporting role of Charles Chase. They were both shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
