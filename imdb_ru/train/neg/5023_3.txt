No one, but no one, could chew landscapes such as the Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and “Elizabeth and Essex” are a great example of why. Although she occasionally plays the party, watch her when she screams that Raleigh writes words for the song her ladies are going to play: at this moment she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely! In other cases, it is killed by the script. When Elizabeth must be vulnerable, she becomes weak and insightful. This leads to an additional effect of undermining her credibility: when she breaks her stack and threatens to cancel justice, it is difficult to take her seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes charm, forcing us to see how Essex could worm his way into Elizabeth's heart, but he is completely unable to convey the complexity and sheer evil of a person. It also doesn't help that Essex is poorly signed. Why is he so hot, who wants to overthrow his Queen - although he swears allegiance to her - except that he is more blue-eyed, and therefore more “worthy” of reign? And why does Ralig betray Elizabeth, intercepting her and Essex's letters? He does not risk losing favor, and we know where Essex (and his head) is going. So why does he risk his own head, speeding up the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtis do with all the $$$ he received? He does not even try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on the sound stage. He had to end this with Elizabeth for the first time alone in the Tower; everything else (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are fantastic. And is it me, or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
