If there is something that you can count on Disney, it is their supernatural ability to take the story and tell it again, again and again. Even watching the ad for “Lady and the Tramp II” was a terrible experience. Disney is going to spoil one of the coolest in its history. It even had that spaghetti meatball scene. This has been done before! And this is what I say sorry for this right on the video (the whole concept should be prohibited). All of this is just a rehash of the original film and even a few really bad Blaut films. The duo of penguins and walruses (I even forgot their names) is just a very bad replica of Timon and Pumba. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats almost all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really awful. I've never heard such bad songs from them before. And the dialogue is cruel. This is a pity and simplistic. On the other hand, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. All the usual characters are not as annoying as they used to be (or maybe this is a minus for the Little Mermaid fans). Returning to the negative, Melody is so disgustingly cute that you can vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and your Mermaid fan a favor. Do not waste your money on this. True, it is not as awful as the Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but this does not comfort much.
