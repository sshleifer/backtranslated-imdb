I would give this film 5, not 3, if it were at least in time ... When I first saw it, it was exactly what could be expected from work based not on the artistic abilities of directors. but about the idealistic or, I would say, idiotic habits of our (Kazakhstan) government ... It's a shame, because “Qazaqfil'm” made good films when it was not honored with the name of Shaken Aymanov, but it was actually running past him Films like Konec Atamana, Kyz Zhibek or even Aldar Kose. But after the death of Mr. Aimanov, the production of high-quality films almost sharply decreased. For 10 years, very few films have been released. However, in the late 1980s, Assa was shot, it was a film about the first organized criminal groups in a large country, a year later Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the same actor / singer V. Tsoi at that time Soviet / Russian rock legend - a film called “Needle” (“Needle or Something”) was completely new, someone called this period a resurrection or a new wave of Kazakh cinema. Unfortunately, at present we do not have high-quality films, our directors shoot films with French and Japanese financial support, and, therefore, films are not for the public, but for professional critics of authors, some of them charge for international film festivals of authors, but there are very few of them become products of business assets ... And again we return to our "nomads". Such films are usually unpopular due to extensive aspects. The same effects were with Nikita Mikhalkov “Sibirski Cyrilnik” about the Russian kings, who was also shot at par with foreign partners, I think they were French or, perhaps, British. Nobdi liked it, even in the Russian public this became the main theme of comedians and comedies like “KVN”. in my opinion
