This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons, and any movie with Kevin Costner in the lead role.) <br /> <br /> Chris Rock looked very awkward throughout the film and its actors playing a supporting role it doesn't even seem like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a great humorist, but he simply cannot convey his talent to this film, which probably has only two tense laughter in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched the movie yet, avoid it like a plague. Do something constructive and more interesting, for example, watch the weather channel or see how the paint dries on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I put 2/10! <br /> <br />
