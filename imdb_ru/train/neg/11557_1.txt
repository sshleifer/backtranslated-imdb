* SOILER * It's fake! All this is fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan Lord and his cousin or brother or half-brother or something like that wants a castle and a title for himself. Therefore, he puts in this overly complex and unnecessary, meaningless plan ala SCOOBY-DOO, to make Alan commit suicide. Most of the film - he picks up redheads and attacks them. He doesn't even kill them. He falls asleep, and the girl disappears, and he thinks he has buried them somewhere. If he looked at the so-called ghost of Evelyn, he could say that she was wearing gloves! My God, that is a waste of time. Do not worry about watching, renting, and if you bought it and have not watched it, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from EVELYN CAME OUT OF GROVE. I give this bitch KREP-O-LANTERN.
