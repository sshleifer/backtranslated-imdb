The only reason this film is rated 1 is because zero is not one of the choices. With a plot that is more subtle than the cabbage soup of the depression era, terrifying acting and special effects that look like they came out of the TV series Thunderbird, it's amazing that Widmark did not kill the director for putting this black mark on your resume. Even by the standards of the 1950s, the special effects are terrible, with the exception of a couple of submarine submarines. I can only assume that he was nominated for the best special effects, because, apart from 20,000 of the League under the Sea and THEIR!, No one made any effects. It was, of course, not a competition for Disney that year, if it was their only competition. I would not recommend this film, even for fans of underwater movies, since the most realistic scene on a submarine was limited to one frame, where you can see how sea water flows along a raised periscope. There are other, much better sub-films that you can watch in this era, for example, 20,000 leagues or Torpedo-Run.
