I never liked the film Myra, although I appreciate the way he parted the Hollywood envelope at the time. Of course, Miss Welch costume was a cult image, although Iâ€™m wondering if many people who recognize this image have seen the movie and know what it was about - <br /> <br /> I have been revising Myra on FMC for a couple of years. back and did not think that he is aging better with age. In the comics on the history of cartoons about the cinema "Sexploitation Cinema" there is an episode in which he received due recognition for putting such big stars into that outrageous production. However, IMHO, the film is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to be exciting, and so busy trying to shock that it cannot inform, engage OR entertain ---
