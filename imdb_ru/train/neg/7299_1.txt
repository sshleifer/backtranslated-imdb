Of course, I saw bad films in my life, but this one was so bad that I really got angry at the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket, of course, I did not get a refund (or even an answer), but this is the main thing. On a scale of 1-10, I give this film a -42. Why did the Jeep (Chevy Blazer ??) stop running from hitting the bat? Why did they hit a Jeep (Chevy Blazer ?????) with a bat and not break an ass skull? The plot was thin, the film was filled with obvious cliches, and some parts of it simply had no meaning.
