Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered when she left for Italy, tired of the Hollywood glam treatment. At first it was the suffering of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, an artistic failure that would have killed the career of a less hardy actress. And now it is EUROPE 51, another tedious task in gloomy feelings. <br /> <br /> And this story is not so important for Alexander Knox in another ungrateful role of her long-suffering husband, who is trying to reassure her after the suicidal death of their little son. At least it has better production values ​​and a more consistent scenario than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive, but is moving towards a more matron appearance as a woman of a rich society. She will never be able to cope with the sudden loss of her son, despite attempts by a good male friend. “Sometimes it seems to me that I’m losing my mind,” she tells her husband. The loud statement in the film, in which there is no humor and grace, but it gives us an idea of ​​where the story goes. <br /> <br /> Soon, Bergman wants to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve her emotional health, and from that moment the plot turns to the worse. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the film is that it is not interesting enough to turn it into a project. for the main star like Bergman. The film loses pace in the middle of the story as Bergman becomes more and more distraught, and her husband suspects that she is deceiving him. From this point on, the story goes down after it cares for the street traveler because of its incurable disease. In the final part of the story, the husband needs to place her in a mental hospital for observation. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers nobly from all this (excessive compensation for the loss of her son), but it is useless. To put it mildly, not one of her best films. <br /> <br /> Note: if she wanted neorealism with a mental illness, it would be better for her to take the lead in the Pit of a Snake when it was suggested. her director Anatole Litvak !! It would do more for her career than for EUROPE 51. <br /> <br /> To sum up: another grim recklessness of Rossellini and Bergman.
