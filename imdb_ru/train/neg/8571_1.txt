Penn spends time developing his characters, and we almost take care of them. However, there are some real problems with the story, we see no real motivation for the behavior of an evil brother, and the time frame is screwed up. Presumably established in 1963, the music of the late 60s / early 70s. Links and dialogue 70s / 80s. The potential for a powerful climax is presented, and Penn lets it slip away. But even with all these difficulties, the clock is worth it, but not great.
