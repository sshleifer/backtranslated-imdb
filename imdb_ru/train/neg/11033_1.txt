According to the latest rumors, Vh1 starts playing out challenges for I Love New York 3 in mid-2008. Does this mean that Budah or Tailor made a discarded New York or does this mean that New York has dropped the winner? I know that “Flavor of Love” is coming up for the third season, so now with “Flavor of Love 3” and “I love New York 3” ..... will there ever be a real winner ??? <br /> <br /> I also heard several rumors that Chance will be returned for the 3rd season I love New York !!!! I also heard rumors that New York will be specifically shown on the Flavor of Love 3. <br /> <br /> I hope this was not too much a spoiler for the final I Love New York 2 .... I 'm just stating the latest rumors.
