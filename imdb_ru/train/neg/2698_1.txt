This film shows how racist is John Singleton. He portrays whites and other races that are not black, as evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly he forgets that it was this educational system that made him what he is, and failed in that. The Ice Cube character is the embodiment of the inflammatory black man, who was responsible for much of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationship between the white and black characters who were trying to communicate with each other. When Omar Epps says: “I need to be with my people,” this racist remark says a lot. And John, do not think for a minute that the picture of Thomas Jefferson on the landing of the tower did not attract my attention. Nice touch!
