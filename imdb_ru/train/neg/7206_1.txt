Well. Where to start Let's just say it; Avoid this movie at all costs. It is based on the animated series. The film makes the cartoon look <br /> <br /> like Hamlet. Filled with haggard actors who seem to be embarrassed to be here, <br /> <br /> lousy cinematography, terrible music and enough product placement so that <br /> <br /> you donâ€™t want to go to Yahoo! Again, this film really is the lower edge of the barrel. According to a New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett embrace this picture, leaving gays <br /> <br /> among men who have noticed a rare kind of salary at a distance. . "<br /> <br /> They have to pay us a few million earned per view. <br /> <br /> Awful.
