This film is a parody, and it is not suitable for maintaining a company with an excellent original. The plot is absolutely a mess, and the film is too long. Every time they fight, they desperately introduce a sentimental reminder from the first movie. <br /> <br /> “The Gregory Girl” is among the ten best British films of all time, this one is terrible.
