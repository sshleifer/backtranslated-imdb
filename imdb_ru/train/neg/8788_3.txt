What a shame, when a potentially exciting and refreshing low-key story manages to cling to your interest from the very beginning, and then gradually brings you further and further until you scratch your puzzled head by the time it reaches its excessive completion. Unfortunately, this is what happened to me by the end of the “White noise”. <br /> <br /> This is not Michael Keaton’s fault; it was nice to see him return as a star of the new film again, perhaps looking a bit wrinkled, but still able to give a strong and sincere work. As a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife (rather than a new idea), apparently contacting her through this funny electric business that you see on your television screen when nothing is broadcast. br /> <br /> The idea of ​​communicating spirits over radio waves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena), and many people really believe in it for real, so I'm not going to comment. I think about it or about them. Let me just say that I’m for stopping disbelief when it comes to buying fiction films like this, but I can’t tolerate not realizing what the hell was going to happen about where I was left stranded when loans finally began to roll. Indeed, a lot of static. <br /> <br /> Sometimes such films confuse me, but if the film doesn’t give me clarity, I’m inclined to think that it’s the director’s fault, not my own (if I’ven’t watched it before I’m too tired to concentrate or something like that). Well, for WHITE NOISE, I was awake, with bright eyes and thick tails - so guess who is to blame?
