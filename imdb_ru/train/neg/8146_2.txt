1st viewed 7/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (directed by John Bianco): A film with a rather stupid gangster about a godfather family in Brooklyn who likes to talk a lot of four letters and kill people. The only thing that interested here was their attempt to show that the feds are very similar to the gang. This is the only attempt at good filmmaking. The rest of the film was predictable and cheap. The quality of the pictures on some of the scenes inside the bars and opaque seams almost made you think that your DVD player had a problem because of bad contrasts, and some of the actors were sometimes hard to hear because of the bad sound. The acting game was largely a feature of all your favorite gangsters from the best films with commonplace names such as Vinnie "Knuckles" and Jimmy "Tattoos", and the plot was largely in line with these patterns. So, watch the best gangster movie before you invest in this one.
