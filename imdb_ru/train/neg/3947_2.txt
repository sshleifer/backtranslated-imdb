In the comic, modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks more like an anorectic model. She has neither the morality nor the personality that Modesty has in the comics. Modesty will never give a woman advice to show more skin to make more money. I see no resemblance to my comics with Modesty and this film. It's like in Mission Impossible, where Ethan Hunt is locked in a high school detention room and talking to a janitor about when he will go to high school, and Hunt will play DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). So, if you're a fan of modesty, don't watch a movie, you'll just get mad. If you don’t know a lot about rolling a Humble comic strip, shoot another movie, don’t waste your time on this movie. I can not understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it. I will ask for a refund at my DVD rental store tomorrow.
