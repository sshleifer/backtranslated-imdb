This film is a special Pia Zadora! When viewing, I remembered a classic cartoon with a Hollywood star; badly needs another role, but is afraid to be a type for a movie or a soft porno role “B”; which says in her casting “Well, of course, I usually don’t do roles that require nudity, but if it’s artistically necessary for a film ................” This memory caused a very capricious image of a similar cartoon in which Pia said at such a session: “Well, of course, I usually do not assume roles that require actual play, but if it really gives me enough exposure to improve my status as a gender designation .................. "This is probably highly unfair, a rather dirty story - the mistake of the book by Harold Robbins; taking into account the nature of the story, Pia’s revelation is certainly don't get undue attention, and maybe pia (cat Paradise once won an acting award in Butterfly) deliberately makes fun of its role, rather than trying to play an almost unplayable role. more often the guilty parties. The real problem of the “Lonely Lady” is that the script, like the original book, is looking for a sensation, not an entity, and nothing can help with this. <br /> <br /> The screenplay of this film is terrible, but the question of whether the film could have been shot more successfully using the best script, direction, and truly competent action should remain a matter of personal judgment. As soon as it is released, my audience rating will depend on whether I value my personal opinion or how well the film successfully shows what it is aimed at. My personal rating for him will be two out of ten; but to some extent this film probably gives exactly what its sponsors expected, and judging by this, a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable. Being in a charitable mood and wanting to make it clear that I don’t blame Pia for my disappointment, I’ll put IMDb on four.
