I saw this film in a preliminary screening at the Beverly Hills Writers Guild Theater. As far as I remember, the producers and the director of the film were present, apparently, to evaluate our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes caused laughter in the audience, which would be nice if it was a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience is not afraid, it seems, the filmmakers. They delayed the release for more than a year. Out of curiosity, I saw it again, to see if they would cut it; as far as I can tell, they did not. It was the same lousy movie, just a year older. <br /> <br /> He almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good," but he is slow and boring.
