This film shows a clip on the injury of a living animal, when a machete cracked the animal and tore off its skin. I know that these terrible things happen in the world, but I watch movies based on the fact that what I watch does not actually happen on the screen. These live animal videos are not meant to be filmed in films, but to show people belonging to certain organizations to help the terrible things people do for other species. <br /> <br /> This should be banned and destroyed. I also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate on the release of this film !! <br /> <br /> This film should be removed from the public. The man who made this film needs psychological help.
