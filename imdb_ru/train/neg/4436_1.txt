I gave this movie a rating of 1 (Awful). The only reason he should even get 1 instead of a big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines, no matter what terrible stuff is thrown to him. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is so not in herself here, as the viewer, it is simply impossible to ignore the fact that she is even in such a part. <br /> <br /> Stupid, stupid story and horrible staging. DO NOT rent your video.
