I’m a guy who usually takes his opinion, but I just returned from this movie and felt I had to give my opinion. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what does a horror movie do? I'm sure I would like to see at least some good script and character development. I know that they often lack horror films, but the prom looked like there was NO effort in this department. Next we all love the unknown. The fact that on the edge of your chair awaits unexpected surprises. Yes, prom was nothing like that! Of course, we like the scary killer. Prom is what? No, he has a cute boy with a cute little knife. And when everything else fails ... at least, the horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable, like blood, blood, and the occasional naked scene! Yes, well, when you have a PG-13 rated horror movie, such as Prom Night, they also miss it. So, if all these elements are missing, I ask ... is it still considered a horror movie? Nope I would call it more comedy. People in my theater laughed at this more than when I saw “Poluprofi”, which was supposed to be a comedy (which sucks too, but that's another story!) I think that I just have to give up the new horror. All the good horror movies of the good old days were turned into rubbish so that film studios could earn money. The people I went with did not even know that this was a remake! What pissed me off! I wonder what will happen when there will be no more films that can be remade ??? Where horror will go on ???
