In his first screenplay, based on his own “Turn About” story, William Faulkner tells a bizarre story about loyalty, sacrifice and really weird relationships. Initially, the story was only about the characters of Ton, Yang and Cooper, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford on a different picture in order to fulfill her contract, and Faulkner was forced to create a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same cropped style as her colleagues in the film “Young and Tone”, which led to a great deal of unintentional gaiety, as these three communicate in the form of a telegraph, which sounds like a sketch of Monty Python ( "Wuthering Heights" (semaphore). Seriously, almost completely pronoun sentences force Ernest Hemingway to read like Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects some of the familiar themes of Faulkner, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as can be found in his "Sanctuary" and elsewhere). When Young invites Crawford in the presence of Ton instead of a wedding ring, ALL THREE are exchanged with engraved rings in childhood. The proximity of Ton and Yang is noticeable, especially when they go to the fate of Thelma and Louise. Honestly, it's creepy. <br /> <br /> However, it’s not as scary for this New Yorker as the recurring theme of Wellington’s massive cockroach, which Crawford happily catches (and which is depicted playing gambling over her hands - I had to turn away!) and young turns into a gladiator. Blech <br /> <br /> As the saying goes, there are some good performances. Young is particularly involved in the scene where he hits the Cooper fighter, and Roscoe Karns is amazing as Cooper's flying buddy. Ton, despite his inability to express himself in a realistic dialogue, has a pleasant moment, washing away his own hidden tears over the fate of his friend Young. Crawford, also devoid of meaningful dialogue, mostly looks like wooden or melodramatic, which is a rather balancing act for one role. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes — unsurprisingly, for the Howard Hawks film — are the most exciting part of the whole picture. But not enough. As I understand it, this is 75 minutes of my life, I will never come back.
