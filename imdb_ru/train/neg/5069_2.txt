I have a serious problem with this show, actually a few. As long as a simple list is enough, later I will go into details: superficial characters, a funny track, and boring humor. <br /> <br /> If you don’t want to look at the rest of it, look and just read it so you can feel better (as if you see something in this show that I haven’t seen) over the often annoyed teenager from Canada. TV audience for new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter, etc.). “Friends” are just as guilty in a reality show, “Two and a Half Men” and “King of Queens”, as are television executives. We now turn to the review. <br /> <br /> These characters have no soul, they are absolutely the same in all respects (off the floor and hair color). They react in the same boring situations and are completely protected in their bodies. Where is the conflict and humor that comes with it? Why isn't Rachel storming Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey think about suicide because no one takes him seriously? Oh, yes, because he is stupid and it is convenient for him. This is a curse to have perfect characters: long-lasting conflict and (God forbid) personality becomes impossible. <br /> <br /> The laugh track is the only thing that should have disappeared immediately after his birth. Any show that exists is almost certainly the opposite of ridiculous. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be a comedy, requires laughter from someone other than the audience, this should mean that the audience will not laugh without him. Laughtracks destroy humor, preventing quick returns. Humor becomes a construct, not a free flow (see Office, Arrested Development). <br /> <br /> This leads to the following point: humor is boring. There is no way to make the ideal character something more frivolous (no joke), simply because our everyday humor comes from the recognition of our shortcomings. So, if Monica is over 17 years old? She immediately admits that she is wrong and breaks up with him. There must be some kind of conflict, not an immediate solution. Maybe her mother will find out, or one of her friends is trying to get rid of him and eventually seduces him. It would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So, now I have presented evidence of my position. Many of my friends love this show because they have not heard about curbing your enthusiasm or arrested development; many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching curb your enthusiasm or arrested development. <br /> <br /> I have watched “Friends” very little in my life, but I have watched enough to discover the huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unnoticeable. If you read this far, thank you, and I hope that you at least start watching some of the shows that I mentioned.
