** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The dude in the Kong befuddled suit (the same one that was used in King Kong vs. Godzilla in 1962) gives most of the luffs in this mocking monster Kong resurrected on the island of Mondo and this time helps the blockbuster hero and other good guys. Like a vampire villain called Doctor Who ?? - funny, he doesn't look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally plays it with pride and joy Who, the giant robot monkey that looks like a bad metal sculpture by Magilla Gorilla. Like many Honda films, this may have had some merit before the American audience worked on this and added new shots. Animation company Rankin / Bass had a hand in this mess. They had to stick to the best children's programs, such as The Little Drummer Boy.
