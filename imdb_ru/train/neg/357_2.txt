JUST CAUSE demonstrates Sean Connery as Harvard University professor of law, Kate Capshaw (is she still getting a job?) As his wife (a slight difference in age) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern police officer (!) And Ed Harris in a completely unmatched performance about fundamentalist southern serial killer. <br /> <br /> Strange cast, but the film raises serious concerns among ** viewers. (do not read if you ever intend to seriously watch this movie or ever seriously watch this movie because of the spoilers) First of all, I felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at liberal stereotypes: all cops are sadistic and create this black guy without evidence . The coroner, the witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a professor at Harvard Law, who gives passionate reviews about injustice to blacks and against the barbaric death penalty. The convictâ€™s grandmother addresses him to defend him and resume the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery denounces (yawns ...) small-town officials and a good IL boys club, but finds that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, who is now on death row, was fabricated. The main evidence was his confession, which was knocked out of him. <br /> <br /> The beating was committed by a black policeman (!), who even played Russian roulette to get recognition from him. Connery learns that another prisoner sentenced to death actually committed the murder, and after several meetings with a serious margin, Hannibal Lecter, like Ed Harris, finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He is tried again, and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... the movie is over .... <br /> <br /> Then all of a sudden! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psychotic and that he used "white guilt" to enlist Connery's support. He came up with a story with Ed Harris in exchange for the fact that Blair committed several murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> Now Blair is free again, thanks to the misleading principles of PC Connery! Final 30 min. a strange action movie shot in a legal drama: Connery and Fishburn are fighting a serial killer in a house on an alligator's skin on stilts (yes, you read that right) in evergreen forests. <br /> <br /> It was one weird movie. <br /> <br /> So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, all the police are just hooligans and torture like Abu Ghraib, but the criminals are really psychopaths and deserve to be fried. <br /> <br /> Truly depressing at every level! The system is completely rotten, and people with white guilt feelings who dispute it are also seriously mistaken. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something like that.
