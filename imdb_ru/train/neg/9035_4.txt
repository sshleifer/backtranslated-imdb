Born in the 1960s, I grew up in the early 70s and watched TV "Movies of the Week," and I liked the creepy movies that were regularly shown, including Farm Krohaven, Bad Ronald, School for Girls Satan ”,“ Kolchak ”“ Night Chaser ”, etc., but this one is just stupid. Obviously, the author is trying to capitalize on the horrendous murders of Manson committed a few years earlier. Movie stars Dennis Weaver from McCloud and Duel have become famous as a father who goes hiking with his family to the beach. The family faces some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weaver’s pacifist position is hard to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat them or something, just don't sit around and don't complain about it. The acting game is pretty shit, an incredible story, and so on. D. Susan Day looks cute in a bikini, but that's about it. Ignore it if it will ever be broadcast on TV.
