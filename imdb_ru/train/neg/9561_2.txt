As many others have commented here before me, I must say that this film is bad, but not the worst I've seen. In this comment there will be no direct references to the plots or episodes of the films, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that I was watching an episode of a television show or something, where they got some extra $$$ to spend on CGI (I saw them worse) ... In general, it's pretty insulting to the viewer, at least if you have any knowledge about computers and / or technology in general, Too many such insults to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself just begging it to be over - quickly - halfway through. In addition, there are a lot of “easy way out” scenarios that also offend your mind as a thinking person ... <br /> <br /> This film completely fades compared to the old War Games, and I think it's damn ashamed that they even call it a sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me, because of one and only one: the performances of the actors are not so bad, given the burped nonsense of the script with which they had to work. However, they should never have subscribed to this film. Not exactly a career move, but I think we all have bills to pay. <br /> <br /> To those of you who got this film the best result ... you should be on a studio salary or something like that. My only explanation. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has not seen this: by all means, watch him and decide for yourself. But lower your expectations to the floor (and then some).
