This movie had such a promise !! What a great idea, a paintball team unable to win, fighting for recognition and personal fame, only to lose speed due to poor dialogue, poor editing and half-written story. Initially, the characters were interesting, only to lose steam halfway, to become one-dimensional people, belching tired only lines. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if they had spent more time on history and dialogue, it was a great film, and not an almost belated effort.
