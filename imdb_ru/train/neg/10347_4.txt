I just saw Adam, who had four sons for the first time, and it struck me that I think that Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons were the model used. They were about the same age as the four boys in this film. Warner Baxter, in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard, spoke about the same values ​​and family traditions that you could hear from our 26th President without some of the louder aspects of TR's character. <br /> <br /> Like TR, all the sons of Stoddard serve in the First World War, in this case, although the youngest loses only the eye, instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But what if a minx woman enters this male family and destroys things? This is Susan Hayward's work here. In one of his first prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious, immoral girl who marries one son, has an affair with another and begins to play a play for a third. This is an early harbinger of the part that later brought her the Oscar in the film I Want to Live. <br /> <br /> I believe that with such a powerful model of decency as Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter, everyone portrays, everyone is afraid to tell the father what is happening. Sons, as well as their governess Ingrid Bergman. That's where the plot gets a little silly. Bergman is introduced to us as the governess that Baxter and his wife Fay Ray hired for their children. Ray dies, and Baxter is undergoing some financial problems in business. Bergman must be released. She returns to France and after years returns to the family when the children have grown up. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can't believe that the children now need a governess. Hayward is absolutely right when she confronts her that it was not the children who brought her back. In the usual manner, Bergman would have continued her life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that from a quarter to a third of the film that I shot was edited. Perhaps this could be the cause of many of the holes in the plot that we have. <br /> <br /> It’s too bad that Ingrid and Susan couldn’t make another film in the fifties, when Hayward was on top, and Bergman had just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason for seeing Adam, who had four sons. And I am ready to believe that there is a lot of Ingrid left on the floor of the cutting room.
