well after watching it i can say that this is not the worst movie ever made, yes, people are worse there than this, there are some good moments in the movie, you can watch drunk teenagers, have terrible deaths, and cute, looking rats eating some kind of scientific experiment and becoming grotesquely huge, drunk cleaner, naughty doctor, and yes, a girl in underwear who has absolutely no shame, stupid athletes, I can't personally wait for the rat to eat these drunken fools, I was rooting for a rat for the last time, she was good th premise, the first part of the movie was interesting, though the scientific explanation of the rats, and small story, but I think it has deteriorated, when come into play dumb drunk excited teenagers. The rat, in my opinion, is the one that is lost, her name is Brenda, she was so fake, it must have been a ZHI rat, looked like a guy, dressed in a beaver, it was pretty stupid, limping, but not exactly terrible,
