If you have ever heard these three words spoken to you ... "Joe Don Baker", fear ... <br /> <br /> "Ultimate Justice" is a low-budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas town called Jeronimo (pronounced jeronimo). He is an ugly, slimy, rude character who hunts a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually falls twice in the film. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) goes to prison, like 4 or 5 times in this film, which makes the plot move to nowhere quickly. Plus, he shoots everything, as if he were in the wild west. I think no one told him that it was the 20th century. A policewoman must show him in Malta (she looks like Elaine from Seinfeld), and she is the only one who can come to terms with cattle. She must be mad! <br /> <br /> Strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Their dance is shown throughout the film, and I began to communicate with dirty women. Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo try to get something out of his way. The ending is erroneous and somewhat predictable, and I was happy that it was finally over. You will never forget this last line from Joe Don Baker's movie from the movie. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to imagine how he was in the Three Bond films ... very strange! In any case, if you want to laugh, then look at MST3K. In addition, I heard his other bad movie (among many), “Mitchell”, the MST3K version is being released on DVD from Rhino. I can't wait to see it!
