Russell Hopton starred in many films until his death in 1945. He took only 2, and “Black Gold” was one (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro sometimes had an abrasive screen, but in this he played a good kid. He was obviously quite popular in the circuit - he made so many films. In this, he plays the son of an old oil robber, who is convinced that he will soon hit the oil. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Burton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell off, because he knows that at any moment a blow will be dealt to the oil. Geologist Henry comes on the scene and helps his father, "Fishtail." He also convinces the Fishtail to go to school regularly. Henry looks at Cynthia, a pretty teacher. It was the last Gloria Shi film - she began her career as Olivia Shi in the film The Glorification of an American Girl (1929). Papa Fishtail dies when equipment is sabotaged, and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his minions to justice. When Henry is abducted, Anderson tries to convince the Fishtail to sell his oil lease. Everything ends well with blows of butter and a fish tail going to military school. <br /> <br /> This is normal for a rainy day.
