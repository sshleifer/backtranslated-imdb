Che's charisma and appearance have the same attitude to his cult as the misinformation spread about him by left-wing propaganda (for example, this film). <br /> <br /> I don’t know what’s worse: to be caught by one of the Che’s murder detachments or forced to sit for 4 hours of this typical Soderberg rubbish. The question is not why this favorite project was created, but what took them so long. By “them,” I mean, of course, left Hollywood and his “secret” love for Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... choose for yourself). I admire the fact that it took decades for one of the least talented liberal directors of Tinzeltown to finally embark on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand yet? It's a secret. All these overvalued “artists” often indulge in similar, politically one-sided projects, but Che Guevara, who is perhaps the most popular and well-known communist, for some reason was not yet their cinematic theme. <Br /> <br /> Partizan has all the distinctive features of an American believable history of an epic scale; Here you can find so many actual details, as in other similar Hollywood bio-budget political fairy biographies, such as “Malcolm X” or “Gandhi”, that is, almost none. The stars of the movie Del Toro as a famous Argentine revolutionary. However, no matter how controversial and criminal the actions of this person were, no one could take anything away from him: he was a smart manipulator from a rich family, so Del Toro responds only visually. Del Toro may be an interesting, charismatic actor, and he may resemble Guevara physically, but he does not highlight any intellectual qualities, so he makes Guevara too primitive. The use of such mediocre roles as Bratt, Phillips and Frank Incompetent only underlines the director’s lack of common sense. <br /> <br /> The film is for the most part very slow (which is not surprising) and visually uninteresting. Even a brilliant filmmaker like Kubrick would have thought carefully about releasing a film that went beyond the 3-hour mark, so it’s understandable that this Soderberg, having shot only one or two solid films and at the beginning of his career, would have thought His Oceanic Greatness fulfilled the task. If you think that the length of the film indicates that most of Che’s life has been shown here - think again. Soderberg focuses on Che's final stage, and most of the film is the tiresome jungle bullshit, full of Guevara's supposed idealism. (Psychopaths have no ideals.) I’m really interested in what type of mind this respected director should have in order to actually ignore some of Che’s early lives. Did he really find it too uninteresting? Massacre of 600 people are not interested in the viewer, eh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this eulogized charlatan would easily have placed not one but two full biographies in a 4-hour film. <br /> <br /> Soderberg, in a sense, becomes an accomplice, never turning to the negative, the dark side - which is more than 90% - Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy, consciously ignoring the ugly truth (God forbid, he should spoil the holy image of Che), Soderberg argues that he is not a humanist - a fake image with which most Hollywood and pop musicians struggle very hard for their career. to defend - but on the contrary: he is only concerned with the ideas, and not with the people on whom these ideas are tested (as in guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are the elite of the worst kind; such people often have a hidden contempt for the "proletariat" (what a stupid term) with which they allegedly lean. <br /> <br /> Half of all students in the world wear the image of Che on their red-orange shirts, but without even knowing why. He became a cult figure for ignorant, ignorant, very often young people who think that having this person’s face on his chest somehow makes them look “sharp”, intelligent, fashionable or interesting. In fact, wearing a T-shirt Che only underlines the general superficiality and complete disinterest in self-education. (Would you like to learn more about the person before you start advertising his / her face to the whole world?) Wearing the already made cliche of the Che image has become just as common as a cup of Bart Simpson coffee. All of these “four carriers” probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they ever read about Fidel Castro’s dead ally. <br /> <br /> After all that was done in the name of Marx, one would have thought that these “ideals” of the mongrels would have been completely buried. It seems humanity will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, the Iron Curtain, one hundred million dead, more than a billion people physically and / or mentally destroyed by this system ... so all this does not matter, eh? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro won the Cannes Prize should surprise only those who absolutely do not know how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote.
