This is one of those films that makes you wonder: Would the Hulk “The Real American” Hogan do the same? Honestly, I do not think so, and he would be right. I am Italian, I can not be proud of my country for many reasons, but I would not row for another team (for example, the French), simply because I am in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition, the main character falls in love not with a British girl at the end of the film, but with a compatriot, so why row against Yale University? As for acting, all players act very badly. And then, you know, I hated this atmosphere of a "society of dead poets." This is actually another movie I hate.
