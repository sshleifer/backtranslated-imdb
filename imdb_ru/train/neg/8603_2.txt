It could be a pretty exciting movie, but instead it is one of the other rags, such as Leech and Rest in Slices, at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. If they had played that click with a sneer, it could have been a very interesting film, for example, “Re-Animator” or “Dead ALive”, but Juan Pikor Simon plays him mockingly in some places, but just more often. <br /> <br /> The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. Next to the sewer line, there is an abandoned toxic waste dump, which turns slugs into aggressive, meat-eating monsters - although monsters that move slowly and can be crushed under your boot. Health inspector Michael Garfield and his two accomplices are the only people who seem to be ready to fight slugs, while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a riot of laughter — unintended in this — that makes you scratch your head about how stupid (actors and screenwriters) the slaying slaying scenario is. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (No New Reason) is scheduled here. Simon seems to mock the bloody elements, but the dialogue is direct. If Simon worked with a smart script - one with many one-liners and eccentric characters, this could be a cult film). br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You will not be disappointed here. We get a lot of explosive scenes in the chest cavity, as well as a huge head explosion in the middle of a beautiful Italian restaurant. Blood and guts, This is what many viewers like movies horror, here is in full swing. You also get the corpses of people that slugs removed, and many scenes with smashing slugs). <br /> <br /> Acting: $ (Wow, Michael! Garfield seems to know that this script is ugly, and he sends his lines with a facial expression, which suggests that he knows how ridiculous this movie shooting is ndeavor is. Kim Terry, like his wife, does an adequate job, even though she does little, except for screaming a little. “Teenagers” were terrible actors - no exceptions. Dude, this film could use Bruce Derna or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /> <br /> Nudity: $$ (Two teenagers are naughty in bed before they are sent - to bad about the scene made - because of the horde of slugs that crawled into the girl’s bedroom (here are both male and female nudes).
