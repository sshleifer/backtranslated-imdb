When this cartoon first went on the air, I got the impression that it would be at least half way down, man, I was wrong. I have to admit that watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all these years ago. I watched a few episodes, and in two of them, Batman literally kicked his ass to the left and to the right of Penguin, who fought like Jet Li, and knocked the shit out of Batman, and I watched another episode, where Batman again hit him with his backside Joker, which apparently used Jackie Chan's movements, rolling in the air like a ninja. Since when did the Joker or Penguin ever come to Batman? and even worse when Joker and Penguin Kung Fu were colleagues Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, sad and sad, as the image of Batman is portrayed in this show. The animation is terrible, and the dialogue is terrible. Being a fan of Batman since childhood, I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all costs, because it does not project the true image of Batman. This cartoon looks more like a Kung Fu Flick imitator, and if you really want to see the classic Batman cartoon, I highly recommend the Batman animated series, but this cartoon is nothing but a slice of S --- T! Take Batman: The Animates Series and donâ€™t waste your time on this cartoon.
