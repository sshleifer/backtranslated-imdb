I'm a big fan of Fred McMurray and Carol Lombard. And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (a very pleasant supporting actor) was in this film ... so why didn't I get much pleasure from this ?! Well, despite the good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd “pictures” I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent on making this film, it’s just shocking how reckless this job was. I knew that the film would be tedious, when from time to time at the beginning of the film I found that I EXACTLY predicted what would happen next - and I was always right! And this is not because I am a kind of “cinematographer,” but because there was almost no imagination or effort on this. In fact, it seemed that the film was just a long line of clichés connected together! Besides, I was a little annoyed that Fred had mistreated Carol throughout the entire film, and yet, in accordance with the rules, she eventually ran to him. Uggh! In the film, Lassi has MORE uncertainty (“will he lead people to save Timmy, or is the rope he hangs on a precipice?”). <br /> <br /> Despite the very, very tired and clichéd script, there were a few positives about the film. It was very cool to see how, at the end of the film, Fred looked like a broken lush - it was pretty believable, and he looked as if he hadn’t eaten, shaved or slept for several days. In addition, the “chatter” of Charles Butterworth provided some slightly humorous moments. But all this was not enough to make the film look different than the movie "B". It's a shame ... it could be much better.
