The film starred some of the best New Zealand actors, many of whom I saw in incredible roles, but this film fills me with deep shame, because I'm from the same country as they are. Fake American accents are the first clue that things are going to go terribly wrong. In another review, it is rather astute that the luxury cruise liner is actually an old car ferry, decorated with several multicolor flags stolen from a used car site. Most of the cast seems to be from Shortland Street's (excellent) long-running New Zealand soap. Itâ€™s as if this movie was shot at a Christmas party in Shortland Street, the result of too many gins and maybe a little salmonella. Imagine that Under Siege meets The Love Boat, staged by your local elementary school under the guidance of an autist, and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I recommend that you watch this film as a study on how to destroy your guardian.
