I was a fan of "Without a trace" from the premiere episode. I really can't express my disappointment in the episode last week. This is the PRESENT problem that too many afikano-american families have encountered and continue to deal with. The lack of media coverage in the first 48 hours was confirmed by a recent study. Law enforcement agencies, including local, state and federal, are also complicit. What was the purpose of advertising this item and then participating in the final? It would seem that television can deal with almost any subject other than race. This is shameful. Get it together or don't explore it next time.
