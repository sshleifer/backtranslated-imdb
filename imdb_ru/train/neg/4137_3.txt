I have a high level of tolerance for shit, so I was looking forward to it. It did not disappoint. Apparently, based on the classic Carmilla Sheridan Le Fan, he follows his father and daughter, hunting for a female vampire who, fortunately, travels with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or the general, as he likes when he is called here), running around at random zombies. Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak? The dead are coming back to life, but no one seems to be concerned. We have zombie builders, zombie soldiers, and even school zombies. Apparently, Santa Claus is looking for his daughter, who turned into a vampire. Oh wait, no vampires, the girl is in an insane asylum, and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she? The zombies are back, and Santa Claus is angry. Lesbian sex, I love vampires and zombies, but I especially enjoy lesbian sex. There is nothing better than any simulated cunnilingus to make juices flow. When will we see vampires fighting zombies? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here come the holy trine zombies. Chainsaw time !! More lesbian sex than zombies who kill and eat vampires. I think zombies won, or they? Plot? Who needs a plot when you have lesbian vampires and school zombies? What about cunnilingus?
