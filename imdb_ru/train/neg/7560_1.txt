How this movie could have missed so many exciting, complex, and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original film is truly remarkable. Incredibly thin and uninteresting plot, deep ankle characterization / motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing voltage with huge bands of noise, replacing mysterious musical references of the original to digitized failures and roaring. Then there are specific references to the original that are simply plastered over the cracks ... Awful. In a world where placid, brainless American remakes from Italian Work (tears appear), Get Carter (sobbing uncontrollably) and Alfie recently desecrated our screens, this one takes the notorious sponge cake. I am nonsense. As Ellen Burstyn ever got involved, this is a miracle ... Rubbish.
