In the first episode, Jared Diamond pointed out that other nations of the world did not have domestic animals other than Europeans, and this explains why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But then in the third episode, he says that when Europeans in South Africa were too far to the north, they encountered Zulu people and other tribes who “grazed cattle and planted crops”. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements, if they had the key things that, according to the author, are necessary for success? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims smallpox sprouts (black slaves brought to North America) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 local warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus * without a single loss * anyway, then I think you have to conclude that microbes don't matter. With or without microbes, we were going to succeed. <br /> <br /> He says that malaria prevented the Europeans from colonizing further north, killing "thousands" of Europeans, without affecting the Africans. (I would like to know the real numbers, but he does not say.) In the end, he says that today malaria kills thousands of Africans, and therefore they cannot catch up with us. So what is it, Jared? Malaria helped the Africans, stopping the Europeans, or hurt them? And how is it that everything is in order with Europe, despite the massive epidemics throughout our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems too eager to say that the reason Europeans succeeded was in silent luck. At times, when evidence threatens to overwhelm his theories of hooliganism, he does not want to admit that the Europeans may have succeeded because they worked for it. It is sad to look at this obvious neo-Marxist reality to try to prove your point.
