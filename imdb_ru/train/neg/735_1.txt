Five-year-old Michael sees his mother die from death from his father, the serial killer of Dorozhnik, who later commits suicide. “20 years later,” raised by Mike (Gordon Kerry, from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to the secluded home of his grandparents to “cope with their fears” at a Halloween party. Morty, a life-size wooden doll that the Indian master keeps in the attic, is obsessed with the spirit of a dead father and kills them using their phobias. Characters are thrown out of the window, drowned in the toilet, eaten by rats, blown up, and so on. D. Morty turns into dad and tree, walks around and makes silly witchcraft. After finding the girl, cut and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters remain in the house, having fun, joking and having sex. <br /> <br /> Morty’s design is good, and Betsy Palmer (Mrs Voorhees from Friday the 13th is amazingly amazing like a grandmother, but this thing is even more meaningless and confusing than the original, and is full of false fright, bad actions, brainless characters, repeated frames of memories and annoying distorted camera work. Plus only two minority characters (an Indian and a half black girl) die first. BLAH!
