The “mathematical” aspect of this is just a trick to try to distinguish this TV show from millions of other police shows. The only redemptive aspect of this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have (undeservedly) subsided after the North exposure, if he signed up for this choke. <br /> <br /> The rudeness of the “mathematical” aspect of the show is captured in one episode in the lead role of Lou Diamond Phillips (who only confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned.) To catch the fugitive, the “mathematician” uses some bubble theory. So he gives this long explanation that if we saw a suspect in places A, B and C, then we can use the “theory of bubbles” to figure out where he might be. He does it all on the board, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I can't remember). <br /> <br /> In any case, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three spots and chose a point right in the middle and said: “Well, mathematically, that's where we are most likely to find the fugitive.” At this point, another character points out: “Oh, that point also turns out to be the house where this guy lived.” Is it math? Its not even connect-f ** k ** g-points !!! This show reminds me of a major mathematician with whom I worked in banking, who had a mathematical analysis that he could do to “support” the points that everyone else had already agreed on with less complex analysis or common sense. <Br /> <br /> It just says that when you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can't wait for them to attach the NUMB3RS team to OSAMA ... They will use calculus, strike an air strike in the middle of the mountains, strike Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as a human shield ... Because, hey ... it's all about numbers. <br /> <br /> Absolutely ridiculous TV show.
