Some hound friends have recommended Live Feed to me, and, in principle, I cannot complain, because the film certainly delivers a huge amount of dirty dirt and buckets full of mud, but of course this is not a very good movie. More obviously, Ryan Nicholson is trying to surpass the rest of the movie in this sub-genre (and that includes the hostel and saw role models) with his sick and distorted makeup effects. and carefully corrupted photos of naked comrades, tested, suffering and begging for their lives. There is no actual plot to describe. Five completely brainless twenty-something friends go on a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but other than that I don’t know why they decided to go there and not to Cancun. They are clearly not interested in the culture of the continents and even cause a restless scene when they become witnesses of how a local meat puppy appears on the market. Subsequently, the quintet plunges into a sinister nightlife, and one of them accidentally insults the leader of the criminal clan. Simple apologies are not enough, as the gangsters follow them into the adult theater and gradually subject them to cruel torture. One girl had her chest pierced, and another poor girl even had a poisonous snake poisoning her throat; Clap. “Live Feed” is surprisingly boring, despite all the bloodshed, and amateur production values ​​are hard to miss, even if you are used to watching such independent fan films. The fat man depicted on the cover, the oriental executioner of S & M, is admittedly quite cool, and he is also the most talented of the whole group, because at least he keeps his mouth shut. I would definitely not recommend this pile of dirt, but, hey, if you like loud and disgusting metal music, sickening shots from torture and stupid losers, go ahead and look!
