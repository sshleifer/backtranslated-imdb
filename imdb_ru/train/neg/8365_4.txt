This is a simple story, but it is very manipulative. He lacks pathos, because he leaves no room for imagination, personal thought or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> Animation is well done, but I feel that it is too presentational. I would prefer more images in the back, more space in the background, and maybe then it would not seem to me such a kitsch. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood-style movie, this works fine, but it is very derivative from Aardman films, and it bothers me. Perhaps a longer movie will check if this producer can do without voiceover. <br /> <br /> I think the offscreen text is too glib.
