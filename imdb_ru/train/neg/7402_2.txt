This is a typical example of technically highly skilled video clips / commercials trying to shoot their first full-length film. On the one hand, the images, camera, lighting, CGI, and even the sound are very well polished and look really “expensive”. Even the actors demonstrate a certain potential - to such an extent that even the best acting can not hide a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, this is not a bad plot, but hardly a plot at all. <br /> Thus, 50% of the dialogue consists of "What the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?" In none of the cases, not one of the characters, nor the audience, received the slightest hint of an answer. In most other dialogues, there is a feeling that there has never been any book with dialogues, and the actors had to improvise freely in a plot that they were never explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason Sky Bennet’s performance can be so good that her character as an autistic girl did not allow her to give these tragic horrible lines of dialogue that other actors faced. Thus, she was able to show her acting talent, with which the other actors could not even get close. I mean that there is not a single actor in the world who could compensate for this dialogue: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is that true, eh? Emily: Stop it. Ben: Mass psychosis? John: Someone has to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation cannot be controlled. Not from you, from anyone. Emily: Not by you either. Ben: No, <br /> <br /> I have goosebumps. But not for horror, but for a terrible attempt. At some point I felt ashamed that the actors added this to their lives. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
