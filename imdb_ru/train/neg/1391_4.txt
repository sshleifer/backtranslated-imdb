Before this was done for a television film, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was done after the last episode of the show went on the air, and many of the originals of the show disappeared. There are no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'Kar or Lita. If you remember, in the second and last episode of the series, all regular customers, except Zack, Vier and Captain Lockley, left B-5 forever. Now for this film, they returned Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 film) to join Zach and the Captain, and the Doctor appears briefly and does not matter. But due to the fact that there is so much left of the old chemistry, this film is already seriously limited. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen), who is led to Babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that were stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of creepy things happen, but to be honest, everything was pretty stupid and pointless. Yes, yes, the station almost exploded, but it was saved and all that, but, frankly, I felt that it was a case "was made there - and made it much better in the past." <br /> <br /> The secondary plot provided more for comic relief was much more interesting as the entrepreneur installed a holographic brothel, and those who commanded were not sure what to do with it and when they tried to force them to close , they were hit with a suit. It was nothing, but it gave a few laughs - something that the other conspiracy must have missed. <br /> <br /> By the way, Shin at first perfectly played “Due Hunter” - with his wild eyes and strange delivery. However, repeatedly throughout the episode, he dropped out of character. This should have been noticed and corrected. <br /> <br /> So the final verdict is that it is only for tough B-5 nuts (like me). Others who see this might suggest that the series is sucked - which is a big injustice. This is a great example of how the show does not know when to quit smoking.
