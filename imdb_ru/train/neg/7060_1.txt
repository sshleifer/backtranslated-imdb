this movie is terrible Characters are completely incredible and wildly inconsistent. The plot is terrible, and some scenes in the classroom are worthy of terrible noise and create inconvenience when watching. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and characteristics suggest that this film was written only by high school students. total lack of trust in the school environment suggests that, in fact, writers probably never went to high school. Acting in most cases, too, was weak, although this was largely due to the poor script and plot, I'm not sure that any actors could make this film watchable. <br /> <br /> Saying that the sound track was fine and the cinematography was good in some places (although the editing was bad).
