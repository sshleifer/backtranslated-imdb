REALLY? REALLY???? I know that if you make a film about political war, you will be noticed, but this film was just rubbish. Awful in every sense. Terribly inaccurate in many ways. It's easier for me to believe that the president of the United States is dressing, flying a jet fighter and shooting down aliens. It's easier to notice a few things right. My jaw dropped when I saw someone say that this film was the best in the last 25 years. It was an excessive, seemingly senseless rejection of the plot, and from time to time he had dubious cinematography. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT utilities ?? Has anyone verified that these things were not in 2004? Not that you had to do extensive research, this film was released just five years ago. I am a war veteran in Iraq, and if you spent ONE day with an infantry platoon or an EOD squad, you would understand how B.S. this film is there. Comparing this with the platoon or rescue of Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why don't you add both the Commando and the Red Dawn there? I think they may be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see historical and actual discrepancies outside the incredible plot, this film may just be normal. Nothing more. If you continue to hear an Oscar buzz, and you need to add your pompous feedback, continue. As for me, Iâ€™m writing to the director to see if I can return my 131 minutes ago.
