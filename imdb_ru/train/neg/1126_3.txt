I rented it, thinking it might be interesting, and it may have been an interesting story, except that it was told in such an uninteresting way. It's hard to trace, weird editing, incoherent plotline, mumble of characters - and all this is a terribly boring waste of time. I just could not understand it, and I didnâ€™t care what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm could not save this film. If you do not need a cure for insomnia, I would miss it. 3/10, and it is generous.
