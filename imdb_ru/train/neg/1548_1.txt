Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no film production business. <br /> <br /> You might think that after such dark films “Superstar”, “Night at Roxbury” and “Coneheads” he begins to understand that maybe he doesn’t know what he does when it comes to movies (and many argue that he does not know what he does when it comes to television). Attempts to make feature films from scenes that are worn out by him for the third time when they were shot on SNL do not make sense. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like Tim Meadows, and I think he would be great in the right movie. It's a shame to see how a talented guy is wasted in the film, which featured unfunny after unfunny situations, and links it all to a terribly bad song and dance scene. Any laughter here will be caused by the fact that the film is so bad, and not because it is funny. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who never make films about them. , The only pity is that this came out on the big screen.
