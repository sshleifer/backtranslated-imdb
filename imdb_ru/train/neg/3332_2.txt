I bought this movie on sale, so I didn’t expect it to be a horror movie on the same level as “Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984) or “The Hills Have Eyes” (1977), but I thought it was still be pretty nice to watch. However, this was not entirely pleasant, but instead the acting and general cinema was mocking, for example, how the “invisible killer” kills its victims and how all the dead people turn out to be young blonde. women. It was a stereotypical horror film. I say this for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blondes are in danger, most die. 2) One survives, crawling in the dark, pursued by a murderer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes in the form of a gun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple moments, I saved you two extra hours by summing up this bad excuse for a horror movie, so now you're lucky enough to not watch it.
