Holy shit It was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. All the performances are in order, but there is no plot. Indeed! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that, and this is your movie. Ug ... The character of Robert Duvall is senile and continues to ask the same people the same questions over and over again. It earns him the same answers over and over. Iâ€™m pretty sure that this movie reached six, because people think they should like it. Good performances with well-known and respected actors, but the real full work is a double turd. Well, maybe this is a bit deceptive, as steam rising from a fresh pile, sounds a little like something going on and in this film DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYTHING! Bag
