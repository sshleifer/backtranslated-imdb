I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would try their sister, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry checking it out. She was confused, and the film just has this weird plot, if that's what you want to call. Sissy was just weird, and Jelle just sits in the toilet that sleeps with this old man in the mountains, what happens? I have never been so dissatisfied with my life. It was just rubbish. I can not believe that the actors agreed to make such a waste of film, money, time and space. Sissy is not up to me to be "beautiful". I thought she was everything but that. These thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHAT'S THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, the shame that the poll does not have 0 does not even deserve 1. I hope Rain is better in other films, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean, that I could not have done better with this film.
