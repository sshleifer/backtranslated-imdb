I do not often watch such a terrible film like this one. I kept watching, every minute hoping that it was intended as a joke, only to understand that this must be taken seriously. Well, as seriously as the genre requires. <br /> <br /> The game was shameful, and the situation is terribly contrived and clich√©. If the film was shot in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its own direction, we would think that the movie was naive then. It so happened that this film was shot in 2000, and I still have to watch a film of the era of silence, which has the same charm as this one. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the serious movie goer. /> <br /> [Do not evaluate]
