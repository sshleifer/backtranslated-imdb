This is one of those cheap TV movies in which characters lose all meaning. The background of the story, the kidnapping of a son by the boyâ€™s father, is very good. But the story does not seem to be believed. Whenever mothers are advised not to do anything that you know well, she will do it. It is a bit far-fetched and not worth viewing.
