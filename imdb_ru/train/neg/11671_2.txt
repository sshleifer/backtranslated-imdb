Do I need to say - this is smelly! (I gave him a grade of 2). <br /> <br /> View it only if you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There are many landscapes chewing and chewing on him, but nothing else happens in this movie. Here there is no obscurity, no deep, shocking secrets, no real threat to the heroine’s well-being. A few disagreements, a small increase in votes - that's all. Secrets are something that could not happen to anyone - the last “secret” revealed in the film is quite predictable at this point. <br /> <br /> The plot for which it is revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), an artist who was hired to paint a series of murals in a huge ballroom in a huge mansion a very, very rich elderly widow and the growing mother / daughter relationship that an older woman craves for her. <br /> <br /> It turns out, the daughter of an older woman, Cassandra, is dead. You can put the other parts together quite well. <br /> <br /> Even a scene with a mysterious person threatening our heroine does not advance to such an extent that you really fear for her safety, perhaps in a second or two. Why he is still hanging out years after Cassandra’s death is a good question. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of the fact that in this huge mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler, who seems to be doing everything ... to cook, clean, serve food, answer the door, etc. All, except, apparently, locking the door - as this will be the only explanation of how one of the characters simply enters the room where Vera is. <br /> <br /> Nothing will make you grab the armrests of the chair and lean forward to the edge of the chair, because there is no "growing" tension in this film - only soft, pitiful revelations that are thrown out from time to time. <br /> <br />
