The end The game started well, the less said about the end, the better. it seemed that the things we are doing just to keep the story going, for example, a reporter who is at first a very inquisitive, intelligent person, does something really stupid halfway through and is completely out of his mind, we are not given a reason for this except Moreover, the next scene would not make sense without it. This story could be told in about 30 minutes, it would make the average political drama on television. However, the brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable, and James Woods does a wonderful job with his work. <br /> <br /> The End The game was, frankly, one of the worst films I've ever seen ...... and that says something, I saw Gigli.
