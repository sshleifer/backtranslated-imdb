In fact, this has never happened. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate the comedy of the 1940s. What a dummy! None of these people approached Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., and in any case, today's public is not so susceptible to this light dirt. Writing is trivial. The hackneyed plot is subtle and obvious. Chemistry between the leading characters does not exist. Interestingly, Julia Roberts seems to think that she is the reincarnation of some big star from the golden age of Hollywood, whenever that may be. She is trying and cannot achieve this effect again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
