The killer of the zodiac. 1 out of 10. The worst game in history. There is no really worst acting ever. David Hess (“The Last House on the Left.” No, the one in the seventies. Renting it is really good) is the worst of the group (Fairly tough competition, but he is terribly God-fearing.) . The film actually stuns a painful halt when on screen. <br /> <br /> It’s not that the film has any redemptive qualities that Mr. Hess could destroy. He filmed on a home movie camera and, apparently, quite old complete with a built-in microphone. Post-production either. C'mon, there must be some kind of spade that a five-year computer can use that could clear this picture. Add fancy videos about the autopsies and takeoffs of the aircraft carrier, and this is one visually spoiled image. The autopsy pictures are inserted in the way that Italian cannibal films reflect these horrible animal killings in real life. And the Navy personnel must be an anti-war statement (because we know that all bloodthirsty maniacs join the fleet) What in the world do the Lion Gate, releasing this garbage? It would embarrass Throm. The plot about the killer of the zodiac (the last time he was seen in “Dirty Harry.” None of the seventies. A ride, it's really good) Someone got a shot in the stomach in Los Angeles, and the police assume that the killer of the zodiac is back Yeah. What can we expect from a film in which it is not known that DSM IV is a book, not a mental disorder, and where is the relationship between a young murderer and an older person reminiscent of the relationship between a congress page and a closed congressman? Yes, eighties haircuts and production values ​​correspond to Nambla subplots. Write me down.
