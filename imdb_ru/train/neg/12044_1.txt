Let's go watch the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here is what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief and history in general, Greek men were not gay. EVER. This was clearly established immediately at the beginning of the film and intensified every five minutes or so later on. So it’s safe for American guys to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen Troy has always had perfect hairstyles and makeup. She looked great in all of her short cameo scenes, which, although numerous, were probably filmed on the same day, one after another, with the director who said, “Ok, now you look beautiful ... good. .. well, now you look scared ... well ... now you look depressed ... well ... now you look interested ... well ... now you look beautiful again ... well ... "<br /> <br /> Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those who had American accents could not act. <br /> <br /> The Trojans looked the same as the Greeks, but they usually stayed on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not blink the camera. <br /> <br /> Helen Troy's biggest phrase was: “They follow me.” <br /> <br /> The Trojan music sounded great, like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt’s hips rise to the bottom. <Br /> <br /> Achilles had a young friend with whom he was very close, but this is normal. They were cousins. Never mind what the story says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell the whole story with one expression. <br /> <br /> The Trojan gods obviously had Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole as drag. <br /> <br /> Greek men never touched each other until they fought like American men. <br /> <br /> All the thousands of extras in the movie They had exactly the same skin color ... Bright Egyptian, from Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy had only three women. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of fair-haired Greeks, and this is good news for Brad Pitt, who otherwise would really straighten up. <br /> <br /> Despite their coastal desert terrain, the Greeks had a supernatural ability to find an unlimited amount of wood for making fires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and the like. <br /> British actors look stupid with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes the expression on his face only when the sun is shining in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers fought constantly but their outfits always looked flawless. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Greek temples were always in ruins, even when they were new.
