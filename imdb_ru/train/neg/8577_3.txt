I knew my resume would get you. How does this movie look like on Pat Rock and Disco ?! Well, if you did not survive the 1970s or 80s, you probably won’t understand why WHY someone would like to buy a new Coke or buy Pet Rock (and, frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I still do not fully understand this). These are just a couple of things that seemed to make sense at the time, but really confusing the younger generation. The same can be said about Kay Kieser and his group. At that time (mainly in the 1940s), they were very popular and had enough influence to make a studio in this film with Boris Karloff, White Lugosi and Peter Lorre. Nevertheless, if you did not live at that time (it was long before my time), you wonder why someone likes such “entertainment”. In the end, Kieser and his group mates are incredibly disgusting, and their humor is very, very broad (that is, ingenuous and stupid). Honestly, I could not tolerate their antics, nor did I appreciate the fact that there were too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the magnificent cast got the back seat, and fans of these actors are likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In the film, Kaiser and the group come to the mansion, where a young lady and her stupid actor aunt are alive. Once there, the bridge is blurred and strange events begin. In the end, this ends with some assassination attempts on Sally’s life and a seance (of a kind). This is all played for laughs - and this is really not a horror movie, despite the actors. <br /> <br /> In general, this is, at best, passable entertainment. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I, of course, felt deceived because I was following Kizer and his stupid.
