The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium, everything is in order: you see real chaos on the set, the producer is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, the director (Mickey Rourke) was bad, the short-tempered star was bad, etc. Youâ€™ve already seen everything but it is well done. BUT THEN! The rest of the time, the film simply repeats itself: the same ten minutes over and over again. There is no culmination, there is no dramatic development, there is no good acting skills, even bad acting skills, it just goes on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good moments when his character talks about his damn career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. In general, this is 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
