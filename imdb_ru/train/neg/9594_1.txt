I signed up for IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching this movie, and the only thing that impressed me was that I had the willpower not to stop it. <br /> <br /> I’ve seen a pretty decent amount of action films and what’s not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I’ve ever seen in a movie. Most of the battles on swords include mindless swinging of swords back and forth and hope that the enemy does not do the same. I have seen many good student films with better action films and more powerful stories. <br /> <br /> So now we have a “futuristic” fighter with a bad fighter and practically no signs of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the film has no action at all and shows a developing relationship with the princess and the farmer / terrorist and his worried sister. In the film, several plot lines, and none of them justified themselves. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem was that I was watching the dub, which was pretty bad. The whole cast has muttered all their lines, so it was difficult to follow what was happening. But I have a general idea. (The exact knowledge of what was said would not have saved the film in my eyes). <br /> <br /> If you heard about a futuristic action movie or a ninja, then you are mistaken. That's what I was thinking when I heard about it, and now I have lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen to you. Stay away from that.
