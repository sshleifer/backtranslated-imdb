I decided to watch this show after seeing its endless commercials on the BBC a few weeks before it began. I watched it, despite the fact that I do not like such pretentious things that Alan Hollinghurst writes (excuse his fans, but I think we have a case of emperor's new clothes with the work of this author). I admit that the acting was great, it was superbly filmed, and it quite reasonably entertained me - however - I found that the plotline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes I feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. “Explicit” gay sex talked about by the media has already been done on television - several times - so I'm afraid it was not shocking. I'm afraid of full marks for production values, but low for the storyline / content.
