It gets two, because I liked it as a kid, but it became so redundant that I just started to hate it ... I can't give it a descriptive review, because it will recreate one after another, I probably will not Do not say anything that everyone else has not yet said. <br /> <br /> The only thing that still exists in this series is that it is rather unpleasant, with the child brought to the boil of this perverted nurse, to nonsense, running around and about in this. I have a cousin who loves this show, and he is the strangest and stupidest man I've met. This show must be removed from the air. It's always the same thing over and over again ... They have to put the best shows on Nick. I am very tired of such things.
