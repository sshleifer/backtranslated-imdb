Phenomenal achievement in horror. It really is terrible fun. <br /> <br /> First ... Nicolas Cage must have now reached the final in the category of "Over-Emoting" in his acting class. Dressed in new hair plugs and with a face that has been raised so many times, his pinched hind ears seem to be tense to touch his back, he not only highlights the sickly clever man, but also creates a hero-hero in which you are not interested. <br /> <br /> I don’t know what happened to Neil Laboute and the female characters. He makes women absolutely deviant and evil ... and pays them that Cage beats them right in the face and calls them "b **** es" several times. I liked LaBut's early films and several of his plays ... but this is his strange passion. <br /> <br /> I would give this film 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn’s performance. By the time she finally appears (boldly struggling with her scenes, when her wig line is clearly visible on her forehead), it seems all hope can be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a calm face, and when she appears in a white mumu with blue and white and gold facial buzzing around the Wicker Man, you know that working with Scorsese and Friedkin really prepared her for this role damn good. <br /> <br /> This film is so fool and cuckoo that you need to believe it. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Nicolas Cage runs away from a swarm of bees, and then falls off the hill. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage steals a bicycle and looks like Miss Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding her. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage runs around the island kicking the door in search of the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Lily Sobieski floats from a once-promising acting career in a fight with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dances in I said, while mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage shouts, “Who burned this? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? ”For no reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I’m not joking) runs through the woods, takes off his costume (but leaves the bear’s legs), and then does some karate exercises for some villains. <br /> <br /> And you didn’t live until you saw the last 15 minutes of the film and its terrible epilogue, which looked as if it was taken yesterday in the basement of your cousin. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that if you can get through this movie without laughing out loud, then you deserve a medal. In fact, there was a moment in the film when I stopped giggling to wonder if it was a carefully thought-out film “hysteria” ... just to remind Cage to scream / scream / whisper his dialogue, that he really belonged to take yourself very seriously. <br /> <br /> I think that this film is again doomed to a cult film ... simply because it is terrible.
