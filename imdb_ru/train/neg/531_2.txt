With this list of actors, I expected much better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the film lying in bed. The best actresses in the world can not do something very interesting, if their acting is limited to the fact that they lie and fall asleep throughout the film. The story says that the daughters reveal the secret when their mother approaches death. The fact is that she never tells her daughters anything but mysterious advice to be happy. All relationships in the film are underdeveloped. I also felt that there was no need back and forth between the past and the present. It seemed that the idea was stolen either from the Da Vinci Code book, in which the device was used to increase uncertainty, or from the Notebook, in which they used the device to create an endless romance of the main characters of the story. In any case, it was a cheap device in this film, because it created nothing. It was a way to try the unknown in a film in which it does not exist. I left the question why good films cannot be written for women. It really was a disappointment.
