I really would like to be negatively voted for, because I think I spent 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever made. the acting was just awful, I mean REALLLYYYY bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded like it was written ... I can't think of anything terrible to say. And daytime “outside” and nightly “inside” frames make you think that events took several days. He acted terribly, directed, wrote, and so on. D. And so on. Up until the gofer gets lunch for everyone. Stay away from this at all prices. If my only saving grace to stay in hell is to do one good deed, tell the world that he should not watch this nonsense. This film is the exact reason why horror films are never taken seriously.
