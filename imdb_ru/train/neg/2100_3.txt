You might think that the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough, without having to invent something about it. However, this documentary, it seems, should show everything in the most terrible light. It talks about the risks associated with the lunar module, and mentions Armstrong’s near-fatal accident with a training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had something to do with each other. This makes the problem of overloading the computer (alarms 1202 and 1201) that occurred during the final landing sequence sounds almost like a disaster when it was just annoyance, and not a risk to the crew at all. Thirty seconds is required to mean that there are thirty seconds of fuel left before the fuel runs out, whereas in fact it is thirty seconds before the interruption is mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the documentary or the dramatization of Apollo 11, go to “From Earth to the Moon” or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
