When the movie started, I was shocked to see that it was shot using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera is trembling and looks worse than the average home movie. Even direct movies on DVD should be better than this one! Hell, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have better performance! Too often, the film seems to be seriously done when you attach the camera to a tripod and turn it on without an operator! Close-ups and everything that resembles camera work is missing in some scenes where they could work, and in others there are too many or poorly-designed close-ups. Yecch! <br /> <br /> A film about two gays who want to get married. As if this was done almost a decade ago, their only option is to marry in Vermont - times have definitely changed. However, the recent adoption of same-sex marriage in no way can be attributed to this film - in any case, it rejects supporters of same-sex marriage instead of help, because the film stinks and never tries to seriously address this issue. According to the film, religious people are one-dimensional idiots who carry the Bible EVERYWHERE and shoot people, as well as wives who have cheerful husbands who are not distant when they learn that their spouses live by deception. I am sure that I am glad that this gives an honest chance to both parties in this matter! <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there is no professionalism in the film, and I don’t even dare to call it a film. It’s more like a home movie and doesn’t even deserve being included in the IMDb list or even included in the list of the 100 worst films of all time. The action is terrible, the writing is terrible, the direction (if it exists at all) is terrible, the camera work is terrible and the plot is terrible. This is a home movie !! I cannot say anything positive about this, except that because of this, Ed Wood’s films seem to be Oscar’s rivals in comparison, and I’m sure that Mr. Wood’s ghost smiles every time someone watches this mess! <br /> <br /> I don’t care if you are gay or nature - this film isn’t worth your time, and I don’t know how they managed to create its DVD. I assume that one of the actors burns them on his home computer in his spare time! Seriously, this gives a new meaning to the word “bad”! <br /> <br /> By the way, if one woman in the film were a real attorney, would not the ability to read be an important prerequisite ?! I'm just talking. <br /> <br /> Finally, if same-sex marriage is such a serious and important topic, can't we have a film that is BETTER than IT, which solves the problem ?! This, unfortunately, only causes laughter.
