You were confused and beaten by my harsh statements about the movie "Fatal Woman" / "Guns N 'Gals"! Now comes another breed of disappointing discoveries: ninja films! Many of them I have seen before, and let me tell you that this is not all that is needed! They usually do not adhere to the essence. This, among other things, does not suffer from originality! What does the ninja have to do with preventing a nuclear catastrophe in Russia? And shouldn't it be a martial arts film? How many shooting sounds to you like an incredible fighter? Is blood the main cause of love of death? Will you spend some of your hard-earned money on the lady singing in her transparent t-shirt? Answers to these important questions can be found in the NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. For even more nonsense ninja, try watching Godfrey Ho films released by Trans World. You get what you deserve and that is a promise! Only recommended for hardcore ninja addicts!
