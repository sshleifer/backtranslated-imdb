Of the three names of Jess Franco, who are on the official list of the nasty DPP videos (Devil Hunter, Blood Moon and Women Behind Bars), this is perhaps the least reputable reputation of a terribly boring jungle fool, vivacious only very slightly inept blood, causeless scene of rape and nudity. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfelner plays movie star Laura Crawford, who is kidnapped by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a wild tribe worshiping a “god of the devil” hiding in the jungle (a large, naked, exhausted tribe worshiping a goddess of the jungle (hidden from the jungle) who loves to eat the hearts of sacrificial female sacrifices). <br /> <br /> Used by agent Laura to deliver a $ 6 million ransom, the brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Kliver) and his fellow veteran from Vietnam travel to the island, but face problems when the bad guys try to make a double transfer . During the confusion, Laura runs off into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island’s local people, who offer it to their god. <br /> <br /> Franco directs it in his usual sluggish style and loads this ridiculous effort with his usual horrible trademarks: crappy blood, grim cinematography, zoom in, numerous cropped shots, out of focus images, terrible sound effects and editing fists. The result is a terrible mess, which is a real struggle to survive from beginning to end (it took me several sessions to finish the job), and even a single glance of juicy Buchfelner in all her natural glory is not enough for me to return to this film in a hurry .
