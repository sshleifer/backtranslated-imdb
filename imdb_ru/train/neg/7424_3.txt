A very, very funny movie fare when Stella Stevens takes instructions from a disguised person (it didn't take me long to figure out who he was) in Old Nevada, near Vegas, for stealing money at the Circus Circus hotel in Las Vegas . Stevens leads his three-person maiden gang, and they discover that they must act much faster than expected. Despite some neat looks at Las Vegas in the 70s, a very average, but trustworthy game of the majority of participants, and a storyline with potential, the Las Vegas Lady lays one big boring egg. It seems that the film will start forever, and when he does, he just rattles here and there and never accelerates. I was somewhat disappointed with this film. Of course, I did not expect anything great, but at least I thought that this could be one of those neat films about the exploitation of the 70s or something like that. Not even close. No one dies. Between the squeaky Stuart Whitman and the official George DiChenzo, one year before his grand appearance as prosecutor of Baglios, Helter Schelter is in an indiscriminate firefight. The shootout has all the expectations from observing a waterfall. One hit and a head kick with a blunt instrument. Beyond that, nothing in terms of action. As for the girls, do not expect much there either. Stella and her girls (both very mediocre, but rather talented, go to the sauna and bath. What do we see? Nothing but a passing side profile. Stella wears these lovely open blouses, emphasizing her real talents, but I would like her to be slightly more frankly with her performance. So I could write one thing that would recommend a film. Alas, this did not happen, and I can say little in favor of this film. This is not a horrible movie anyway, this is just nothing going on for this.
