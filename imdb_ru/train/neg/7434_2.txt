If this is based on a real life relationship between Miss Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am very glad that I donâ€™t know them personally This is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills during the whole movie while the theme song plays in the ground. Many silly scenes with people who behave stupidly do not do a comedy.
