“Algi, Shakhtar” is one bad and unfunny silent comedy. Headlight response time is completely disabled. This is a kind of humor with certain episodes that make you wonder if they should be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film does not matter. This is a must-watch for movie lovers, because it is one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The protagonist of Algie - effeminate guy, acting in many ways as a stereotypical "pansies", characteristic of many early films. The film has a homophobic attitude, characteristic of that time. "Algi Miner" is pretty terrible, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
