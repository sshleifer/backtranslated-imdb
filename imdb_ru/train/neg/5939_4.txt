I thought the film was fine, but very disappointed that they didnâ€™t capture his true lifestyle. I was waiting for his mother to become a real Jamaican, and it drives me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. Which I completely lost interest in just a few seconds from the beginning of the film. I am very disappointed, it's like watching a biographical story about Mark Anthony and Arnold playing a role. I do not know what the writer was thinking about, missing the valuable fragment of the film, which, I am sure, his mother played a huge role in his life. I will say that the film was fine, except for the main Fla !!!!!!
