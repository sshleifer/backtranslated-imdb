Peter Fonda is so deliberately agitated as an actor, that his tearful line readings rule out any irony or humor in the dialogue. He exchanges sassy beards and an imprudent repeater with Brooke Shields, as if he were a wooden block with a hairline; even his smaller touches (for example, going through non-existent mustaches on his gray face) do not reveal the character as much as an unsure actor whose director is himself, an unsure director. In the south-west around 1950, a poor player (not to mention a little deception) wins an orphaned, future Lolita in an unsuccessful poker game; After receiving a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon, the two quarrels become scouts. Some wonderful perspectives and a strange, but interesting cameo Henry Fonda as a man with gray canyons is the only compensation in a weary comedy drama, where two heroes pursue cartoon killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on it. map. Shields is very beautiful, but - although the camera loves her plump, glossy beauty - she has no screen presence (and her tin voice has no range at all); every time she opens her mouth, everyone is inclined to either cringe or duck. * 1/2 of ****
