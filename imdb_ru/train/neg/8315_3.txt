What a missed opportunity to actually make an interesting film on a complex topic. There is very little research on what it really is to be a direct (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. Dancers continue to talk about their art, as if it had no erotic component. Not all of them can be prostitutes for hire, but they are really sex workers who act out fantasies and sell private lessons where more is offered than dancing. The film gives the impression that they mostly appeal to women who go to gay clubs and then hire “dancers” for private sessions. Even shots in the club show only women in front of the stage, and “dancers” play only with women in the hall. It is simply not the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to earn a living by private dancing for straight women and couples. So what do they really think about their gay fans and customers? We learn very little. Instead, we get a filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of direct dancers. The manager, who tells us about the costumes for the dredge, but does not give an idea about the life and relationships of dancers. <br /> <br /> Photos of Mexico City are common. A phallic montage showing sausage frying is confused. <br /> <br /> This is an absolutely simplified film that should interest only those who want to see some photos of dancing cute boys. The rest of the film is an insult to gay people.
