Absolutely ridiculous movie. I live in London, and the plot is so poorly understood that it is ridiculous. No one could be terrorized in the London Underground. For a short time, it does not work every night, there are teams of service personnel who check the tracks and carry out repairs, etc. The fact that homeless people live there is also unlikely. Or, that in this day and age you can even lock yourself up and not have access to a mobile phone ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing that can happen if someone gets there after the last train is that they can get graffiti on them. Although it was under control due to the huge number of security cameras on the network, another problem in this story. (Remember that in general in London we have more CCTV cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If it were installed in a city that I donâ€™t know, I might enjoy they are unknowingly, but this is not a high-quality film, so I just could not bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try to enjoy it because of the banal little story that exists. <br /> <br /> I would give 0/10 if such a rating existed! Perhaps the most disappointing movie I ever thought I would like.
