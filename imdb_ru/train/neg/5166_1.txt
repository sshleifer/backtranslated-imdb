A horrible game, a lame plot, a wacky story and just a horrible movie around - sums up this part of the junk. Sitting was painful. Just awful. Do not spend a penny on it. Cinemas should feel bad due to the fact that they release this film for viewing by people. This horror film was not even scary, creepy or disturbing. It was in no way attractive. Acting was so terrible for all actors that any attempt to draw you into the film through dialogue is completely destroyed at the moment when the actor / actress opens her mouth. Plus the whole story, I do not know why someone made a film with this story again. Do not waste your time and money. Even if it’s a free ticket, don’t waste a minute to watch this movie. You will feel nonsense watching this.
