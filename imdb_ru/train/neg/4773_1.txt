very good plot, good thrill ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? very well done and a good story destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry, but 1 vote ... that's what it deserves, I think Chris Chadley could come up with a better result ... but maybe next time :) all this senseless blood, bloody emptiness? The end will raise the story to almost 10, but this is not so ... the end has ruined the whole story, I think most people are not lame, and when they go to the movies, you want a good ending, even if it is difficult ... but the only one is lame here is the end ... sorry
