I made this film, expecting a little laugh, hopefully enough to entertain me, but I was very wrong. This film showed very minimal moments of humor, and pitiful jokes made me cringe with shame for hiring him ... Directed in the age group of 10-15 years, this film will certainly leave viewers beyond these limits very dissatisfied. For those who do not want to spend 2 hours of their lives, it costs no more than 3 votes.
