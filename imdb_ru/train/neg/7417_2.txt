This film is so bad - the dialogues, stories, actors and actresses are everything! - it's hard to imagine that we will see the worst film this year or in subsequent years. “Brother of love” (established in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but superficial clichés about Italian culture, and this means that even Italians from Italy and Italy speak English in the film. The message of the film - ugly people should marry ugly people, beautiful people should marry beautiful people - really unpleasant. Giovanni Ribisi is quite good at films like “Suburb” or “Lost in Translation”, but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Rubbish like a trash can!
