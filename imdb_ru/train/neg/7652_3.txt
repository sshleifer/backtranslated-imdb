In 1967, the miners found the remains of an ancient, vanished civilization named Abkani, who believes that there are worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gates between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped before the gates were closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Bureau for the Study of the Paranormal 713 was sent by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who experimented with orphaned children. Today, one of these children is the paranormal researcher Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just received an Abcani artifact in South America and is being pursued by a person with abilities. When an old friend from a foster family disappears in the middle of the night, he tells us that the demons are returning to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Alina Sedrak (Tara Reid) and the head of the Bureau 713, command. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his squad are fighting against evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Despite the charismatic cast of good, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in Dark" never works and is a complete mess, without character development or plot. The reason can be explained by the “brilliant” interview with director Uwe Boll in “Extras” on DVD, where he says that “video games are bestsellers of the younger generation who are no longer driven by books”. In addition, his target audience will be people between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. Sorry, but I find both statements disrespectful to the younger generation. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends, and they are not such a stupid stereotype as the director says. In addition, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Alone in Darkness”, “About Despertar do Mal” (“Alone in Darkness - Awakening of Evil”)
