Forget "Plan 9", this is the final fiasco, costume drama, clumsily directed, screenplay, actors, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-best novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are struggling to overcome such a horrible scenario. A lot of mistakes (like, for example, since it snowed like Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of this evil, called “magic realism”, it stands out as the worst movie of all time. It totally sucks !!!
