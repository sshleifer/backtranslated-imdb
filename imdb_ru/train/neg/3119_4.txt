Robin Williams gave an excellent performance in The Night Listener, like the other actors. However, the film seems to be in a hurry and leaves too many loose ends to be considered "must see." I think the problem arises from the fact that there is no sufficiently strong relationship between the caller and Gabriel's noon (I had to write it this way because IMDb wants to automatically correct the correct spelling for the “Nobody” symbol). The film lasts just over 01:30, and during the first 15 minutes, or, as it seems, Noon begins the search for Pete Logande, the calling boy. <br /> <br /> This happens after he talks to the mysterious caller. about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too deep, mostly they consist of how you ... I am in the hospital ... why your boyfriend moved ... etc. In the book, the child almost becomes midday and vice versa, and the reader understands why He goes in search of this boy, as soon as he finds out that the child disappears and thinks that he can be a hoax. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Midday becomes Logande's obsessive search, but viewers are left to wonder why? Since there is not a strong enough connection between Noon and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know that there is a difference between a book and a film, but these calls and these relationships were important for establishing on the screen, because they provide the basis for the rest of the film. Since this is not the case, the film is falling apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising because of Mopin’s other work, Tales of the City. When it was turned into a mini-series, it worked beautifully.
