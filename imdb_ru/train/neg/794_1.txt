If you are not already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film, save time and stop reading this review after you get to the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> FORGET TO FORGET IT ON THIS MOVIE AND LOOK SOMETHING SOMETHING OTHERWISE. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, think: <br /> <br /> A lame car for Japanese idols, handsome young men with a meaningless, intricate "plot", which delays for some time, until you are ready to shout. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie makes sense. This is an endless series of people expressing various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, WITHOUT A GOOD CAUSE. We can see that something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we just DO NOT GIVE A STRONG WHY, because there is no history. <br /> <br /> By the time this movie ends, you will be sick and tired of these stupid, durable, girly star faces. You will be outraged by the fact that you spent all this time watching how they smile, smile, cry, look mysteriously, “serious” and with any other meaningless expression that they beat on their faces. <br /> <br /> Something a moron ever go so far as to refer to this piece of tasteless trash as the "soul" of any of his "actors", and this should prove to you without a shadow of a doubt that the trailer and the countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /> <br /> This film will appeal only to “converted”, mindless minions, most of whom are teenage girls with a pathological adoration of something androgynous. Freud will have a field day. <br /> <br /> Unless you're one of these thoughtless “fans,” stay away from this abomination.
