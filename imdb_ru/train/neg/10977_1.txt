I live in Ottawa, where this film was made, and I would very much like it to be. This is one terrible movie. I really try to support independent films, but there is something like stigma associated with indie, and that is stigma: Indie Films Blow. Well, this film does nothing to shed that curse. Actor, writer, director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre, rather he rephrases weary cliches from films of the past. I'm really tired of threatening evil characters who hide in the shadows and hunt for unsuspecting, this is too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I remember one particular scene at the very end of the frame, where the entire scene is illuminated by the headlights of the car. Now, some may say that it was an effect used to create mood and tension, but unfortunately he had to demonstrate the limited budget of this film. As for the film, which dares to call itself a horror, the viewer will be difficult to find some real blood, except for a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colors. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing that drags this film is the pace and lack of character development, the main plot is that children are abducted, and parents must track this guy, the carbon castor, until a certain time to return their children. It’s not that this concept gives me doubts, but I really don’t consider it plausible that when the two main characters, both lost children, can find time to sort things out with each other. This is done in such a short period of time that it is unthinkable, my first priority will be to return my daughter and, at least, to get to know this woman before talking to her. <br /> <br /> The last thing I have is .... and I will not stand up to this Kelly, but the film was shot entirely on a boring, insensitive video, and it really takes away any tense moments that would just ooze style on film. Although, if this film were redone for a million dollars and redone, the story and boring acting game, and the lame one would not be able to keep this film afloat. I’m the only hope that something will happen to prevent Brett Kelly from making the sequel, which was reported on his website, the sequel half written in one sitting. <br /> <br /> God help us all.
