This film is not terrible, really. Someone noticed that Mo is the type over which Americans laugh. But there are those, and not necessarily the Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who do not care about the French; and the character Xavier is not going to shake them. <br /> <br /> Let's look at its stereotypical French attributes: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, malnutrition, check, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). Excellent appreciation of the kitchen. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 4). Warm work ethic. Check it out. (Forget the fact that he is supposedly a wealthy stockbroker because he is watching him in a film that seems to take ten hours off of his work week.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check. Despite this: <br /> <br /> 6). Weak interpretation of marriage vows. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 7). Big sexual ego that says that an American girl owes you sex if you buy her lunch. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the scenario, Mo doesn't matter if Mo is really a hit or not, she has no reason to fall in love with this smug European. <br /> <br /> Like other male reviewers, I liked to see Karen Allenâ€™s cute, tiny body. I will give the film four stars; two of them for that.
