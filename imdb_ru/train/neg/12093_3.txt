Isabel Huppert is a wonderful actor. The director of “La Pianiste” understands this, giving the viewer Huppert’s long gaze, which is good to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - she registers emotions with the smallest raised eyebrow or smile. <br /> <br /> Aside from the pleasure that an experienced actor is doing well in his profession, there’s nothing in this film that makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you like injuries, sadomasochism, and strange behavior, the “Pianist” may work for you. Besides these attributes, I could not find any redemptive value in it.) <br /> <br /> In this strange material the core of truth is buried. People who compete at the highest level — in music, sports, and so on — begin as strange people, and the competitive environment turns them into strangers. <br /> <br /> You should not go to the cinema to retrain this life lesson. <br /> <br />
