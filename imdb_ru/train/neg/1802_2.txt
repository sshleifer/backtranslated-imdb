Bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, my ... this is one of the films that does not have a single positive effect. Just everything from actors to history stinks into the sky. I'm just wondering how low I.Q. You should watch this movie and even enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Is there anything worth seeing? Well, there is a lot of nudity here, but nothing special. And when you just think that it cannot get worse, you realize that all naked ladies looked like they were forty years old. Come on guys where are you looking for these actresses. Perhaps in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> In any case, the leading actresses have some sexual appeal and know how to show it. Again, too bad that she is too thin and old. In general, skip this. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
