I saw this film with my climbing instructor, and we found it all so ridiculous that I felt sorry. (On the one hand, if Stallone himself is engaged in free climbing, there is no need to carry any equipment with him, but I suppose that these hanging carbines look like “mountain climbing”, so let's throw them). For those people with lobotomy who think that Colorado is like the Dolomites in Italy (where the film was made), Hollywood magnates have much more funny and foul-smelling things that you can swallow.
