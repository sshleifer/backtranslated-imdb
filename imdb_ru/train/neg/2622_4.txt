102 Dalmatian (2000, dir. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> Kruella de Ville (Close), who is considered curable, is released from prison and intends to start a new life. Cruella is doing well; she helps stray dogs from the street. When a big ben clocks, everything becomes bad. The hypnotic medicine was completely changed, and Cruella returned, and this time she was determined to make the spotty coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close reprises his role as Cruella de Ville and again is the highlight of the film. Each scene with her is worth seeing in this boring sequel, which is more like a repetition of the previous film than a new story. <br /> <br /> She has changed. ?? Ken Shepherd (Ioan Griffith)
