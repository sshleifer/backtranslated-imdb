As for the film, this is a fantastic science fiction film. It has a lot of cool stuff and a few quality scenes. However, this is not so good, and some things are rather contrived ... <br /> <br /> As for the name of this other film-cube, this is complete and complete nonsense! This is the definition of milking a great and inventive original film ... The whole point of this can be somewhat translated into the essence of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the “command” behind the cube itself is somewhat stretched ... <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 *** due to a backstab of the original. This film had to be sterile in many parts of the film so that there was no time or place to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> You can watch those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but are not recommended for fans series ...
