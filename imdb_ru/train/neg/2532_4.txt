The personality cult enhanced the status of Roger Korman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. As kings of Bi. Since the people at Crown International were so crucial, they were not promoted to the status they deservedly deserve. A film like THE VAN may now seem like a one-off piece of Drive-in Esoteria, but it was a significant hit when it was released (not to mention the subsequent re-releases as a double function with other Crown hits). <br /> <br /> The VAN was a great example of the Crown's hit strategy, which allows you to grasp the mood of the audience during the film's release. There was sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and the short fad of "Custom Van". As others have noted, the irony is that the hit song in the film refers to Chevrolet when the title car is “Trick” in the film itself. I had the town of Selectman, where I even declared at the time that these vans were "the den of sin on wheels!" The perfect advertising line for the movie! <br /> <br /> There is the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscular heads and low-brow hair (including Danny DeVito's auxiliary bit). In many respects, this is not much different from the old films about the beach party of the 60s, but now it is flavored with nudity and drug use. It is clear that with a limited budget and limited graphics, the film is quite nicely combined with a slight charm, which, by modern standards, compensates for some non-PC views of women. <br /> <br /> A classic touch is a toaster for Bobby's lair on wheels. Yes, the toaster! Hey, you need something hot for these snacks! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
