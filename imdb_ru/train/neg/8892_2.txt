I have to admit, this version disgraced Shakespeare in advance! No one can act except the nurse who was my favorite! In her teens, Juliet had good skills, but she couldn’t give emotional depth to her lines, and we’ll never really be able to connect with her. It is worse for her to act in a scene when she is going to drink sleeping pills ... God, stop whining! I would pour it in her mouth to shut up! Anthony Andrews ... yes! Considering his other wonderful films (“Return to Brideshead”, Ivanhoe, “Scarlet Pimpurnel”), he is in this shock. And don't get me to Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's still nice to see if you hunt every Romeo and Juliet ever made in cinema history. The version of Olivia and Leonard is still the best, followed by the version of Leslie Howard, and then the current Leo and Claire!
