Gayniggers from space to a large extent indicated by its name. It lasts only 27 minutes and describes a gay black manâ€™s spacecraft who come to Earth to free men from women. Although I see little meaning for the plot, it is also really illogical. Of course, it was a comedy / deception from society and science fiction. I laughed a few times, so it works out. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. As the spacecraft floats above Earth, you can see the stars increasing for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at the beginning look fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several spelling errors in the text, the actors are not convincing, the characters are confused; in general, everything is not taken seriously. If you overcome all aspects that make it a bad film, it will be very accessible and easy to see. Some parts are funny. But in general, the only thing left for you to remember is that this was one of the most ridiculous concepts in all of history. <br /> <br /> To see that this is a short film, and there are some funny aspects in it, this is not the worst thing to see. But this is illogical and has little long-term value. I cannot recommend this; if you look at it, do it for a unique concept, not for quality.
