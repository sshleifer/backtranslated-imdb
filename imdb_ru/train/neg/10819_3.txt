I agree with one of the other commentators on a good story and good actors, but it didn’t fit, and I would also say that I hurried. It has been about 24 years since I read the book, as it was in school. But I felt that you need to know the story of Jane Eyre when you watch this, since the bits are omitted, and therefore it does not have complete meaning. For example, Jane and Mr. Rochester barely spoke, and suddenly he proposes marriage !!! The actors don't have time to let viewers understand how their character relates to every thing that happens in the story. The actors are good, but they are not given enough time to make this story fair. I am sorry to say this, but I didn’t really like this version. A 1970 version featuring Suzanne York and George S Scott would be the Jane Eyre film I would prefer, BUT you should watch the BBC 1983 mini-series version with Zella Clarke & Timothy Dalton in 2 main roles. I love it so much, I watch it regularly. There is a shortened version that goes for 225 minutes or a full version for 330 minutes.
