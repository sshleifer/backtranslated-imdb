Yes, this film is bad. Worst of all, he does not enjoy any advantage of his own name !! In the whole film, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWO. On top of that, we are never sure that the protagonist of the film is a DEFINITELY vampire. Some may argue that they tried to “soften” or make it “realistic”, but in the end it’s just boring. More than half of this film takes place in the car. Scenes that occur somewhere else also cannot boast. In addition, there is no obvious antagonist, and, in the end, you have no idea what actually happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I would say that for a film with such low production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumental (with original score or sampled music from other places). <br /> <br /> I’m all for independent films, but it seems that this was never intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "Worse than the Scarecrow Killer."
