By the end of the film, I felt that it was too technical. It seemed to me that in class I was watching our navy perform rescue operations at sea. I liked to see that the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I should have understood this before, but I never thought about it. Using 747 to transport valuable old paintings with a very low level of security is strange and unrealistic. The acting was pretty good, as they are mostly seasoned professionals, but if you are going to move so far away from what is likely to happen, it should be more like fantasy, funny, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least in the film pilot Felix Ungar, with Buck Rogers, the night pursuer and Dracula on board. The film was filled with well-known faces. I understand that Hollywood should exaggerate a little for drama, but it really worsens the quality of the film when a serious subject turns into a caricature. That's why I said it should be more comical. My favorite passion for air travel films is that everyone just randomly moves around. They walk around with drinks, set them up and pick them up after 5 minutes, as if they are in a building or something else, and act as if turbulence simply does not exist. In addition, I know that this is a film about a catastrophe, but in anticipation it is not necessary to include a 30-second crash after the impact. In any case, experienced actors and actresses will not allow this weak script to turn into a film that was shot after the first show. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch the nutty person end up in the deck ... :)
