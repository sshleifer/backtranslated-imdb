whatever you do, do not waste your time on it is meaningless. movie. Remake that did not need to retell. Everyone leaving the theater had the same comments. Worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money !!! <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage was cycling down the hills, swimming in muddy water and rolling on the hills when bees attacked him, but nevertheless his suit was still perfectly ironed out, and his snow-white shirt scene. <br /> <br /> Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage, the acting was just as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad films. Don't they get a copy of the script first. If you are still interested in watching a movie, at least wait for it to be released on DVD.
