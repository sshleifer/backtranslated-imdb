Rock star John Norman Howard (Chris Christofferson) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a singing star. Star Esther rises, and John - in decline due to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John makes a self-destructive red-convex-160-mph, crack on a deserted highway. The best thing about this movie is music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as a nascent star when she is already * a star. The first time she appears, sings in the alley, she looks like a famous singing star who idle all night, and not on a struggling unknown who is trying to start her singing career. She is too self-confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page from “Apartment Life”, and not some kind of hole in the wall where a real fighting singer would live. <br /> <br /> Chris Kristofferson treats the egocentric, out-of-control role of a rock star, like ... well, like a singer who tries to be an actor, but does not have much acting talent. The direction is cool, the story is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this film is not acting, not slop or a slow story. This is hair! After more than two hours, looking at the terrible hairstyles of Christofferson and Streisand 70s, your eyes hurt.
