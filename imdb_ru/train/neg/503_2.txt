After the initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash games, REDEMPTION was able to clear the lower part of the barrel with the help of BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I have not found bloodsuckers anywhere in this film. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. The mysterious Earl invites several actresses to her castle for a little vacation. After several soft sexual machinations, the girls are decapitated one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red herring in this country than on the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The pace is unbearable. The story is stupid, and the scenes from the skin are also not so good. <br /> <br /> Give it a shot.
