I remember the days when Kim Basinger was no more than a pretty face who adorned films with typical characters of silly blonde, romantic interest, or a girl in danger. But that all changed when she won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie LA Confidential, and I think that I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance. However, after this point, her career did not follow the ideal path. Of course, the prestige that she won through this film made her participate in moderately prestigious films (such as People I Know or Door to the Floor), but we never saw her again as an essential character. The film “While she was gone” does not help her cope with this situation; and the point is not only that her character is not very tasty, but also that the film is really trashy. The script of this film can not be more empty and simple. However, Basinger introduces some conviction in her character, and this makes his poor film to score a few points. This film is full of clichés and general villains. The work of director Susan Montford is really pernicious for many reasons, but mainly because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone. The ending of this film is extremely funny. I do not recommend "While it was not" in general. This film commits a mortal sin.
