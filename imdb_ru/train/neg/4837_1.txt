I went to see this movie just to see what the hype is, and I was just as disappointed as I was surprised at how he received 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 IMDb rating to date. <br /> <br /> Catherine Bigelow has to be the happiest director ever to get the best picture and Oscar's best director for such a really bad movie, and I wonder why? Does an absolutely unrealistic “cowboy” storyline for bomb disposal to someone that I could not see? Why did I keep thinking that this film was a remake of some old film about the bad West, where a cowboy does “brave deeds” in the Wild Wild West, infected by “evil” red Indians; but only that it was set in a different background this time? Was he awarded the Oscar because the director was from James Cameron, and made him a good story of deception (gossip) for daytime TV shows that could be attempted? Or was it some kind of Emperor's clothing syndrome - where most people understood that it was rubbish, but simply could not say it, because others did not seem to say it out loud? <br /> <br /> And finally, what happened to that sniper scene, where they showed that the shell of the projectile falls in high resolution - super-slow - as if to convey a “deep message” or something else? Something like "EOD guys suddenly make good snipers, and they will constantly chase dirty terrorists"? Was it just me that I felt that there were so many places in the film and pieces wedged for no apparent reason? And you can get the Oscars for editing and directing. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen this yet, don’t spend money on tickets. Wait until they run it on TV in a few years. You will not be bored much.
