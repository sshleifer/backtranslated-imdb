Well, I don't think the picture is as bad as most reviews say. but it is impossible to deny that he has problems. <br /> <br /> Basically, problems in the script. There is a plot - but not a big story, and certainly not one that anyone can call plausible; he throws out any number of self-consciously strange and / or stereotypical characters, lines, moments, “what-have-you” and, in the end, there are not so many of them in this section. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I didn’t give a damn what Farnsworth’s “social malady” might try to solve; there will always be a sector of the population ready to do anything to cut your brain, even if it requires running around the corn fields, trying to steal ammonia, or something else that these morons do. So, like a movie, you won't find what I call “Iowa” “important.” But at the stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting, and some of Farnsworth’s decisions in depicting the vortex state of the metamode are beautiful, cheerful, worried, and — yes, I will say it — inspired. <Br /> <br /> The game is uneven, but it may be a victim of the aforementioned stylistic achievement. Listen, Rosanna Arquette is a wonderful actress, but she is not very good here, so a picky viewer should ask: "What happened?" It is strange that Diane Foster rules the simplicity and grace that so few other actors can come close. For example, I could seriously think about any explanation that Farnsworth could give Michael T. Weiss to an excessive turn as a probation officer, but I doubt that I will ever buy it; It just does not work. <br /> <br /> Again, he is the most alive, and at that moment when I saw John Savage appear over the years. So go figure it out. <br /> <br /> This is the work that torments, but does not promise - and this is normal; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make films. So, if Farnsworth has another film, it remains to be seen, but if he does, then it is likely that it will not be a soft dad. In an era when people are planning their lives around the last American Idol game, perhaps we could allow, rather than despise, Farnsworth a legitimate and undoubtedly spoiled movie. <br /> <br /> Moreover, perhaps we could welcome, rather than scold, his energetic, and sometimes blessed, peculiar imagination.
