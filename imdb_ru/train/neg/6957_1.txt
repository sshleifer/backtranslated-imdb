Avoid this if you do not want to watch an expensive, but poorly made film. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is unclear - the main sin in the French film. <br /> <br /> In this film, an attempt is made to combine western, narcotic intrigue and antique costume epic. What kind? Well, think about it. Cowboy music was hilarious during sword fighting. Or what about a woman in underwear holding a knife and bouncing on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone has to do on this bomb “How are you, tiger lily”. Rewrite the script, and then rename it or add subtitles to it. Gosh, it's almost now. (By the way, Gerard Depardieu and Carol Bouquet, both known to American audiences, have roles.)
