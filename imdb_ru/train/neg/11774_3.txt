He made an unfortunate mistake by seeing this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was well filmed from the very beginning, but this is the last positive review I have about the film. The game was terrible, I wonder if the real girls were hired. But it was a really funny story, in fact it was funny and not boring - the only reason I gave it was 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers below **. <br /> I just want to mention a few scenes that really made the audience laugh: <br /> <br /> push the girl in the field: who would have thought that a child pushing another child could act so badly . This is a revelation. <br /> <br /> Hit on the bus scene: the girl sits on the bus. But according to the music, the world is coming to an end. <br /> <br /> Throw under the clothes line: wow, it really demonstrates the skills of the script writer. The room is followed by raw meat and selling skill. Why not just make her commit all three "sins" at the same time? At least then the film could have been a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> Running on the stairs of the shopping center: watch as one of the girls flies down the stairs, pursued by the flesh that eats Dow, do not wait. she * just * goes quickly, trying not to break her nails. <br /> <br /> Running bloodstained: this is definitely my favorite scene and the appropriate end of the film. A half-marathon in red paint, completed by jumping up the stairs and across the bridge, just to fly past it is unrealistic. Not only that, but the suicide undertaken by the most obsessed girl in the film, now she’s stuck with the character. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that this film was created by 16 year olds and their comrades. Unfortunately, having met the director at the presentation, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> But if you have a sarcastic mood and you want to laugh at a few friends ... then you don’t even think about it.
