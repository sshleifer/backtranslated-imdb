This film has long become old, right? The thing is that syrupy nostalgia turned into itself in some kind of feedback loop. <br /> <br /> This certainly sounds like a good idea: a great ensemble cast, good jokes and some kind of human drama about what could have / possibly been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that would link them all together, as was the case in “The Great Cold”, one of those original films that gave rise to such films. You end up wanting to see more than one or two specific people, instead of taking short looks at each. The created superficiality is not just annoying, it is crazy. The script below average does not help.
