Who researched this movie? It was installed in Baghdad in 2004, but all the soldiers wear the AKC and have all the equipment of a universal camouflage sample. Nobody wore this clothes in 04. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie when I was abroad, and I can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was WTF? This film did not make sense if the characters came and went without explaining the reasons, and people did funny things that NEVER would have happened in real life. I understand that this is a film, but he is clearly trying to portray something realistic. With a crash fails, but tries. <br /> <br /> As if someone came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed them and swallowed them, and then tore out the movie. I would not recommend this film to anyone. I'm still not sure why I sat all this. G.I. Joe was the one who really made you think compared to that. STAY AWAY!
