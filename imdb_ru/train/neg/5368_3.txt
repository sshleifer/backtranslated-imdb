Private practice should be medical drama. Therefore, I think that my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in medical storylines. Just by watching House I “solved” two (of nine) medical puzzles before the doctor. Boooring. Seriously, if you're a lazy writer, why not copy some cases from older episodes of the ER or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House - recent and popular - it’s hard to recycle their ideas ... <br /> <br /> The second biggest complaint: these people must be forty with something, right? Then why should they behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? Do you really need three weeks (i.e., three whole episodes) of intense thinking to understand that if your best friend does not want to be your “good friend”, perhaps this is not because he wants to harm you, but because Doesn't he want to risk his friendship? A character who thinks everything, by the way, is a psychiatrist - the whole storyline is so unreal that you cannot really agree to the supposed “drama”. <br /> <br /> And I won’t even complain about what the series did to everyone’s favorite Addison when we met her in Gray's Anatomy ... By the way, you don’t think it's funny when Addison longs for a loser Pete (sorry, but anyone trying to cure Insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, Ph.D. or not), and Derek is confused about crying, irritating Meredith for a few miles in rainy Seattle? In addition to this small rapprochement with Mark, they seemed ideal for each other. Sometimes I think that the subconscious mind of Shonda Rimes tries to tell us that in a relationship our first choice is often the right one ...
