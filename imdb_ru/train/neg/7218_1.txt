At the beginning of the shootout, there is a scene where horses run. If something red is striking, itâ€™s because the white trail is parked behind the bush along the trail. I thought I saw badly, but that's all. White van in the west. Didn't they catch it? Oh, well, and I paid the best dollar in rent. It makes you want to grab your buddies and make them all put 10 pieces in each and make the best movie. The conversation was so slow that acting was mostly normal, but it should not be taken seriously because of the poor nature of the filming. Sheriffs have a door that today looks like a door with a special finish. I say watch this movie and move Cabin to number 2 at the worst of all times.
