The armature is an astronaut who goes to the first space mission to Saturn in the world, but of course in this horror film everything becomes horrible and he returns to Earth as the only survivor. Struck by a strange condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose consciousness, if he does not regularly consume human flesh, he kills, apparently, the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to a nearby city to pursue more victims. <br /> <br /> I liked the premise, and the effects of the monster and blood are actually pretty good, but the space scenes are simply glued together from NASA stock material, and the hospital looks strange as a warehouse. A very weak script, weak character development and generally a bad game do not allow it to rise higher than anything else than a mediocre clicking slasher with the novelty of having a live candle as an assassin, and more or less has only its own bloody effects interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, strictly for the most persistent movie fans of monsters.
