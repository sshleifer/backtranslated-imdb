this documentary is a biscuit-based, as soon as you provide it with the PRESENT testimony, the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of shit, for example, Bart Sibrel claims that they should have several sources of light, because the shadows seem to intersect if it were if there were no two or more shadows for each object, when Apollo 11 passed through the van Allan radiation belts, they spent there 30 minutes, rather than 90 minutes, stated in the documentary, and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent Alentno dose of radiation X-ray. <br /> <br /> seriously study what really happened, don't let this bunch of documentary form your opinion on what really happened
