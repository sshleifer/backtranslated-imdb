From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of cinematic sediment. Supposedly based on the work of H. Ryder Haggard, the only similarity he has with what Haggard actually wrote is that it happens in Africa (although there are dinosaurs in Africa â€” which our fearless adventurers use to pull your canoe!) some characters with the same name. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) go on a treasure hunt, armed only with a medallion, and get exactly where the treasure is, purely a chance. On the way, they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters, lead the French chef, and McCallam has an affair with the Queen of Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so funny, it's a scream. This is the only reason I did not give her 1.
