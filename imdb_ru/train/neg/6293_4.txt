I had the pleasure of watching this film early, and I must say that I thought it would be boring, and I thought how they could improve the 1984 version of the Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks, who, in my opinion, was pretty good ... I was right ... To be honest, I thought it could be better ... Of course, there were some funny moments, but it just did not seem successful to me ... The game was fine and the storyline was pretty follows the original well, but I think it could have been much better ... This film, I would AZAL is designed for teenagers and young people of the heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... This is just another typical movie of a mill party that repeats over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for that.
