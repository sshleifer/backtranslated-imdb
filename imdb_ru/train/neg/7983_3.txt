As a result, there are holes too long and filled with more plots than Swiss cheese! The director and co-author of the film say that he wanted to mix genres - in this case, drama and comedy. Well, at least here these two are mixed like vinegar and oil. And the comedy is not very funny and youthful. In addition, the film is not very realistic. Freedom is taken in relation to the legal system regarding the accusation of French citizens against their will and the apparent ease of escaping with drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on TV at home and found myself screaming for the film to continue. In the end, I quickly redirected the last long speech that one of the main characters gives the son of his former lover. By that time, I was exhausted by a ridiculous confused plot that concerns a dead lover, a marriage of convenience, and a psychotic former lover. From time to time the plot goes to the families of the two main characters, and then returns to one of them - either Ismail, or first and foremost Nora. To the detriment of the audience, the points of view are constantly changing from Nora and Ismail, her former lover, limited by his will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films here, neither of which is very well developed. The epilogue does not really cover many of the plots and seems to want the viewer to believe that Nora will somehow find happiness, although, considering her circumstances in real life, the chances are equivalent to the chance of a snow globe in hell. Actors do their best and are attractive, but this is not enough to overcome all the obvious shortcomings of bad writing, editing and lack of focus.
