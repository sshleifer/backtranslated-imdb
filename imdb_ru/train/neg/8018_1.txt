Wow, I hated this movie. The subject was supposed to lead to a really good film, and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to deal with this topic, but the script - if even the script * was * - a mess. will not lead. I would say that it does not go anywhere quickly, except that in fact it is the longest 81 minutes you will ever sit. As I said, the lead actor is good. Similarly, Faruz Baulk (SP), as his sometimes rude, but ultimately loving and receiving mother. Cinematographers have something to answer for, because it's a mess. A real shame, because I really wanted this film to be liked, but it basically surpasses the film that was never made. Skip this one - it didn't even cost $ 6, which I laid out for pay-per-view.
