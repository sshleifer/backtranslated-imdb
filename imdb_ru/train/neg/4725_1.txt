A great opportunity for the Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the verge of fame. It could be a decent film if it touched the traumatic past of John Livien and how he tormented his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to identify the life of John Livien with the life of John Lennon. John Livien’s suicidal mother was John Lennon, and she wanted him to be as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon’s musical brilliance and his remarkable ability to expose himself so others can learn something about their own life, he showed that Lennon’s legacy is a bewildered, drug-addicted soul that should be seen as God instead of man. I'm a big fan of John Lennon, and this film reminded me of another “crazy” man who was obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of this? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty, and I was disgusted by seeing another anxious man as the main character in this film, obsessed with Lennon, and did not show his beautiful contribution to the world. Yoko Ono graciously commemorated John Lennon, making a memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to express their respect and recall John. Instead, the director of this film decided to use this site to commit a murderous attempt to commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of the world who died a cruel, meaningless death, and seeing such violence near this place was like repeating a terrible wound for any Lennon fan. It totally messed up my movie. It could have been a decent movie, but I still have a bitter taste in my mouth. May John Lennon and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his evil murder by this irresponsible film.
