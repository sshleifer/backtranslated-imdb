I'm not sure how they are connected, but I'm almost sure that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this film (or the story on which it is based). A very similar storyline, and even some of the scenes and scenery seem very, very similar. “Lost and Mad” is actually a much better movie, so watch it. <br /> <br /> This film is moving very slowly, but, being a French film of the late 60s, this style should be expected. It is told in retrospect from the point of view of one of the girls attending school. Editing flashbacks with current scenes is a bit confusing at first, especially because the sound of each of them overlaps (i.e., hear flashbacks, seeing the present and vice versa). In addition, the "girls" are a little bit old to think that they are in a boarding school. Finally, not so much character development to even tie you to a movie.
