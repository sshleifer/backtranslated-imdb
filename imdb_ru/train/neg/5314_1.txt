Music that torments the nerves, like nails on a blackboard, acting like a zombie, that it was a shame to waste the cast without making the second film; playing all the real zombies in it - with the participation of Sabrina the teenage witch in the role of heroes ... of a film so terrible that if there were still stoner around, it could be considered a cult film - but, oh so amateur, the scenarios could be just as well separated by the actors, their lines were read as they slowly shuffled the film - banal, illogical sets, modeled after the divisions of Los Angeles, propped up directly from ToysRus! Has there ever been a movie that was so incompetent ??? The logic takes off into the wind in this crappy, senseless, senseless and with a “monster” so stupid and uncoordinated that it cannot catch the turtle in the ice box - short, long-legged - and Amazon! This kept my attention all along; as a terrible, continuing chained accident in the fog involving several vehicles makes one watch until the very end ... how, after a ridiculous battle with radiation weapons in a prison on another planet, a sexually disadvantaged and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter pursues a backward alien fugitive - - LAND! Don't let anyone p ** s on your popcorn, you might really enjoy watching it. This is so bad!
