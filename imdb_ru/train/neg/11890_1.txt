From the first time I saw the boxed cover of the film and the stretched photo, I thought that this guy, this friend of Scwarz, should be about 6 feet or 6 feet 2 inches. <br /> <br /> Not 5 feet. It's not his fault. <br /> <br /> In any case, I turned on the film on a cool night in Tucson, went to the second story deck with a good cigar and let it go. At that time, my wife had an affair, and everything was going uphill for me, so I had to have fun. But no matter how bad the movie was ... I really liked it, with a bottle of Merlot, I could admit. <br /> <br /> Indeed, I watched this movie many times. It always makes me feel good! The point is not that he is “trying too hard” to be cool, or that “This is so close” to achieving the goal in the action movie ... This is insane. And then really ignorant. Then mad again. This is the best of the best when it comes to the slow chase scene. Wow!! I never felt more secure in my life. Warm and happy too. I was grateful for the fact that they saved on gasoline during the chase because of less production in the summer months ... in any case <br /> <br /> The direction was “boring”, the actions and the fighting had to be put in choreography, or re-set the choreography and tensed, the sound did not sound, delivery did not hit you, it just continued, the other way. The “locals” of the village in which they were, rather, cities, were “not in themselves,” they also did not seem to follow the situation very well, they looked and even “looked” at the camera lens. Like a deer in the light of the head light, some of them are smiling, smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because “Columbus”, I bet, has a good heart and caring spirit for people in America, as well as for its compatriots. <br /> <br /> However, “Barretta Island” is very sluggish and incredible. Even so far I really like it. My now X-wife hates it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that I'm pretty picky about films that I like or even like. In general, I like Franco. And there is. <br /> <br /> As an addition to this, we add a movie, if you like to kill a few hours with a truly fascinating view, directly to B video or “bad” movies for your small library collection, then if you can find This, see 'Big Pot' (1991) with Robert Z 'Darom .. You know the big guy from' TANGO & CASH '. “Big sweat”, a police story bomb without real disclosure of the plot and such a stupid game that it can be “on crutches”, and at the end of “Big Sweat” I think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits. -Good fun. <br /> <br /> But overall, not as good as “Barette Island”, I gave him “1” and the overall rating is “terrible” for the awfully good film “B”. I am waiting for the continuation, perhaps, of Baretta’s Revenge over Montazuma (Franco takes Mexican holidays and then gets sick on water, declares war on water companies) or Baretta’s Gunpowder War, where, as he will bet, a large drug lord in his country chemically splicing genes and creating a hybrid super-beetle (insect), which could be bred and thrown onto coca fields and there is coke, and after passing through the beetle it forms a chemical reaction, coke for pure icing sugar. Then another continuation, which he would have to save, so that young people would get rid of excessive sugar dependence, and so on. He could get a large company for the production of toothpastes to approve and partially finance the project with careful placement of the product in this function. Right?(*)
