Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do the film producers think they are? ABSOLUTE WORLD, the most unrealistic film in which I saw as much as I can remember. This film is so bad that I felt obliged to register on IMDb and make sure that the rating of this "film" fell. <br /> <br /> God, I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunk girl, so while she fainted, I REALLY am going to walk my room for HOURS, desperately asking myself: "WHAT I DID?!" .. Heather, get up and grow up ... and I would like to send the same mood to idiot producers ... and while I'm in it, instead of the film being a pitiful excuse for the story going out, it might be more appropriate to focus the plot on a character who is mentally unstable. ... how is your so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know when I first engaged in same-sex sex, when I left the next morning, I jumped into the sky in a thrill in the middle of the street ... honestly b * tch, pull yourself together ... <br /> <br /> What a joke! and please note that there are many, many other flaws and terribly stupid aspects in this settling film, but Iâ€™m so sick of even thinking about it more. The bottom line is that if you are an intelligent person, you hate this movie, and if you are not an intelligent person, then you will like it ... it's that simple.
