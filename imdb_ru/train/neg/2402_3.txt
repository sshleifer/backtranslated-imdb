An amazing misfire from the usually reliable Larry Cohen (God told me too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High struggles to be funny and fails miserably, even with decent turns Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin looks embarrassed throughout the entire performance, and his son Adam is just numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like comedy classics.
