After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some reviews comparing it with Lost In Translation LITE. When I read this, I immediately saw the point of view of the reviewers. <br /> <br /> This film was an unsuccessful attempt at a similar theme. Interestingly, the movie format is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. "10 items" throws the viewer through the 1-day timeline of the film, while the better-planned "Lost ..." seems to be stretching for several long days. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m sure that some people will see this, because Morgan Freeman is there and will be disappointed. It seems that his best roles at the moment are supporting roles in big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in films with a limited edition of less than $ 10 million and in indie films.
