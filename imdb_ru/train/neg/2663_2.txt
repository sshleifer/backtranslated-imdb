In one of the interviews, David Duchovny said that he could not even watch the first hour of this film - and you should not. The scene where he asks the owner of the house, where the murder was committed, if he can look around - change the name he gives, and he could raise his speech from almost any episode of The X-Files. He's on autopilot for the entire movie. Brad Pitt terribly replays.
