This is a movie about making a movie. Such films may be interesting, but they need some substance to do this. I'm afraid this did not happen here. Unfortunately, Mr. Coppola did not inherit the skills of his father (as well as his sister, who, however, can make films that can be watched). <br /> <br /> I really wonder how this film received such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the main actor, presumably the director, is as expressive as the frozen squid, and his voice has the same height as he, the leading actress has a facial expression that never changes, the plot completely broken into pieces, perhaps with one single connecting element, the film in the idea of ​​the film should be more outdated than the Paleolithic stones ... Will this be enough? <br /> <br /> I regretted every moment I watched this movie. Walking the dog is great entertainment for this incredibly lame movie. It’s as if Francois Truffaut’s story was directed by Dick Cheney ... Brazil, any other classic SF movies? You must be really joking ...
