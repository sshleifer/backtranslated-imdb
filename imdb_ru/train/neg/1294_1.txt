The central theme in this film seems to be confusion, since relationships, setting, action and social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel, it seems, is not in his element, and he lacks his usual flawless clarity, direction and intensity. Worse, his character is called “Che,” and we are only (directly told by the narrator) in the film that he is not “this” Che, just a guy named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once a certain family is divided - the younger generation goes to America. So cliché. Other reviews discuss how the film portrays the effect of revolution on a boy's family; However, the political position of the director is gloom at best, and we can never say for sure who is responsible for the bloodshed. So they lost their property (acquired by the gambling business) - and so what? The refusal of a political position in making a film about the Cuban revolution is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention that the movie was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? Unsurprisingly, they did not get permission to shoot in Cuba. And if it’s most important to look at family life here, it would be great if we could find out who is who — we “met” them at the very beginning — a cheap way to clarify the relationship throughout the film! The game was mostly small, wooden and incredible, the time did not fit. "Special" visual effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films — and the black character in the form of a Greek choir — are strictly free, intellectually, and invariably irrelevant. I watched the whole movie just because I was waiting for clarity or some moment in all this. It never happened.
