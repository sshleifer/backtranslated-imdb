Well, I seriously can’t think of anything worse than PR. There are a lot of bad things in life: traitors, liars, etc. But, seriously, the Power Rangers MUST be at the bottom of this list. Can you think of anything more stupid than five or six teenagers (who don’t even behave like a normal teenager) dancing around in identical costumes WITH DIFFERENT COLORS THAT YOU CAN TELL ANY APART? Fans, have you ever come across a real person who is thrown into the mental wall, almost immediately gets up and continues to fight without injury? Power Rangers are for five year old boys, and believe me, I never liked this show, even when I was five years old. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Teenagers actually act like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually acts as a mentor or not, as a teacher. He has youthful humor, although the fight is unconvincing, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Power Rangers are crap, but I wouldn't. That would be an insult to shit. So, five year old boys, Power Rangers are rubbish.
