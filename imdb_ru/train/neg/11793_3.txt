“Deep shock” is played out like a television film: a whole group of commercial quality actors, a poorly designed creature who can become a “bad guy”, and a script that is more full of technical, political slang and significance than he knows what to do with <br /> <br /> I checked out the movie because of the creature (I like to see what the directors think about their projects in these cheap videos), and immediately became disillusioned because the creature on the box was not in the movie. The actors I expected because of the type of film that it is (really quite general and not thought out until a certain moment). The music was typical, not thought-out action-symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment, as well as the design of the mini subwoofer. The film even showed up very well, with guiding screens that let you know which set you were watching the plot. But in any case there is not so much plot. <br /> <br /> This film gets 3/10 IMO stars. A boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it ... kind of lame. Even a lamer is a marked love relationship between two characters you don’t see. Try this movie, which is trying to raise an acting career from the stage and shoot a video. Do not worry
