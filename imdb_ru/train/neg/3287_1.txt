If this film is to be renamed, then it must be Donkey Hazzard. Summing up, we can say that this film is only 88 minutes of two immature village punks who delight the famous 1968 Dodge Charger around the city and the village, chasing the girls and avoiding the law. <br /> <br /> I was a “Duke’s Fan” and the thing that casts a shadow on the film are characters who have nothing to do with business. Excessive depravity of profanity, sexual references and drug use has turned the good name "Dukes" into the trailer trash. <br /> <br /> Comparing this with a TV show, the acting was terrible. The only actor who understood this correctly was the famous 1969 Dodge Charger named General Lee. Others exaggerated the role of the character who cast a shadow on the film. <br /> <br /> “Herzogs” have become another victim of the tragedy of the transition of television to the 21st-century big screen. Skip this movie and buy a TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
