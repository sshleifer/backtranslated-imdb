Having nothing better, I decided to check out "Aztec Rex" (since he was billed) to hell. <br /> <br /> A stupid story could play better if the dinosaur effect was convincing. In fact, they looked like animatics (those coarse drawings that artists later use to complete the CGI effects, adding more details, smoother movements, etc.). Absolutely awful looking dinosaurs, and this is the only reason you might , want to go through it anyway. <br /> <br /> The only saving factor was the wonderful Dichen Lachman as Ayakoatl. She kept my interest; if only the budget were increased and some convincing dinosaurs could be used. <br /> <br /> Disappointment. At the very least, the cast and crew got a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was made.
