This definitely corresponds to the time when Axis & Allies played spy games in most parts of North Africa and the rest of the world. This is not the best of films, but, of course, not the worst of budget films, as described earlier in the collection “Classics of War”. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was really very good in one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the Harry Park performance (credited as Parkyarkarkus). Why he never received more significant roles, I can not do. He played the perfect role of a buddy / partner and saved the film ... imho. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, this film was part of a Superbox-Mart budget package called War Classics. Eight films for eight bucks, including others that have never heard of films that have decent stars trying to pay bills. <br /> <br /> This script ... well, not so hot Editing and cinematography ... worse. If you can get around all this and want to see the future of the Cisco Kid and a great helper who, unfortunately, never realized his true potential, definitely raise it! Otherwise, there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> <br /> -Tunderossa.
