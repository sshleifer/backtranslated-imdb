It is strange that less than two hours may seem like a lifetime when you sit in such a flat, boring bustle. If the story is as personal as this one supposedly was for Sally Potter, do you not expect that a little passion will manifest in her performance? Her game was completely independent, and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo, and the tango scenes that were supposed to be fiery, given the nature of the dance, were instead awkward and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story in a film can be intimidating, and, as such, Sally Potter would be wise to allow the best actor to take on the task, and not let his passion fall victim to his shyness.
