We laughed at our heads. This scenario is so incredible that you either go to CNN or go to bed. <br /> <br /> My dad was a sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <During his experience as an officer, he once took command of the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey per day and (sorry) sat on his desk. Of course, it was not in the nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, a fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give a workout at the time, this is just a Hollywood script. When the captain is arrested, he is under arrest, you take all his keys and open the safe where the weapon is kept. It is stored for several minutes in a well-guarded room. He CAN'T escape, it's like in prison. <br /> <br /> Funny, my father also had a dog on board, but we see Hackman allowing him to urinate in the control room. It is not done, ever. My dad cleaned out all the mess that the dog created, wherever he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make three stars for which this film is credited, everything else is bulls ** t. <br />> When we know that 23 people are still alive in Kersk, this film acquires an additional measurement <br /> <br /> If you want to see the real submarine rental thriller: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
