I saw a trailer for this film, and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, acting is ruins, special effects (if you can call them that), which look like something out of place in a school play. Some characters are so stupid in this movie that you will be confused by the minute they are on the screen, which, unfortunately, often. As for the story, forget about it. This is a warning, do not waste money on this film, it must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If for some reason you liked the movie Troll 2, you will probably like it too.
