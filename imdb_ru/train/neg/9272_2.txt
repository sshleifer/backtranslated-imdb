Recently, I decided to return to the “Omen” trilogy to discover that {insert demonic music here} is the fourth. I did not expect much from this, and in this respect he certainly met my expectations. If you like to watch bad movies for laughter, then this could be a movie for you. Oh, where to start? <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the appearance of the film "created for television" was obvious. Music was often inappropriate in combination with what was happening in the film, and therefore (at best) distracting. The script had all the expectations of an 8 year old piece of art. But one thing that needs to be said is that the missing script very well corresponded to the terrifying game. Numerous scenes made me think about whether this script or acting was a source of absurdity. <br /> <br /> The story itself is rather thin, focused on all the crazy antics of Damien Thorne’s daughter, adopted by the unrighteous and ill-functioning nuns. There are the usual many mysterious and entangled deaths that personally made me yawn when the drama unfolded, and the usual third-party investigator in this whole affair. Later, thanks to some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jr. was born. And that pretty much completes the plot. All this is done rather badly from the very beginning due to the lack of waiting, making the film one monotonous and / or ridiculous scene after another. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of WTF?!? moments that provide unintended relief comedy. For example, what about a serious overreaction at the beginning of a movie when a child scratches a mother’s cheek? It is unlikely that an omen turning head 360 degrees. I also laughed at the over-reaction to baptism. The baby is crying and everyone looks very worried. The unfortunate mother runs out of the church, and the priest looks very alarmed, crossing herself. BUT? Then there is the nanny of the new era, who seems to have a blank check when 8 years old is exposed to all kind of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when the nanny offered to invite the troubled Delia to an extrasensory fair to meet with the hippie nanny's friends, and the mother just shrugged and allowed it. “Yes, it's cool, fill my head of a troubled 8-year-old daughter with all this mysticism. That's cool. I don't need to be there. ” Of course, this was to be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt an adult rottweiler that they encounter on the street, and who can snack on little girls as a snack. The whole scene at the psychic fair is rather comical in a certain sense, from the horrible reactionary views of psychics to Delia, to the subsequent hell. <br /> <br /> I also laughed at how the death of the nun is considered a “strange accident.” Here we have a religious fanatic (who is described as part of a cult) who fanatically preaches in a pit with rattlesnakes to prove how God's Glory will protect them. She counteracts snakes by handling them, and EVER she is bitten several times. It is unlikely a strange accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> The serpent scene against the nuns was not the only comic death. Driving at a slow speed leads to decapitation in the school parking lot. Then there is a slow ball of destruction, directed straight to the detective. I suppose I could go and make some coffee when the time lapse started coming back to see how the demolition ball was still heading straight for the “interested” detective story. Then there is the most significant cliché "who shot, who shot" when the gun shoots, and both behave as if they were shot for a few seconds, exchanging frightened looks. Then someone falls down the stairs, revealing who was the real victim. In addition, the death of the priest at the beginning of the film seemed a bit strange and meaningless to me. He runs, looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously, finding it rather distressing, he eventually falls, clutching his chest and dies. Apparently, something demonic was happening, as this is what the music offered. Mmmm. OK. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that others rated this film positively and, in particular, as a “worthy sequel”. It's hard not to notice the meaningless scenario, unrealistic game and inappropriate music. There is no expectation in the film, relying heavily on Delia’s “demonic look” to create a sense of horror that becomes rather annoying in a short time. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this is a bad film, the only feature of which is that it can become a comedy.
