My friends can usually come to terms with a lot of hopeless films, but this one was too poor for us to even see it through. It was so boring and unoriginal. Even the "hot" girls who starred in this film could not make me watch. Everything was just predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> At times the game was good ... but more often it was bad. The most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die was supposed to be the best friend of the main characters. The more I saw him, the more I wanted to break my screen. (You know what fat, ugly guy Iâ€™m talking about) <br /> <br /> The plot was shot so many times before I think that other film companies should sue him. Well, that's a good idea, but that's all that was in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this film can only be watched by oneself in order to avoid abuse by friends. Or if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
