This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie in history. Ever It beats all. I have never seen worse. Remove the trophy and give it to these people ..... there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Even three days after seeing this (for some reason I still don’t know why), I can’t believe how insanely Terrifying this film is / was. This is so bad. So far from everything that could be considered a film, story or something that should have ever been created and embodied in our existence. <br /> <br /> It made me think about whether people really go to this earth to do good This made me feel disgusted with myself and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of cinema truly hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we must prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. This is embarrassment. I don’t know how any of these actors, writers or filmmakers of this film sleep at night, knowing that they have played their part in the making of "Loaded". I do not know what disgusting monsters like to watch movies of this type. <br /> <br /> As I said, I love a good “bad” movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are funny. I tell all my friends to see them, because they are "bad." <br /> <br /> But this ....... it crosses the “bad” line in a completely new dimension. This is awkwardly bad. It is bad when you know everything that should happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean, like, after watching the first 5 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> Every stupid editing “effect” is shamelessly used again and again to a disgusting point. I really never want to see the effect of "shaky" camera, "addiction", or spasmodic, or steep, or ANY CUT TO EVENTS. This is meticulously boring, repeats and simply torments the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be more specific here, the most UNACCEPTABLE in this film is that, given the production, it seems that a pretty decent amount of money was actually invested in this excrement. I will personally take the director’s shoulders if I ever see him, and shake him in obedience, demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of Drainage-O, or I will do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever need a new form of inhuman torture for our prisoners of war abroad, just keep showing them this film in a soft chamber over and over again. Believe me, I think they will become more extravagant using suicide methods after the 72nd time through this. <br /> <br /> Stop these films, they are only the most vile aspects of our society. You are welcome. Stop. NOW.
