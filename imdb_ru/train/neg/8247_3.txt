Another British romantic comedy that viewers around the world seem to have a wild appetite. This is a weak effort - an unintentional parody of the genre - here are all classic clich√©s - from ridiculously thoughtful misunderstandings to running after the departing trains to declare your love. Characters are one-dimensional caricatures, except Love Hewitt, who manages to give the film cohesion. Things threaten to spiral out of control in the credibility department as the film progresses; our good faith suspension finally collapses during a ridiculous ending. If you are looking for the experience of Bridget Jones, Notting Hill, you will not find it here.
