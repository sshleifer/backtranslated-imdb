Knowing how old the film is, you should prepare the viewer for several things, and considering these things, the film may be more tolerable. So it was when I watched Zombie Rise. One should expect a strong dependence on tedious dialogue and banal movements, as well as on the primitiveness (or lack) of special effects in those days. The spectator's imagination is being asked a lot - maybe too much in this case. And the plot is not easy to follow: some zombie soldiers from Southeast Asia in World War I performed very well. Although skeptical about why, if this is true, the explanation should remain in the hands of others, so the group is sent for archaeological investigation. The key to distant hypnosis is recognized by one of the members of the expedition, who uses it to, among other things, temporarily do without a beauty for whom he has hot dogs. To prove his love for her, he refuses all that he should not have done, because once they were all ruthless, many want to kill him so that he never controls them again. Below average, even with caution. It is recommended only for extremely patient.
