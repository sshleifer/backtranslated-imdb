Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite cartoon of the 80s. I liked both the first and second seasons of the series, as well as the 1992 Christmas special edition Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas. Some gadget fans quickly criticize the second season (1985) of the show, but they need to compare it with the 2002 DiC release of the Last Case Inspector of the Gadget: Claw Revenge, and then they will find the second season with absolute gold. . <br /> <br /> As a gadget fan, I couldn’t resist seeing the inspector’s animated gadget in something that wasn’t connected to the boy gadget. I bought the film, and I swore to myself that I would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic freedoms would be taken from the original series. I was not even ready for what I was going to watch. <br /> <br /> The original show was almost untouched. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of some of them. Cons of this film: * Humor in the original series is missing. <br /> <br /> * Penny and the Brain (initially playing almost the same role in the series as Gadget) are absent in combat for fifteen to twenty minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * There is no original music of Saban and Levi, and the estimate that exists is below average. (I realized that Saban now has his own production company, but at least Gadgets Inspector Saves Christmas "had good music, even without Saban.) * Don't expect to see any Gadget gadgets that made the show so attractive , as a gadget-kopter, gadget-keychain, gadget-hammer, gadget-coat (which was actually used, but not even called the same), as well as its standard hats and gadgets for hands. In this film, his gadget legs were telescopic, not springs. Such things annoy real fans of the show, and they just do not need to change. <br /> <br /> * The mobile gadget from the original series is now a fast-talking, supposedly “fashionable” convertible. All fans of the original series liked how the gadget-mobile turns into a van with gadgets, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Chief Quimbi is now very hot-tempered and even mean for the Gadget. He was always grumpy in the original series, but it is a bit repulsive. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. <br /> <br /> Does this movie have any positive sides? ? Well, that's all ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice Lamarche copes with the role of the great Don Adams as an Inspector for the Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Chief Quimby hints at a real villain from the animated series: The Great Wambini (the classic villain Gadget from season two, voiced by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Looking for additional factors for this movie? Well, you're out of luck. Life is about making choices and living those choices. Most life situations have a purpose, even if she teaches a lesson. The lesson learned here: stick to the original formula! "If it is not broken, do not fix it." Fans of a true gadget should stay away from this movie; You will certainly be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hopefully DiC and scream! The factory will continue to produce more of the original series after the release in 2006 of Gadget Inspector: Original Series, Volume 1, containing the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true fan of gadgets, a fan of the 80s animation and many DiC programs, I encourage viewers to purchase "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVDs that will fit perfectly and bring with them. good memories
