It seemed to me that I watched this movie a thousand times earlier. It was absolutely predictable. Every time the story tried to become a bit distorted, every time I waited for something interesting, I did not see anything except what I expected. They say, "The bakery opened another enterprise, because there was not enough bread." In a nutshell: a flat story, a clich√©, a bad game, bad special effects ... Only the stupid Russian cop Vlad was a little funny when he punished the bad guys. The muscle pile was incredibly stupid that it made me laugh at him for a moment. I wonder why I spend my time spitting on this disgrace of the film ... It won't get any worse (because it is impossible): D
