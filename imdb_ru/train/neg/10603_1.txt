I tried to watch this film twice, and both times I could not get to the end. The first time I managed to sit through the first sequence of the battle, and then lost interest. The second time I managed to force myself to digest a stupid acting game for a few hours, a slop SFX and an extremely bad direction. Pale in comparison with the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever heard of the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who did not let me fill you. Now 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest box office for all time ... Atari decides to release the game with reference to movies on his home 2600 console system. In short, a long and financially painful history has come to be felt that thousands and Thousands of Atari 2600 ET games were thrown to landfills because they could not even give them away, let alone sell them. <br /> <br /> What does Universal Soldier: The Return have to do with this story? Look at the rating of 3.2 and find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> A horrible movie ... IMDb forced me to give it 1 out of 10, because their rating systems are not as low as 0, not to mention 0 in negatives.
