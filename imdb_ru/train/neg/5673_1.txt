I quote Oedpius Rex, because it is a tragedy that this film was even made !!! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I am by no means a hater of Uwe Boll, like most people without humor on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Such films of Uwe Boll as “Post” and “Tunnel rats” are very bad and therefore interesting. But honestly, this film was just awful. I hated it so much that I could give it a zero rating if I could. The story is just crap! He spends four-fifths of the film building the plot, and then they have the middle, which is just the scenes of a grizzly horrible tasteless killing! Finally, end it with Villan’s victories, which is perfectly acceptable, but undoubtedly it could be more delicious than this! <br /> <br /> I am not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) and not against violent films! I fucking love brutal movies! I liked the films "Saw", "Hostel", "Police Tokyo Mountain", "New York Ripper", 28 films, "Dog Soldiers", "My Bloody Valentine", "Last House on the Left", "Watchmen", "Wolf Creek, every Tarantino film, every Peckepe Sam, even the Cannibal F ** Holocaust King! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was just cruel, sadistic and perverse! And look at the films that I just listed! If I liked the cannibal Holocaust, and not this one, then it must be bad! Uwe, do not go into the darkness again! You're funny when you have a weak heart, like Ed Wood. It was just a terrible experience! After that, I felt terrible! <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK !!!! AVOID ALL COST !!!!!
