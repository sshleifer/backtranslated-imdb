I read the back of the box, and it said Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron. I thought, "Wonderful! It will be great!" I was so wrong. The story was all spoiled. In fact, I still do not understand. It just seems to me that all the heroes drank, smoked (opium?) And had sex. Not that this is a bad film quality, but please! Where was the story? I forced myself to finish the film, and yes, he still picked up by the end, but by that time the film was almost finished. Rent it if you really want. Just do not believe the back of the box.
