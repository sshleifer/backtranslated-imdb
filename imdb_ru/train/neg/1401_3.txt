Someone mentioned editing. This is badly edited, and what began as an intriguing, became an incomprehensible mess. First, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choice for the type of experiments in which they participate? And what exactly are they testing? Obviously, there is some ambitious plan that some agency is going to use. The game is pretty bad. All emotions. Everyone keeps secrets. They often mention that if it were not for the money, they would have hung up. There is an abnormal minister who is spewing Scripture. Again and again. But, again, the biggest problem is the lack of a playing field for actors. There are some really crappy items. These small rooms and these chaise lounges. Horrible wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). It was interesting, but it never went away.
