Ambush is not an ordinary action movie. It is very bad to be ordinary. One person goes to the other with a flaming machine gun. The other shoots with one shot and fires a person with greater firepower, and not a penny of lead hail falls on him. Guess which one is a good guy. Duh. Such is the "Ambush" through. Not a good action movie, not a good drama, not a good movie, Ambush fails at all levels, because B-movie veterans are mechanically moving through the movements, as if they know they really lost. No one is recommended. <br /> <br />
