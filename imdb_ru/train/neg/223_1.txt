Not a "female film", but a film for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by a male director about a woman. Director Andy McKay just does not know a woman. Peaks of bad taste, humorous style of American pie, rough story, no sense, unreasonable story, refuted characters Vulgar fantasies came to life on the screen. It's a shame and definitely not funny. I wonder how three good actresses took part in this?
