Kirstie Ellie, looking a bit slimmer, but only a little, is in this mess with a MacGyver-like man, bleached blond hair and all that. The premise of the film is about an elderly woman (50 !!!) who cannot get her script due to age discrimination, so she sends her younger nephew to pretend to be a writer. Not an original idea and not a very good movie with a lousy game, meaningless dialogue and a funny plot. There is another story about a writer who loves or admires Kirsty’s hero, and why it’s included is a mystery. The actor who portrays Brother Kirsty is so wooden and strange that it was painful to look at their scenes. What can I say about this movie. Avoid this.
