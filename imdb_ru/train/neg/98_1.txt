I received this film as a gift, I knew from the cover of the DVD, this film will be bad. After I have not watched it for more than a year, I finally looked at it. what a pitiful movie ??. <br /> <br /> I almost never finished watching this bad movie, but it would be unfair of me to write a review without watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Believe me, when I say “this movie sucks,” I’m really shocked that some bad director Wayne Bee even received funding to make this pathetic movie, but it couldn’t cost more 20,000 dollars to make this movie. All you need is a cheap camcorder or mobile phone camera. About 15 people without acting skills, the script, written by several drunk people. <br /> <br /> In the first part of this terrible movement, the reporter (Tara Woodley), assuming that she was drunk, tells about the hunting city. He is completely unharmed. They went to the alleged abandoned house, but, fortunately, it was almost completely furnished and the bottle of alcohol on the threshold of the door was there. only for the alleged drunk person, but everything is not as it seems. <br /> <br /> Then the alleged drunk man begins to tell stories about the ghosts / zombies of Tara. <br /> <br /> Fist of your fool Lame stories should be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> His story <br /> <br /> Sergeant. Ben Draper allowed one of his soldiers to die from exhaustion (I think that’s exactly what happened), after allowing the poor soldier, private Wilson, to squat, he let him dig a grave, and then the soldier collapsed, Ben Draper <br / > <br /> buried him in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But Sergeant. Ben Draper is waiting for a big surprise. his wife / girl knows about this, and she and her lover kill the sergeant. Ben Draper revenged private Wilson (next to the grave of the soldier he killed). The soldier wakes up from the grave in the form of a zombie and kills them for taking revenge for him. <br /> <br /> The end of the twist was so inconclusive. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, don't watch this movie.
