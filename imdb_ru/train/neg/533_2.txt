I knew that “Evening” was a film about a girl, so I expected him to be bored. The wicked tease IMDb said it was a “flick of the chickens”, but that your companion would survive. <br /> <br /> Survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when the two of us left, we were amazed to find that it lasted only two hours - the evening seemed much longer! I suppose that for the Yankee it should be sublime or fascinating, because we are talking about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide veranda and lawn, but without an obvious lawn mower. If you are impressed, it may seem like a rather short film. <br /> <br /> There is a movie about Monty Python about a knight who simply will not die. He finishes wriggling (why the Yankees add a third syllable to this word, I wonder) torso on the road, still shouting threats at his sworn enemy. This film is also about some living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the serious evader shown here) continues to die, having inappropriate guilt. She does not bother to be wide open, breathless, but imagines herself to be a murderer. <br /> <br /> Obviously, being a film about a girl, there is a guy who should be Mr. Darcy / Heathcliff’s character. I am not a woofer, so I cannot claim to be a good judge in such things, but the tedious weakling who is driven out for this role seems to have only the title of servant in his favor. He is a bloodless cipher. <br /> <br /> As you understand, the main characters are not so many cops, but the secondary ones manage, which is surprisingly much worse. There is a guy whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is pregriding. True, but this is not the role of Hamlet - why so bad? Having forgotten that it was a film about a girl, I thought that he would be thrown out, because any decent girlfriend would have told him that the fungus on his face did not flatter him, but then I realized that she must have pushed him to grow a “beard” because without him he looked worse. <br /> <br /> I didn’t sleep, noticing which actors and actresses had earlobes attached or free, and noting interesting fragments of the landscape - if you were dragged to it, look if you can find a stuffed buffalo head, then you expect to see in a beach cottage. <br /> <br /> In addition to the obligatory wedding, there is only one action. You would think that they would understand it correctly. Unfortunately, however, an accident with an accident occurs in a car that cannot be there. When an accident is detected, the actors wander over a scream about a character that they cannot know, nearby (but we do as an audience). If they have no idea that a person is a few miles from a place, then why are they wandering aimlessly shouting about him? I believe that the director’s justification is that he should be a half-remembered sleep episode ... <br /> <br /> Another piece of scenery that caught my attention was the saucepan with the copper bottom. I did not think that the technology for this was developed until the fifties.
