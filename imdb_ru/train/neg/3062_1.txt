Some would say that “Baby Geniuses” with giant baby robots or “Dumbo” with a psychedelic episode of a nightmare filled with drugs will be rewarded for the most disturbing film for children. You can say that too, but you are mistaken. And now, I'll bring you: Santa Claus, the most helpless family movie ever since ... well, ever. <br /> <br /> From the introductory scenes in which children from different parts of the world sing their tasteless thematic songs (seriously, this segment lasts almost 20 minutes and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the exciting conclusion in which Merlin appears out of nowhere and saves the day (do not pay attention to him, he is from Barcelona), this is a childhood trauma in all its glory. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just ... can't ... get ... these ... deer ... laughter ... from ... of. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this amazing piece of garbage, as if you were avoiding a sexually hungry whale during the mating season. However, if the fiery fun demons with a serious case of overeating flu are what you need, I think you should try. But in fact, this film is not worth your time and mental health.
