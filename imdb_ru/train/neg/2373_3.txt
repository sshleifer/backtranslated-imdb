ATTENTION: REVIEW CONTAINS YOUNG SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago I managed to watch the first five films of this franchise, and I planned to review the entire Elm St. series. However, after only two years, and I found that I can not remember enough about them to do it ?? I guess they could not make their mark. From what I remember, some of the sequels ?? Warriors dream in particular ?? it was not as bad as it is often done, although even the original was not a classic. As a rule, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep, they are killed in a dream) does not give in to narrative tension. But although I can’t remember most of the first five films, I know for sure that they never looked into the depths of Dead Freddy. <br /> <br /> A sign of how sick the Freddie audience is at this moment can be judged by the fact that the film was moving solely after the death of the character. The fact that the conclusion of the film is not even hidden, but in fact the whole purpose of the film is to show how empty, heartless and cynical this enterprise was. <br /> <br /> Accepting the morally dubious idea of ​​having a child molester like a charismatic villain, Robert Englund's rampant interpretation is roaring with laughter. I always thought that Freddie’s mockery of teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenagers who could ever watch this joke. It’s like Englund shouting, “We know it’s rubbish, but you pay to see it, so who laughs?” And I’m sure that the victims of child abuse will be disappointed to see such an insensitive description of their situation. Was the appearance of Freddie in films always so elementary? All he can do here is a few “haaaaaaaaaaaaarr har har hars” and that's it. If it was the only Holy Knitting movie you’ve ever seen, you wouldn’t recognize the character at all. Even in spite of the fact that the death figure in memories Inglund plays him as a villain-pantomime with hissing in transatlantic (that is exaggerated, inappropriate and not funny at all) irony. <br /> <br /> Acting almost everywhere is poor. Look how many times Breckin Meyer replays with his gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Japhet Cotto, retains his dignity. And when Rosanna, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper appear, you can almost see the film sink into the mud. The script is also absolutely lousy, almost useless. Carlos (Ricky Din Logan) reveals a roadmap on which Noel the Cowardly Freddie wittily wrote: “You're a fuck.” When Carlos asks for a card, he replies: "Well, the card says that we are awesome." Who wrote the script, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> What about the scene where Freddie tortures Carlos, his hearing rises to painful levels? So Freddie is torturing him, threatening to throw a pin? potentially deadly sound, given that all sounds are amplified. Strange, but the fact that Carlos is screaming at the top of his voice so that he does not fall seems to have no effect. “It's nice to hear from you, Carlos,” Freddie jokes, hoping that more successful features will come. It is also worth noting that sleep in a dream does not happen instantly, therefore, if you lost consciousness, it would not allow getting instant access to the world of Freddie. Although part of the story contains a human computer game, and the logic of the three-dimensional final plot is not so high in the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> The teenagers who lead the cast this time are really the most unpleasant. Unpleasant group in the whole series. Tracy (Leslie Dean) - the only one who meets Freddie with “shut up, dude” and a blow to the scallops. And was ridiculous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddie is dead Do not laugh Do not be scared. No interest. Without fun. <br /> <br />
