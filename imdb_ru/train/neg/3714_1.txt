This film is a census of Warren Beatty’s 1978 film “Heaven Can Wait,” but it was written for Mr. Rock’s comedy style. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is taken before his life time expires, and makes a deal with God's representative, Mr. King, to return to earth as someone else. As in the movie Beatty; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a wealthy white man, all because he likes Sonti Jenkins (Regina King), who appears in Wellington's house at the time of the murder. In this remake, the role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers, and the idea of ​​turning an elderly white multimillionaire into a standing black comedian who tries to persuade Santi does not work. In addition, the interrupts used to show Rock as Wellington, and then as the real “white” Wellington, failed miserably. Improvements could have been made to Beatty’s original plot, which in itself did not skillfully portray the idea of ​​“life after death”, but they, of course, could not be found in “Down to Earth”.
