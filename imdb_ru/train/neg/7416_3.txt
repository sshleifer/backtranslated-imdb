A fashion designer stumbles over a cat and falls into the pool, hitting his head on something floating on the surface. With rather foolish effects (it was a television movie), it pops out of her body. She swims through a tunnel with rings of swirling orange smoke, and black rigid figures enter her gaze (they look like dummies in her apartment). I almost thought I was watching Jess Franco's movie .... When her friends enlivened her, the black hand grabbed her wrist, and she had to struggle to free herself. When she comes to, she remembers everything, and she has a bruise on her arm. <br /> <br /> Soon after that, she was nearly knocked over by an unmanaged car that was driving on the sidewalk behind her. On Halloween, she decides with her boyfriend to go on holiday to Mexico. When she gets there, she is surprised to find that it is the Day of the Dead. They are annoyed by another American tourist who continues to follow them, and he almost sinks into them. <br /> <br /> Designers are invited to join a group of people who were on the verge of death. All of them survived the tunnel, but not black figures or repeated escapes from death. One of them has, and he is very worried. She is also recommended to meet with a psychic. <br /> <br /> A doctor tells her about people he calls “Walkers” (the name of the novel on which he is based). These are people who presumably died from one cause, which, when investigated, turned out to be dead from another cause. Thus, they continued to walk after death until they died again, but he blames it on poor record keeping. <br /> <br /> I watched this on a 102-minute video and it was awfully long. I can't imagine that there is actually a 192-minute version! Perhaps if it was intended to be watched on television for two or more nights, it would be better to watch it this way than in one sitting. <br /> <br /> I read only one novel by Gary Brandner, Floater, and if he is a representative of his work, he is not the most original writer. Floater had a common conspiracy: the chosen child kills people out of revenge. Even the variation was quite common: the chosen child dies and kills people years later out of revenge from the grave. And in fact it has a common feature with this film: the child practices astral projection, and when he drowns, he swims out of his body, like here. I don’t know how close his novel Walkers follows From Dead of the Night. I understand that howling films are not very similar to his novels. <br /> <br /> This is a rather slow movie, and special effects and cinematography are really held back (apparently) by a low budget and are intended for - disadvantages of TV. There are many easily recognizable characters. It also seems very outdated, earlier and in the mid-1980s than in 1989. I was bored. Much better than a low-budget film covering a similar theme, which I don’t think is outdated so badly, is The One Survivor (1983) (perhaps this is the inspiration for the 2000s Final Destination films). It blows from the dead the night away.
