... or the audience. Overview .... <br /> <br /> So you have a doctor who is experimenting with stolen body parts for some uncertain reason. He wants to make a transplant, but he feels he has to do it in his basement. WTF ??? And suddenly, unfortunately, and conveniently, his fiance cut off his head as a result of a road accident, for which he is responsible. Suffering from grief, he keeps her head in a pan with lasagne (or is it a strudel?) And pumps it up with a full “adreneric serum” (sic) to support her life. And then she wakes up, discouraging her head (so to speak), even if her neck was clearly cut off from the vocal cords and she doesn’t have lungs, so she couldn’t speak even if they had them. It seems that the ungrateful mother does not appreciate all that her fiance has done for her. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his grief turns into excitement when he sees the opportunity to instill the head of his lover on the body of the first dirty girl he can pick up from the street. In the meantime, the assistant doctor, a kind of Igor's little shop, enters into philosophical debates with a head that has made telekinetic friendships with the “monster in the closet” (every mad scientist has one). In the end, the screenwriter realizes that he cannot continue to cause his misogyny and fear of intimacy of the audience indefinitely, so he kills everyone and then, apparently, goes to the bank to cash the check before the film's financial backers can stop paying . in the subject. <br /> <br /> I already said that I think this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone must tell Turner Classic films to stop showing this edited version without horror. The sight of an assistant with a torn off hand that feels around the house without leaving a lot of blood is just too precious.
