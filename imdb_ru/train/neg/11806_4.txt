It has been difficult to watch this movie and to be absolutely honest and objective, since I am a big fan of the original 1944 film. For me and many others, this is one of the greatest films ever made. Understanding that this is just an abbreviated film made for television, and that most people have spoiled it, I did not expect much, but you cannot but compare it to a film of 44 years. Backstage, I found myself comparing what I looked at and remembering how it played with Fred McMurray, Barbara Stenvik, Edward G. Robinson, and others. Now I saw these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was over, I found that everything was not as bad as I had expected, but this did not correspond to the 1944 original. The two main areas in which this film was not so good for television were: (1) electricity was lost between the two units and (2) just 90 minutes, they rushed into the plot, barely having time to develop a plot, characters and chemistry between these leads. Krenna and Eggar were flat and simply did not match McMurray and Stanvik as "Walter Neff" and "Phillis Dietrichson", respectively. <br /> <br /> Where this rethinking took place in other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton". Cobb was awesome, like Kees, and Robert Webber - like Norton, the head of the insurance company. It was also somewhat interesting to see how the time frame changed, so houses, cars, telephones, voice recorders, etc. were in the early 70s and not in the mid 40s. The rest of the storyline was very similar, just in a hurry. <br /> <br /> However, one viewing was enough, and Iâ€™ll be happy to return to the original version for the rest of my views of this classic story and film.
