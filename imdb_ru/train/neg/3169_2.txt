This film is one of the worst for the year. The main characters do not have chemistry, and the game is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has talent, and the only one who is not annoying. I never watched Desparte Housewives, so I don’t know how Eva Longoria was in this show, but in this film she was terrible As if she doesn’t know anything about acting. All that makes her heroine - it whine throughout the film, and she can not play the role of b **** and still be interesting. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion, and you seem to be looking at the hint cards when she reads them. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is so printing. It goes from point A to B with a little surprise. Much more could be used with Kate as a ghost. The plot had to revolve more around it and what it does as a spirit. <br /> <br /> FINAL CONCLUSION: It’s not worth looking at.
