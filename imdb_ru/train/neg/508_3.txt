An early film directed by D.V. Griffith; in it is a superbly happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the King leaves the stage, his Queen makes music with the Palace's Minstrels (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers lovers, he decides to commit the terrible revenge of Edgar Allen Poe. It is hard to believe that lovers do not hear those who plot against them; although the actors try to look alternately noisy (lovers) and quiet (concrete mixers). The sets make the "Sealed Room" very staged. The performances are in order, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.V. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
