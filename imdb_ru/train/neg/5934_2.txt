I do not consider myself one of the greatest fans of Leonard Cohen. He, however, appears as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far, the most valuable element of this documentary is to hear Leonard’s thoughts about his life and career. Warming and modesty. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians represented at the concert did not change the nuances of Leonard’s musical / literary manner. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were exceptions, although Leonard appreciates the interpretation of his songs by Rufus Wainwright. <br /> <br /> What was particularly unsuccessful in this documentary is the director’s ability to let the viewer see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians relate to him. Much has been said in this respect, but the viewer does not fall into the personality of Leonard Cohen. This failure is especially evident in interviews with Bono and Edge. They see Leonard as a special icon, but they cannot translate their exact meaning to Leonard Cohen. Cooperation with U2 is a farce. All live registration is like an urgent job. And just like in the whole film, only Leonard Cohen remains part of it and can talk about his own part. <br /> <br /> The whole montage and script are very similar to the correspondence project of a secondary school. Using effects such as echo, slow motion or flashing image is poorly placed. Part of the camera work is grim. Part of the score hardly reminds of any associations that I could expect. At times, the director seemed to add psychotic elements to the film. Perhaps a reference to his once-used LSD. <br /> <br /> Some kind of unintentional humor ... at some point Leonard tells how he influenced the music genre.

The next scene in the film is a live broadcast of “I Can't Forget” ... <br /> <br /> “And I Can't Forget, I Can't Forget, I Can't Forget, But I Can't Remember Who
