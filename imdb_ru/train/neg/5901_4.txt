Something to sing about was produced at Grand National Studios, where James Cagney worked during a contractual dispute with the Warner Brothers. He made two films for this B-studio, neither of which received a high rating in Cagneyâ€™s films. <br /> <br /> One of the big losses for the movie is the fact that Jimmy Cagney made so few films that used his amazing dance skills, Two that immediately come to mind are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Parade Footlight. Two smaller films - "The History of West Point" and "Never steal anything small." Cagney himself said that he had never watched anything but his retired musicals. So why did he make them so little? <br /> <br /> Well, this one was wrong. The plot of Something to Sing About concerns the subwoofer, which stands for the group that opened and received the contract for the film. There are common complications: the cunning studio boss and the crafty press agent played by Gene Lockhart and William Froley, respectively. His contract requires no marriage, so Cagney and singer Evelyn Dow marry in secret. Then we get the complication of the studio advertising novel with lead lady Mona Barry. I think you can understand where this is going. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing in Something to Sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and end of the film and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Dow had a good singing voice and charisma of a ham sandwich. She got the musical numbers as they were. I'm sure the audience paid for the tickets to see Cagney dance. <br /> <br /> Besides, besides the fact that he gave him several dance performances, he would be a good dance partner. He danced well with Ruby Keeler at the Parade of the World and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day at West Point Storey. Weren't Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler available? <br /> <br /> There were no memorable songs. And Dow's voice is also a talisman. She has the soprano voice of Jeanette MacDonald, who was so out of place with the swing band. <br /> <br /> No wonder Cagney ran back to Warner Brothers. But they had to give him some decent musicals.
