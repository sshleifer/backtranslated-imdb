When I was a child, I remember watching it when I visited our “uncle” Phil's friend. We returned! The dinosaur story is a stupid cartoon about a dinosaur named Rex (voiced by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a little boy dinosaur a story about how dinosaurs returned to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of what brought them back along with some friends. The villain Doctor / Professor of this film, I think, may have been responsible for their return, but I do not care about him. Children may like it, but personally it's too stupid. John Goodman was probably the only worthy thing. Poor!
