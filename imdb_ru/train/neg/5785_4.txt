VAMPIRES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: mono <br /> <br /> Motorists (Murray Brown) are lured into an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianna Morris and Anulka) and immerse themselves in their free energetic sexual way of life, but its owners turn out to be vampires with a furious thirst for human blood ... <br /> <br /> Understanding this from the cycle of lesbian vampires, started by the director- maverick Jean Rollin in France and the consolidated success of the series Hammer "Carmilla" in the UK, bold Shocker Jose Ramon Larras "VAMPIR" put forward the concept of "Adult Horror" much further than the British censors were willing to endure in 1974, and his film was cut by almost three minutes in its original British release. It is easy to understand why! Using his Gothic theme as a pretext for so many naked people, sex and bloodshed that will allow a short time to show the film, Larraz (who wrote the script under the pseudonym "D. Dobeny") uses these commercial elements as a simple background for languid meditation on life, death and promptings - sexual and other - that confirm the human condition. <br /> <br /> Filmed in a picturesque country house in the fall of 1973, pursuing the cinematography of Harry Waksman evokes an atmosphere of gloomy foreboding. in which desolate countryside is gloomy and beautiful in equal measure, it seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of looming horror (Larraz did a similar trick at the beginning of the same year with SYMPTOMS, a reserved thriller that reel during the final madness of violence). Nevertheless, despite their claims, the subtle plot of VAMPYRES and rough production values ​​will divide the audience from the very beginning, and while the two main female characters are as charismatic and attractive as you would wish, male leadership (Brown, past his main) during the filming) terribly mistaken in the role that should have been given to some beautiful twenty-year-old girl. A must-have for fans of cult cinema, a funny surprise for everyone else, VAMPYRES - acquired taste. At the end of the movie, watch out for the superstar of the dumb era Bessie Love in a short cameo.
