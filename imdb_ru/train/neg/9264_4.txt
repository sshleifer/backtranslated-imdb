This inferior sequel, founded by characters created by David Selser and Harvey Bernhard (also a producer), concerns a marriage named Jean (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Fei Grant). They adopt a little girl named Delia from the monastery. Gene York is re-elected to Congressman and chairs the finance committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be near when unexplained deaths occur. It creates chaos when there is a metaphysical fair, because the shops of numerology, therapy, counseling, healing, yoga, tarot and others are destroyed. Karen York hires a private eye (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and strange events. <br /> <br /> This TV sequel demonstrates thrills, chills, horrible events and bloody murders. Delia, such as Damien, seems to be sending a new creepy murder every few minutes of the film, committing horrific murders. The main excitement is to see how mediocre special effects can make a new and innocent victim. In addition, mediocre protagonists, Fay Grant and Michael Woods, no matter how good the minor characters like Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and the recently deceased Don S. Davis, he was an army captain transformed into an acting game. As always, a great musical score, taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is intended exclusively for hardcore followers of Omen Saga. The film is poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominic Otenin Girard. The previous and much better versions are the following: an extremely excellent original Omen (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) of Richard Donner; Damien (William Holden, Lee Grant) Don Taylor; The Last Conflict (Sam Neal and Tisa Harrow) Graham Baker. Rating: below average.
