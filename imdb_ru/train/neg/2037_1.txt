If I could give him zero, I would change my mind and give -10 instead. Absolutely terrible movie without the plot of the film, does not make sense of what is happening. Just boring. Please do not spend your money on this. Pleaseee !!! This film could have been done so well if it really depicted the story of the real killer of the zodiac, but no, I didnâ€™t feel anything but disgust while watching it. Do yourself a favor and rent a few classic films, it's better to watch a movie that you have already seen 3-4 times than watch this shit! I do not understand why people even try to make such films when they know that it will not be good. Zodiac killer should be called "Boryakov killer" !!!
