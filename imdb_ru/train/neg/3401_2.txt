I rented this film after hearing about the rush about not being nominated for an Oscar, but after watching it, it is easy to see why he did not. Despite the beautiful photo, the film is incredibly slow, despite the fact that the plot is almost absent. <br /> <br /> The story of a young boy who is trying to come to terms with the death of his parents, which may or may not have been an accident (the film is never clear about it), and how his grandfather told him fairy tales. In the fairytale scenes there are only interesting pieces of the plot, but they are very short and do not seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale, in particular, concerns a boy trying to present a magic flower to his dying girlfriend in order to save her life, but the boy postpones, first trying the flower to make sure that it is not poisonous, which leads to he was late for a few seconds to save his girlfriend, the grandfather declares that the moral is that the boy is too impatient, but this makes no sense because he has failed because of excessive caution and slowness. The perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> Skyâ€™s photo is beautiful, but then Stardust, which was released this year, is another film about fairy tales shot in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it is infinitely better than this one.
