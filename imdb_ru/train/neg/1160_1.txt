It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. This is (I think) a story about a rebellious college basketball player, his tough but fair coach, his girlfriend and fellow student (played by Michael Margott), who is constantly having breakdowns. The story has not gone anywhere, the character development is zero, there is nothing to worry about, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as a coach, are terrible. It's hard to believe how such a talent as Jack Nicholson could make such a terrible film. Be sure to avoid this turkey.
