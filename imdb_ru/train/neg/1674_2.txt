The premise was intriguing, but unfortunately this film simply does not matter. The casting was pretty good, and it was beautifully shot - but most of the direction was stylistically inconsistent (editing was done too fast, but it didn't matter ...), the characters were identified solely by the use of coke on the screen (and pretty much everything the rest is left to “Boogie Nights” for character development), and there were no characters capable of attracting the viewer to the plot. A very forgotten movie.
