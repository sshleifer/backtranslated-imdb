I must confess that I am greatly disappointed. <br /> <br /> In no way can this version compete with the 1995 version. The reason I watched her was that I was not completely pleased with Ciaran Hinds in the role of captain. Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones is much more like a captain whom I imagined when I was reading a book. And he was too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only quality of the film that saves. Everything else is not as Austin as possible. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would NEVER run through the streets of Bath like this. It was not in her character, and it was not made by a woman of that time. Ann Elliot from the book was a lady, and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but this was the worst option. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotes in the book, they are completely inappropriate and warn those who know the book, which is another important part of the book. will either be absent or reversed. <br /> <br /> And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it seems that everything is in a hurry. Very little was done to introduce the characters, to show their location and motives. Important scenes have been omitted. How could they cut out the final scenes in this way? Catastrophe! And it was nowhere near as beautifully photographed as the others. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austin, do not waste time on it.
