This is one modest movie. He has no real plot. We never become implicated in motives other than wealth. Characters - one of the worst actors who have ever been filmed. The threat seems supernatural, but then it is controlled by these three elderly people. Why they do what they do; in order to instill fear in other members of the group? I dont know. From a foggy car that rolls through the halls, some fog rolls in, and everyone seems to be afraid of it. Does it do something? I dont know. There's a bit of nudity for its own sake. I am always surprised to see this in old films. Things have actually calmed down in this regard these days. In any case, people run like chickens, ready for an ax. They have no plan; no resources; There is nothing. In the film, about five stupid climaxes. Who are these people and "is" whether there is a ghost or demon. What happened to other people? I urge anyone to tell me with confidence. What a mess
