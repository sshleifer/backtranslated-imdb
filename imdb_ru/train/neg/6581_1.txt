I rented "New Best Friend" in the hope of a movie that looks like nice teenage thrillers, such as Gossip and Curve. Instead, the “New Best Friend” is more like “In the Crowd”, which has no thrills, and the game is incredibly fake. “New best friend” is boring, and the events during the film are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
