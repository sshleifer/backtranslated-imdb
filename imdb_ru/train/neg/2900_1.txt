I have a rule of 5 minutes (sometimes I leave for 10 minutes). If a movie is bad in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it will probably never get better. I have not yet experienced a single film that would prove to dispute this theory. Dan in real life is definitely no exception. I watched this turkey and thought; wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, and I donâ€™t like the characters at all. <br /> <br /> The story of a commentator / widower-teacher who brings up three young daughters who fall in love with their friend brothers. I suppose that this slogan will be "browser reviewers who can use advice"? I dont know. The nature of the dance in no way impressed me as someone qualified to give advice. I think this is irony? I dont know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their children at some kind of annual family retreat, which seems like a very nice and potential feed for a good comedy, storylines ... none of which never appear. The main story is mainly about how he loves this woman, but can not have her. Anyone who has an impulse will understand that in the end he will receive it, but you must suffer from the painfully unfunny, banal, lifelong dialogue of the cinema "love killer" in order to get to the inevitable happy ending. really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
