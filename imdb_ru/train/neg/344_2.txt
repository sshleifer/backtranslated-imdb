Let me be really clear about this movie. I did not watch this movie because of the plot, I watch it for audacious sex scenes. However, this film is so damn terrible that I turn the sheer joy of seeing the divine body of Tracy (Mandy Schaffer) and squeeze my eyes out of the disaster of the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Alerting the spoiler The first scene of the film has already made me cringe ... you see a woman who draws something at the lake, in sheer bliss and serenity, then a beautiful girl comes up and asks if she can draw next to her. When they both finished, they show each other what they did ... and the woman painted the vineyard when she collides with the lake. What director of delirium will make such a mistake ?? And in another scene, Tracy kills her teacher's lover, smashing him with a barbell, and then she swims away, and no one from the city police has ever suspected her. I mean helloooo? Mandy didn't wear a glove, did she? Her fingerprints are all over the damn boat! After that, it gets worse, whenever Mandy is there, a “frightening” sound effect sounds, which sounds like a cat, in its worn form. It is a pity that Rosanna Arquette is in this film. I feel real sorry that she does not act in this super low budget soft porn no brainer. The same goes for Jürgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to star in this film. Total 2/10.
