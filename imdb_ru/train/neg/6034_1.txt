Oh god, where to start ... this movie was just awful. The letter was bad, the acting was bad, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this film is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but, of course, did not understand it! I thought it would be decent enough, since I'm not picky. I watched some bad horror movies. In fact, my goal is to watch all the horror films, no matter how horrible they are. Once in the film, I made a comment about “corn syrup blood,” and in special functions they actually admit that it was Karo syrup (branded corn syrup ...). (blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid movements), but he just lacked anything to really do it well. The author should either take some classes or just give up!
