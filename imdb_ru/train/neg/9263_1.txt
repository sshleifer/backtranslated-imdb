What was the clothing deal? All of them were dressed as something from the end of the 70s - the beginning of the 80s. Cars were even outdated. School is outdated. The outfit of the nuns was outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 40s, with its wards and wooden stairs and things. Nothing in the whole film meant that it happened in 1991. My mother laughed, saying, “Damn it! WHEN was this movie MADE? ”When we pressed the“ INFO ”button on our console, we were sure that 1991 was supposed to be a typo! Has anyone else noticed this? My favorite part, however, was when a woman tells her husband her dirty husband on the phone about an inverted cross in the mirror, and he just says, “Well, look, I have a congress meeting. I'll talk to you about that later. This line was just a classic. JUST AS A MAN! My favorite role was that they gave "Spawn of the Devil Child" their own Rottweiler. My mom said, "What the Devil's Spawn needs ... Rottweiler." She also enjoyed people collapsing in churches, clutching their chests. Her OTHER favorite part was the guy in the school parking lot, who was driving at 5 miles per hour, driving right into the garbage truck / dump truck / wheel loader. He had about 20 seconds to just stop the car ... but he just kept walking, with a really dull, blank expression on his face. I mean, how fast can you go to the school parking lot?!?! No difference!
