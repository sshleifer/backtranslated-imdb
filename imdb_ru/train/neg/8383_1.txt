... ever. This is the bottom. I am not kidding. The theater should have had some kind of warning. “Leave all hope that you who come in here” would be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I have no words to accurately describe the hell this movie. His grueling stupidity cannot even entertain. This film is definitely aimed at slow turtles in the sandbox. The story was apparently stolen from the 10-minute cartoon Bugs Bunny, and then stretched out like Mr. Fantastic, to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes. <br /> <br /> I remember when Wi-Fi films were funny. I believe that the pressure of Hollywood to produce products is to blame for the fact that they are constantly growing. I feel sad and sad that they think that we are stupid enough to enjoy 90-minute jokes with a ball and a thin plot based on a cartoon. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like almost everything in this movie. I won’t spoil anything, but the child is actually a dwarf with the face of Marlon Wayans badly applied to the body of the dwarf. What I REALLY loved was the end. Not the resolution of the film, but the actual end, where we all got up and left. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie one star, but it clearly deserves less. I don’t feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script cost stars. It really deserves Razzy, and I pray to God that it will work out. <br /> <br /> When people are going to study; if you stop paying to see this idiocy, they will stop harassing it. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. Avoid this at all costs. You have been warned.
