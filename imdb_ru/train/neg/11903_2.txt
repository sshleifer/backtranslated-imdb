Wanders was great with Million $ Hotel. I do not know how he came up with this movie! The idea of ​​giving an idea of ​​the situation after spt11 and the view of American society gives us hope, which makes it 2 out of ten. But this is not a movie. This is the best thing that someone can do with a great idea (west-east clash). In the Middle East, important things happen and it just appears on the MAC screen with the fingers of an American girl who is actually at the level of stupidity she just does not know the facts). Characters are not well formed. And most importantly, the idea that is given with religion is somehow ridiculous for me. On the final scene, Lana says that let's just be silent and try to listen. And the background music says: "... I will pray." It’s not really a religion. But it ends with this. As you will see the truth, if you just close your eyes and pray. The light is already shining on the truth. It is. PS: "My house is not a place. It is the people." The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is the offer. But it is wasted in creating this film. (By the way, like "someone" mentioned below , the best young people in America are not the best, they are just “poor” and “hopeless” who subscribe to an army in need of good salaries, which are not provided by the government!)
