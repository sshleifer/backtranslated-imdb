On the cover of this movie box is Kyle Minogue's name, but she has the same fate as Drew Barrymore in Creek. This is the first thing that makes this film a failure; they are trying to sell a movie with someone who has been in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course, we need to have young hip college guys in this film who don’t notice that there’s a killer around. To top it all off, Molly Ringwald, known as a teenager in the 80s, became the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career for Molly to get some money by making a crappy movie in Australia, so she won't be made fun of in the states. <br /> <br /> In any case, this stupid film about some silent horror film that was never finished, because this stupid creature kills everyone who is in it. Throughout the film, we have to guess who the killer is. In short, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... or is she? <br /> <br /> This step is just bad, rent it if you want to torture yourself or just break it to the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread the horror.
