Ironically, although he knows how to do the splits, Thomas as an actor is full of energy. <br /> <br /> This film is imprinted in my memory as one of the most wacky and incompetent films I have ever seen. So, I actually quite love it. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason it gets more than one star is because Thomas has a great shape and it's funny to see his tiny, muscular body performing various gymnastic skills on strange-shaped cliffs and poles on the Eastern European side of the country (including the notorious horse-shaped cap in the center of the village square, which Thomas uses to put his feet on the faces of various insane village dwellers). But let the poor creature open his mouth and try to imitate, and any illusion that he may have a career in the cinema, immediately shattered. <br /> <br /> Thomas, at least, had an excuse that he really wasn't an actor. All the others in the film are actors, directors, editors, cameramen, etc. At least the same are bad or even worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt is not as bad as you think. <br /> <br /> Hope poor Kurt took the money and ran. If anyone ever asks him to play the martial arts movie again, I bet that Thomas kicked the guy in the face.
