Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is the US-Mexican border policeman. He serves as the father of a young immigrant Danny de la Paz (like Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best man at his upcoming wedding. Savalas is cruel, but Eddie Albert's boss (as Commander Moffat) can be tougher. It’s hard to stop smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suárez). Alliances may be in flux. <br /> <br /> If you think that Kodjak and Oliver Douglas are cursing, they are disgusting, you should stay away from Border. If not, you may not be mad enough for a “realistic” scene of slaughter of cows. Although it is not worth it, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Lane) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
