If you have seen very few films, this may be great for you. If you've seen a lot of movies, this is a joke. The game of these heroes is depicted very badly. Not to mention the fact that there are songs, there are many memories, and most importantly, the battle scenes are stupidly performed. New characters, good leadership, would have done better, but since they have all the heroes / heroines of Bollywood, you can predict what will happen next. You are not sad when something happens, the emotions that they experience are terrible, mainly because we saw this actor in 1000 other Hindi films. This is supposed to be a realistic film, but not shown. There are times when you ask yourself: you have thousands of army vehicles filled with moving soldiers, and the Pakistanis are bombing them, and not one of their bombs hit them. Did the packs really aim badly, or did the director make them look stupid? There were only a few characters who played very well, but as for the plot, the actions, they are badly aimed. This film could be short if they took songs, memories, stuck to the point.
