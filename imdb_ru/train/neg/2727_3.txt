This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION really doesn't need to be included, because it is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. However, what she does is shine when she is on the screen. The closest plot without a film is just a reason to show some of the contract players of Warner of the day. JANCIE RULE shows promise, and it is a shame that she did not become a big star. RUT ROMAN performs the role of "breadwinner" with aplomb. Better if it were in color. Travis Air Force Base locations with some rear projections work well. What is best in the film is a wonderful musical interlude. If you liked “THANK YOU GOOD LUCK STARS” and “Hollywood Kant”, you will like this one.
