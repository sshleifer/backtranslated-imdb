At the young day there is bad hair, he goes to the hill and goes where he cannot escape. Then he meets mr. ATLAS, the “mythological” dude 2,000 years ago, as his best friend and sound-like Arnold Schwarzenegger. His herculean strength helps the boy avoid danger, and then adapts to modern life. So what's the deal? This is the most disgusting idea for a family walk! In any case, it should not have tried at all, really! Our fictional character of power and muscle is nothing more than a typical stranger who seems common to the whole universe. To blasphemy, you should add the absence of something new or attractive, and before you know about it, an attempt is made to violence that does not qualify it as “family” entertainment. The scene where Atlas complains about his underpants is still giggling. Just spend a nice quiet day in the park for a change.
