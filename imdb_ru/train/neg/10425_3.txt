Note that this film is great, but only in the form in which it tells a very bad story. Stella is so terribly rude and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobbish and narrow-minded. No one ever learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella realizes that her daughter is ashamed of her tasteless manners and dress, but can not understand that she just needs to soften it all? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman and a very good mom. Abandoning yourself, so her daughter may be associated with a bunch of fanatical snobs, that's disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see might be normal for those times - people drinking a beer or two, enjoying playing the piano, dancing - but this looks like a kind of moral inferiority. “I can't have our baby live like this!” Deliver me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: an unwashed working class can never hope for the height of the upper classes. And that's just a bunch of bullshit.
