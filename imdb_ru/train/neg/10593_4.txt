The notorious "classic" Ed Wood "Plan 9 from space" is a perturbed alien calling the human race "... stupid! Stupid, stupid stupid!" I would say that to show. And in this test it will probably be this film, a ridiculously stupid science fiction film. <br /> <br /> Falling fighter Jean-Claude Van Damme returns to the main role for him from the original film. Luc, a former universal soldier who is currently working on creating really good universal soldiers. Although Van Damme was too big to repeat the role in the first two sequels, he was too small to do anything else by the time the fourth film was released in the Universal Soldier series. Thus, probably cursing himself all the way under his breath, he kicks, grunts and frowns after ninety minutes of explosions and karate beats. You will find a lot of senseless violence, but I would advise you to take a check of the coat for the brain by the door when you start to watch it. Otherwise, you can forget where you left it when you're done. <br /> <br /> Luke is called to action against more Universal Soldiers after a truly REALLY evil computer named Set (makes HAL look like Gandhi) turns all other universal soldiers into evil, merciless murderers. Of course, this is what these things are programmed for, but in this case they kill their creators, not the “enemy”, so this is a problem. <br /> <br /> I like the blunt logic of this movie. Logic, which assumes that the supercomputer will create for itself a body that looks as shameful as Michael Jai White in this film. The logic that dictates that the creator of Set is a blue-haired computer stereotype that spews cliches more regularly than Old Faithful. In the logic in which the fight with karate climate occurs, there are two characters who hit each other, although ten separate glasses break over an interval of three minutes of the screen. <br /> <br /> The film also depicts the daughter, the danger, Bill fighter. Goldberg, as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier, and so enthusiastic about the novel, I must think that the authors believed that obsessive romances are really a GOOD thing. And when this film ends, it ends. Less than a minute after the giant explosion in the final style, and the loans began. No epilogue, no where they are now, no final kiss, just an explosion, a hug, an end. Even the creators want to get rid of this thing as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Although not Plan 9, US: TR is a silly little thing of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of noisy parties. Fans of Van Damme, who love to see their hero really reach new depths. Not to be seen on a serious belly.
