The first line of Joe Don tells everything about this film. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pretentious men) and involves Joe Don Baker in tracking down an Italian gangster. The character Joe Dona is called Geronimo (pronounced Geronimo), and all he does in this film shoots people and gets arrested again and again. Everyone in the film hates him, just as everyone hates Graydon Clark. I liked the earlier picture of Graydon's "Angel's Revenge" because it was wide for boys who turned three years old. Avoid this movie at all costs!
