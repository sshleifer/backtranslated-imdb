I recently watched the first film “Guinea Pig”, “Devil's Experiment”, and I must admit that I am disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film is invariably included in any list of the “nastiest” films, and perhaps I expected more because of deception. The truth is, I don't appreciate it. <br /> <br /> If I watched it, believing that the introductory text was true (“I found this tape ...”), I might be a little concerned about this, thinking that it was real. Even if I did not know that this is not real, I would understand that this is really not the case. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, she reacts to what they are doing to her. just not what they should be. She should scream like a banshee in pain. The fact that it does not mean that this is clearly not realistic. I would not want to watch it if it were real, but if it were more convincing in its game, the film would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are the notorious scenes: nothing affected me all up to the scalpel in hand. Hot oil, maggots and entrails just did not bother me. I am not saying that I am "hard"; I just could not stop my disbelief, partly because of the girl’s inaction. <br /> <br /> The scalpel made me shudder a little, but the hammer in my hand just made a rubber hand. And the final scene with an eye frowned again, but no more. I did not want to look away and did not feel nauseous. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is because the film is more than twenty years old, or maybe I'm just exhausted. The truth is that I do not find this film quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is the thing that you would expect to see in the cycle, as an installation of modern art and as an exercise in shooting characters. , story, etc., and just leaving the torture, it works on some levels. As a disturbing fragment of the film, at least it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I looked at the guinea pig with my wife, who bent over "it's just a movie," and she was surprised that all the fuss was about. We started to discuss why I watch these films, and I have many reasons, but there is a desire for the film to touch me. She said she did not think that any film could be so convincing as to disturb her, and suggested that I do exactly that. I played her on stage as a fire extinguisher from the movie “Irreversible”, and she was really alarmed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that I have a meaning, except that both of us were more alarmed by the scene in the not-horrified genre film than any film that still intends to disturb.
