Bingo is a game, nonsense is the name. Rarely has the screen been soiled with such a blasted mess of semi-dry conspiracy theories, puritanical hooliganism and gibberish of the new century. Most of the story takes place in Vicente, a Christian resort in the Peruvian jungle. Just think, Rivendell Tolkina meets the planet "Star Trek" in Baku, where the unconscious followers of the not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow worship of love and peace live. Thanks to the terrible action and tasteless production design (the rosy visualization of the mysterious universal "energy" is particularly disgusting), Celestine's Prophecies looks and resembles the discarded episode of the Twilight Zone of the 1980s. Actual errors concerning church history and nomenclature abound. I cannot believe that Hector Elizondo agreed to be a part of this. Perhaps this was done without his consent in the style of Bowfinger. May the Lord spare the director, the screenwriter, the author of the novel and the poor souls who are watching a movie or reading a book.
