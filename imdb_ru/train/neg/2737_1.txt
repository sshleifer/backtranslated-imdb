In this review there are no spoilers. Nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> No conspiracy, nothing; in most clips, at least, they try to link clips in the plot with some minor stretch, but this has not even happened. The clips, the three lines that lead to the next endless sequence of boring clips ... Well, so maybe they didnâ€™t have enough time to produce, but it would be better to skip this episode completely. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm not sure how this happened. Scrubs usually do much better with subversion, but somehow they did it ... <br /> <br /> Thank God for the next episode they regained their form.
