The best thing about camp films in general is what you know what to expect. This is like watching a professional duel, a daytime soap opera or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the meager plot, identify the cardboard characters and watch with satisfaction until all the cliches are performed. However, sometimes the director does something really unexpected. It may be something unusually stupid, or something strange, or something insightful. Director Makinen is there with the best leaders of the camp, and this is his best film. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat, it seems everything fits. This is not good, but still manages to be one. The film does not slow down even once - the action continues and the hits continue. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no sense of time: some characters seem to take months doing something, while other characters only spent one hour at the bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer, when the sun never sets, so you donâ€™t even feel the day turning into night. <br /> <br /> Finally: there is a conspiracy somewhere. You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it.
