I was gifted with this film, as there was such a wonderful premise in it - the friendship of three women spoiled by one in love with a young man. <br /> <br /> Intriguing. <br /> <br /> NO! I hasten to add. All these women are drawn in extreme caricatures, they don’t support each other very much and come to an agreement and manage to knock each other down. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton couldn’t do anything wrong in my book before they saw it, but here they are handed a dark script and are told to balance the action between the farce and the talker that doesn’t work well when women are all famous professionals in a very small city. <br /> <br /> And for smart women, they spend a whole lot of time complaining about the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt that much more could have been done from this, given the decent script and great tension, the lesbian sub-plot did not go away, and those women who smoke / drink (all three are over forty ???) were very unrealistic - even in the children's scene - Screw the child, give a cigarette! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, the shame of spending. 4 out of 10
