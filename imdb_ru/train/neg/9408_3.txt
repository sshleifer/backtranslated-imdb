Watching videos of 8 different cartoons about Spiderman 1994-1997 made me understand why I couldn't survive this when it first came out. <br /> <br /> I’m from old school, where in 1967 Cartoon Spiderman was the best and still remains the best. (I will not go into the psychedelic version, which is terrible - please give me the traditional villains.) <br /> <br /> In the new material is lousy, read the sheets either without feeling or with reappraisal. Paul Sols, where are you now? This guy was the best voice acting for Spider-Man. Nobody comes close. Viewing Secret Wars, a great idea for the animated series, made me flinch. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. In the scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has no German accent, and Ock has a heavy Russian! In the old 1966 Marvel hero comic series, the voice was much better. “Iron Man” sounded like it had an iron mask on, and “Captain America” sounded authoritative, not at all like a teenager. Paul Fries, like the 60s Thing, was the best in history. Old voice actors were pioneers, and never will be like them. Have you ever heard Mel Blanc's son? He can not repeat his father. <br /> <br /> The animation is awkward. So, they have all the fancy shadows of characters and beautifully drawn backgrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad. Sometimes, when you allow a computer to control movements, they become robotic. I really do not think that any of these animators know what intermediate links are. <br /> <br /> Stories are poorly written, and some of the lines they give to the heroes are terrible. Why, for example, when heroes come together, do they start fighting each other? In The Secret Wars, this was a weak excuse that led them to disagree. I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like a Punisher, but why Feeling and Iron Man cannot keep their morals with each other, it's funny, then Torch joins. It’s just another of the later Comic Trends that the characters fight each other for a few seconds, because “everyone” wants to see it. Give them the best reason to fight, and maybe it can be done, but “Hey, what are you doing here” and “You don't tell me what to do” are the reasons for LAME. Another poorly written scene is The Wedding, where Harry Osborne exposes himself to spoil Peter's wedding. This whole scenario was terrible. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, what the other critic calls “violence against minors,” that is, without any blows at all. In The Secret Wars, the Lizard carefully avoided the attack of Thing. But Thing punches bad guys all over the block in comics. He should just go back to lifting heavy things and conquering the bad guy, grabbing him in cartoons. Of course, these cartoons were made not for us adults, but for children under 12 years old. That's why they can't have fists, because mom and dad don't believe in this type of violence. But you can blow things up, these cartoons will include this. In childhood, before political correctness came into fashion, I saw cartoons beat each other. What's wrong with the punch in the chops? Is there really less violence in the world today, because these cunning and cunning new caricatures have suffered a blow? I find this the most offensive of all when I see new things. They wrote a “punch” because we can all hurt ourselves. <br /> <br /> Kids, enjoy these cartoons as you like, I have seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
