Well, I have already watched this film twice, I have carefully researched it on the net, I asked several people about his opinions. I even went so far as to read the original book by Sheridan Lafan Classic Carmilla, on which the film should be based. I feel that the best way to review this film is to describe a game that can be played while watching. Since the plot of the film seems to make no sense, here’s the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Siberia with her father, Mr. de La Fontaine. They continue their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day they receive a letter from a “general”, a man who has made his life mission avenge the death of his daughter. He claims that there are supernatural powers at work, and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman causes the La Fontateny to look after their daughter Carmilla for several months. Soon, Laura begins to marvel at strange dreams and begins to suffer from a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what should she do with the state of Laura and the general? <br /> <br /> I invented this game and would like to play as many people as possible and tell me what their results are. I even have a memorable name, and I will have a jingle too, but that doesn't bother me. It is called "this film has no meaning." <br /> <br /> All you have to do is try to come up with a full story while watching a movie that explains what is happening. I mean the full answer to all questions, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> He will have to answer questions such as ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk during the day? shine? <br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is the girl named Bob? and why is she shooting herself? <br /> <br /> * When a film is a dream and when is a reality? <br /> <br /> * Why does killing a zombie seem to be a recognized part of life that doesn’t make anyone beat you with the century? <br /> <br /> * Why does Travis Fontaine noticing and knocking down a zombie, not slowing down while driving, and yet, when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage from behind her car, accept the excuse that she is also a zombie? <br /> <br /> * And why then does he allow the girl, whom he later openly reveals, that he knows that this is the main vampire, to ride with him in his car? ? <br /> <br /> * And then let her go alone with her daughter to a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What the hell is the asylum scene? <br /> <br /> * What the hell is green? <br /> <br /> * Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why are vampires never fighting? Zombie? <br /> <br /> * What is the significance of the necklace? What is it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how did Jenna find out about it? <br /> <br /> In fact, damn it, it’s just as fun to try to think up as many questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my own storyline, and I must admit that this is not entirely true, but it is a pretty good effort. <br /> <br /> In conclusion <br /> <br /> “Vampires against zombies” have no moment when in fact vampires are fighting with zombies. It seems that everyone in the film knows exactly what is happening, and yet they are very reluctant to tell the audience about it. And for some reason it is based on the classic horror story of the 19th century. How? What for? What the hell is going on?
