“A young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf, based on the family legend of an ancestor who is blamed and killed for allegedly being alone. Because of her past treatment of men, she travels around the countryside, seducing and killing the men she meets. ” Having fallen in love with a kind man, her life begins to change for the better when she is raped, and her lover is killed by a gang of bandits. Injured by these recent events, the woman returns to her cruel ways and searches for the path “Revenge of the Thugs,” according to the annotations on the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Reno Di Silvestro's La lupa mannara begins with a full head-on, writhing, moaning dance of slender blonde Annick Borel, who (like Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera lights up between your legs. The revealing "memory" shows that her hairy ancestor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature. Miss Borel, unfortunately, not a werewolf; she's just very strong crazy. <br /> <br /> In the film “Werewolf Woman” (in English) it would be better if Borel’s character really was a werewolf woman; with its sexual victimization is a big feature. But as for the 1970s, it is difficult to cope with this. Cheerful Borel is either naked or sexually dressed throughout the film, in which there is quite a lot of gratuitous blood. Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (as Helena) and the awkward Howard Ross (as Luke) are good support players.
