Big hair, big tits, bad music and a giant pin ........ These words best describe this horrible movie. I love raw horror movies, and I have seen hundreds ... but this must be one of the worst things ever done. The paper is thin and funny, the acting is an abomination, the script is completely ridiculous (the best is the end of the fight with the policeman and how he found out who the killer is, it is so damn terribly written), clothes are nauseous and funny in equal proportions, hair is big, tits bounce, men wear those cropped t-shirts that brag about their belly (it's sick that men really wore them !!), and music is just synthesized trash again ... almost every scene is crappy music, tits and paramedics who clean bodies. .. and the gym at e have not yet closed for bereavement !! All these jokes aside are a really bad movie, whose only beauty is to look back at the disaster that was in the 80s and laugh at how bad everything was then.
