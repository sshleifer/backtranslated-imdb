This movie is just awful. So bad that I can spend nothing but a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crime were reproduced correctly. A lot of slaughter. Strange cuts and edits. There is no continuity to the plot. The acting is absolutely the most amateur one I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This bomb from the film, obviously, was created in order to earn some money without taking into account the accuracy of its content. Camera work is not always focused and always shaky. It looks like it was videotaped. <br /> <br /> Actually, now that they have Dennis Reider with life in prison, I would like them to go to jail and the guys who made this terrible movie <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't even think about watching it. I would give him a negative star if I could.
