I gave this film an increased rating of 2 stars, since I personally appear on the 42nd and 43rd minutes of the film ... the scene on the side of the road in Russia. In this scene, the film director offered me an immortal phrase - “50 dollars. You drink and speak, ”but I felt that my Polish colleague could speak with a more convincing Russian accent than I did, so I refused to accept this by speaking on. I was a little stunned, as it was my first experience in the film ... and who knows ... these lines could end with lines like "I will return" and "Totally honest, dear, I do not know" Damn. "If I would say that one line, then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminum as “Heavy 1” instead of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> In time, I feel lucky that my name is not related with this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I spent the whole day on the set, at the Hot Point of Barrie Island in South Wales, no one could tell me what we were a real storyline. All the mourners and the cloakroom attendant agreed that there were a lot of curses and exposures ... everything could be worse if I were naked in this most horrible movie ... <br /> no less ..... On the positive side .... I chatted with Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, because Notting Hill had not yet come out, and I had no idea that he may be Welshman. He made various inappropriate comments about what a terrible hole Barry Island has become since I was in childhood in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen appeared that I realized that I was in high-quality production ........
