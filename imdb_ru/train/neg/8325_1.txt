I just watched this movie last night and, being a man with very low expectations, I was still disappointed. The most blatant mistake in this filth of the film is that the main point of the plot (the guy waking up during the operation) has nothing to do with the result. It would end up equally regardless. So what was the point of this? Who knows. In addition, this surgeon had 4 lawsuits against him, and he did not think that people would ask questions if a patient died on his desk? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely mediocre, and Christiansen is almost as bad. It was all just ridiculous from start to finish. Iâ€™m pretty sure that if you felt someone cut through your chest with a scalpel, it would hurt you more than that.
