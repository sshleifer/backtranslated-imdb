Firstly, this film reminded me of old films that I had to watch in religion classes at school. This is NOT a good thing. In fact, this is just a preaching and pretentious piece of dirt, as in the terrible TV series "Left behind". I do not take offense at religious films ... but I take offense when these religious films turn out to be extremely terrible. I just wanted to say something good about a Christian film, but it doesn't look like it will happen anytime soon. I bet that if you gave biblical scholars a decent budget, they would still be unable to come up with anything good. Just avoid it. In addition, the fact that the American Family Association (mostly Reverend Wildmon’s footmen) talks about this film on their website is another reason why I hate it. In fact, after I looked at it, I went home and looked at my copy of David Cronenberg's “Crash” with NC-17 rating. Forgive me father, for I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
