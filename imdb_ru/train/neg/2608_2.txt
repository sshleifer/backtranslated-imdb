My 10-year-old daughter, Alexander, writes: <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that it was very boring, and I thought that it was just a repetition of material from the 101 Dalmatians. I could not wait for the end of the film. The best part was loans in the beginning - they were nice and well made. The rest of the movie is not worth watching. Thank.
