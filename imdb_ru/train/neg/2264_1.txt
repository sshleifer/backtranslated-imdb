In the preface to this review, I have to say that I seemed to be a bit curious about this film. However, I probably would not have seen this if I did not have a little twisted arm. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film shows how depraved a person can be. In my opinion, the worst thing about this Springer phenomenon is not that people from the Jerry Springer Show behave like they (which in themselves are highly reproaching), but that many people are so curious and excited. watch them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose that includes me ... to some extent this is true). If we do not celebrate this kind of behavior (as some might say), then at least we can subtly distort our mind and / or reduce sensitivity to this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soapbox (sort of), Here's skinny: the film has an R rating, and although it can only deserve this (I looked at some scenes, so I'm not quite sure), I feel that NC -17 (tip of the hat to another reviewer) may be a little more suitable for a huge sexual content (a cynic could comment that the film was just one great excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very bizarre, tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and frustrated stereotypical blacks that will appear on various Springer shows. In the end, the film leaves the person with some determination and rhetoric of Springer that we need to see the real world (obviously, as can be seen from his show). I agree with him in this - it is important to know what the world really is so that we can achieve positive changes. Having said that, let me tell you - a rather bad worldview in the newspapers or the news to see it, but let's not lay out good money to support the sensational and, perhaps, formal title that Springer seeks to give us.
