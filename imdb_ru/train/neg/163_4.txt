The early part of the film was quite enjoyable, but by the end it became commonplace. Although Turturro is an actor who I generally like, his Luzhin often resembled a bad impression of Rain Man, and the image of a genius as a semi-autistic man irritated. In general, it seems that this film is trying diligently and ultimately looks pompous, despite the mostly good performances.
