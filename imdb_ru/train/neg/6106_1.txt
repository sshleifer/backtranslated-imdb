It was just awful, the plot was just fine, but the rest was bad. I mean, come on, puppet, and then they even tried to make the movie digital, and it made it even worse! Usually I would like a low-budget film, but it was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set on which it appeared. I have about ten low-budget films with about 6-8 movies, and I must say that this is the worst movie of all. In addition, the wording is turned off, and they use fake plastic machetes that don't even look like real ones, they can use one that looked even a bit like real ones, so save your time and money and not watch a horrible movie.
