When I noticed that Hamish Macbeth was broadcast in the United States, I was delighted. Then I was lucky to watch the damned thing. I adore the books of M. C. Beaton about the wonderful Scottish constable. The characters in the book are interesting and very well written. The forces responsible for this mix have obviously never read any of Beatonâ€™s books. Only the name Hamish Macbeth has anything to do with the series. Apart from the lack of familiar characters, I find the whole show offensively loud. It seems that the actors feel that they have to shout their lines and shout at each other. If you love the charming Hamish Macbeth MK Beaton, do not waste your time with this garbage.
