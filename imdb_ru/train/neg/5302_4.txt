Dewaana as the film goes through the usual clich√©s. A man and a woman fall in love and get married, allegedly a husband is killed by a family friend who wants their marital happiness to marry again, and surprise husband No. 1 suddenly appears. The film resembles Chandni Yasha Chopra and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good results. Amrish Puri, like a villain, passes through the movement and is nothing more than an ordinary Bollywood villain. The music of Nadim Shravan is great, all the songs were great. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is a regular movie that runs through the movement.
