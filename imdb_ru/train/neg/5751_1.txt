The film was supposed to be shot in one day, there are scenes where you can see the reflections of the camera and its red pointer, even the green light of the landscape, which is mixed with the actors !!! The plot and lines are really awful even without the slightest Inspiration (at least, like a movie about the thriller genre). Everything connected with the Po in the film has a shallow and childlike approach. The film is full of roles and does not care. If you want to watch a funny bi-movie for a relaxing evening with friends, then go for it, you will like it (like me), but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
