Tobe Hooper is perhaps the biggest coincidence that the horror genre can offer. Like any horror fan, I liked a Texas chainsaw, but I think that in order to put your name in the title of a movie, you should have at least a few hits. I can’t remember any other film made by Hooper (by itself, not counting Poltergeist) that really influenced the horror genre or the world of cinema. And this film, “Nightly Horrors,” only confirms my point of view. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit for at least good work with the terrible material that was given to him. He did what he could. As for the movie itself? Pure friend. Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been written in ours, and really just awful landscapes, music and cinematography. Nothing in this film is exchangeable. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1 out of 10. I’m sorry for Hooper, his career seems to have ended before it really began. I hope that he will be able to play at least one more good click, and in this way he will be able to give his cult status some justice. <br /> <br />
