Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of Beverly Hills characters 90210 were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, then this is your movie. This is the midnight express for the MTV crowd. That would be good, but the story was poorly executed. Invented plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved problems abound. This small film did not deserve the right to be as mysterious as it ended up. A potential spoiler and an incredibly ridiculous storyline is a passing tension filled with the moment when a hotel employee discovers that girls have no room there and are going to drive them out. (This moment is inappropriately played out with the same seriousness and seriousness as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint). Later the same employee of the hotel was somehow found - and Bangkok is a big city, note that I was there - and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free May Tais gives 40 years in prison. C'mon. Rent another day in paradise.
