The authors and producers of this little journey have plunged a new depth of depravity. The writer's bloc sat down so badly, OR the ideas were so exhausted that they had to turn on the disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the backseat of a van and then quickly throws excrement into the car behind you at least add up what this film is worth). We have already addressed one of the other women, we urinated because of one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would be enough ... we got a message! It really takes toilet humor to a new level! If the script and acting would be better, I would easily have forgotten that I was watching a movie shot entirely on a low-budget video. It was a rather original plot line, with a clever (single) direction in which we could only ever take a point of view from inside the van; thus making it feel much more real. We have never seen inside other places, such as a shop or a field where several women disappeared, and this could add much-needed tension. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible. Lines like: “I don’t feel too good ... I want to go home” after a psychopath chased one of the girls; was raped with a screwdriver and the shot seems a bit unhappy. <br /> <br /> The action was devilish (except maniac). Did all the 5 main actresses in this acting class attend a home study course during a long post strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with the subtitles turned on. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have coped with this task easily. It seems that the only direction he was supposed to give was: “Screaming girls”. <br /> <br /> As for the scream ...... If you watch this, please be sure to prepare paracetamol at the ready!
