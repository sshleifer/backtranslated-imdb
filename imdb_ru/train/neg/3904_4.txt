I admit, Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the only greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the top of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a palimpsest at best. <br /> <br /> A comparison with the version of Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable - this version is much more true to the witty spirit of the book and much more enjoyable to view. <br /> <br /> There are some good elements here - Kate Burkinsale (who used to play Flora Poste at Cold Comfort Farm, is clearly smarter than Emma's spiritual twin) is the beautiful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes respectively decorative Frank Churchill. The production is beautiful, but the interiors are too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are some serious problems. Firstly, Mark Strong - firstly, he is not suitable for Mr. Knightley. Perhaps this is because he plays the role of a strict Victorian priest. This is very upset. <br /> <br /> The second problem is the problem of length. Simply put, the film is too short - to get the right feeling, it must be twice as long. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, there is the quality of adaptation. Austin - the dream of the adapter - the whole dialogue is already there. It just needs to be cut and arranged properly. Andrew Davis seems to think otherwise. Firstly, it's a rather dark movie, and the last thing Emma should have is dark. More importantly, Davis considered it appropriate to rewrite the final as a kind of bucolic feast. What is the planet or the background work of Thomas Hardy? It is completely beyond the style and spirit of the novel. And I think it is very presumptuous to try to improve — perfection. <br /> <br /> See a version of Paltrow or Kate at Cold Comfort Farm.
