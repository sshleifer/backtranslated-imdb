In this regard, one of the worst FILMS ever made. The plot goes as follows. Wade through the jungle for 10 minutes or so. Let Bo somewhere and undress. Sneak through the jungle some more. Give Bo another reason to undress. Return to the jungle. Oh, look! Tarzan looks at the guy! Striptease, Bo - striptease. Kill the safari people. The guy looking Tarzan has a fight scene. Saves Bo. Bo strips. Run credits. Run credits, run.
