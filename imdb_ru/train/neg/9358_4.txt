Since the beginning of the film there is already a discrepancy. Since this film unfolds on the border of Normandy and the Middle East, and is also an international film, it can be expected that it will show the correct accents. This is not done, as most of the actors sound American. In addition, I believe that, at best, to rehearse an acting game, from the very beginning it is a little difficult to understand the plot line. Who is who? The rest of the film is very accurate in costumes and scenery. If you want to watch a movie, to feel how it was in the past (albeit without accents), then this movie is worth renting. If you are looking for an epic film like the Kingdom of Heaven, then look elsewhere.
