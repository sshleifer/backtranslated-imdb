Some movies are so bad that they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about as true as Pinocchioâ€™s chances of becoming a real boy. The game was terrible, the direction was bad, and he traveled too fast. As if the director just wanted to get it over with, get it over with and go home. <br /> <br /> Melissa Joan Hart never seemed to me a talented actress, but every film she made was quite a low budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she lets her characters down by shooting too much, talking too fast, as if the acceleration of her words makes her more dramatic. She really brings out the feeling that there is a team in front of her, and she talks to the camera when she needs to attract the viewer with her character. This pretty much fails the entire movie, and any leg on which he could stand is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Probably the only good thing in the film is when they beat her at the end. But even this was not enough to subdue my hatred for such a bad film. <br /> <br /> See if your taste in the film is cleaner than a piece of dry toast.
