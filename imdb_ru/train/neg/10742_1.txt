I tried to sit through this bomb not long ago. What a disaster. Acting was cruel. There were some absolutely pitiful action scenes that didn’t work like a lead balloon. This was mainly due to the fact that the reaction of the actors simply does not sound believable. presumably modern reworking of Hitchcock’s original “Lifeboat”. I think Hiccock will be spinning in his grave at the very thought of it. From what I was able to survive, there is nothing convincing in this movie. It boasts several semi-famous names, but they don’t put effort into their characters. but honestly, no one is to blame, in fact. I mean, I'm sure the script exploded in the first blast, lol. It is possible that this thing will improve as you move forward. But for me, I don't want to spend at least three days to figure it out. Therefore, if you do not have at least a three-day weekend on the horizon, avoid this stinky / 1/10
