Few films have left me with such a feeling of anxiety, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in the theater (how it ended, I can only be surprised), I was subjected to 90 million hated, derivative garbage, the main impression is a bit like this other sick movie “Do not answer the call” - but worse. The nastiness of all this, rape and all that, is shown without any distance (as opposed to such powerful things as “The Last House on the Left”) and complete contempt for (ideal?) The victims and all involved, leaving the viewer as a sadistic voyeur. In the end I wanted to take a shower. No credits to the director
