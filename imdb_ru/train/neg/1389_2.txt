I was very disappointed in this movie. Slightly bordered on stupidity: souls that can influence reality the same way they do? A mission, apparently critical for Soul Hunters, assigned to one of their youngest members? And the whole story of the “golobrotela” and the lawsuit against the station was so terrible that one day I blurted out the TV: “Why do you spend my time on it?” <br /> <br /> Thematically, “The River of Souls” is not went deeper into the question of the soul more deeply than the original episode "Soul Hunter". We see that Soul Hunters may be wrong, but we still do not feel their culture. (Are there any female soul hunters?) <br /> <br /> The game was fine, considering the material with which they had to work, and the special effects — especially the planetary landscapes in the first act — were very impressive. But overall, I would say, skip this one.
