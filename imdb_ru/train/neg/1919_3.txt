I read the book a couple of times, and this film should not be exactly as it should be. I could let this slide, this is a movie. However, I have serious problems with setting up a movie. No one seemed to mention that this film and the book on which it is based is based on real events that took place in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city on which this film should be based. First, the “small” city, referred to as the situation, is the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50,000 people. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Secondly, the scenery for the film is wrong. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. Which is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but I got angry when I saw that my hometown was being treated so badly. It was a real event. Large parts of the city were destroyed. The book is about cycling from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I think you could, if you don’t mind, drive 15 miles each way.
