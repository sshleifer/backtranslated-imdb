Outrageous dirty karate / horror thriller with a lot of graphically bloody violence and unwarranted nudity, as well as a completely ridiculous and strange "conspiracy." This is low-grade and low-quality entertainment that only viewers with a particularly strange taste like, but this is kind of fun, and I have to admit that in fact I was not bored while watching it .... (1/2)
