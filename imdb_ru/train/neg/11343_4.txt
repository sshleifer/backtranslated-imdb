1st viewed 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Deer-Jim Kammerud and Brian Smith): “An unforgettable and exciting continuation of the proposed continuation of the original classic animation“ 101 Dalmatians ”. Yes, the film continues where it ended in the first, but the problem is that it plays the same way as the original. One of the remarkable moments in the original was the pace of the story, which is not in it. The animation is also not very impressive for Disney, and all we get is the same characters repeating the same story over and over again. When Disney is going to stop bothering us with sequels, reprints, and so on. D. And so on. And so on. Maybe when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have released.
