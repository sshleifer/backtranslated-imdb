This film was more effective in convincing me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one. And I'm Jewish. <br /> <br /> Anyone in school journalism? Read the editorial? Freshman annual rhetoric? These alarm claims, presented in an acceptable manner, can be convincing. But, without offering confirmation of possible opposite arguments, nor viable (or any) solutions, few sources and each of them of dubious origin, makes the argument a useless trick. <br /> <br /> And thanks for that - I wouldn’t want anyone to leave the theater, BELIEVE any of these racist claps. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me — and hopefully a warning tale for you — actually read the movie before watching it. ,
