“Scary Movie 2” is definitely the worst of the 4 films, because the plot is not so much, a bad game, rather tedious, and some really wacky jokes. But. And this is big, but there is one good actor, one good recurring joke and a good start. A good actor, Tim Tim Curry, the only good recurring joke is a creepy, weird butler with a disgusting hand who always plays kring, but laughs with dignity. And a good start is deception of parody. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film “The Terrible Film 2” is the main characters of the original, and many new characters along the way are invited to stay overnight in the eerie light of the old mansion, but will they survive the night? This film is not very good, but if you are bored, you can watch it!
