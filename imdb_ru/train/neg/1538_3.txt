What a pity that a truly competent director, such as Andr√© de Thoth, who specialized in slippery, changing alliances, at first did not master this concept. He could help unlock the real potential, especially with the interesting character of William Bishop. As the cinema is worth, it is largely a mess (as reviewer Chippe claims). The main problems with the direction, cheap budget and a bad scenario. Strength lies in the excellent cast and interesting overall concept - the characters are pulled in different directions by the conflicting forces. It took a person with sufficient vision to put together the positive elements, reworking the script into some coherent whole, rather than the sprawling, clumsy mess that it is (try to figure out the motivation and interaction, if you can). In addition, a larger budget could coincide with a contrasting location and studio shots, and pull locations from the too obvious outskirts of Los Angeles. The real shame is to waste an excellent lineup - Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth were scored), Deaner, Reeves, and also James Millikan and William Bishop shortly before their untimely death. Few films illustrate the importance of authorship with a vision greater than this unassuming western man, who in the right hands could be much bigger.
