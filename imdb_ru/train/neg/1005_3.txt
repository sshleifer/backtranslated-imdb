When you go to the open-air cinema under a Greek summer night, you usually donâ€™t care what this movie is! Edison started very well, with a lot of effort from actors who want to be singers, and again from the magnificent Morgan Freeman, but ... (The film is usually a good start to get the audience ready, a little boring. However, that fills the middle of the film is more about the characters, not about the actions, is ready, and the third part is something really good so you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite policemen (packed with weapons that can tear down ) shoot the guy behind the car, don't hit him even once, pok and he kills everyone (except 3), and then the guy takes out a flamethrower (to kill the other 3), you realize that the Greek summer sky filled with stars is too good to be distracted by such a movie!
