At first glance, “Show me the money” should have, at the very least, finished the full season. You have always had the fascinating William Shatner, surrounded by a dozen beautiful long-legged bakers, who are collectively called "Million Dollar Dancers." You had knowledgeable participants, who had interesting stories that they could tell about their life, and who probably knew a lot of trivia in pop culture. And you had a lot of money! So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was a failure. A good game show needs at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting stimulation and the ability of the viewer to play at home. The very best, the most persistent have all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM did not have them. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game were among the most difficult in the history of prime time games. Let me try to explain how the game works, as briefly as possible. <br /> <br /> The participant began with a single word or a short phrase, followed by the letters of choice A, B, C (thin cap for the network?). Each letter was associated with a separate question, starting with the word or phrase. After the participant chose one of the letters, he could either answer this question, or skip and choose the second letter. If they passed, they had the opportunity to review the next question, and they had the same option. However, if they answered the second question, they had to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After they answered, and before they found out if their answer was correct, they had to choose one of 13 dancers. on stage, each with a different amount of money in a scroll on its side. They indicated the amount in dollars (from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the participant answered correctly or not ... this amount will be added or deducted from their bank. <br /> <br /> Still so far with me? In addition, there was one dancer who held something known as the "Killer Card". If you chose a dancer with a killer card and understood the question correctly, you were safe and the game continued. However, if you made a mistake, you had the last question to answer. If you incorrectly answered the last question, you are out of the game. If you understood everything correctly, the game continued. <br /> <br /> There was no quitting and not leaving with the money earned until you either answer six questions correctly, or answer six questions incorrectly, or until you hit a hole that you couldn’t earn enough money , to come back. Got it? Good! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, in my opinion, was the complete absence of tension due to the design of the game. A participant could pass on questions that he knew, which they did not know, and answer many questions that he knew, making the pressure even less. Then they could still find a small dollar amount, even after they deliberately missed the question, which meant that there was still no “drama”. And the fact that they could answer five questions incorrectly and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. And the arrangement of questions was deadly slow: often the questions were so obvious that it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there were some doubts about some of the most common answers. <br /> <br /> The pace of the absence of any real tension at any time during the show and these very complex rules did not allow this program to work, despite Shatner’s Tertshorian talents.
