This is a vivid example of a low-budget approach to victory over what would be a good storyline. Let's return Samaira Armstrong (after seeing her work in OK, I know that she can do better), and then find the best scenario and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad, and mostly badly generated by the computer, it almost lost me the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And the transformation of Samaire Armstrong (warning!) Into a werewolf was done by reducing it first to a bad GCIF figure, before it even began to change (people of Final Fantasy, as well as Pixar made them ridiculous, consider the figure nude Barbie Doll). <br /> <br /> The story was interesting, although the idea of ​​the werewolf pedigree is not new. Because it also entered into a balance between evil, (possibly) not such evil, and the possible end of the human race if two lines mate. The subplot "books about the origins of the werewolf", which for some time affected some other characters with similar spells, was effective, but could be more extended to explain what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Give the best scenario and direction and I will come back again.
