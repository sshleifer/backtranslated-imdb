This movie is fun. The problem is that this is not a comedy. One classic scene involves Kurt Thomas, who accidentally stumbled upon a crowbar horse in the center of the village square (which he uses to beat the bad guys). The other is a trip to the Village of the Mad. It is a pity that this film was not made by farce, or perhaps it got the best marks.
