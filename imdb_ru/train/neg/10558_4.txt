I don't know why this has fans, and I don't know why I even gave him the bill that I have. This is ridiculous. There are many cases in which you have to stop disbelief, let the picture collapse and catch up with her somewhere before she goes berserk, and some poor cop must eventually explain what we saw. But it does little and has too long sequences, where nothing happens and has nothing to do with anything, while we have to listen to the most repetitive soundtrack, even by Italian standards. Not giallo, itâ€™s a complete mix of horror ideas, featuring Klaus Kinsky in one of his most glaring actions. I believe that he appeared, did the whole day and left, leaving Mr. D'Amato so that others could fill it. Eve, of course, is good, but no, that is not enough, and in the end we saw too many of her appearances everywhere, even after we had completely lost interest in this thoughtless and pretentious chatter. Maybe I was just not in the mood!
