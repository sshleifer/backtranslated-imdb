There are two points that I need to clarify at the very beginning. First of all, we all know that this year's Oscar was REALLY all this year. It was the Academy's way of showing people that they were not racists, and never had been. They wanted to clear all preconceived ideas about themselves. Secondly, it is pointless to comment on the show, because in fact, what's the difference? But this is interesting to write. This is the year when I am fed up with Oscar! I will never watch the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe won the Gladaitor, when their real winner was Ralph Fiennes in Sunshine. If you have not seen this movie, watch it and you will agree. "Eyes Wide Shut", when released, did not receive nominations. As for this year, bad choice was everywhere! Baz Luhrmann does not receive the nomination "Best Director"! You are joking!! "A Beautiful Mind" on "Best Makeup" ???? "Training Day" nominated ?? The film was terrible, and it seemed that Washington had not even turned into a representation, all that he had proved - he knows how to use four-letter words! That's what he got the reward for! Take your tongue and bet, he almost played himself! I liked Gosford Park, really, but why 7 nominations? And how could they not give it to Altman! I mean, come on, if there is just giving people a reward to clear up any bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years, not Oscar! There were many, many things that worried me about this year's Oscar, but I will live with it until I have to watch another show again! The culmination of the (and ONLY) show was when Woody Allen first appeared at the awards ceremony. This will be one of the greatest moments in the history of the show.
