Shadrach was not my favorite type of film. I found this overly sentimental, and the action was below normal. Harvey Keitel and Andy MacDowell were good, but some other actors were far from believable. I also did not believe that Paul’s parents would leave and leave him with the Dabni family, especially if there is a housewife living at home. Their social classes were too far from each other to be considered plausible. It seemed Dabney’s lifestyle was too exaggerated. At the beginning of the film there was a scene in which Andy McDowell got out of the car after having sex with someone. Who was that? Her son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the scene even included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the film and was never actually mentioned again. It seemed unfounded and did not fit into the story at all. There were too many discrepancies in the film for me. The story with Shadrah was good, but I was not sure that Dabni would be as kind and generous as they were portrayed.
