My brother is an avid DVD collector. He looked at the cover (two models on the toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I didn’t sleep with him to watch a film that turned out to be perhaps the most pliable (I use this term freely), which I felt obligatory for myself. I did not dare to look into my brother's eyes, quite sure that he must have cursed the check in a clenched fist. The biggest name in the entire film is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in one scene that the “director” decided to show every double (about four in total) during the entire film. In fact, the whole movie follows this example to a large extent. The fact that the DVD contained the deleted frames was a shock. (However, I went to bed without looking at it). Not surprisingly, after about a week I discovered this disc without a casing behind the TV.
