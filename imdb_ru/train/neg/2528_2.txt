The Van is a good movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van to seduce them. The only thing that this film does not fail to do is accurately depict fan-fed in the USA in the late 70s. Looks like it was completely made by amateurs. It's rubbish, but I liked it! I must admit that I am a fan of 70s rubbish! Hope this reaches the bottom of the IMDB 100! <br /> <br /> 2
