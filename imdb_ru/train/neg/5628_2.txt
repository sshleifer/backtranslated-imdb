I am not inclined to creativity. I am a scientific woman, and I felt that this film was perhaps one of those artsy feature films with a limited budget. I watched some of this with my fiancé and my future stepdaughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fiance and his daughter voted for this, and we moved to the 13th anniversary of Ocean, but that’s another story. In order not to hold back, I woke up the next morning and gave the film another shot. I started watching this movie again seriously. I just don't get it, I thought I would. I thought that the funniest part was the washing off of the ashes and the urn, which found a place by the fireplace, which is used as a vase for what seems like dead flowers. Interesting, and yet there were dead things inside. It was a strange and strange film. Maybe this is what they were after, but I will not be deceived a second time!
