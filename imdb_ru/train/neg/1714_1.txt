Once again, the classic of the film was meaninglessly redone with predictable catastrophic results. The name is false, like everything about this movie. The period is not convincingly presented, and the leads seem to be too young and too stupid to be even criminals. The film by Arthur Penn had a style, humor, point of view and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist, it would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version deviated from the facts, introduced the glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative for 1967, and it contained some outstanding features that allowed you to take care. This 1992 remake seems to be cut off from the original film, and not from the truth, as we know, and the actors in this version are obscene, unattractive, and no less interesting. By all means skip this and hope that the 2010 version will be better. Could it be worse?
