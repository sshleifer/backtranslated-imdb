A rather poor Firestarter clone that looks more like a bad television movie than a bad movie. How disappointing that this came from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Government contractors are conducting a human hydrogen bomb experiment. A boy who was born to a couple as a result of an experiment constantly reeling to 100 degrees, and when he becomes an adult, people in his life begin to spontaneously ignite. He is trying to figure out why. <br /> <br /> People who are completely engulfed in fire are great, but when they get to the point that they are doing well, in a different sense, they are clearly turning into dummies. When streams of fire shoot from the hands of the characters, it looks stupid, and does not disturb as it should. Also funny is the fire, which, obviously, passes through the telephone lines and is erupted by huge jets from the receiver's earpiece. How exactly should this happen? <br /> <br /> Something else that seemed silly to me in the film is when a character has visions of his late parents. Later we see exactly the same footage from these visions in home movies.
