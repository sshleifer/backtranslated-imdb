The storyline "No one sleeps" is a good idea, and the subject is of little interest. But while watching this film, we said out loud: “It’s hard for these filmmakers to find good places, good lighting, good makeup and hair style ... why is the sound so bad?” Throughout the movie, the sound was echoed, distorted, and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is a good role in this film, and I think Jim Talman is a really good actor. This story with some of the same actors would be worth making as a big budget movie. <br /> <br /> I just can’t repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more good sound, Sound is the same part of the film as the image, and you should do it right. Could earn 6.
