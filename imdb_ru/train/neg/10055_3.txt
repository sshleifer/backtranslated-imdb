I grew up on the theatrical version of “Superman II” (“S2T”), and in my childhood I loved it more than Part I, because not only did it contain more Superman and three villains like Superman, but everything started with a bang? ? The best transformations of Clark Kent to Superman and scenes of salvation. Children no longer had to look forward to the appearance of Superman on the screen, as in the first part. Now, as an adult, I can see how the mighty fell from S2T (see My Review). I always heard about the back. The story of how they prematurely and unreasonably fired the director of the original Richard Donner from the second part. (It must have been a rarity at the time to make two separate films at the same time, now it's common: Back to the Future and Matrix 2 and 3, for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing Richard Donner Cat (or S2RD ") I still can not fully recommend it. Passed, there was a great scene of change for Superman, all the salvation of Paris, as was the remarkable result of the first part of the opening of S2T. In fact, they almost all wrote the words:" Earlier on Superman? ? ”In C2RD. The special effects were not good either in Part I or in S2T, but in S2RD they were just ridiculous. for example, Lois falls out of the Daily Planet window, I admit that some of the new scenes worked and some that they shot were a welcome departure, for example, any scene in the “bridal suite.” In general, if you grew up on S2T , like me, and loved him as a child? not carping like me, as an adult, you should definitely see S2RD, as it is almost a new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: the strange amnesic kiss from S2T disappeared, replaced by the exact same ending as “I”. This is not only lazy, unoriginal compromising evidence, but it does not make sense why Clark returns to this diner if these events never happened. And will he continue to “return time” for each confrontation?
