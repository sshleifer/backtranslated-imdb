Who could sympathize with these two nasty main characters? What should have been a light, frothy comedy about neighborhood children who can't quit their children's game of gambling, even when they age well in adultery, is more like an exercise in cruelty and irritable self-indulgence. As children, the couple is unbearably premature; as adults they are unbearably immature. This is a bad combination.
