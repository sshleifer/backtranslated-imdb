Although 2 years have passed, I still remember the total waste that makes up the whole plot of the film. Unfortunately, I ran into this movie after my friends chose it when they were watching new releases on Blockbuster. We decided to choose a film because it was the only film that we all had not seen, and it sounded like it could be enjoyable. Although quite a lot of time has passed since I watched the movie, I still remember the lack of a plot (seriously, there is no real plot) and a complete waste of time spent watching the film. If you're in the video store, and this movie catches your eye, go ahead and find the best movie. If you end up watching this movie, I understand your pain :)
