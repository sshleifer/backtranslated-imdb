This movie is terrible. You do not need to read this review further. If you plan to watch it, suffice it to say - do not (if you do not learn how not to make a good film). <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible ... a serious amateur hour. Throughout the film, I thought it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that he really is! New minimum even for him !! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who claim to be original or good may have never seen a decent movie before. Even standard Hollywood action movies are a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it !!! Instead, go for a run - at least you donâ€™t want to kill yourself.
