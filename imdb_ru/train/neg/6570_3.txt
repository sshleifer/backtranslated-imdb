I never found Charlie Chase very funny, although his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find VERY funny. (Charlie Chase also reminds me of the monstrous Hyun Brun from the page of the Sunday Post comics in Scotland.) In Chase's best films, I tend to admire his professionalism, not laugh at him. I pay tribute to Chase for the fact that his best films, such as Mighty as Elk and His Wooden Wedding, inspired a fandom that betrayed him immensely ... but I’m sure that even the most stubborn fan of Chase would agree that very early and very rude "Married to the Order" is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase - impatient, awkward, lifeless, naf - young Swain, hoping to look after the beautiful Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best role in this film in the role of his reckless father, who despises Chase as a "mollikodla." Leo White, who did more visible work as a foil for Chaplin in Essan, is at hand here as a rival. <br /> <br /> There are some activities related to Ingersoll watches. I was intrigued that the brand name was mentioned in the headlines of the dialogs: is this an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main disadvantage of “Married to the Order” is Tibi's rosemary game in the role of Rose: it is conceived as an actor’s game, but you are flat-breasted and hawk-faced - not physically suitable . Theby (the wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but never had a plausible intrigue. The film historian William C. Everson treated her very scornfully in one of his film books. <br /> <br /> I will rate “Married by Order” only 3 out of 10, and I will be charitable ... because I continue to suspect that Charlie Chase has something that everyone else gets, but I keep bored.
