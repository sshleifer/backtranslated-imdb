Johnny and Jeremy are kinda vampires. No canines, of course. They are dark, bitter creatures who have nothing to do except to spread their own suffering. With their spells (namely, a sharp tongue and a thick purse, respectively), they seduce desperate souls, which they torment and pursue. This is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> I cannot mix with black humor, partly because it prevents me from presenting viewers who are ailing for a sloppy, protagonist. However, I really liked the sound and melody of fast (and supposedly very witty) remarks. I was very impressed by the strong acting, especially by David Telis; only the character Jeremy seemed too two-dimensional. Photography and music, both dramatic and dark, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What really does not suit me in “naked” (and the main reason I never recommend it to anyone) is that he constantly presents misogyny as the surest way to express his anxiety. In other words, in a world that sucks bad, what difference does it make if someone hurts girls, right? To suggest (as some people do on this site) that Johnny is not such an unkind person, because he is not so rude with girls as Jeremy, it seems to me completely absurd. They are both terrible, nasty people. And they are especially interested in hurting women every time they get a chance. It can be argued that Johnny ultimately gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly fell back and bit him in the ass. But nevertheless, his and Jeremy’s sadistic behavior is to some extent considered ridiculous. And I could be wrong, but I guess most people who absolutely love this film also find this aspect of the film darkly comical.
