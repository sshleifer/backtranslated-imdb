I can not say that this is the worst film of all time, but only because there are still films that I have not seen yet! It must be the most pretentious attempt to make a film of all time! The director suffers from the same problems that he has with "There will be blood" (although in this film he was not so bad. In general, the film seems that you are looking at a guy trying to impress beyond his abilities). It’s as if he sits in the chair of his little director and thinks: “How will a great director cope with this scene?” He simply doesn’t have it in himself. I don't know if this movie could have been saved by a great director. Of course, some pieces of greatness that could be polished, but nothing was ripe. The scene where all the characters sing is the worst moment in cinema history. One by one, as we see, the characters sing, and I squirmed in my place. I continued to say: “PLEASE PLEASE just don’t make the guy on the verge of death sing too!”
