It can be a cute movie for kids. My grandson watched him once. he watched him a second time, and I watched something with him. <br /> <br /> When a little bear gets lost on an ice burg and he finds himself in the water, he tries to get to a piece of ice. it says, "Come back, you silly ass." <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t want my 3-year-old grandson to watch movies with these words. <br /> <br /> So he was appreciated. for kids. Must be child friendly. This is what I expected. I would like to expect that there are no words of curse in him. Words do not even fit the film in most places, as it seems, added later. And the film stretches in many parts.
