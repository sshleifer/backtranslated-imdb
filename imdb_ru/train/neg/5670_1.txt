The only reason why the Tapes of Norlis deserve ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. In addition, to see Angie Baby in the play in front of the "Police Woman", there is nothing more to see. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> *** LITTLE SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is called to write a book about the supernatural. Once he mysteriously disappears, calling his publisher and suggesting that he stumbled upon something that put him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this pathetic pilot was written, obviously, was supposed to be a series of memories through “Norliss tapes” - a set of audio cassettes that the writer recorded when investigating cases of the supernatural. <br /> <br /> In the experimental episode, a rich sculptor dies - but not before buying an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist, who assures him that a trinket will give him immortality after death. Soon we discover that the ring itself does not give immortality. Instead, he only reanimates the sculptor’s body, allowing him to escape from his crypt so that he can run around the city, draining pretty girls with all their blood. <br /> <br /> Blue-eyed, yellow-eyed and growling AHEAD. Since the last time you watched the Scooby Doo cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) on a dark night. She escapes and, through a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get his help in solving the mystery of the supernatural return of her late husband to her estate. <br /> <br /> So this guy is a vampire? Not. There are no vampires in this story, even though you may have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. How? I do not know. We see only his attack, not the collection. What for? Perform the second part of your application for immortality. It turns out that a reanimated sculptor will be allowed to live forever only if he builds a life-sized statue of a demon named Sargot from a mixture of clay and human blood. When it is finished, Sargot plans to populate the statue, using it as a gate to our world. <br /> <br /> FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br /> “The Tapes of Norlis” were not selected as a series for a very weighty reason ... it was rubbish. As you can see from my resume, this story is an insignificant, ill-considered mess. Game and dialogue offer no better. This is not even a contender for the prize "So bad, it's good." Sometimes bad is just bad. <br /> <br /> After many years, when I heard the underground rumble of the great virtues of Norliss Tapes, I was very excited when I saw him on the Fox Movie Channel on 15.10.03. I wish I didn’t tune in to autumn. <br /> <br /> I saw this moan for the first time two days ago, and I can only assume that any applause you have heard from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who watch the show based on vague memories and nostalgia on youth. Or maybe they are just loyal fans of Dan Curtis. In any case, they offered you the misleading reviews of the "Tape of Norlis". <br /> <br /> Poly Orchid - October 17, 2003
