Seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the most fun way to see how Cruella De Ville gets punished for torturing animals just for the sake of their skin. The whole movie was quite funny and, in my opinion, better than animated. But in reality there was no need for a second one. First of all, if Krul returns, do not treat her and do not make her mad again. Just make her break away from prison, and this is rap. I thought it was not very funny. It is assumed that only one original puppy will return. I expected it to be Lucky, since he was the most attractive, and besides, Roger and Anitaâ€™s return too. Nevertheless, they decided to carry out a complete processing and add in fact not a hundred, not even a hundred and two, but only three puppies and a parrot, who considers himself a dog (smart). The role of Gerard Depardieu was meaningless. In the end, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating, and too exaggerated to be true. It is baked inside a giant cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, an attempt to imitate the same effect from the first. It just did not work. It was too much, and not too funny. I really regretted Cruelle.
