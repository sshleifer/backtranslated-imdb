I never understood the popularity of Saban's Power Rangers show, which was just a second-rate Americanized version of the ultra-popular Japanese super-sentai show of the past three decades! What was cool in the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, characteristics, special effects, etc. D. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children will say that the Rangers are the best, but they will be wrong. /> <br /> Iâ€™m sure that if they spoke Japanese, they would know how much better the Super Sentai is compared to the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers are absolutely terrible, try Super Sentai! In search of a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension!
