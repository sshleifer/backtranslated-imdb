I don’t know why I’m commenting on this stupid reality show that I’ve seen several episodes (live cable marathon, when they broadcast 5 episodes in a row or something like that, although I didn’t see it all as three episodes) because I was nine months pregnant and I was going to give birth on any given day. Maybe I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for Britney, really. For all her money and fame, she seems to have very little sense of dignity. Or she is selfish to the extreme. She married the dismissive Federline (well, anyone could be wrong), and before that she "starred" in this terrible show about his daily life he, where she shoves the video camera wherever she wants, no matter on whose head she is or in her soul when there is Federline. She talks about her sex life, leaving nothing for your imagination, I do not care about my part, but I can't help but wonder what she feels about this now that she has divorced. And yes, for her sake, I am embarrassed. But I should not be. She seems to be living a rather empty, shallow life, though. I do not want to share lives with her, even if I could. Road-kill TV if you want.
