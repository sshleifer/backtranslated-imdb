Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a little animated series with a lot of funny (but rehashed and exaggerated) Bush jokes. Apparently, I should lower my expectations even more. <br /> <br /> The letter was absolutely pitiful. In addition to the joke "Cheney-chicken food" and some funny little bumps, it was really boring and not funny. <br /> <br /> The animation was as sophisticated as the Flash project of a thirteen-year-old child. It is shameful that they used the Macromedia product for this, because it is capable of much more. <br /> <br /> I don’t really like Bush, and I like Bush’s joke as much as the next guy, but it was just a half-hour strike on the president with a few painful moments that were not funny. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did much more with "This is my Bush." <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, skip Lil 'Bush and buy a copy of the short-lived comedy “This is my Bush.” You will thank me.
