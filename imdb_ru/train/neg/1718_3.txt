I read several books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales reflect real photos taken by the gang. The death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche are especially well done. This actress looks exactly like the photos taken on the day Blanche mourns her dying husband. Nevertheless, this film is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes are satisfied to the end, even after being shot dead in their holes (in Bonnie’s life, she suffered a lot in a car accident a year before their famous ambush and didn’t look so cheerful when she died). The script is tedious and the game is bad, especially the leads. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. They may not be a "true story", but this is a great movie.
