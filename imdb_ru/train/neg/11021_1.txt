Hallam Foe tells us a story about a boy who lost his mother and later experiences some kind of complex edepus. <br /> <br /> This is something like 95 minutes, but after ten it will be better. It is about an hour in the middle when he climbs roofs and habits in a church tower such as Quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic). <br /> <br /> There is a strange love story in this story that has nothing to do with anything. She looks like his mother, so what? We know that he misses his mother, that's what the first ten minutes were about. They should have just put a beginning and an end together, and that would have been OK short film. Now this is a portrait of a character who does not change. He is the guy with whom that happens. The only active choice he has throughout the middle of the film is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> A whole thing happens here with Eedep, which should make us analyze his character. He draws a face, puts on women's clothes and wears a dead badger on his head. Badger! You must see the end! He returns to his house with a badger on his head (and is being shot like a sticky horror film) to kill his father’s new wife (with whom he had sex in the beginning). And for some reason they thought it would not be entertaining enough, so they put some indie punk music in the background. I have to admit that I am allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on the nose. It feels like this director / guy Mackenzie / anyone is trying to show us that he also studied psychology at school. You're so clever! Thank you for bringing back all these forgotten theories back to our memories! You really dug! What a Wallraff! Well, now I understand that this film is based on some random book, but in any case ... <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it’s boring. A lot of talking heads. Plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene, you know, it's cold and warm, and so on. Why? Maybe Hallam Foe is both a feature film and a test film for color blind people. Or maybe they just thought that the drama would not be enough to tell us that he feels lonely, so they turned blue to really understand it. <br /> <br /> I won’t even comment on the cliche Indie-like-like-like-cute drawings that they made in the presentation. And all the "cute" sex things go on. This whole movie is an independent cliché. But I recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Although it is really annoying to be a student of a film and see how such crap passes through a car.
