I will talk about the plot of Alice, having outlived the previous edition of the Nightmare series, will find that the death dreams of Freddy Krueger begin again. This time, the mocking killer pierces the sleeping mind of Alice’s unborn baby. His intention is to be “born again” in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddie is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her own son? This film started very well, as we see that Alice dreams of becoming Amanda Kruger, who was stuck in a room and raped for 100 manic paintings, then she was urgently sent to the hospital, but then she was no longer a pregnant woman, but Amanda, who was again Freddie gave birth <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people who returned from the 4th film, and then received several new Friends "shortly before Freddie started killing again, I really liked the first dead, everything okay, "not as good as other deaths and and dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddie himself in this film did not seem at all scary, the nightmare was just boring, in fact, it was not at all scary or creepy. <br /> <br /> Shooting a movie was a good idea for the fifth movie in the series, but overall, I think this movie was really boring. (Still not the worst film in the series, Freddie the Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
