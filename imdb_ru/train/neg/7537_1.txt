And I thought that Beach was bad, with the difference that in this film there is one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Don't blame him for the horrible script, if anyone can figure out what the hell he was in this movie, pat yourself on the back. This is a cross between the Village and a more hoarse scenario. It all starts with what catches your eye, and then, when it goes further into the plot, it just does not make sense, and do not start me with the ending !!!! What was it? The only thing that makes this film existing is that Nicholas Cage has his usual humor and his ability to be funny in the most strange situations. If you go to a blockbuster, and this is the only film you can watch, save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn on something, and someone will ask you why, just say the dumbest thing that comes to your mind and there you go!
