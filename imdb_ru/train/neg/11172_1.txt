Undeservedly popular in 2002, the film “I Love the 80s” is a meaningless, idiotic, offensive and disgusting pop cultural disorder in the show, which was the first in a series of terrible television programs, which eventually marked the end of The only real music-oriented channel remained on television! I used to practically live on VH1 until spring or winter, I forgot which one now, in 2002, when trash like this began to appear absolutely for no reason. Out of pure morbid curiosity (I think this is what you would call it), I decided that I would go and see it, at least on the first night when it appeared, although the advertisement looked like complete nonsense. At least I can honestly say that I was not a little disappointed with this, because my expectations were obviously below the bottom level of the foundation from the very beginning. The focus of this show, which I discovered during the first 5 minutes, was less for each year of the 1980s, and also for what was and was not culturally significant or popular (which I expected to see), but instead an improvised platform for a whole range of really awful nameless comedians to show what they most likely consider to be comedic abilities * rolls their eyes * ... more like their absence if you ask me! Now it's pretty easy to understand why no one ever heard of these idiots before they appeared on this show, because they all are so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called “humor” that I swear I felt my guts are messing with all the rancid one-line players who they filmed one by one! Overall, I have no problem saying that “I love the 80s” was / is the garbage of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore.
