I love the often-published series "Masters of Horror." Horror fans live in constant lack of food. Similar projects (and the similar “Greenlight project” that gave us the Holiday, whether we like it or not) are a breeding ground for wonderful thought bubbles in the heads of filmmakers with horror, seeking to develop and bring maturation to food for us who like to have dinner horrified. <br /> <br /> It started with the idea of ​​a truly-kool-idea and ran ... straight to the edge "where am I going with this? !!!". <br /> <br /> I don’t know how to spoil the spoiled one, but "SPOILER FORWARD" Suddenly ... no, this light used to drift through the night sky ... we are long-haired aliens (eh?) ) men, brains, and ... yes, I understand, but ... well ... the worst curse of the narrative is a promising and promising creation without a reward. <br /> Hint to storytellers ... your build should have a return exceeding the build. And not vice versa. A story in mathematics 101. <br /> <br /> End spoilers - Big oops!
