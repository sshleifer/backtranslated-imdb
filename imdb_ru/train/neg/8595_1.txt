Lucy Alexis Liu and Killian Murphy are great actors who can certainly cope with any acting challenge they face. Unfortunately, “Watching detectives” (2007) offers only one actor and audience: do not fall asleep during the time of an incredibly boring, very predictable and unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> “Watching detective stories” (2007) tries very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely ill-directed, awkwardly on the verge of complete ridicule. <br /> <br /> After the third of the film, they still do not hint at what may attract even the most interested audience, such as the director’s friends and relatives, not to mention what is happening. <br /> <br /> I’m pretty sure that everyone who liked it faked it or imitated it, like Neil’s ex girlfriend when he showed her an old black and white film about which she didn’t care. “Watching the Detectives (2007)” is far from category B, is it somewhere between Q & R, like-Questions? and repeat the questions! The director knows what he is doing! Well, if his goal was to tire the viewer to death, he did a very good job! <br /> <br /> “Watching detective stories (2007)” was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Killian Murphy PLEASE PLEASE do not allow this to be a waste of your time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
