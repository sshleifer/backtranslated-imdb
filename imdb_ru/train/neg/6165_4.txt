Allen leaves for his dacha (somewhere where he hates driving in real life) and spends his weekend with his friends - these are the usual successful white belly classes of the middle class, which appear in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I Usually in Woody Allen's comedies you can find something funny, but here he really looks completely awkward. It seems that even one-liners have left it. In fact, this is not a plot (pieces of Shakespeare's cod pieces), but Allen seems to use this location to create a semi-mystic air that makes this thing even more insane and semi-dry. <br /> <br /> It simply does not work at any level and is just a giant bore. The best thing about this movie (except for the final credits) is that the bad reviews seem to make him wake up and realize that simply creating a slapdash script and adding your comrades to it does not make it fun.
