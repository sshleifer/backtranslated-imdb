If this is someone's "favorite" movie, they need serious help. This shit is nothing funny or clever. I have not seen the original film, which is a remake (some film of the 1950s), but it just has to be better than this new bastard. <br /> <br /> Major was kicked out of the army for having a fringed element, and ends with the education of children at the ROTC school. Unfortunately, the major is Daman Wayans ... so that the children will have a world of annoying serene stupidity. Can Vayan bring these losers into shape? Can they make him become a little more human? Cinema bombs, like most films of Wayans, with a few brilliant moments. William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time, too little. This charming old man (best known to me as the actor of "Tales from the Crypt", best known to you as Uncle Louis from "Christmas Holidays") shines every time he is on the screen, which is not so much. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also looks like a biker that fits him perfectly. I would not mind a little more Bam Bam, but I think he played the role of "biker" as much as possible for a war movie. <br /> <br /> And there is an attractive teacher who has someone fall in love with Major Payne, although he doesn’t handle children, has no social skills, and it’s just impossible to turn into someone you would like to spend time with. . She must be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure what it is (although this may seem “stupid”, because it is clearly seen from the film that she leaves the house quite often). <br /> <br /> Uayans had one bright moment: a dance sequence in which he performs a series of moves (including a very cute “robot”) and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. This scene was enjoyable, but hardly compensated for something else that made this cynologist spit it out. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to watch a film about a loser who helps unlucky children to become heroes, rent or buy “Ernest Goes to Camp”. At least he's a cute loser, and really funny. Perhaps if Major Payne had fought a badger, I would have felt better, but he did not. Forget Payne, forget Waynes ... you can do it a lot better.
