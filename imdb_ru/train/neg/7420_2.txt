a novel without feelings, a drama of problems without meaning (or a drama) .... It is assumed that this film will be all that and fails on every account, as if he is not trying. Or as if the director / editor / screenwriter team is not really trying. Actors are able to - they need better support. <br /> <br /> One element that does not fail is the assessment of George Delarue. Beautiful and touching. What a pity that is attached to this film. In a good movie, the words, movements, and music of the actors synchronize and enhance the effect. This editor is covered with music without dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly touching in this regard: insulting the talents of leading actors. <br /> <br /> Another element works in the film: photographing from the spot. One moment is noteworthy at Grand Central Station. I guessed in advance what was going to happen; but the way it was filmed in this setting was breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this forum have noted that the assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists by the United States did occur during these years of McCarthyâ€™s fear. At that moment, when the film seems to be starting to seriously look at American society, it switches to an ordinary romance; before any human feelings can affect us, he goes into the (predictable) thriller output. <br /> <br /> Just as the film insults the talents of the actors, it insults the problems that it pretends (and fails) to accept. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
