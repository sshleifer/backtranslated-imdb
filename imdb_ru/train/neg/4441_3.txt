“The Triumph of Love” is proof that not every Comedie Frances writer who uses dressing up in disguised courtship, like Shakespeare, deserves attention. <br /> <br /> Or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, a playwright inspired by Commedia Dell Arte, about whom Brittanyk says: "His nuanced sensations and clever puns became known as marinades." <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino is entertained by three mixed novels, her role in the pants did not even reach Cherubino in “The Wedding of Figaro”. <br /> <br /> Heavy editing is annoying and seems to indicate that every long speech required a lot of duplicates. <br /> <br /> The best was Fiona Shaw in the role of a deceived maiden, as well as costumes. <br /> <br /> The glimpses of the audience that we see, and the closing curtain to wink that this is all fiction, does not really help. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 05.29.2002)
