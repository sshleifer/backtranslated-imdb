A sort of family parody mixing "Officer and Gentleman", "Broken Heart Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and, no doubt, other films that I can't remember right now) into a rather boring movie with some bright spots. Gags are always where you expect them, and the lines of Damon Wayans are, well, predictable. As I said, unfortunately, this film never surprises you ...
