This movie was terrible. Well, my favorite movie is “Wicker Man” (1973), so I was always a little biased. <br /> <br /> The plot wanders, discarding enough of the key elements of the original, which makes the term “remake” very doubtful. (He is not a virgin, but he is allergic to bees. WOW!) So much of everything happens that it does not make sense and is inexplicable, that, I'm afraid, Mr. Labut does not shoot a horror film. (Like the two people we clearly saw were blown up in the car at the start, alive and well at the end of the movie?) Cage looks exhausted and confused everywhere, and his character tends to shout "Rowan!?" At the slightest noise. The “nods” on the original are annoying because they seem to be more sticky, rather than intellectual tributes. For example, some incidents reflect the original (the girl falls from the buffet, pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage searches for the island), and several lines of dialogue are taken directly from the original Anthony Schaffers script and included. <br /> <br /> I’m sure that others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this one, I really can’t write more about this movie. He lacks any substance. Throw it in a landfill, along with all the rest of the remakes, which spoiled the good titles of the films on which they were "based" (in this case, very poorly).
