This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. I was expecting an unexpected movie, but at least with a few cool car scenes / races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is so limited in budget that it accelerates them to create the impression that the cars are “driving fast”. In one scene, the Mercedes SLR accelerates from 200 to 0 in 4 seconds, simply spinning around. This is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a real movie about cars, watch the TV series "Fast and Furious." They may be a little silly, but 100 times better than this movie. Better yet, just watch Mischief 3000, the best car movie I've ever made.
