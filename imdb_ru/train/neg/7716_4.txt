I had the luxury of seeing this film only once, when I was quite young, so most of the film is blurred in trying to remember it. However, I can say that it was not as funny as there should have been a film called “Killer Tomatoes”, and the most memorable things from this film are the song and the scene with an elderly couple telling about poor Timmy. In addition, the film is actually just scenes of small tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around, and people acting frightened and replaying, as people should do in a movie of this type. However, just having a very stupid premise and a memorable song theme is not a very good comedy. This film is supposed to be a “B” film, which should not be taken seriously, but you still have to make funny jokes and not try to extend the slightly fun premise into a full-fledged film. Perhaps a short stance would be good, as the trailer with the elderly couple mentioned above, and the man who was desperately trying to shoot a large tomato, was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a fake trailer, but no, they really made a full-fledged film, and quite a weak one.
