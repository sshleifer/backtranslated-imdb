This is, without a doubt, the most offensive "throwing chicks" that I have seen in recent years, if not ever. The letter and characteristics are so permeated with stereotypes that the film borders on a parody. Before leaving the theater in an hour and five minutes to this catastrophe, we were touched on the following topics: the birth of a child solves all your problems, the “types of performers” are pitiful troubles, and musicians cannot be good mothers if they dream of more habitual way of life. What a waste of talented actors and great scenery and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Tony Collett that if she did not live a more ordinary life, she would eventually shudder - “alone!” I felt nauseous. I can't believe this movie hit the cinema. This kind of tariffs can be expected from those "female" cable channels, which I always miss when I watch channels. I am a woman and I am over 35 years old, so I have to be part of the target audience of this film, but the boy, “Evening”, misses his goal.
