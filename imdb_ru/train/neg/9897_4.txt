I found this good film to pass your time, but not by chance of any historical value. The image of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> Distortion of the facts ... funny! She gave birth, feeding her people!?!? Oh, please ... For this reason, the pregnant Egyptian queen (especially this one) would not walk from one room to another! They tried to make her holy for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify her killing their own sister ... is beyond description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based on anything but her feelings and morals. She did everything only for two reasons: strength and self-preservation! She was born in a family where she had to fight for survival, which she did very well. All that stood in her way was either killed (her brothers and sister), or seduced (Caesar and Marc Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was too strong to kill, and too ... gay to seduce. So he was her end ...
