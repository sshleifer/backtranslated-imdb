Country singer nicknamed “Big T” - seriously, that's exactly what they call her - runs the risk of his budding musical career and his life, having fallen into the company of a mean drunkard (Bussey) who wants to become her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father is also an alcoholic, and he has a strong temper. You can imagine where this would lead. At the same time, there is a lot of music, as Parton, with her flowing vocal talents, begins to sing song by song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Stay away from this mess and check it out at NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.
