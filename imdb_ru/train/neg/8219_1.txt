I am one of those people who always go to the horror section when I choose a film, so I chose five through my eyes, I was disgusted with this film and I thought that there was no storyline and no sense that you could enjoy it, it made my skin crawling from the thought that people like to watch movies that just encourage violence, damn it, it was low-budget and very rubbish! I think I could have done better myself. I think it was the worst movie I’ve ever seen in my life and you don’t have to worry to watch it, the actors were rubbish, the camera was terrible, the image was bad and the sound wasn’t from scratch, I I think it was a little bit like a cheap baler pull, which is a project, and it did not work at all, it was dirty.
