Another rape of the story <br /> <br /> This film is a disaster; he simply uses historical history and creates a sweet love story with a bad game and low budget. <br /> <br /> The film should be 1/3 of the time, they just took the time to make a mini-series. <br /> <br /> Scenes of battles are so stupid and illogical, soldiers are beating fools, costumes are catastrophes. The Romans were good at fighting in open territories, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans, when they tried to fight in the forest, in this film the Romans decided to fight away from the city, I mean, to become real. <Br /> <br /> And by the way, Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, which means a person with fair skin.
