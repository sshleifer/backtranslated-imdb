When I heard the plot for this film, I just had to see it, I mean whole cities destroyed by killer tomatoes! Unfortunately, the name is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Under the direction of Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn, who never takes off his scuba diving clothing, and Lieutenant Finletter, who is never in a picture without losing a parachute) “ Attack of the killer tomatoes "- a parody of the B-Movies, in particular the Japanese horror of the 1950s. The film begins with the fact that women are washing dishes in her kitchen before a standard-sized tomato is found before we are in the middle of a crime scene, as the tomato allegedly killed this lady, and let me tell you that he doesn’t get any more sense as the movie progresses! To be fair, there are a couple of funny moments, for example, every time a Japanese scientist Dr. Nokitof says his voice is dubbed with an American accent, or when disguise expert Sam Smith soaks tomatoes: “Hey, can anyone pass on ketchup?” Similarly, this film was probably much funnier in 1978, and in general its idea was bad. Unfortunately, for the scam movies "Attack of the Murderers", such as the TV series "Airplane" and "Naked Weapon", this comedy has since become much better. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible; There is no continuity in editing, and it seems really slow and lacks energy. In order for the parody film to work, it is necessary that a lot of things happen right away, one gag after the shot. Singing in a movie seems pointless, and advertising a furniture store that flashes on the screen is pretty darn bizarre, even for this movie. Ultimately, however, you can understand why this film is iconic; I do not see that many people were indifferent to this. Unfortunately, it would be terrible, as I would have summed up.
