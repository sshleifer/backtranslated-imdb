My friend and I shot this movie because it sounded very good. But we were wrong. First of all, the acting game ... wow ... the acting game was the worst, the effect was really bad, it was like a movie that a college student made. The plot was pretty good, but it was done. Most spoiled movies actors. The main guy was the worst actor in the whole story ... Sorry, I even call him an actor ... The only good thing about this film was that it was so bad that it was funny ... so if you want laugh to see it ... but other than that ... stay away from it. I usually love movies on list B and things like that, but this one ... I don't know how they missed it, to even put it on video ... it's the worst thing I've seen ... and I've seen some bad ones.
