It was almost incomprehensible to me that this film would go bankrupt, but I was really disappointed. Having been a cinema lover in Beijing for many years, I discovered that this DVD was heavily sold, and decided that it should be removed. The first few titles, iconic for Beijing fans, have an interconnection between man and animal, but here we hear not the diegetic surrounding noise of children playing in the schoolyard during the installation of the bomb. Fantastic suspense. Then, when the criminals, Caan and Duval, go on their next mission, Duval drops a bomb on Cann, who had an STD last night that was only detected through surveillance through her wallet, while Cann was close to her. The laughter that followed is fantastic, and he is clearly paid tribute to Brian Depalmy’s “Dressed to Kill” movie at the expense of Angle Dickenson’s short expenditure. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits the film collapses. Even “Bring Me a Head,” the chapter “Alfredo Garcia” has a great production value, a bold appeal for everyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekingpa credits as additional lecture material, but as soon as they run out, turn off The Killer Elite.
