Have you ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, it wasn’t even where to start. <br /> <br /> How to start? Incredibly tedious scenes with our heroine sitting around the house without any feeling of threat or even premonition created even during what seems to be constant thunderstorms (which are strangely never heard in a large double glazed house)? A house that appears to be just a few miles from the city, but a few hours away (?) Or a third girl who doesn’t pursue a goal, except to provide an amazingly quick kill when the boring becomes unbearable? Or even a start, which involves a series of 20+ murders throughout the region, although it is obvious that the killer never moves far away from home? Or a fancy ritual of salt and pepper, which pretty much sums up most films lacking direction. <br /> <br /> Add a lead actress who cannot play, but at least is ready to do something completely inappropriate. Nude scenes in the shower, and this video is really nasty, but not in the way you hope. <br /> <br /> Given the fact that he was simply banned in the UK in the 80s (mainly because of the final surprising murder), there is nothing but curiosity in it - and one classic “stupid” murder (not worry - it was wired at least ten minutes ago). <br /> <br /> After a walk through the forest, our victim comes to a rather steep uphill slope, which they are clearly fighting. Halfway there, they see a figure at the top, dressed in black and waving a large scythe. What are they doing? Slip and run, like we all do? No, of course not — they fight at the top and stand comfortably in front of the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> This is really just a movie, as they say ..
