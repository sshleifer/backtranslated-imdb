Not enough words to me. This film was extremely difficult to watch, and, looking back, I would really like me not to do that. Although I tried to sit through, I must admit that I could not last more than an hour, so my opinion may be unfair. However, this film will require the most impressive last third in the history of filmmaking in order to give it a review that is not something terrible. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch any part of this movie,
