If there ever was a film that would deserve a big fat zero rating, then this is a bunch of crap. I love movies about zombies, and even bad movies usually benefit them, but not this evil deed. I actually started to get angry when I watched this film, because it is so insultingly poor that I cannot believe that the people responsible for it actually believe that this is acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, but the plot is shot with scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not react, do not act and do not look like people. The entire film was also shot in two rooms, sparsely decorated, to vaguely resemble the places in which they should be. It’s all about one senseless mess, it’s not going anywhere, and when the zombies finally appear, they look like trash and do little. <br /> <br /> I could have made the film better than this, so could you and so could someone who has never seen the movie before. This is a pathetic and, without a doubt, the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the worst movie of all time. You will notice, by the way, that only positive reviews give it a 10/10 and encourage you to buy a DVD. I can’t imagine someone neutrally thinking that this is a good film, it’s awful. <br /> <br /> 0/10, and this is generous.
