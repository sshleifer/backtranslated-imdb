I had high hopes for this film (in translation the name “How we get rid of others”). In the end, the concept is great: the near future, in which the ruling elite accepted the consequences of constant verbal and legislative prosecution of the right-wing government of the so-called freeloaders and the left wing as a whole, and decided to just kill everyone who cannot prove that they are contributing to the establishment (The establishment is called the “common good”, but in fact it implies the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Very cool idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only this film gives you a chance. Satire is released only in several scenes and absurd performances, but this satire is not sustained; it is not acute and not witty. And for the alleged comedy in the film almost no funny scenes. I believe that comedy lies in the absurdity of situations, but situations are largely uncomfortable and overly serious, and do not cause laughter or thought. <br /> <br /> The script is replete with serious location errors. The action should have focused on the political aspects and on how to do wrong, but instead a lot of time is spent on the young woman who wrote the new laws for fun and tries to save everyone. By organizing resistance that sends people to Africa. None of this is relevant! Such a film should not qualify for seriousness! This is a satire! Political statement. But it doesn't even begin to actually solve the problem that it should be about. Maybe he was afraid to go too far? How cowardly. This is not art. This is not even a real satire. <br /> <br /> Soren Pilmark, very serious and currently one of Denmark’s most senior actors, was very good. He largely carried in himself the small entertaining meaning that the film All Others had: nothing special (well, except perhaps with the exception of Lena Poulsen, who really convincingly spoke). <br /> <br /> In fact, the problem with most Danish films is that the language never sounds natural. Neither the wording nor the delivery. Why is it so hard to make it sound right? Why should it be so nonsense and artificial? I hope that when people watch these films in fifty years, they don’t think that this is exactly what people said in Danish society. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
