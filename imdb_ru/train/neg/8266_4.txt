What the hell is with this movie? Couldn't they find a better script? In general, a “good” movie, but ... it was done more than once ... Until the end, I thought that everything was in order, but ... going back to the last part ... * barf * TAK trite ... waited the appearance of the fairy god ... but wow, this did not happen ... that's good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but to see such a film in a new form with another child who would like him / her to be older / older; it is so simple. <br /> <br /> Just watch until it appears on TV. Don't get me wrong, but that's not all
