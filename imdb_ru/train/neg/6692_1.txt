During a sleepless night, I switched channels and found this confusing movie. What were they thinking about? <br /> <br /> If this is life after “Remote Control” for Kari (Wührer) Salina, it’s not surprising that she’s not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take this role? This is a pity! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But this is probably the best part. This nerdy college kid brings this vamp-ish girl home ... this scene right from the comics - or cheap porn movies. She calls the mother of anal restraint and kisses the father, "Oh, I did not expect the language!" Gorgeous features! <br /> <br /> After that I had to see how it ended .. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, this bitch from hell has a damn past, so the SWAT team is up the stairs. And yes ... they surround her! And YES YES! The kid knocks her brains !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHAHA! <br /> <br /> This is a TV that is a must see. <br /> <br />
