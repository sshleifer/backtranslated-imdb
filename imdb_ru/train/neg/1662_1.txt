This is without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen. It makes your TV mill film look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on the book of the one and only Britney Spears and her mother, this is rubbish without anything but a sensible speech by Virginia Madsen (I hope you paid well) to save him. The story of the village neck with the red neck, which wins a scholarship at a prestigious music school, is small, but this means of pedaling Miss Spears hurts music to the consumer and generally agrees that a low brow should be suitable. There is nothing good with all the bits as predictable as the night the next day. Never again
