I saw it at the premiere in Melbourne. <br /> <br /> This is small, two-dimensional, does not affect, and it is hard to believe, considering the subject, is boring. The actors are tolerable, but they didnâ€™t have anything to work on, given the very wacky and unimpressive script. For those who may have been worried that Ned Kelly will be overly intellectualized, you can calm down by the fact that this storytelling is completely without any literary depth, fully narrated on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it does not work like a popcorn movie. His pace is too unstable, and his skill is too weak to satisfy even at the level of a worldly actor. <br /> <br /> I very much doubt that Gregor Jordan could sit down and say to himself: "This is the best. I could do away with the material." <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a charming figure, and equally - the national response to it. Perhaps the popular genius, perhaps the class warrior, perhaps the psychopath and, probably, all these things, he dominated the true Australian mythology for more than 120 years. br /> <br /> This is life.
