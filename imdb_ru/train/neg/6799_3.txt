don't expect much from this movie. In many respects, this film resembles a film in which Doris Day starred in 1956 under the name "Julie." In this film, Doris, who was a flight attendant, then a flight attendant, landed on an aircraft after her crazy husband, played by Louis Jordan, shot the captain. She did a much better job, more convincing than Kim Oja, who took control of the 747th and managed to land it without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft, I myself was a flight attendant. As I said, do not expect much from this film, it was done on a cheap budget. Manufacturers had to cheaply use the aircraft with the name of the airline. “Oceanic” is the name used by several films. The only inscription on this plane was the name of the company that made the plane.
