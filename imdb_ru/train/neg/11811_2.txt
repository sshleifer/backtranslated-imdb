You know when you're on the bus, and someone decides to tell you your life story, and you sit there with a pitiful smile on your face, when all you really want to do is slap and leave? Well, I had a similar feeling while watching this movie. Well, I really decided to go and see April, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste of making myself the only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last part of his memoirs, I wanted to give Moretti madre all the slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to utter a word. At Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so all you hear for an hour and a half is a shrill whimper about what his policies are, or what strange part of popular culture tickles his imagination. At the moment. He also finds time to make films that he doesnâ€™t like, which I thought was meant for losers like me. Of course, being in a position like you, you think that he will try to conclude that the movie is a bit more reasonable than this. Making the right film, perhaps with some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps one that is not completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he began to examine his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not an obsessed filmmaker with a strange tendency toward tasteless music. Next time, when someone you don't know will try to tell you the story of your life, give him a slap in the face from me. Each strike will be a small victory in the fight against moretism.
