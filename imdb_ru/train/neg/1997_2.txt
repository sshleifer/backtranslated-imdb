This version is most likely available at your local dollar store DVD. The imprint is not very good, as is the sound, but if you have an extra $ 1.00 and about 90 minutes, you will get the value of your money (which doesnâ€™t say that much). Anna Neagle is extremely helpless as Nanette. Whatever her charms that day, they are not obvious in this film. This film features a large number of excellent actors (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material does not match their talent. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how such experienced performers make the most of the weak writing. The musical numbers (there are actually only two) are pretty awful. Obviously, the studio did not feel obliged to cash in on the rich musicality of the original "No, no, Nanette." In this DVD can be bought for 1 dollar. It's worth it just to say you saw it.
