For the first three seasons, Fairly Odd Parent was just as tasty as caramel, bright, sweet and addictive. Now it’s as tasty as Pepto Bismol. And, unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you need after watching more recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence that do not cause laughter. Cosmo, once one of the most charming characters of Nick, turned into an insulting unfunny cretin, about which the actor of the Family Guy would not even want to know. Timmy turned into a selfish arrogant jerk, from which Bart Simpson would happily knock snot out (and given Timmy's sluggishness, this would require a lot of beatings). And poor Wanda ... a real charmer, the victim of her husband and godson, now she is labeled a "grumble" for caring for the welfare of others. In addition, Cosmo’s stupidity hurts everyone else, but he is never punished for it, nor does he learn any lessons. Which largely sums up Butch Hartman’s attitude towards children: they are rough, vulgar and not too bright. Thank God, this evil toon was canceled along with his favorite Butch Hartman, Danny Phantom. At the very least, Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
