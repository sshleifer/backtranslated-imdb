- The Mexican priest becomes a fighter for the salvation of an orphanage or something like that - <br /> <br /> I went to see this film because it was not a fight from WWF, and so I thought that this could be funny. It was not painful to look. Awkward. Any opportunity for comedy is mercilessly missed. <br /> <br /> I confess that I still don’t like Jack Black. After that, I puzzled over one good role he played. The only thing I can think of where it was ok. was a necessary foil for John Cusack's character in High Fidelity. Jack Black is one of those terrible, ruthless loafers, such as the fat man in The Abbot and Costello or Jerry Lewis, who should be told that being idiotic imperative is not the same thing as being ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is not even a farce. It is just annoying. It's not even stupid, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I heard some good news about the Napoleonic Dynamite, but if this happens, I’m in no hurry to look for it on DVD.
