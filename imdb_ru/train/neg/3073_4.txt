On the back of the DVD box, Ellen Page is being filmed in this movie. She doesn't even appear until two-thirds of the film is over, and then in a minor role. I also do not consider this a supporting role, but rather “a little”. Also in the plot are many unexplained elements. Here are some examples: why does the main character reject his eldest son? Why does her youngest son get on the train? He says that this is for the "sucker" bet, which explains nothing. Obviously, the screenwriter does not know the definition of a sucker bet. This film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think you need to see it.
