I like to watch early color films - do you mean that the clothes of the 40s were not gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this film. Her "eccentric" clothes are actually quite attractive, and yes, she has an amazing figure in the hourglass. But I feel that she got too much of a head. Probably, she developed this characteristic in many representations, and no one told her: "If it makes you laugh, leave it." She's fooling around too much, fooling around when she has to be amazingly down to earth. The joke of Madame Arcati is that mediums were usually depicted as thin females in long draperies. Arcati behaves like a retired director (we really put our backs in her!). The contrast between her fresh, mundane manner and her foolish convictions is not really revealed. <br /> <br /> Just because all the actors are English (except Cummings), the Americans think that they need to use the words “Brit,” “hard,” “lip,” and “top.” Oh, let him rest! The three main characters constantly lose their composure and make risky remarks (did he make love to you? Yes, but very carefully - he was in cavalry!).
