This is the worst movie I've ever paid for, except for “They saved Hitler's brain,” the worst movie I've ever seen. When this film came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and therefore anticipated what I thought would be the funniest film that could be made because there were no restrictions with which improvised television shows should work. <br /> <br /> The screenwriters must have thought that we would add a little bit of rudeness, a few jokes with flatulence, a bit of cheap sex and hey, we have a risky side that shares a funny comedy. A parody of game shows is nothing more than a cheap unimaginable take-off to “Make a deal with stupid rudeness” A sit-com with a single girl and her boyfriend was just a bad high school humor. The stunner ad was a good fit for Seasame Street. The skete in the subway of Los Angeles was soft humor with tasteless blood. A French chef walking around a blind man who constantly pronounced “no difference” with a French accent was, well, you understood my point of view. <br /> <br /> The only fun parody is the Chevy Chase, which lasted a full minute. That means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes, I read the comments that the whole country was stoned in the 1970s, and you will like this movie if you are high. Well, most of the country was not stoned in the 70s. If inept writers were stoned, it means they were cures for sinus drowsiness. When I watched this film, there were 4 more people in the theater besides me. Of course, the rumors about how bad the film was have not reached.
