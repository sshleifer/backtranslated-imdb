I have never seen the original film in the series ... I just hope that it was a much better film than this one or the sequel made in the 1980s, as if this is not how these two terrible sequels were even justified. This film had a really good start when they advertised it for a show on one of those old independent stations that were a thing of the past. In any case, it looked like it was a very good, scary film. It was, however, a film that would make some Walt Disney films look dark. In fact, this film was just a beam of light, and there was almost no visible swampy stream. The only real observation is closer to the end, when you see its shape during a very heavy rain, except that there are practically no signs of a creature that really disappointed in childhood. The story basically lies in the fact that the old evil hunters have to kill everything they see, and chase a marshy creature from a stream, and the children are going to help him or just an occasional hairy guy in the forest who likes to haul random boats through the water. Not really worth watching, however, I would like to see the original if its creator would also make a bad marshy creature of the 80s, but he also shot a very good directorial film in the 70s "The city of a terrible sunset."
