I rented and watched this movie for the first time on a DVD without reading a single review about it. So after 15 minutes of watching, I noticed that something was wrong with this movie; it's horrible! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious! <br /> <br /> I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be funny ... (So stupid, it's funny ...? WRONG!) He should watch and learn from the best comedies of horrors, such as: "Night of Fear", "Lost Boys" and "Return of the Living Dead"! It's funny! <br /> <br /> “Fever” is the reason why I signed up for www.IMDb.com so that I can express my thoughts about dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> decided to watch the movie a second time> AAARGH! <and take notes for my partial “review” to show how stupid the film is. "Resident evil" (horror) or "Dude, where is my car?" (comedy) I can watch again and again and still enjoy! But this ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can a script and director be ??? This is bad. Here are the horrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the early scenes we see Henry, who does not understand how his dog lies on the ground, sticking his tongue out of his mouth, and his frozen look froze. is dead! <br /> <br /> The film does not explain anything about a long-haired blonde who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcie's question without an answer (“What happened to the forest?”) is “nothing.” The scenario makes this bearded guy warn them about forests only for “suspense.” <br /> <br /> Then the “smartest” of five people, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to kindle a forest fire. He meets infected Henry, who asks for help, and from this point on the film wants to break the record in using “F-words”. Bert begins to get worried because Henry looks terribly sick. Bert: "Don't make me shoot at you!" (He forgets to add: "... with my m gun explosive! ") <br /> <br /> Bert returns to the cabin, but how about this? He meets Marcie and Jeff, who had sex, but now suddenly decided to take a walk! Marcy wisely removes the unguarded fire, which Bert started earlier (A moment of clarity for change?) Bert doesn’t mention a word about Henry, because the fool thinks he killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, when Five Estupido are sitting around the fire, there is another eccentric your dog. (Maybe this is a warning about the forests? It is filled with cranks ... and their dogs!?). They allow him to sit with them only because he has a huge bag with cannabis. (Their brain is completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so stupid!) This is the last time we will see this forgotten character ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry appears in their cabin, (NOTE: he was lying a few yards from their hut all the time !!!) looked worse, almost like a zombie, all chewed up! He says he needs a doctor. But the young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets in their unlocked truck, which, of course, also has a key in the ignition. Henry seems almost smart enough to drive Hell away from there, but instead begins to vomit blood all over the dashboard, the seats and the windows. The Fantastic Five runs, armed with an explosive pistol, a knife, a baseball bat (and? Have you ever tried to play baseball in the middle of the forest?), Poker and (insecticide?) Spray - maybe ready to fight with a lonely, unarmed and terrible a sick person. (smart script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one shot from his BB pistol, which is possible only in the head of director Eli Roth. "What else should I do?" Bert screams in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to beat Henry with the bat and poker, but instead they miss and smash the windows of the truck. Henry comes up to the stupid girls who say: “He is coming to us!” (Thanks for the information, stupid women, I see it! But I don't think he wants to harm you!) Marcy squirts his eyes, forcing Henry to scream ! And our “hero” Paul touches Henry's hand with a burning log by the fire, which they recklessly left to burn while they were INSIDE the cabins! (Where did all this wisdom go? I think hemp began to bear fruit! :-) Henry turns into a Human torch and runs away screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day, Bert and Jeff are headed for the mechanic. And Marcy decides to “go to help” herself, in the forest, since Paul stays with Karen ... Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul, because Jeff and Bert were already “coming for help”! <br /> <br /> Now I am missing my comments on how we suddenly see Marcy in Canoe rowing along a huge meandering river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she is going? In any case, she goes to the bank of the river and finds a very large and seemingly abandoned cabin and, as in most horror films, goes into the cabin, saying: “Hello? Is anyone there? ”Bert suddenly jumps out from behind the furniture and scares her (and me first). And with him, and Jeff. How did they get here!? Did they swim the river ??? You see how brainless script!? <br /> <br /> MP Winston meets Paul in the cabin. For some reason, he does not notice the blood on their truck. This takes about 35 minutes to watch, and I decided not to torture myself anymore and took out the DVD. (Before I bring out my eyes! ... Now, this is ridiculous!) <br /> <br /> If you like this film, do yourself a favor and watch "Fear Night", "Lost Boys" or "Return the living dead. " Then you will see that they are more interesting than this ... thing. Even "Toxic Avenger part 2", which is also a lousy movie, is much funnier than "Cabin Fever".
