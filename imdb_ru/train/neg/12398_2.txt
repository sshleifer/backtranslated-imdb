Awful, approaching God-terrified. <br /> <br /> When a police maniac begins to kill, the reporter exclaims: “What happened here can be described ONLY as a black rainbow of death.” <br /> <br /> 1-- The rainbow is not black, and can never be. 2 - The rainbow is harmless and can never cause pain or death. 3 - A news reporter, one of his valuable to his agency, may find another way to describe the consequences of a murder. “Black Rainbow of Death” is not the only way to describe this situation. <br /> <br /> This is what you need.
