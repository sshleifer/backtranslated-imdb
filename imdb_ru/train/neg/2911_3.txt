This film is inflated, predictable, pretentious and full to the depths of the soul. The settings are true to the era, but they are shy in increasing with long exposure. Delaying artifacts stops action and closes almost as much as an empty dialog. Tom Hanks seems to be moaning just like Bruce Willis in Hart's war. Tom, you can't give depth to character by just making your face empty! The content did not guarantee the historic action of Paul Newman. This is dirt wrapped in an atomic bomb.
