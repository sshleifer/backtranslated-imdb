I just want to clarify one thing - I love Michael Vartan! But this film does let him down. His acting is still great, he is as charming as ever and looks great. But the film itself is rubbish! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry, I say this a little courageously ... you are constantly waiting for her to run away with her best friend, whose own storyline is a bit strange. My family and I (who sat and watched a movie with me) were also put on the soundtrack of the film; at times, the music simply did not fit into what was happening. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I found a very disappointing film. I could forgive a prostitute leading lady, I could forgive bizarre characters that were added to the mix, and I could forgive a bad selection of musical accompaniment, but whose choice was to cut out the entire middle part of the movie and skip right to the end ??? The final was obviously planned from the very beginning, but how it gets there remains unknown. If you're a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this movie: buy yourself a poster instead.
