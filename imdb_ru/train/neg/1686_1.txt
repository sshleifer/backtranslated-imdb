Imagine that by the date you are being asked what movie you wanted to see and you remember how you watched the rather intriguing trailer for "The Grudge". So, in good faith, you recommend watching this movie. After all, this is the Halloween season. And last weekend it was a box office, so it must be very good ... so you go. <br /> <br /> And you are really shocked when the film ends the way it is and you hear how loudly you say: “This cannot be the end of the movie ...” But, alas, it is. <br /> <br /> And imagine that you are leaving the cinema in embarrassment and shame for recommending such a dog to the cinema. You think that your date thinks that you are stupid to suggest such an atrocity, and your proposal will surely put an end to promising relationships. In fact, it was so bad that we both laughed at how bad it was. I see no future for Miss Gellar in the films and I suppose that she will stick to television in the future. In fact, not much time will pass before it is sent to the flea market, where Buffy's memorabilia is sold, and this will not happen soon enough if you ask me. Awful, terrible, terrible. The plot does not make sense; the continuity was terrible. Obviously, the whole final was coined to have “Grudge II - The Return of the Cat-Boy”.
