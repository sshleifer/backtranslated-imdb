The actors did a great job playing their roles, especially the mom. However, as the film progressed, I found that I was watching him more for their actions, and not because I cared the least about people. And sometimes I was annoyed by the irresponsible and inattentive attitude towards raising children, which manifested itself again and again. The daughter is a 17-year-old shallow skunk, whose main goal in life is to lay famous men and become a dancing nifet (complete with a lot of “shaking the booty”). The son is a guy with low self-esteem who seems to be in great need of relationships and friends - so much so that he throws a drug party at the end of the film. Both husband and wife are bored, but instead of investing energy in their stale relationship, it is better to look for new partners (although the wife chooses badly, since the man into whom she “throws herself” turns out to be gay - OH!). I just felt that ALL the characters had to grow up, and it was difficult for me to take care of such small jerks. I think that the author’s attempt was to demonstrate the complete banality and emptiness of the capitalist system. However, given that these characters are NOT typical of the average western family, this seems insincere.
