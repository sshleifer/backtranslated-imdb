Jeff Lowell did not write well and shot "Over His Dead Body." The idea, first of all, is as stale as my jokes, and the execution is just a cherry on the cake. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker - there is nothing attractive in this film. Eva looks great, as always, and shows a pleasant performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks exhausted and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete mistake. She looks courageous and shows strictly average indicators. Jason Biggs wasted, as was Lindsay Sloan. <br /> <br /> I expected more entertainment from this movie. Unfortunately, I was not entertained.
