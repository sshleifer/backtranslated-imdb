God, as a gay man who lives in New York, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the underbelly of the gay culture that is depicted in this film - and I am glad about it !!! If this film were broadcast on television throughout the United States, it would cause a serious reaction against gays, and I cannot say that I blame them. People in this film do not represent the average gay American or even the average American transgender, what they truly represent is a pure and complete nightmare. The inclusion of clearly underage characters is terrible, and overt racist sentiments (anti-whites) are glaring and alarming - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and the rejection of education by the actors of the film - the actions of these people are not an act of despair, but rather a rejection of something like personal ambition and a willingness to do something from oneself.
