What did the director think? Everyone who read the biography of Artemisia was overwhelmed by her courage to face a rape court during the Renaissance and even be tortured to show that Tassi was guilty. This fact shows real independence and emancipation - at its worst, it sustains its MAN. Why should the films depicting the Renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the sandy side of life or the Hollywood mood happy-happy won? Although I would always defend the freedom of the director to create his own reality in the film, I cannot comprehend the life story of Arthmisia on its head. Very disappointing selection of the creators of this film.
