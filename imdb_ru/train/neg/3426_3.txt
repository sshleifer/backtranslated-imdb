Being a fan of manga and anime Goh Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I was looking forward to it. I have not seen manga or anime, so I did not have preconceived opinions. Good thing too. We have a series of stupid erotic films of that type that appeared on the cable channels with alarming regularity late at night. Although this is compared to what is packed in the throat of ordinary viewers (the naughty pieces of our hero are either tastefully hidden behind a strategically glued scarf, or decorated with the ridiculous effect of the sun), there are lengthy scenes of slavery and torture that lend the process smart enough to its unsuitable for the kids. Although I have nothing against the naked heroines, I do not like movies made by amateurs (there are at least four in this series). On the other hand, in each of the four episodes that I saw, there is at least one amazingly beautiful actress. No wonder Nagai's TESTICLE BOY never did it ...
