They had such potential for this film, and they completely failed. In the first Cruel Intentions, we are interested in what prompted the main characters to become as they are and act as they do. In this prequel, character development is almost NO. This is actually a very sad story, but this film has done nothing for me. It was as if they had left a good letter instead of unnecessary f-words. And the end has absolutely no meaning and does not explain anything. The letter was just awful. Another thing that bothered me was that they leased the 3 EXACT SAME lines that were in the original. For example, a "kid", or a kissing scene, and a few others that I can't remember. I was not at all impressed with Robinâ€™s game, but Amy did a great job. This is the only thing that reconciled this film.
