I like Goldie Hawn, and I wanted another one of her films, so when I saw a protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart, I bought it. Although the film is a bit funny, it will never reach the goal. Some scenes, such as a bar party, just go on for too long and don't really make sense. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, at the end of the film there is a sermon scene that gives the whole film a bad taste, as I understand it. I do not think that this scene is even added to the film. I do not like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written, in particular, in the 60s, when I burn! <br /> <br /> In the end, although I'm glad that I have another movie “Hawn,” I certainly was worth the money I paid for it!
