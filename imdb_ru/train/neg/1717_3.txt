Here we have 2 misunderstood children who have never had a chance against cruel, poverty-ridden existence: Robin Hoods, chosen by the police for persecution, because they were sometimes a little wild. Gad! According to this shit, Bonnie was the sweetest little thing to the west of Missouri that he taught to be a psychopathic killer from a fun loving guy who really didn't want to offend anyone ... he just wanted things without investing much energy to get them. Poorly acting, poorly filmed, incredible dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, blood that looked more like grape jelly than like a real thing. Avoid this bilge water. Thumbs down. -5 stars.
