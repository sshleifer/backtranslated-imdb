There is so much wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the film could be compressed to five or even ten. In general, the film (fortunately) is already short, but this could be completed by paying a little more attention to the vile lion (how did Miss miss the reference to “The Wizard” on this?) And after working through his plot. a little closer to the main story. In short, the script was the source of a good idea, but it required a lot of work. <br /> <br /> Secondly, he could do without coarse humor. The original also had something it could do without, but at least there it was almost an afterthought - here, flatulence and urination are abundant. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the show is too self-conscious. In the original series, this was enough, as in the first film, but here it’s too, too much. In the anecdotes of Brendan Fraser, it was just too much (and why there is no mention of the "new Ursula"?). Other jokes with the Narrator, especially the pair of interactions near the end, also transcend common sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, a little more attention could be given to the work of the CGI. At first it was difficult to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally, special effects should just tell the story of whether they are good or bad, and at least they do well in this regard, so this is a relatively minor problem, but it is still there. <br /> <br /> All that is said, the performance of Christopher Shouermana in the role of George is quite decent. He lacks the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher really fails only in this particular comparison - he even managed to give George some personal depth, which should have been a serious violation in the film inspired by Jay Ward, but he was not here. Julie Bentz as the new Ursula surprised me that I was even better than Lesley Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most of the other speeches were fairly standard and did not stand out, in my opinion, as good or bad.
