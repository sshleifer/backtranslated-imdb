Super long drama, which is not able to give any real meaning. So she became an actress - so what? She learned to love - a big deal. There are certain eccentricities among the characters, as well as in dialogue and situations, but the type that is bad for the film makes it often seem absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, which plays the main role, speaks and behaves like a semi-retarded person, so there is no other choice but to see the film as a backward girl who makes it in the world of theater, which is clearly not was the goal. We are early (in the same “Barry Lyndon”) are told that she learned to hide her emotions, which, of course, explains her autistic stone face, but the film suffers from it. She basically walks like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not entirely credible, given her lack of emotion. From time to time there was a dull, sleepy feeling in the film Dogma 95 in the film. It's one? I would not be surprised. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late Phoenix. Nepotism rarely works. <br /> <br /> If you want to see my Hollywood nepotism list with more than 350 photos / records, please contact me by email.
