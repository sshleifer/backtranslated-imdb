This film is not worthy of the name Omen. It is so bad that it actually damaged the classical nature of the first three. This should never have been done, they should change the name. <br /> <br /> They donâ€™t even write the name of Damien Thorn !!!! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all films about omen. Pull it off the shelves and burn it.
