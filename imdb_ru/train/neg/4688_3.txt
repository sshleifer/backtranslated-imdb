Letting the class to watch it in English was a bad idea. Films that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but it seems that this one had no effect on the class — whenever the teacher left, the conversations began quickly — and I did not hear the words “Shakespeare” or “The Tempest” being used at all. . And when you look at it, it's easy to see why. There is nothing special in the game - it seems to everyone to be boring, just reading from the page without concern in the world. Shakespeare always preferred an explanatory dialogue to action and death, but I just could not understand the word that someone spoke. The costumes are not so bad as the special effects - the class might not like the movie, but they also didn’t take it with them. But it is difficult to joke about a film devoid of any inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the beginning of the film were not so badly made - although the rain looked a bit unreal, everything else was done well and well. But where were the severed heads and exploding masts? Where was the death? Where was the inspiration? Ariel's character would have been taken much more seriously if he had been dressed in clothes — but, as everyone has shown, he was another excuse for a joke. This film is in no way suitable for either sex. Women and girls will not have any romance or comedy, and the abundance of naked men and the lack of action or death will confuse most men and boys. The storm was not made badly, but it was like what the manufacturers had to do, not what they wanted to do. And the total boredom and lack of inspiration show. 3/10
