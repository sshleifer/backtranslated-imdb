I am very puzzled. I have been a big fan of Seagal for 25 years. I have seen all his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as "weird." Steven Seagal shares the script, writing and producing the credits in this film, but it's really hard for me to believe that he will choose to duplicate his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, aching voice of an impostor. What I also do not understand is that if they had to duplicate some of his lines, why does his voice sound on everyone else? I expect Seagal to grow old like all of us. But Seagal in this film hardly highlights a part of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm and sex appeal that he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous films. Most of all I missed his bold, self-confident attitude and his mocking ridicule, which passes so easily into this delightful smile. Where is the personal attitude and charm that made him such a huge star ??? I hope this film is not an indication of what Seagal left to offer us - if so, then his fans will have to admit throughout their lives that Seagal, whom we all knew and loved, is gone.
