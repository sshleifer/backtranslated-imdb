... just look at the poor character of Robert Webber (great performance, once again!), who is trying to take away the machine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this film seems a bit wrong. The biggest mistake, in my opinion, is an attempt to make the action firm in reality in the early 1980s (the fundamental difference between this film and the much more fantastic, ironic and, therefore, timeless Die Hard). The story comes as an unsuccessful attempt to glorify the SAS commando. Ideas, for example, when a commando shouts "head down", "all the good guys do it, and all the bad guys do not do so that they can dismiss advertising (with a clear conscience)," that the main character does not go crazy with gas. in masks, although he wears the same clothes and wears weapons from their arsenal, it seems unlikely and makes it difficult to take the film seriously. And it happens that he tries to be not just fun. Do not talk about the toilet-mirror-episode-signal ... <br /> <br /> I don’t mind criticizing the pacifist movement as a shield for villains and disputes between world fanatics and sedentary, even those headed by authorities in this film. But the political comment is rather unconvincing and boring. This is unfortunate because the film shows Judy Davis’s early production. She plays a major fan and seems to have done extensive research on this topic. ”In any case, her performance is one step higher than the others, and I feel that the film has let her down.
