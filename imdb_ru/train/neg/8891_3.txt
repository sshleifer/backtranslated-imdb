Easily known from all the plays of Shakespeare, she was seriously let down here. Inconvenient direction, stagnant studio work and promiscuous performances spoil the beautiful tragedy. <br /> <br /> In the city of Verona, the Capulets and Montague fought for centuries, but tragedy is inevitable when Romeo (Patrick Raikart) Montague falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Cyrus), Capuleti. Bloodshed will soon break out ... <br /> <br /> Studio work, especially in daytime scenes, seriously freezes the energy of the play. This is a story that with its energy deserves to be filmed on the street. In combination with this costumes are disgusting, with too many tights and ridiculous gourmets. Stage fights look awful, they stretch too much and run around to be exciting. <br /> <br /> Patrick Raikart is too easy to be truly effective Romeo. He controls the intensity of the character when the plot unfolds, but his majestic accent and soft, often inexpressive look limit his range. Viewers are very difficult to treat this Romeo. Rebecca Sair is too young to be a good Juliet - she catches the character's innocence, but a little more audacity would be welcome. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles are not much better. The monastic Lawrence Joseph O'Connor is all right, but too many of his best lines are cut off. Mercutio Anthony Andrews belongs on stage and not on camera. He grunts and gestures excessively and as a result looks pretty ridiculous. Alan Rickman, having diminished his role, is practically not present in the role of Tybalt. He developed the edge and intensity to provide some beautiful screens on the screens in subsequent years, but this is not proven here. The prince may be a wonderful role with his brief appearances, but the actor Lawrence Naismith does not give the role of any authority to the camera. Only Michael Hordern, probably in his best role in this series, comes out of it with dignity. His Capulet is well played and is joyful to watch. <br /> <br /> Take a look at one of the other versions of this story.
