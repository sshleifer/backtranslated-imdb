It was interesting for me to watch this film because I knew that it was a Christian film. The director had a good idea / intention when making this film, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone still feels for someone whom he considers the greatest love of his life. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. The main character continued to apologize to his friends when they were meaningful to him. They did not understand at all and used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, like no one else, did not know whether the former girlfriend was divorced, still married, and so on. D. But they were against him, allowing old feelings to be dealt with. It was assumed that his friends were Christians and should have been supported, whether they agreed with his decision or not. So many times we do things in life where we donâ€™t apologize to those we hurt in the past, and when he tried to do this, they were all against him. The ironic part was that his new girlfriend accused him of chasing himself for finding an old friend when she did a really weird thing to get his name, address and phone number ... she seemed like a pursuer ! she was not at all a friend, but only looked after herself. God is love ... and I think that God wants people to be with the person they were supposed to be with, and I feel that the film has committed a terrible injustice, giving the impression that God does not care about true love .. only you are left with the one with whom you made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... the whole point is what steps you take to correct the situation. As I said before, the film had potential, but I was tired of the one-sided point of view, which was constantly repeated, and stuck in the throat of the audience with its so-called ... friendly friends. This film did not adhere to the Christian belief in love, but I give it to C for its efforts.
