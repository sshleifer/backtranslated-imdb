This film is inconceivably bad. It starts with a few random explosions, and then cuts through the toe of the T-Rex doll, which talks (!) With the audience. This is repeated between the puppet dolls and the animation, probably because the filmmakers could not afford live actors. I will spare you a long, tedious, implacable conspiracy that pulls this pitiful film for a cruel 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video in a hobby store selling b-films for sale, and he bought it for the sole purpose of ridiculing it, but as it turned out, our intervention was not necessary. This film makes fun of ourselves better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought that Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Space was the funniest movie ever, but left it for Japan's Jazz, Lego Machines / Puppet Socks to surpass it. If you see this film anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and costs many, many good laughs.
