After seeing the trailer for this movie in the cinema, I thought it was the original concept of a thriller, which became it in the competitive world of computer companies. The star cast was another message that this film is likely to be good. But when I did not go to watch it in the first week of release, then by the second week it had disappeared, I was afraid that I would miss something. Patiently, I waited for his release on DVD, and then I bought it in a hurry home for a pleasant evening viewing. Waiting on the way home was much better than the movie. To begin with, the direction is terrible. There is no thought in it, and the director simply makes the role for himself so that he can appear in the film. I do not rush to use it in the future. Secondly, the main role does not play the role of Ryan Philip. Phillip is usually a cool character, as in “Cruel Intentions” and “The Way of Arms”, but in this he must be an awkward hero whom he tries to portray by slipping when he runs and has disgusting friends, but he simply does not look right. Female stars, Rachel Lee Cook and Claire Forlani do not show enough, but when they do, none of the actions are close to their best. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in the role that he could play for him, and it is his quick-tempered nature and mysterious ways that fascinate the film. And the last thing is that this film is another one that fills the trailer with scenes that you don’t see in the film, and which are used only in the deleted DVD scenes section. Even more disappointing because, although some of these scenes are rough, they fill important gaps in history.
