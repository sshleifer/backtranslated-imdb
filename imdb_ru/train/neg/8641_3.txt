The Great Central Murder (1942) Director: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre mystery “B” was one of five films released in 1942 with director Simon Of course, he could put another Red Skelton movie on his schedule! In any case, Grand Central Murder is a shameless robbery of films about Thin Man, with the exception of wit, charm and chemistry of the main characters. We are treated to a thin paper plot, which barely withstands 73 minutes, a bad game and fatigue. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick and Norah Charer, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is PI, and she is his wife and hibernating partner. They are engaged in "humorous" banter with each other. See? This is completely different. Heflin is the only one here who hints at bigger and better things, although he is very close to being an asshole. Virginia Gray was in the film “Another Thin Man”, but again, let me emphasize THIS FILM IS NOTHING NOT SO AS ONE, no, sir. And in case we start to think that this film is completely different from another film (say, “SLIM MAN”) that we really like, Sam Levin appears as a lead detective who is a little confused, and he needs to Van Heflin subtly directed him to all the important conclusions. Hmmm <br /> <br /> “Murder” comes quickly from the bitchy little scammer Mida King, who loves to trade on rich men until he finds an even richer man. She is played by Patricia Dane, who looks like Cedy Hedy Lamarr until she opens her mouth and turns into F. There are a number of stupid suspects, each with their own motivation to want Mead's death. There is a type of society, tough talking ladies, a thug, an ex-lover and a dubious theatrical impresario (Tom Conway, here burdened with the incredible name of the character "Frankie Syro"). Roman Bonen plays a nervous, nervous type, which I think he could have done before. Millard Mitchell plays the idiot policeman who, in a gag that does not go away, cannot stop thinking about a piece of a donkey who is waiting for him when the matter closes (that's true, Millard Mitchell is a fencer). Finally, in a completely revolutionary method of telling stories, something we have never seen before, all the suspects gather in one place, where they tell their stories (as memories) to a detective story, while Rocky makes notes, until in the end the Guilty person is forced to blurt out a confession . <br /> <br /> In addition to the actual image being stupid, I naively thought that there might be some personnel shots of the actual 1942 Grand Era. Central, but alas, no. There is only one very short shot at the beginning. Thank you for nothing, the Great Central Murder. Summarizing, we can say that it is quite formal, but Heflin is all right. <br /> <br /> * ½ of 4
