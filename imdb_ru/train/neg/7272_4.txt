The film is a bit tedious. This is basically a silent film, most of which is presented as a series of voice-overs. Although making such a silent film is not such a bad idea, it is one of those films where the lack of dialogue and repeated early scenes make it just tedious. You do not understand the cause of fatigue until you go deep into the picture, and by that time it is too late. The first 40 minutes of the film is the slowest part of Mexican soft pornography, and prosaic soft porn in it. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes begins to make sense, but it is already too late, because by that time the audience is lost. The National Autonomous University of Mexico has a great filming location. I often wondered why more films were not made there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields, which give the campus a completely different world. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer made the film the way he wanted to see it, not paying attention to how the viewer who does not know the story sees it. You cannot ignore the audience when telling a story.
