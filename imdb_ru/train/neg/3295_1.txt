... then you better not watch this movie. They completely messed up the premise of the show. In the film, Duke's boys are idiots, Daisy is a vagabond, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jesse is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters. At least Enos seems to be close. <br /> <br /> At some point, they open the door to get to General Lee, said Nuff. <br /> <br /> The original show may not have been a great TV. , but it was interesting, and the characters made sense. This film is similar to "Dumb and Dumber Meets Simple Life."
