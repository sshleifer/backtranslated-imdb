A newcomer suffers so much. There are random music songs in the film, a long meaningless script and enough stuffing to make Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Levitt just do not know when to leave. A full hour passes before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters will be shipwrecked. Then the guys start playing Japanese sailors with a standard racist caricature of the day. It's a shame that the funniest parts of the film are when Noonan and Leavitt play silly, stereotypical Japanese guys. But it gets rather tedious after switching between two character sets. Then it just ends suddenly. Even nude Julie Newmar in a towel can't save it. <br /> <br /> The film has really little charm, and it lasted more than half an hour. History is tormented, trying to create funny situations and fail. Stick to Martin and Lewis. At least Deano had a charm, and Jerry had such a lively face.
