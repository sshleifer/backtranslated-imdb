Continuous comedy entertainment with musical interludes, it generates a fast tempo that leads the process at an amazing pace through a maze of humorous and colder complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form an ominous villain. The script contains all the standard mysterious cinematic details-sliding panels, secret passages, thunder and lightning, as well as poisoned darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre are engaged in heavy looks and the apparent melodrama of the gas era. Kay Kiser and his group offered great entertainment to people who lived in the 1940s, who tried to forget about the horrors of the Second World War.
