Apparently, the Injured Man talks about a guy who wanders the earth, demonstrating self-destruction as a way to cope with his abusive childhood. I use the word “obvious” because without listening to Andy Kopp’s commentary by the director (which I didn’t have) or reading the film before watching, the audience will not understand what it is about. <br /> Gorehunds and fans of extreme films may be seduced by watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh spray scenes and disturbing real shots, but if they don’t like the pretentious, headache-causing experimental art house theater, they will find this real chore to sit down. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly images, accompanied by irritable sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this overwhelmingly terrible nonsense is the perfect way to test your sanity: if you still have all the marble, you turn off this garbage and instead look at something decent (I watched it all, but I understand perfectly well that I bark completely!).
