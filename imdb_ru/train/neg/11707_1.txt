This 2003 film for television, of course, was shown on the women's channel. As a man, why am I even trying to watch this? I don't know, but I need to inspect my head. Both the director and the writer Simon Gornik should be ashamed of himself, in order to expose people to injustice, like himself. He takes away any strengths and convictions that a man may have if he is forced by several boring women. Native number one - Joyce Heiser as his wife. I couldn't wait for him to leave her. Her revenge was stupid and stupid and very confusing for most of the film. The other fatal woman was Nicole Hilz, about the coldest man you ever wanted to meet. Her appearance did not guarantee that our presenter turned over her, and her game was so obvious that only a fool could miss. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but she was slow about how a whore seduces her own husband, who David Deleuze plays as a loser again. Anthony Denison as the boss completes our lineup of losers, and he has little left to do except frown on our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say sacrifice, was not so good. At first I thought he was just a bad actor, but then I believed it. He never received this part and was everywhere. Although, as a man, I got angry when it got away with two women. Men, beware of this channel, which suppresses men, and women leave even with murders. LMN is a channel. Caution. Note. Looking at it a second time by mistake, I was convinced of my initial thoughts. Especially on the writer / director Simon Gornik. I still believe that he has disgraced the male look and should be a beaten horse. The only saving grace in this film is Thembi Locke, which has no chance to show their talents with the terrible play of Jenkins, Heiser, Hilz and Deluise around her. Plus a stupid conspiracy that only makes it worse. Down with the film Gornik and his empty stars. Please, LMN does not show this trite again.
