This is definitely one of the strangest films ever made - even for Fellini. About another strange his satirikon. This is two and a half hours in a strange, nightmarish world of decadence, wealth and sexual problems. Sutherland makes Casanova strangely unattractive, and strange events in a series of untied vignettes taken from the great loverâ€™s autobiography do not attract the viewer. The artistic direction and design of the costume, however, are OUT. The Academy overlooked even the fact that it did not put forward the first option, but it justified itself by rewarding OSCAR for the latter. An incoherent, meaningless and almost inaccessible scenario was also nominated (oddly enough). Go figure it out !! The film on the video is only 150 minutes, which is 16 minutes less than the original time of the show. This viewer was grateful.
