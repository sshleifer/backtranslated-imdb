Dave is going through a divorce, and his mind returns to his first love. “Wanders” is probably not the right word. I have to say that he is fixated on the last girl. He remembers the day the relationship ended. Sequences of dreams do not have only fog transitions. He lovingly recalls their favorite songs and the places they went to. I am not a consultant, but maybe this is somehow connected with a failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets with a half of his age (also divorced) woman, who, instead of being "turned off" by his eeriness, becomes interested in him. Did I mention how creepy Dave is? Sometimes he refers to himself in the third person. He also does not move his hands when he walks. This is just weird. In short, Dave is plotting to track down Mary (an old friend) and kill her ... make mistakes ... I mean confront her. He does that. Which was really creepy. He believes that she is married, and yet he flies across the country to meet her. He stakes at her house to make sure she is alone before he jumped into her. He has an awkward conversation with her, which ends up sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less and flying back to the new young girl. We liked the movie mainly because of the unintended comedy value. I still entertain my wife with my impressions of Dave ... "I heard another song of Dave and Mary!"
