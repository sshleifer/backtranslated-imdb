Let me first say that I watched this movie around midnight, and usually only garbage at this hour, but this film broke the record <br /> <br /> first of all the main character is an old unattractive creepy guy, nevertheless he finds all the girls who meet on his way, for example, he goes to the store, talks to the girl, and then you see them, secondly, there are a lot of sex scenes, and in many of them there is no nudity at all, I would not be surprised if one of the characters in the film would say: get dressed quickly so that we can f * ck! <br /> <br /> Thirdly, this film should show that sexual addiction can do with a man or family, this film only shows a soft, poorly acting erotica, it makes me wonder why these actors agreed to play in such garbage
