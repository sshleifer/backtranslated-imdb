My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I met a group of my friends who are NBB haters and had a big bonfire, and we took a CD of their songs and a DVD with the film and a bunch of photos. The band members threw them into the fire and danced a cheerful jig around the burning material, singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead". It was the best thing on the show, and this show is stupid with the god-capitol, this show sucks. I hate it so much. Get rid of the shitty car. You guys really sucks! You really messed up the whole channel! No offense or anything else, but you guys have to get a life, I mean, really, who's doing a stupid show with a stupid lead singer who can't even sing! You guys really sound awful and you need to live like strollers or something like that, except Roselina. She is really beautiful. But still, you guys get it!
