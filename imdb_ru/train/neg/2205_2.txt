This type of plot really has a lot of potential, but it was cut here. Honestly, I felt the cheese element at the beginning, but I thought it would be better after the grotesque birth. Wow, I was wrong! So, a mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old buddies before killing them, but, of course, they run away. After that, it's really bad. I had to count the number of times a rubber mask from sharks looked out because of some kind of foliage, but, most likely, I would have lost count. <br /> <br /> The camera shows dripping blood from a severed leg to show us how a shark man finds people. I hate being fed with a spoon in all aspects of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and after I was nearly killed by a mutated shark man and dragged around the island in the jungle, there is nothing more cheerful than a middle man telling Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> This is the case when you cheer on a monster ... if you can watch this bad excuse to click.
