Although I recently included it on my list of the 10 worst films, I must say that it is probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in Crazy or any of the “Look Who Says” sequels. Still, it's rather nauseous, even when sexy Drew Barrymore plays a bit of a horror film in response to Holly Golightly, moving from New York to Los Angeles, but finding out that she is being followed by a murderous appearance. Poor Sally Kellerman, a bizarre actress who became widely known in the 1970s, boils down to the negligible role of support, and Barrymore's lead man George Newburn is the worst type of comedian who always stops laughing every line. The picture is dark, but the bloody scene in the soul of Drew boasts entertainment, and the personality of the psycho (although right from the episode of Scooby-Doo) is interesting. But as for the finale ... become real! Who was supposed to clean up? * from ****
