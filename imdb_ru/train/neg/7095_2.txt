The Sexual Addict Diary is a pitiful attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness. Probably a cinema marketing scam, this film is a stylish shoot with a good cast and nothing else. In the end, “Diary ...” would make us believe that our character, a sexual addict, has the world's most stupid wife, a stable of babies on the side, who have nothing better than to give him panties at his whim, and there is no work, the fact that I am a restaurateur. At best, this movie could be a good drama. In the worst case, a cheap erotic. "The Diary ..." is not between anywhere else. This is for dumpster. (D-)
