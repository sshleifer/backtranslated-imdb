I saw this movie at a gay and lesbian festival in New York and thought it was pretty bad. The first and most distracting was how much of it was shot; that is, there are many slow movements and overly skilful close-ups that seemed to make no sense — wise or aesthetic — apart from showing filmmaker skills (which I also thought was the director). This film seemed to come up with a pretentious student. The main actor (Sam Levine) was, of course, very nice, but at best was a mediocre actor; and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so to bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I have to admit that most viewers seemed to enjoy the film; constantly laughed and sighed, but I really did not like it.
