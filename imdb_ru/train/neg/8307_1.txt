This show is incredible in this. , what he represents and what he focuses on and,, words cannot describe how insane the alien is. They will report everything. If a celebrity is even remotely indirectly related to history, ET will report it. If the dog poop is in the courtyard of Tom Cruise, they will report it. If a celebrity dies. They will talk about it for a few weeks to such an extent that the public is jealous of this celebrity. If a celebrity is on trial. ET will report this within MONTHS in a row. There is no end to what this show is going to tell, and there is no timeframe for how long they will focus on the plot. Is it even considered legitimate reporting? The reports are so damned annoying, with harsh delusional voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of importance. I can not watch this show without questioning the existence of mankind. ET is one of the main reasons why I generally avoid evening shows. I regret that IMDb can allow at least one stellar rating, not zero or even negatives. For this show deserve -10 stars.
