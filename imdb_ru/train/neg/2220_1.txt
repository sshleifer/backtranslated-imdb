What the hell is in your head? This movie sucks! Every minute I was getting duller. I wanted to watch the end, because I hope that at least something will finally happen! But instead I was struck by how boring the end was ... What is this story with this bloody "freak"? Why doesn't he die? For God's sake, he is a bloody man! A simple boy who killed his stupid sister 15 years ago. What then ? Did his stay in a mental hospital make him immortal? This film is incredibly stupid ... It's just nonsense. I'm going to resell it right now to some stupid guy who understands this stupid movie.
