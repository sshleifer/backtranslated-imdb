Watching the little man, you will spend the time of his run, trying to figure out his many holes in the plot. And this is not a good sign, because this film should be a comedy! You must laugh at this !! And you? Probably no. <br /> <br /> The main problem of a small person is his concept — too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoon comedy), so when loud, difficult and excessive jokes start, they make the whole thing seem ten times more stupid than now. <br /> <br /> “But this is a comedy,” some of you may scream. This is true, but it is no excuse for such a stupid conspiracy. I mean, come on, think about it, if you saw a child with a FACE OF GROWTH OF PEOPLE, would you be a little suspicious? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why didn't he put it on the nearest shelf instead of the bag of a random woman? And how can a qualified doctor NOT recognize that Calvin is an adult? i mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> “The point is not in the plot, but in laughter,” you shout. Well, you see, in the little man there is almost no laughter, and it only makes the plot of a stupid ass even more noticeable. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the comedy of brothers-vayans with a plot that is removed from the faith, stick to the white chicks, because, at least, they had some decent laughs.
