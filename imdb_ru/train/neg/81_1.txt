Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait for it to end. The plot was meaningless. The game was terrible! Especially teens. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperately trying to give the actors work? The previews were attractive, and I was really looking for a good thriller. One day a good movie will appear in life, and this is not one of them. If there was nothing else, I would avoid it at all costs. It was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would prefer to scratch my face on a brick wall for two hours and then permeate it with peroxide. That would be more interesting.
