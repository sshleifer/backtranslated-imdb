Yes. I admit it. I believed all the hype around this work, about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in Mexico City regarding their sex life. So, I really expected to see a Mexican film (at the age) that would be both popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the film was extremely disappointing. The story presents us with two couples, both with very obvious family problems. When a third person appears in the life of each pair, their problems reach a crucial point. Or absolute absurdity. The plot then turns into a battle of the sexes. The position taken by each group (yes, they are literally a group, girls with girls and boys with boys) are clearly stupid and childish (I think that humor should have been there). And everything goes from bad to worse. The performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr. Bichir), where Serrano does acceptable work on his opera opera. However, the flat circumstances that make up the plot, one-dimensional characters, a very bad (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship, etc., make the film unsuccessful. Miserably. SPyL had a (impressive) good reception at the box office. Believe deception at your own risk.
