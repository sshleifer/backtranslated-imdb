What a disgrace! I tested it, hoping that it would be James Garner's undiscovered gem, and how terrible it turned out to be! Product quality was good, but the plot was undoubtedly lame, and I can honestly say that I am only a couple of hours older and much dumber now. The film really did not have redemptive qualities, and if such things go out, it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what you are talking about, this is about nothing, and in this case it’s not a good thing. We are being watched as one old wicked woman, who is one of the most stupid creatures who ever roamed the earth, turns out to be married to a real lover, who is probably the only living person who can come to terms with her. She drags him through one confusion, drives him into one awkward situation after another and is always proud of herself. Then the movie ends. What a relief! You shouldn’t spend time watching it, so do yourself a favor and skip this one, you’ll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one is.
