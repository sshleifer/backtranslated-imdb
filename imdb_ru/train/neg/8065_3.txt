Steve Carpenter can't shoot horror movies. First of all, the casting was very wrong for this film. The only decent part was the hot brown-haired woman from Buffy, the vampire slayer. In this film, there is no blood (usually the key ingredient of a horror movie), no action, no action, and no expectation (also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and simple in this that it is sad. There were several parts that were supposed to be funny (continuation of horror films / comedy films for teenagers), and no one was laughing in the audience. I thought this film was rated R, and I ignored it and realized that it was changed to PG-13. In any case, watch this movie, if you like it, I still know what you did last summer. This is the only type of person who would find this film even remotely scary. But seriously, this is for you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. This movie makes Creek look like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
