Words cannot describe how stupid this story is (and therefore bad in this film)! Bassinger, Del Toro ... what were you thinking about ?? So there is a shopping center, and its parking space is completely full. The Basinger character goes to buy a cup of tea and wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When it comes out, everything is so empty that no one hears two shots nearby? Even if she lives there, when she leaves the villains, does she go to the most distant and forgotten place of God instead of the nearest police station or at least to a crowded place ?? COME ON !!! I will not even go into the infamous red toolkit, as other people have done it before. Not to mention how she kills the idiotic thugs one by one. <br /> <br /> This is so stupid, without the slightest logic, I can only warn you, watching this, it is a complete loss of time, honestly !!
