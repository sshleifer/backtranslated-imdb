I saw this film recently at a film festival. This is the novel of a former unemployed alcoholic man who has just emerged from a major depression, and a single middle-aged woman who works at an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of cliches, taking the “social” theme of the film and turning it into a romantic comedy. The lead actor has done a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not a believable working-class woman, she looks, behaves and speaks very much like a “high-ranking” woman. I mean, Ana Belen is playing herself. In any case, she does this in all of her films. The whole movie scene was very poor. The photo is ugly, not very well using the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds completely scripted and boring in most cases. Comic situations are typical for Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are badly solved. In my opinion, this film is not worth watching. Only if you really like Pereira’s previous films, you might like this movie. Anyway, I left the theater because I felt that I was wasting my time. The director was at the door. It’s interesting what the director feels when he sees someone coming out of one of his films, especially those created to please everyone.
