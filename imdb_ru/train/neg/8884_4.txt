Dominic is one of those films for which the expression “slow molasses” was to be invented. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times do we see Robertson slowly walking down the stairs because he hears someone playing the piano?). This is ALMOST bought at the end by an unexpected turn, which, unfortunately, is followed by a second turn, which succeeds only in leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Not a very nice movie.
