We were served - a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I admit that since I’m white and I don’t have any practical experience in the "competitive world of dancing on the step", I wouldn’t be exactly authority on this type of film. On the other hand, I see a bad movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> And boyfriend, I just saw her. <br /> <br /> Filmed on a low budget and directed by Ian Iqbal Rashid (“Touching Pink”), “How She Moves” tells a story about the importance of following your dreams - even if these dreams include running around loud, annoying hip-hop music and speaking of dialogue, an ordinary person would not understand if he had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will try to give a short overview of the “plot”. First of all, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J who work at an auto shop in Toronto (a Mecca of racial diversity), but still have time to dance eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> In this “team” there are a few more guys, including a white dude and a guy like Denzel Washington in Malcolm X. The film also has two women - one resembles Serena Williams, and the other looks like Geraldine from the old Flip Wilson Show. One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her training on her brother with drug addiction. The other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, is without a doubt useless. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddy Murphy's buckwheat, while another actor who fakes Huggy Bear. These guys are rivals in fast-moving dances. Obviously, this occupation is very difficult, and they are all preparing for the big “Step Monster” jam in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Since I couldn’t understand 90 percent of the dialogue (perhaps some subtitles would be useful, like in the Bergman movie or in the same Snow music video), it’s hard to explain what happens except for a lot of controversy about the girl Serena Williams (by the way, she never smiles) becomes a freelance stepper (moving from group to group), there are several step-dances and a lot of annoying hip-hop music. <br /> <br /> This is a typical story from rags to riches; Kind of like "Rocky" with a really bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without laughter. <br /> <br /> But why a film that could have a big impact on a black audience should contain addiction, bad parents and a name that sounds like a first grader, pronouncing the phrase: “How is she moving?” <br /> <br /> However, this film “touched me.” Moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible.
