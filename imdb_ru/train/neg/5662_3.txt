When I read BRIDGE from other comments, I felt that they were too glowing for this film. I found that he had completely lost the spark found in earlier Zatoichi films, and simply proves that after a long absence on the screen it is often better to just leave everything as it is. I completely agreed with the Star Trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the FIRST Star Trek film with the original series - millions of excited fans waited, waited and waited for the show to return and were forced to watch a boring and fruitless Approach to the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it is terribly awful (although the recent NEW Zatoichi Bit Takeshi is much bloodier) and there is no heart of originals in it. I didnâ€™t mind blood at all, but some may turn it off (especially scenes with a severed nose and severed heads). In addition, the time was not good for Ichi - he seems to be a broken and sad person in this film (much, much more than usual) - and this is something that fans of the series may not really want to see. <br /> <br /> This was a very sad return for Zatoichi. If you are not like me and do not want to watch EVERYONE Zatoichi film, you can skip this film. See one of the earlier versions or the ALL NEW version of 2003.
