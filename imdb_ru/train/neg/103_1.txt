Not wanting to be a killer, Brad Sykes is in charge of at least two of the most boring and cliché films I've ever seen - one of them, and Camp Blood the other. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the print is bad, and everything in this film shouts “seriously, you could have done better yourself.” Could it be a challenge for everyone to feed the youtube with our own zombie crap? <br /> <br /> I bought it for £ 1, but remember, you can’t set a price for 71 minutes of your life. You would be good to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain price in the basement.
