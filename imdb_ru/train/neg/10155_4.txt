I read some good reviews that defended and criticized various aspects of this film. One thing I see again and again is the annoyance of Megan, an idealistic political analyst trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe because I am a 23-year-old political student and I think that I am also going to change the world, so I belong to Megan. Besides, she's cute. She is not a super model, but rather a pretty girl next door. <br /> <br /> Good, so she cried a lot and screamed. It is very dramatic and seems to have overdone it, but doesnâ€™t it fit her character? She goes to this show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove her point. She thinks that people who like this show are sick. I think she made her argument very well. Of course, being a young, naive girl, she is afraid of what she has to face. I think that her actions accurately portray a young girl who displays moral courage, despite her overwhelming fear. In addition, I think she retained a certain dignity throughout the film, despite the desperate situation in which she was. <br /> <br /> As for the film as a whole, except Megan, that was pretty much what I expected. He had excellent bloody scenes, by the standards of the microbudget. The plot, perhaps, quickly thought, hardly thought. Basically, it's just a dark humorist, a meaningless slasher film, about which the title speaks. I love the sadism of the doctor. He continued to tear off his shirt with Megan, not only because of meanness (albeit in many ways), but also to torture her before killing her. A chainsaw was fun. For lovers of slashers, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this film 4 out of 10. He had a good atmosphere, almost no plot, and a mixture of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for cheap thrills, but hardly a diamond in rough diamonds, which is the horror of the microbudget.
