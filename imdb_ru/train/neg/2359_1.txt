This was supposed to be the last Freddie film (and it was for over 10 years) - you would think that they would try to make a good film. But it turned out that they give us the worst of the series (and this says a lot). The plot did not make sense (I seriously can not remember this), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them to die), and Freddie's wisdom was even worse than usual. The only success in this respect was the short (and funny) cameo of Johnny Depp (the first film “Nightmare” was his first). <br /> <br /> I also saw him in the theater in the last section (Freddie’s childhood recalculation) was in the 3rd. Well - the 3rd was a lousy faded color, and the image was in and out of focus. Also, the three flying skulls that were supposed to be scary (I think) caused a backlash from my audience. ALL burst out laughing. It looks even worse on TV in 2 dimensions. Pointless and stupid - very boring. Skip this and see “Freddy vs. Jason” again.
