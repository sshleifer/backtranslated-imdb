Much worse than the original. It was * really * painful * to sit, and it hardly interested my six-year-old child. <br /> <br /> The presentation of a new pokemon is slightly interesting, but the storyline is very thin, the dialogue is still bad, and the music is mediocre. Watch a TV show instead - it's much better.
