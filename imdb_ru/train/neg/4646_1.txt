Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little bit about heavy metal, you saw jokes everywhere. If you know anything about porn, this bogus documentary will leave you cold. Everything in it sounds fake. <br /> <br /> Spinal Tap was funny because he captured the familiar world and pushed it up. This film is clearly not funny, because he paints a picture of how porn is made, which has nothing to do with the real world. <br /> <br /> Acting evenly here is terrible, but what would not matter if the main idea from the film were good. But it is not.
