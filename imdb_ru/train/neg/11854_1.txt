For life, I can not understand the good reviews on this piece of shit. It was pointless. Matthew Modin was terribly mistaken as the leading lady. Gina Gershon, well, others said it, but I repeat, why a stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And her game was just bad. I do not know whether she was thrown accent, or how. There was no chemistry between the two. <br /> <br /> And the girl with whom Modin was in love, suddenly puts half of the salad in her mouth and behaves silly? Where did this come from? I think we should have regretted her when we saw that her marriage with a workaholic was beginning to break down, but, frankly, I did not care for any of these people.
