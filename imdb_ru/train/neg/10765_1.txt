A great example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of fiction and stupidly spoil it. <br /> <br /> In the case of Big Sky, writer Dudley Nichols and the company arrogantly suggested that they could improve the classic pioneer novel of the author who won the Pulitzer Prize A. B. Guthrie. At the same time, they eliminated the soul of history, as well as its sharpness and influence, which she could have in the form of an adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie’s book and the evolution of its protagonist, Boone Caudill, from a naive Kentucky guy turned into a hardened and competent survivor / mountain man, was replaced by a reduced farce on a riverboat that little resembles the author’s intentions . In the film version, Boone’s presence is nothing short of delight. <br /> <br /> Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie a new effect and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason. What is most puzzling is the emphasis on Zeb Calloway, who was a secondary, secondary character in a book, spanning only a few pages. On the other hand, a very important and exciting character, Dick Summers, a pioneer veteran, disappeared completely !!! It is also obvious that the director Hawks decided that the character Zeb in the film, played by the actor Hunnicutt, is not annoying enough. Thus, Zebu / Hunnicutt was given a considerable amount of time to create this disgusting, off-screen narration, which is a Hollywood abbreviation for incompetent screen recording, editing and directing. <br /> <br /> Some films really improved the books on which they were based (William Wyler's Ben-Hur is a great example). But this is terrible and dismal, not only as a film adaptation of the novel, but also as a film in itself. <br /> <br /> The story is boring and ordinary, and the characters — at least those that have not been edited from the script — are just small and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And, unfortunately, the star appeal of Kirk Douglas, which could help to make this film, was shocked by the role of the thrush that he was given. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, the movie version that won the Guthrie Pulitzer Prize sequel to The Way West, also starring Kirk, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, “Big Sky” further strengthens Howard Hawks’s place as one of the most overpriced, coolest directors in cinema history.
