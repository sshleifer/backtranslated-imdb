I rented this film just to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box, I thought it sounded like a good story ... but the first problem was that there was actually no story ... or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was that these characters were not tuned ... yes, I realized that they all went to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the movie you realized that they have nothing in common and they donâ€™t like each other. ... so why do they keep getting together. Disadvantage number 3: the director, although long pauses and narrow shots in the frame were equal to expectations (especially with typical backup music), he was sadly mistaken. It was painful to see how an amazing actress, like Amber Benson, wasting time trying to bring it back to life ... My only hope - the money she earned here was spent on making her own film.
