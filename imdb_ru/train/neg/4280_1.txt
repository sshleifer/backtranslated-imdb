This should be accompanied by a special rating and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> The obsession of Danelyuk with the dirtiest functions of the body becomes a real nightmare here. It is also obvious that this person is a misanthrope; he hates everyone — his country, his people, his actors, his work. And this hatred makes him blind, and he more forgets the profession he has known for a long time. <br /> <br /> This so-called “film” is simply a disgusting series of disgusting images, without artistic value and without professional knowledge. This is an insult to good taste and common sense. Shame, shame, shame!
