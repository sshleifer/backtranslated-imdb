I feel like I just watched a snuff film ... beautifully played, tight, exciting and terrible thing! The two-hour persecution of perversions in the simplest and most comprehensive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burials and cruel treatment, abuse, abuse. No redemption at all. And I had fun. I could not stop watching. What does it say about me, about people who do and act in such things, and about a world that has become so desensitized that in the end real snuff films will become the norm. And I'm not a puritan and not without humor, I'm not trying to hide from the existence of darkness, and I definitely did not lead a protected life, but I am ashamed of myself. And I wish my British cousins ​​were draining this sewer like my own tribe. It does not have to be cozy, but should it get bogged down in vicarous sadism?
