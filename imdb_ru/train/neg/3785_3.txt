They say like a real hard-boiled gangsta. The story is not worse than any number of gangster films, but never confuse this film with the Godfather of I or II, or Goodfell. It is not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But the film occasionally seems painful to watch, because all these Italians are Americans, having fun, throwing bad gangster lines with an even more terrible accent. Pacino would be great if they just baptized him. I was looking forward to meeting Abrahams and Loggia, but their bright accents spoiled the fun. <br /> <br /> Well, the script is also not too hot. Don Corleone could make it disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling all the time and patting him on the back.
