This film is a joke, and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass it off as the film Modest Blaise. If you have trouble sleeping, then shoot this movie. The figure they call an actress who is considered to be modest, Blaise, should be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe it can be used as a hat stand in the background of this movie. Seventy-five minutes, thank you nothing, who ever invented the fast-forward button. If you see this movie, if you can name it, that way you run. I can't help but think that a third world country could spend the money spent on this shit. this film is boring, the actors are a boring waste of color, spent air they breathe.
