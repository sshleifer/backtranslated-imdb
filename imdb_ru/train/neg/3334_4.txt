It scared the hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more fun than frightening, but with some rather disturbing moments and with some nasty quality that I like. And, if you think about it, the plot is pretty disgusting in fact ... but it is processed with some sort of taste. If there is a problem with this film, this is what there are HUGE gaps where nothing interesting or interesting happens. In addition, the finale goes on forever, which makes a potentially tense climax after a while stupid, and Barbara Bach screams and screams. "Monster", after he exhibited, unfortunately, is not very scary. The somewhat grim look of the film also works against him, making it look like a television movie more than anything made for movie theaters. But this is an example of films that are rarely made today, so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel nostalgic ...
