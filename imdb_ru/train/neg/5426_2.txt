"According to the tradition of" Carrie "and" Vereski "? Try `shameless robbery not only of these two films, but also of the“ Evil Dead ”and 'The Shining'. However, they really no longer make bad horror films like this, and this is a shame, because it’s a gas. <br /> <br /> Rainbow Harvest is a Winona replacement, and although she barely does more than mumble her lines (and sometimes shout “You are ugly!” in her haunted mirror), she’s a goth before fashionable, so you have to respect her. (And she is also very creative in this, putting on accessories with black leather scarves and a peculiar Hawaiian punch hat dyed in black spray. Eat your heart, Cher.) <br /> <br /> Karen Black changes clothes a bit, but she not completely without dignity, and you can not help but sympathize with her. (Unless you are a friend of mine who asked, “Who is this, Horse Lips from MASH?” When it first appeared on the screen.) <br /> <br /> There are decent performances by Kristin Dattilo (as square the chick who is friends with Rainbow), Ricky Pall Goldin (in his trademark role as a sorceress), and William `Larry, Darryl and Darryl 'Sanderson (like some favorite undertaker or something like that) But it's sad to see that the once sooty Yvonne DeCarlo began to play what can only be imagined as the role of Charlotte Rey. <br /> <br /> The eighties were the heyday of funny, stunningly stupid horror films like this, and Mirror, Mirror was one of the last of its kind. Definitely worth a look.
