High Tromavil turned into an immoral wasteland of mud due to the consequences of the accidental release of toxic waste from a nearby nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> Unrestrained chaos, filled with absurd violence and rude behavior. Rather, a terrible, apparently intended, film mess with directors releasing the reins, allowing the mediocre free board to idle to ignite it. The craft was far in Trom’s target list for this bloody murder. Honor Society - punks with horrible face painting and stupid outfits. The German teacher, who becomes a member, through a “poisonous kiss” has stripes on one side of her face that really made me goosebumps. However, the poisonous monster that sent the annoying punks towards the end is pretty cool. br /> <br /> Kind of garbage lovers in the film from the heart.
