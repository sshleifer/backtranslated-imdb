As a big fan of the films and plays of David Mamet, especially his first film “The House of Games”, in which Joe Mantegna also starred, I expected great things from this film. Instead, I was annoyed by the shallowness of the film and the lack of trust. Racial insults are thrown out without any feeling or meaning behind, hoping to create a racial tension that never materialized for me. Identity is completely overvalued, and people become “heroes” for no apparent reason. Because of his vows taken as a policeman, the protagonist categorically refuses to perform one relatively minor action that does not harm anyone and can save lives, and yet performs another action that is very cruel and VERY illegal, but then still refuses minor action. In addition, an extremely unbelievable story involving the man who killed his family is presented only for the sake of the story, which was almost advertised by writing a skywright, and the policeman’s reaction to this incident extends beyond the limits of gullibility beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, waiting for another thriller from David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed, to say the least. 3 out of 10
