Despite the fact that Bette Davis did a wonderful job as Mildred, I felt that the film was not the best that I had seen. At the end of the film, I felt that something was missing in it. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis did a great job and she made me hate her and pity her all the time. Leslie Howard played the role of Philip Carey in love very well, and I felt so sorry for him throughout the film for being in love with such a terrible lady. It is such a sad thing when someone finds himself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it is someone like Philip Carey, a sensitive person, albeit a pathetic one. <br /> <br /> In the end, acting is what happened, not the plot. The final scene was especially good, but I'm not one of those who distribute it. While others may find this film good, I was the one who found it so-so. I have to recommend this film to those who love a bad seed so they can see what can happen to them if they turn out to be in love with this horrible person.
