Someone will have to explain to me why some films that depict poor people and that look pseudo-sandy are somehow perceived by some as “realistic”. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything realistic in the characters (although the actors did their best with really bad roles) or situations. Instead, I saw a forced, shy effort of being "nervous", "sandy", and "dirty and puffy." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this requires much more than just keeping the camera without rhyme or the reason and inability to illuminate the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way. <br /> <br /> This is a sad commentary on the state of independent distribution of the film, that the only films that are seen inside the theater at the moment are all copies, with bad cinematography, a non-existent camera direction and a great oath to impersonate "Art" . <br /> <br /> No wonder films like “In the Bedroom” or “Pro Schmidt” come across such raves. I find them winding and very average, but compared to the current killing of independent clones, such as "Raising victor Vargas", they are simply gorgeous and inspired. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, we watched an “independent” film, which means that you will most likely be related to some kind of originality and a lot of energy and care, and possibly several technical failures caused by a low budget. Nowadays, this means that there is a chance that you will get another digit, let's try to “shake the camera for two hours” to soothe the lack of taste of independent distributors. And, of course, all of this is for serving characters and situations that are completely unreal and far-fetched. <br /> <br /> Is it surprising that there are fewer surviving companies in the independent market? Not at all when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas, in which there is nothing but copying the worst of the films that preceded them.
