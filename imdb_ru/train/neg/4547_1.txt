The film was HORRIBLE !!! Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last few years. One of those films that I can tell people over the next three years is that it was the worst movie I could come up with. Thank you for giving me the answer to this burning question: “What is the worst film you have seen?” Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Believe me ... I read a book, enjoyed the message and was thrilled to see the film, but then they treated the audience like us. There is no story, and the story there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence. It is unfortunate that they have to set forth nine prophecies and cannot simply weave them into a story that is interesting to follow. They did not waste time on character development, and it was easy not to care about the death of any character. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who remained until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is also quite boring, but I liked the parallels that can be seen in everyday life while you are reading a book. The film does not offer such an opportunity, and I would advise not to watch it if you want to continue to keep the words of the book to heart. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.
