Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a top-class housewife who lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Schaeffer). Della pays all the attention to the twins, neglecting their home, their appearance and upsetting Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, she goes to a local mall at night to buy wrapping paper for gifts, and she doesn’t find a place to park. When she sees an old car parked in two places, she leaves a message to the owner, calling it a "selfish jerk." When the mall closes, Della's car is delayed by the driver of the old car, and she is threatened by four punk ?? Chuckie (Lucas Haas), African American Huey (Jamie Starr), Sino-American wynch (Leonard Wu) and Latin Thomas (Louis Chavez). When the mall guard protects her, Chucky shoots him in the head, Della speeds up her car, trying to escape from the criminals. However, she crashes her truck next to the forest, pursued by a gang. She takes the toolbox and hides in the woods, fighting a gang to survive. <br /> <br /> A couple of days ago I saw the trailer for “While She Was Absent,” and I really wanted to watch the DVD, Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I’m completely disappointed with this boring and implausible collection of cliches. Della Myers seems to be an insecure and careless housewife and does not exist as a wife; motherhood is her only interest in her family concept. Four dastard criminals are chasing her, but she defeats them with a toolbox, which seems to be Batman's service belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that annoying. The gang of criminals is formed from the beloved clichés of American films, where African American, Chinese American, and Latin American must be politically correct with the American lord. Kim Basinger has a decent game, but their children are too young for a fifty-five year old woman. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Enquanto Ela Está Fora” (“While it was not there”)
