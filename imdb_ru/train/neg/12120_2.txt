In what could have been otherwise, the mill, a mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties (a subtle period of “free love”), the creators of this film piled on a ridiculous script behind a ridiculous script and complete all this tritely cherry endings I have never felt sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their hectic life without the cares of the middle class, as well as to the exhausted Lie Sriber. The storyline slowly unfolds to its predictable, pitiful conclusion, and the only thing that is interesting and watchable in this film is stunning topless Diane Lane. Here's a hint, it happens 30 minutes after the beginning of the movie. Go to this part and skip the rest.
