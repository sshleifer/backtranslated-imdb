Sometimes the movie is so terrible that it has a devastating effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that standards are so terribly low? Can they honestly expect us to endure so many clich√©s and still be entertained? <br /> <br /> Of course, the Hollywood prop is still to turn GUN into the protagonist, the plot device and the source of conflict and resolution in the films. The character needs a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do this because he has a gun. Put the gun first. Oh my god, what are we going to do? He has a gun! He waves at him, behaving more viciously than real people. He pushes it on someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting out questions. A distinctive feature of any output will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> This is a real problem to make such a tired, battered formula work again; the film must be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. He has no life and no personality, and he will suck these components from YOU. it makes you feel MORE about the life in time and space that you do. Indeed, who needs it!? So yes, I will say this: I think this is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. Anyone who participated in the creation of this mediocre trash that kills the soul should be publicly embarrassed at the disservice they have rendered us all.
