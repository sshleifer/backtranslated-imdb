While I completely disagree with one reviewer who described Charlie Chase as unfunny, in this film he certainly is. This is a shame, as I suspect that another reviewer must have seen only a few failures of Charlie Chase and suggested that the guy was not funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and what's the price is good? These are very good Chase films, so it CAN be very funny, considering the good stuff. Unfortunately, in this film he was given absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the usually good Oliver Hardy as a foil does not help, because the basic premise (the boy wants to marry the girl, but the girl’s father thinks the boy is insane), and the gags are so poor. It's a shame, because I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those who are used to looking at Charlie since the mid-1920s, you will be very surprised as Chase goes in for sports without glasses and a mustache - and doesn’t look like you expect.
