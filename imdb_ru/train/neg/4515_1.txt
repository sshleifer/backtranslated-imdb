"Piece is Cake" is a worst-class, defeatist revisionist story whose sole purpose is to unfairly invalidate the (supposedly fictional) pilots it portrays. This left a surprisingly unpleasant taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> In the March 1989 Monthly Plane, Roland Beamont strongly condemned the way the command of RAF fighters was portrayed in a television mini-series. Several of his comments deserve to be repeated: <br /> <br /> “None of the squadrons I saw in action had any sense of defeatism, and the complete absence of rudeness depicted in Part Cake. This would not have been allowed for a moment ... ... The atmosphere was more similar to the atmosphere of a good rugby club, although with more discipline. There was no feeling of "death or glory." RAF Scientists insisted that we were there to protect this country, and now we had to do it - no more and no less. <br /> <br /> “There was no talk of“ courage ”or“ cowardice. ” People either had courage or not - but mostly they had. But we knew fear, recognized it in ourselves and in each other, did our best to cope with it, and then got to work ... <br /> <br /> "... I did not feel any" glory " , but there was a sense of grandeur, and none of this had the slightest resemblance to a “piece of cake.” <br /> <br /> Beemonte was, in his own words, “a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer recent TV series, was there at the time. " <br /> <br /> Beamont served in the 87th Squadron both in France and in BoB, before becoming one of the main representatives of both Typhoon and Storm and the post-war test pilot. <br /> <br /> A slice of cake is an absolute, total distortion of the way pilots acted in the Fighter Command. This is nothing but a complete and complete shame ...
