As a rule, terrible garbage from director Fred Olena Ray about a female cyborg hunter (Teagan), who, on behalf of warden Jan-Michael Vincent, managed to find and execute the escaped alien criminal Criminal Ross Hagen, who charted a course to the ground. Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of nasty guys from college led by annoying Richard Wiley, who moved Hagen with his RV. Soon, the cyborg shoots a laser into his hand, burning one innocent alcoholic Doctor (Robert Quarry from Yorg-Vampire Count), proving that no one will stand in the way of searching for the skin of a convict whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body. Lo finds an ally in Leo Gordone, an old Vietnam vet who has too many weapons hidden in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps terribly deliberately made, this is what rancid movie fans aspire to ... terrible feature effects, actions and prerequisites. At least in the film there is PJ Soles for eye candy ... even in '89, it was rather smoky. " This laser gun is, of course, funny ... it can burn some at home, but when a cyborg shoots Lo, it barely leaves a mark on the shot.
