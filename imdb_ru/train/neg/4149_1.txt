Dear me Where do I start? Dad is not so grown up to be a girl's dad. He corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The favorite exclamation in this film is “Jesus Christ !!!”. Zombies are agile, stupid and few. Motives are completely incomprehensible, and the story does not exist. People rush to their destination in jeeps at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The world seems to continue to live as usual, but it must be the last days. Breast appears for the sake of the chest. Usually such an approach would provide some ransom, but the rest of the film actually made me disinterested about the chest or the future of humanity. There is a dog for no reason and a thin, orange blood that turns the belly. The General and his catchphrase "Shut up!" This is the only redemption function. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they did a decent thing and killed themselves.
