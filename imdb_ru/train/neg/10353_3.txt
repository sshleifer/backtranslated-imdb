I never read the book "The wrinkle in time". To be completely honest, after watching the movie, do I really want to? Well, I should not revisit this film, I will start with that. Further, I will say that the television film is quite easily forgotten. Do you know why I say that? Because I forgot what happens in it. I told you that it was forgotten. Honestly, no television movie will ever be better than Merlin. <br /> <br /> How to describe a television movie? I have never written a review for one before. Well, I'll just say that they usually have some celebrities. The wrinkle in time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> There are funny special effects in the film, a slightly interesting plot, scenes that make you go on stage "WTF". The film is incredibly bad, and it makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? This is a television movie. They are usually not good. Like this one. Wrinkles in time - a waste of time and a great waste of time. To top it off, you will most likely forget about it as soon as it ends. Well, maybe not the second, it's all over. But within a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Wrinkle in time: * / ****
