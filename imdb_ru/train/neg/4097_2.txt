The bad news is that it is still terrible. I gave him 2, because sometimes this parody parody really seems funny. <br /> <br /> She is supposed to be better than Malwa, Zombie Kicker, and progress must be rewarded. Or maybe I drank heavily when I watched it and felt generous. Anyway, “2”. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it all ended up pretty quickly. He takes the elements from most of the Kill Bill I and II key themes and battle scenes, hacks them, silences them, pollutes the dialogue and turns the whole mess into an hour of really awful amateur video. <br /> <br /> It’s best to smoke a lot of something strong if you want to enjoy it. And get this DVD back to the video store on time! You really hate yourself if you pay for a late fee.
