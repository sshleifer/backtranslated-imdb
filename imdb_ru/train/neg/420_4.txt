For those who would like to watch this movie? I would say: go! Without narration, it can be a very good film / documentary. But the music, the narration, and some of the realized plot lines make it very difficult to observe a skeptic like me. After several animals, their lives for several seasons, there is a feeling that we are observing animal soap. But the melodramatic point of view does not suit me; moreover, if the predator finally catches up with prey (one exception is left there), the camera zooms out or switches to another scene. I ask myself why this happens, if they were to show reality, why cut out scenes in which a melodramatic tale remains? I think that morality is important for the masses of the crowd, because in the end: to destroy this beautiful planet would be a waste.
