Sometimes the prerequisites start well, but because of the demands of going overboard to satisfy the demands of an audience suffering from attention deficit disorder, this becomes an irrelevant mess. And for three respected actors who have worked better before and after, this is a deadly shame. <br /> <br /> So let's see.

It was well done in "THE HAND", which pumps the cradle and the single white woman, and this is a proven ticket to a successful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now there is a dilemma. Create a disturbing story that really annoys you to bring a real threat to your main characters, and at the same time never go so far as to look ridiculous, or throw some semblance of reality, increase the shock factor and make this cop so extreme - a very bad variation any other supervillain who has hit theaters since the days of silence. <br /> <br /> The producers and directors chose the latter. Thus, the film turns out to be poorly filmed, with actors who try their best to make heads or tails in the roles they have already written before, and nothing is even less so.
