I watched this movie with a few friends a couple of months ago, I still laugh, thinking about some kind of nonsense. The first few scenes were fun. I will not spoil anything for those who want to see it, I would not want to spoil the laughter. Needless to say, all the time while I watched this film, I tried to understand exactly what the meaning of everything that the characters of this film did. However, by the end we all got bored, because the initial gaiety and shock from the fact that the film was so random had passed. There is no plot, no trace of a decent game. Characters are about as well developed as in the book Learning to Read in kindergarten. They even managed to make the scene of lesbian sex uninteresting.
