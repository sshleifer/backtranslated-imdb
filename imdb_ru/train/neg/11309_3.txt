A bad plot (albeit a good one for a B-movie), good dynamic fighting scenes, maximum 5 out of 10. But something always bothered me in this film: why did Mariska Hargitay never speak? In the television version, she tells Jeff Speakman a few intimate moments, even a kiss in the garden. And yet, in the normal (video) version, most of her scenes are cut, and she never speaks at all. It bothers me, because it not only removes the female (albeit stamped) point of view on the film, but also makes the last shot creepy. This film would be better if they kept her scenes, because at least in these scenes she has a personality that undermines everything Speakman says.
