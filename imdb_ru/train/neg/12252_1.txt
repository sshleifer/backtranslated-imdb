** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is one BAD movie. Seriously. Acting in absolutely terrible, fx terrible, and the plot down is terrible. But hey, it's so bad it's fun to watch! The script is so bad that it's nice! You just have to wrinkle and laugh at such lines as "I think this is what you call CROCTEASING." how women shine their breasts in a crocodile. I mean, it's funny because it's so bad! He has such horrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while it gets too big as the film turns into crap. I really started to fall asleep. Believe me, although the plastic crocodile leg on the leaves and the constant strokes of the tail of the shard hold you well for a long time. Although I have to say that he had one cool role when a crocodile tore this guy in half, and he just hanged himself there, trying to figure out what to do. Hehe, pointless movie that should be nominated for the MST3K line !!
