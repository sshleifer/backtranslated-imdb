Here is another blasphemous European history in which they destroy the religion of their country. (These atheist filmmakers are ruthless.) Here we see a violent explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not a Catholic). <br /> <br /> This victory actually won an Oscar for best foreign film. This is probably because the story made Catholics and religious beliefs in general look extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest, and he cares more about food than about anything else. He is depicted as an idiot. No wonder that the Academy, which is dominated by secular people, loved this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is some stupid fool who plays a guy who refuses his religion to marry one of the four daughters shown in this story. The daughters take turns luring the student to the “seminary” (who claims to have studied for six years, but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous is this movie ?? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and another great example of secular-progressive film bigotry around the world (not just in Hollywood).
