This movie is terrible. FEARFULLY. One of the worst films ever. I can not even imagine that Jill was worse than this. Previews made us say “NO”, but then, looking for something among the sunken ones right now, we decided to go ahead and give it a chance. <br /> <br /> Stupid US. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. He is an image and may look good with explosions, but not even the one that Bruce Willis got in Die Hard. If he took off his shirt and ran, fighting the bad guys, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> Catherine O'Hara had the best part - she’s always good. Gandolfini again fails (if it were not for the Sopranos, they would have washed him), as he did in Mexican. <br /> <br /> Affleck wanders through all the scenes and, as others said, without a character, he has any motivation for his actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS.
