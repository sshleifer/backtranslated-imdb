Others have already commented on the “decline” of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was fully capable of choosing good projects (as he proved by playing a major role in Exorcist III of the same year), so why did he agree to appear in this? Sure, he gives an appropriately crazy job, and the film is not completely bad; it's just uninteresting, uninteresting and unattractive. These are three "un-" too many. (* 1/2)
