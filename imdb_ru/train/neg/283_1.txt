For the film, this film seemed to me one of those after school events, only with a smaller budget and less of the rest. I think it was supposed to be some kind of inspirational film, but it didn't help me. since preachy.it has very pale shades of flash dance, so what? there is simply no excitement in this film. the dialogue is invented and polished to death. Of course, the whole film feels like a bad 80s cliche. The acting was less than stellar, although this is largely due to what the actors were given (or, in this case, not) to work. In addition, this is a bad choice of songs with very bad lyrics. all actors involved. they are all talented, but you cannot tell from this film. This, of course, is my opinion, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe 1/10
