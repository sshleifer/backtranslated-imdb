... then they will have a suitable place to feed this shit. Sorry, this is not a “mystery”, allegedly a religious idiot. I kept waiting for the “unimaginable evil” that was promised to me, but the “evil” in this film would be unimaginable only for a five-year-old child with learning disabilities. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that they actually managed to find better-known actors who wanted to take part in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, this changed my opinion about them forever, and I will probably avoid everything they do in the future. I am also a little discouraged by the fact that now I have the name of a writer and the name of a director who need to be remembered, since now I will avoid everything they do, such as the plague. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all religious fanatics who write here and say that this film is 10 out of 10, etc., will first publish their reviews. This can lead to the fact that more people, like me, will be deceived, believing that this film was something other than a religious sermon. <br /> <br /> Well, now I'm going to the video store to get my money back for false advertising. It’s a pity that they cannot give me back the 105 minutes I wasted watching the thought that this is actually a Hollywood horror film / supernatural.
