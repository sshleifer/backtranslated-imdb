In childhood, my friends and I believed that Gymkata was the most violent, bloody film ever made. I'm not sure who started this rumor. He was probably born because of the disappointment of 10-year-old children who were not allowed to see him for one reason or another. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a multi-year cable movie late in the evening, and as a result I was able to catch up on the lost time. I must have seen scenes from this horrible excuse for a film more than a dozen times, and I can always determine it by 1-2 seconds of screen time. However, in addition to the forced combination of gymnastics and martial arts, poor duplication, hard dialogue and an incredibly complex storyline, the film has something for this. With all that is bad in the film visually, the sound is actually quite interesting. Never before have punches and kicks been struck with such a small force and loudness! The preserved sounds of kung fu are impertinent, but slow and subdued music and the almost 5-minute slow motion scene are really strange. The chase around the city of crazy, bloodthirsty villagers is actually not so much intense as annoying, and there are enough bad wigs and extras who just look at the camera and wave to make this train wreck a little pleasure, Can it become a cult classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
