A few years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother had a policy that a man must pay to choose a film. And, although I would never have paid to see some sort of nonsense into which I was led, I could not resist a free trip to the cinema! That's how I came to look at shit, like the second film about Conan, and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN! Now, despite the fact that this is a miserable movie, it is interesting to watch it in places - in a crazy way. And, technically, tricks and camera work are good, so it raises my rating up to 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first film about Rambo, this film has almost no plot, Rambo himself speaks only 3 words (except grunting and screaming), there is an unnecessary and completely inappropriate and undeveloped “romance”, and the film is one giant (and dull) special effect. And what are VERY HORRIBLE special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets shoot Rambo, none of them have any effect on him, and almost every Rambo bullet or arrow shoots at the target! And, while the bad guys use the AK-47, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes Rambo only had a bow and arrows with nuclear tips !! The scene where one bad guy shoots him when he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows, especially made for dumb viewers! It was wonderfully parodied in the lead role with UHF with Weird Al. In addition, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a funny parody of the genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is so stupid and meaningless, it is almost like self parody!
