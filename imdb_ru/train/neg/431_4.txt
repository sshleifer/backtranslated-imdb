Admittedly, I find Al Pacino a guilty pleasure. He was an excellent actor before the smell of a woman, where he clearly overdosed himself irreparably. I was hoping that this film, about which I heard almost nothing, would be a sweet gem. Overlooked, ahead of its time, an intellectual and fascinating urban political thriller. This is not true. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a film that obscures its plot with so many characters, names and “realistic” citywide problems, that for a while you think that its plot is so wide and important that as soon as you find out the truth, it will blow your mind. In truth, however, these plots and deviations ultimately lead to rather tame and very familiar urban historical trademarks, such as “Corruption of power”, “Two-faced politicians”, “Mafia with police links”, etc. fear that none of the characters are safe and anything can happen! But then again, this is really not the case. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only thing that happens is quite predictable, and we have a few “confessional” monologues, which are generally intended to form a modern kind of fable, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the “real world” of politics and society . But after 110 minutes of names and missed messages and a web of lies and concealments, the audience usually receives a somewhat satisfactory disclosure. I don’t think we’ve stayed at the City Hall with this, and although this is a very full film, I don’t find it altogether rich.
