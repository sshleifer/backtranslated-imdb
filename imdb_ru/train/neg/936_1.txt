I do not understand people. Why this movie gets 8.3 !!!!!! ???? I had high hopes for this film, but as soon as I worked for about half an hour, I just wanted to leave the theater. In the overwhelming majority of reviews on this site, people say that this is one of the best militants that they have seen (or summer, year, etc.). They say this is a great conclusion. WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? What was done (apart from the fact that Born can ride motorcycles, shoot and fight better than anyone else he encounters)? What do you learn about the Bourne character in this movie ????????? Absolutely f ****** nothing !!!!!!! Well, there is a lot of action, but what is so good about this movie? I do not like cinematography and film editing. The wobbly effect of the camera and the rapidly changing pictures were used TOO TOO, and they quickly grow old (I did not object to them in “Excellence” because it was still easy to follow him and did not use it in excess), and I was dizzy. I really wanted me to save my $$$ for something else. <br /> <br /> There is no plot in this movie. This entire film is a 115 minute chase. Born, about whom you know absolutely nothing in all 115 minutes of the film, is a perfectionist in everything he tries. In this film, there is absolutely no character development, you do not know about anyone, and in this part a wide range of new characters is presented. Some people said that this film has an incredible spelling and suspense. ??????????? !!!!!!!! What is the spelling ???? What is the wait ??? There is no waiting. Bourne is so perfect in doing everything he does, I don't think he has anything to worry about. If this is the best movie of 2007, I can just stop watching movies completely !!!! <br /> <br /> Many people also said that Matt Damon’s performance in this film is one of the best (if not the best) in his career. What are the indicators ?? How many lines did he have in this movie ??? I have some respect for Damon because he acted in films that I liked and played different characters, but a good actor is someone who can hardly be learned from one film to another, who chooses different types of roles. Not the one who plays the same roles over and over again (and Damon does not, but an example of who plays is Vin Diesel). <br /> <br /> In any case, this film was a big disappointment for me. I don't recommend this film, but I recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy), and I definitely recommend reading three books (which are very different from movies).
