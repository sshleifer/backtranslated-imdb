I don't know why the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal's films, but I watch them, because, no matter how stupid they are, at least they are always good for laughs. Why do you rate this movie as 1 out of 10, based on duplication, when exactly such things make a film like this a cult favorite, over which you can laugh at nonsense? <br /> <br /> “The Power of Attack” is not a great film, but I felt that it was as worthy of Steven Seagal's car as many of his other films; in fact, I did not think it was one of his worst in the long run. In most cases, it was a semi-connected storyline, and in most cases it was exciting. The ending really sucks, but even there were some unpleasant elements. In the end, the story itself did not bring what it promised, but I actually thought that the action, the characteristic (if I can use such a big word) and the rest of the production values ​​gave exactly what Steven Seagal's true fan expected. In particular, Seagal himself was just that stone-faced man who, as we used to expect, was a man, and the rest of the cast supported him quite well, not even pushing him. This, people, is what makes Stephen Segal's film. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
