This movie is really terrible, sweetie, in which Ben plays, can compensate for everything else that is wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Writer / director / producer / lead actor, etc. It’s probably a good idea to create a film about important issues of same-sex marriage, family recognition, religion, homophobia, hate crimes, and almost all problems affecting gays of the time, but trying to squeeze every problem into such a badly thought-out film has little justice for any of these reasons. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the casting is very ordinary, but the dialogue and actions are terrible. The homosexual brothers play the camp actor himself, and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two leading actors (I think I saw more passion in cornflakes advertising). The game is tough and dialogue is imposed (the scene where the brother feeds the detective, his lines were the highlight). <br /> <br /> It is just nice for me to see that the creator of this train wreck did not push any other garbage into distribution, and if he thinks about it, I have a few tips - just don’t do it.
