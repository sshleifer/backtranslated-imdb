In fact, this film, made in 1999, has a fairly good production performance. Actors are attractive and talented enough. There are not many clowns running around, flying hundreds of rounds, but never hitting the flesh. Also, there are no wild car chases / accidents when thousands of cars worth thousands of dollars are thrown away uselessly. <br /> <br /> The interiors look quite modern, architectural, and the equipment looks like tobacco. Well, there is this high-tech computer room, decorated with something similar to the remains of an electronics lab in the 50s. And the pancake makeup on the corpses infuriated me. Not pancake cosmetics in the conventional sense of the word, but something that looks like a dry batter for pancakes, spread on open skin. This is supposed to confirm the idea that the bodies were calcined, although how the virus will perform this transmutation is an exercise left to the student (the viewer). <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the worst prerequisite for a sci-fi horror film, which I know but cannot. A computer virus that is transmitted through the TV screen (or computer monitor) and becomes a deadly biological pathogen? Let me rest. Warp drive a la Star Trek is one thing, and photons are becoming viruses? It is so stupid that the desired “fear factor” is simply not feasible. The film could have used one of those horrific dream sequences where the dead come to life, or make the cat jump out of the closet, or something like that, because viral gadget doesn't do that. <br /> <br /> We can assume that Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this madness that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, dirty venues. He needed money. However, no other comparison between them should be interpreted.
