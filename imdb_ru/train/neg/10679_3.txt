I did not expect the film to be as good as “In The Line of Fire” or the episode “24”, but it looks like this film was made for television and at best performs mediocre work. The (good) cast could not disguise the fact that the plot was too predictable, and the actors had to go out of their way (I think they really try their best) to present their bad scripts, giving their rather flat characters any additional opportunities. When I watched the movie, I had the feeling that I saw it in other (best) films. There were car chases, big shootouts, romance, plot twists, etc.; There is not one in this film. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see how another woman talks on the phone with a Cuba character, you know who is behind all this and all the clues you are given ("you are standing too close to the president, you see it from my point of view .. ") sounds silly. <br /> <br /> If it depended on me (and perhaps it’s good that it isn’t), I would rewrite the plot like this: <br /> <br /> The first lady orders her husband to be killed, because that she was tired of constantly writing checks to Cuba.
