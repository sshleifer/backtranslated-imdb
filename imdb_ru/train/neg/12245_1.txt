Why, oh why! ... did I pick this up? Okay ... I needed it lightly in the summer heat, and the cover looked cool. <br /> <br /> Of course, I should have known better. This is a really bad movie. And it becomes embarrassing when the creators know that this is bad, and try to hide it by adding a few sexy / beautiful women and some sex scenes. Well, guys ... it doesn't cut back, does it! <br /> <br /> If you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very, very good, well played and fun: go rent Lake Placid! (this is an order)
