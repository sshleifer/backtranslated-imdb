RINGMASTER star plays Jerry Springer as the host of a TV show called Jerry, but this is not the "JERRY SPRINGER SHOW", his guests are the trailer, not the trailer that you get on the "Jerry Springer SHOW", they attack each other, but not like on ..... What is the point of making a film about Jerry Springerâ€™s show and pretending that this is not a Jerry Springer show? And on top of that, it's a very boring movie.
