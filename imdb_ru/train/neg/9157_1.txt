Your first clue that this is a stupid movie is that it was filmed on video and not on the movie. The story is tangled, and the production is strikingly sloppy. Note, for example, that when a couple is on a plane that allegedly landed in Vermont, where they went to celebrate their relationship at a civil union ceremony, the plane shows up at the airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, which will not last five minutes in the climate of New England. On another plane trip, the picture shows a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably, they could only afford to travel on the steering wheel. As for the plot, in this film you expect you to believe that Victor, the sincerely Christian brother of Arthur, was expelled from his church when the meeting learned that his TAKE was gay. Moreover, the pastor eventually assigns Victor a hired assassin to kill Ben and Arthur, “in order to cleanse their souls from sin.” Obviously, no one in this church had ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If it were not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective like Arthur, this film would not have any redemptive qualities at all.
