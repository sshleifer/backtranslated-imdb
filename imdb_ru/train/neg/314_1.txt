I bought this movie for $ 5 at a bookstore with discounts, Adam Sandler is a terrific actor, and I thought it would be a good movie, well, it’s not. Absolutely there was no storyline, bad jokes, and the other comedian uttered the “F-Word” every other word he uttered, the curse did not usually bother me, but that was too much. And even worse than the lack of a storyline, there were parts when Sandler just started talking into the camera in random parts of the film; he reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn, look at the screen and ask you questions. And finally, when in the film they randomly insert pictures of girls in a bikini. In my opinion, do not buy this film, it is a waste of money
