First of all, leadership, Brad Dourif - KUK. If you are trying to take this film seriously, then I guarantee that it will spoil it for you. If you don’t take him too seriously, it’s actually fun to watch. As in the case of another reviewer, I liked the scene in which Lisa (Cynthia Bane) and Dourif declare their love for each other - between how to dodge the streams of flame escaping from his hand in the car. Another great scene in the style of campi is watching John Landis when the producer of radio shows hits the room. In fact, I discovered that the last 15 minutes of the film were a nonstop ridiculous rebellion - I'm just not sure that Tob Hooper wanted it to be that way.
