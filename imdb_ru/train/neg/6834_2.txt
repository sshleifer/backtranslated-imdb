Gee, damn it, movie! ... I said that I want to become a specialist in bad films from all decades, so I decided to start with this. It was a fairly adequate choice. I went into this adventure to find lost gems and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I did not see anything like this in this pastel mess. I really haven't watched a lot of bad movies before, but I have a feeling that this is something called “so bad, so good,” maybe because it's so unintentionally damn funny! First of all, there are inaccuracies. There are inaccuracies associated with the plot, physical inaccuracies, as well as psychological inaccuracies. The latter, in particular, are as insane as Van Damme's asses in this blue spandex. There are also very sticky lines, and I’m not even going to talk about some fun activities. There is nothing wrong with playing everyone involved in this hot movie mess, except for one particular case. Jeffrey Lewis looks completely pompous, like Frank, a completely stupid character. And, frankly, I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a great job with the role of the twins. He managed to achieve a different tone and mood in two roles that were convincing for me. But the film was mostly very bad, and the sad part is that it was filmed by a large film studio ... which has now gone bankrupt.
