This film is too skeletal. This is a rather low-budget film (I hope!), Which somewhat justifies it, but the lack of a decent cast and thoughtful plot hurts him too much. Phillips is quite plausible in his role as the torn-up son of a wealthy family who is looking for himself (although his family ... uh ... well, a little too white ...), but the rest of the cast grabs the straw. Every moment that has potential collapses due to excessive melodrama, and there are too many sub-plots (which is an obvious sign of a plot deficit. They need a filler ...). I would not recommend this film to anyone who I am not a Phillips fan, and he has absolutely nothing to do. 4/10.
