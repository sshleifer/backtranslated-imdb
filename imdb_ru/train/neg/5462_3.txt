This program is calling me! There is no humor in it, and he is too serious to call it “fun”! This is too educational for my taste! Characters are very stereotypical and unappealing. Plots are superfluous, and the moral is simply repeated again and again. Where is the fun? I also feel that this has been on the BBC for too long and too much broadcast. Do you really need to have a T.V slot every 2 or 3 months when the new show ends with episodes? I think the time has come when the BBC begins to return some of its older shows, such as Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorks, Muminas, Raccoons and Graf Daccula, but not constantly signing contracts with these new shows! I thought the BBC would return Danger Mouse, so what happens to this ?! 3/10
