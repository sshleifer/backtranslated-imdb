This film, though supposedly a comedy, is deadly serious. His theme is imperialism (with a capital letter): how Britain stupidly and humiliatingly tries to convince itself that it remains a great power after the Second World War. At home, the Empire is ruled by friendly assholes, benevolent Tories who are so divorced that they cannot distinguish close relatives; Government offices consist of long-forgotten archives (excavations of Orwellian paranoia?), Inhabited by lazy rats, and hallways in which synakura are boring, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Abroad, Britain clings to the old pump; but pomp out of context looks worn and stupid, especially when it is embodied in awkward guys. “Carlton-Brown” is an unsentimental picture of decline, in which there is no tear rot that darkened the supposedly anti-imperialist pearl in the crown. <br /> <br /> The film also tells about the “cold war”, boldly recognizing that this is a dangerous farce, whose members deserve bullying and contempt, and not fear and respect. It is about how colonialism, characterized by disdain rather than tyranny, destroys the colonies that it leaves, depriving them of comfort, power and, most importantly, self-esteem, leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys. <br /> <br /> This is seriousness, of course, it kills. This does not mean that in a comedy it is impossible to shoot weighty items - "The Miracle of Morgan Creek", "Doctor Strangelove" and "The Life of Brian" proved it. Indeed, we can assume that serious topics should be treated only with the help of comedy - this allows us to get a clearer idea. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlton-Brown is that every situation must have a meaning that goes beyond the merely comic, so that it becomes burdened and unfunny. In the three films mentioned above, most of the comedy arises because of the character's reaction to an extreme situation, and not to the extreme situation itself. Here the script is too poor to bear the rich comic features, and some of the greatest comedic talents ever collected - Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntly and John le Mesouriere - are criminally squandered. <br /> <br /> Terry-Thomas, exalted so often, shows that he could not cope with leading roles, and that he needed to play mocking, arrogant robbers, and not mindless conversations. The music is made to carry most of the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of fun on the screen. (To be fair, unlike most British comedies of that period, which were staged and under-produced, “Boulting” is often tried to express their point of view through the film itself, using editing and composition) Only Huntley manages to cause sincere laughter, and by writing an essay character that he could play in a dream. <br /> <br /> None of Bowling's farces is outdated well — they never think enough. Although Carleton-Brown revels in the decline of the Empire, he also looks anti-democratic and militaristic. I’m sure this wasn’t intended, but these blunders are bound to happen if you let your worthy intentions take precedence over comic intelligence and film form.
