A terrible movie made on a budget of about 9.99 dollars. They used very obvious miniature sets, a bad game and a terrible storyline about aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spacecraft. The film contains some blood (not enough to bother her) and a character who replaces one of the hands by beating an egg. (Yes, you read that right.) <br /> <br /> One saving grace was a song performed at a “talent show” (as is, ironically?) The punk / new wave band, which I think was called “ I "I'm looking for a heat rocket." Other than that, it's not worth your time, even at the level of "so bad, it's good." See if you're in other people's movies, but someone else has to stay away. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 of 10
