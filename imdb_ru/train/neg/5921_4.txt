What exactly happened during the 11th World War in New Zealand, when American troops were there? <br /> <br /> This horrible story about 4 sisters was really pathetic. Can you imagine the role of Joan Fontaine as the elder sister of Sandra Dee? Fontaine was more like his mother. Even more fun was the fact that Fontaine became pregnant in this film. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who showed such wonderful chemistry on the screen 4 years later in Hastler, do not have scenes together in this film. Laurie plays another sister who leaves for Wellington to roam there, despite the fact that she is married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. <br /> <br /> Gene Simmons was widowed and found an affair with the very depressed Paul Newman. There is even a romance for young Miss Dee. <br /> <br /> Snapshot means almost nothing. Are they trying to say that everything is fair in love and war? If so, they did a bad job selling it. <br /> <br /> Conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly resolved. That was what needed to be done quickly with this horribly disappointing 1957 film.
