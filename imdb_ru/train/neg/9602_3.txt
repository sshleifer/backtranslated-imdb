Daniella has some problems with her attractive appearance. She begins to go mad when she finds out about a distant relative (whom she looks like), who was burned for being a werewolf. She gets a little wild when she throws off excited men and cuts their throats. In the end, she finds a man who helps to contain her inner beast, but when others destroy their bliss, she extracts her cruel and fluffy revenge. <br /> <br /> “Woman Werewolf” is not a very stupid movie, but it looks like a good crowd movie. Fun time could be spent suppressing a bad game / dubbing / translation and just a simple game. But by itself, it moves slowly, but has enough nudity to keep you awake.
