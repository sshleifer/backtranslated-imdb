I just sat in the theater bored as hell, I wanted to leave halfway through the movie. The plot is simple: 4 Samoan guys spoil the wedding. Therefore, they must bring dates to get to the wedding. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The so-called rude jokes annoyed me the most ... They were very unweighted, ridiculous and thrown into your face to make you fall into an already boring movie. The acting was below average, and I felt that this film just continued and unfolds only about a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the worst films I have ever seen in 2006 is funny, plays badly, is simply ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank God, a friend shouted to me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
