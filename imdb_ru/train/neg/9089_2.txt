The film has only one flaw, unfortunately, this flaw undermines the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> It begins with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of the disputed territories. This is not able to eliminate the cause of the Israelis. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That is why Israel is "occupying" their land, because these countries lost it in the war they started. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel challenged the UN without fulfilling Resolution 242. The problem is that 242 was rejected right after its creation ..... by the Palestinians, which made it invalid. <br /> <br /> Many films are put together and can really show frames that change their mind, but remember, when watching something, do not believe what you hear, but only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All the participants in this film are well-known critics of Israel, and some expressed many anti-Semitic public comments, removing any possible trust in their words. . <br /> <br /> All participants are in dire need of a real history lesson that is taught objectively, and not by some Palestinian sympathizer.
