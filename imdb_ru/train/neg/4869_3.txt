This film could not explore the humanity of animals, which left me with a feeling of emptiness inside. [Spoiler Ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D. really had a good reason to refuse a large ransom deal to help his furry friends. While Babe (the original) opposed the trend of hits with a large budget, focusing on the human merits of animals compared to their human counterparts, all of the animals in this film were nothing more than funny caricatures that could gladly be put into a meat grinder ( especially if it were possible to understand their meaningless chatter). Without Eddie Murphy's insane behavior, this film would be a failure.
