I like character based films. I also think that Hope Davis is always doing a good job, so I have high hopes for this film. These hopes were soon realized. <br /> <br /> The main disadvantage of this film is the direction. There are many scenes that are sequences of dreams. The film often uses Denis Leary as the alter ego of Campbell Scott's character. This does not work for me at all. It would work better than the game. <br /> <br /> There are problems with the plot. It is important that the characters of the film go on a journey and find themselves in a place different from the one from which they started. I did not feel that the characters grew up in the experience described in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, editing was not done well either. In the middle of the film was a very big failure, which was extremely boring. <br /> <br /> With the exception of acting, which I felt was always strong, this film failed in almost all aspects of the movie.
