This film is a great example of the recent harvest of horror films, which are simply not fully realized. There are two ways to do horror movies: either you don’t really explain what happens (or who the killer is like in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre), or give the characters a lot of background and characteristics to explain everything (Halloween can be an example of this). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Creep fails in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give a small piece of Craig's story without a full understanding of the essence of his character or his motivation. Not a single character is fully realized, although the circular nature of Kate’s character in the film is the most perfect part of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, this story is largely unmotivated, and none of the ideas gives it the necessary life to make it fascinating or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film production, which delay the film. <br /> <br /> This movie will go down in history as another example of a movie (like most of them) it can be much better, even if it will never be great. The only thing that was properly used in the film was the setting: the characters, the story, the direction and the overall writing would benefit from a serious face lift. <br /> <br /> Creep does serve a meaningless purpose, a stupid horror movie with no intellectual or emotional attachments, but unfortunately, that's all ...
