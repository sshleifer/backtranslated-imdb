Who likes horrible comedy shows like the Little Mosque on the prairie? I can only think of two types of people who watch it: one, Muslims and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of each ethnic group, who are so excited that there is a perception of Muslims that it doesn't even matter whether this is a good show or not funny at all So). Two, old people and people whose idea of ​​a comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, stale jokes. <br /> <br /> CBC needs to really look at what they do and who their audience is. If they continue to write comedies only for really old people, guess what happens, their audience will die soon, and they won't have a single audience left. I would be curious who writes for this show at all? Do you think this is actually Muslims, or fashionable, fun young people? No, I bet they are old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same type of bad CBC shows since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you watch the CBC comedy show, Air Farce was only finally finally taken off the air (thank God!), but we still have lame ducks, such as "This hour has 22 minutes ”and“ Rick Mercer ”for which we pay, not to mention this bad excuse for the“ comedy ”of the Little Mosque in the Prairie. Does it have to be insulting and funny? Only CBC thinks that this shit show is generally offensive or ridiculous. It's a shame CBC for squandering our tax dollars at shows, only a few people would bother to watch.
