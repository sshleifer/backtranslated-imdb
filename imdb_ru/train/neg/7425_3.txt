This tedious, grueling film about robbing a casino in Las Vegas is almost impossible to watch and take part in. This is what you “look at” if you have absolutely nothing better. The only two decent things in this film are related to the gorgeous Stella Stevens, and one spends the entire program, hoping that she will fall out of one of those scant tops she wears. Lots of great Las Vegas shots from the mid-70s (when it was still a cool place to visit) and the fashion of the day are also good for giggling. Otherwise, one big yawn. The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen, but even at a price of less than 10 bucks, it’s still not worth it, in my humble opinion.
