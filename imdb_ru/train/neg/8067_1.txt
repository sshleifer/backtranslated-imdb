First let me say that this should be on the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean that nothing in this movie even remotely worried. Most of this is very confusing, and as you go, you just want it to end !! Some people want a movie that makes them think through everything I’m talking about ... “More power to you” !! I, on the other hand, just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this bitch, entertainment is not. This film is stupid and a complete waste of time. It seems that most here also agree. Most of this did not make any sense, and by the time you think that one scene is cleared up, another lame scene appears and ... well, I think you can see where it goes. Avoid this sucks .... bad !!
