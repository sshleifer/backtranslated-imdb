Something that I really like about this womanâ€™s short films is the elusiveness of the topic, especially in Living with Happiness. This film has a good start - an unusual location and potential for strange cinematic processing, but it fails to achieve awkward demonstrative dialogue, ambiguous speeches and very television coverage. <br /> <br /> This is again a charming television and a very ordinary cinema. Ideas are so realized that they almost feel like television advertising. But the mood is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would really like this director to do full-length animation and try to work with a producer who doesn't require such boring clarity.
