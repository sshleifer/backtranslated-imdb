There were more interesting Polish documentaries about breeding worms, in brail_ !! The competition (breeding worms) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically sick after watching this movie. A deceiving husband (I think that dougray_scott_) was a joke in every sense of the word. Poor Jennifer must really need a job, and that was with an accent !! Places and occasional meetings reminded me of pranks in high school, and showed the humility of a 10-year-old in the culinary class. It was so bad that I think I would write a sequel called “This is not laxative.” Thank you for listening, it was a great weight of my mind.
