This is very bad and awkward for Canadians. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. National Ballet is among the top five companies in the world. But we make horrible movies! This one is not particularly bad. This is especially typical and, as a rule, bad, filmed in two-star hotels and public parks with a subtle direction, acting at the high school level and "damn it ... let's see what this button does on the camera?" the photo. If Michael Moriarity was so tuned in to imitate Jack Nicholson, could he not at least make a GOOD imitation of Jack Nicholson? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, truly one of the most beautiful cities on earth, and also in the center of yacht building (part of the “plot”), then why, in the name of God, do we allow this endemic Canadian inferiority complex to dictate its disguise as Seattle? ?? Not only am I crazy about this movie, I’m confused and more than a little ashamed. Australians make great things. We produce fancy wine. Gawd !!!!!
