Well, if you saw The Ring, you basically saw The Grudge. He tries to be scary, just having a bizarre camera job and loud noises, but fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather leaky, for example, how did the care center learn that Yoko did not come to work when there were no people who lived in the house? And it's not at all clear what the character of Bill Pullman has to do with anything. He just appeared out of nowhere to advance the plot. It did not make much sense what happened to the original family. Who hung in the room, a little boy or dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her? There were too many unanswered questions, and I was too bored to think about it more.
