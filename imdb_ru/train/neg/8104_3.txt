Yes, a cheap shot, I know, but this film is an excellent example of how a collection of meaningful “depths” (political turmoil, love / lust) can be accidentally combined with a lot of critical acclaim (see also “American Beauty”). Kaufman's cine shots and useless sex scenes alternate with often painful dialogues (in one scene I counted three different “common European” accent influenced by actors) and state demonstrations can get out of control, but cannot tie them together in successive meditation Kundera Offered. and in his three long hours he manages to almost completely disguise the Frenchman, the missing fourth part in the love triangle that underlies the plot, and thus sacrifices the central mechanism of the novel, reflecting the spectrum of emotions and power relations that they acquire in love relationships. it also doesn’t even include the token-show time for the son of Thomas, used in the novel to illustrate some of the political moments Kundera made in the novel. In combination with excessive sound, these flaws make the three hours of this film unbearably weighty and light in content.
