As a rule, I have much more time than writing reviews, but I was so disappointed with this film that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just to take it off my chest. <br /> <br /> You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be an acceptable bet ... well, this movie was just awful. It is almost impossible to “suspend disbelief”; I tried, I really wanted to enjoy, but Justin Timberlake just wouldn't let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake must stick to music, what a terrible performance - NO presence as an actor, NO character. I can not blame Justin for everything: the film also boasts a terrible plot and an unsuccessful editing; This is definitely the letter "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I wonder what really motivates the actors. I mean, of course, Morgan did read the script before taking part. Didn't he see how poor it was? What then could have prompted him to take part? Money? Of course, at times acting depends more on who you see than on really high-quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; he gets a lot more time on screen than Freeman or Spacey in this film, and he really struggles to deal with the bad script. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, viewers say: “What the hell is going on here? Do you expect me to believe in this nonsense? ”<br /> <br /> In short, except for Justin, a great team has been executed - very disappointing.
