From time to time a film appears that knocks me down and reminds me that my taste in the films that I am looking for is not always perfect. Normally, I would stay away from such things, but I was fooled by some of the glowing reviews and Rohmer's lineage. <br /> <br /> In the production there is an initial and intriguing novelty, where Romer essentially imposes actors on the painted (digital) backgrounds of the revolution of the French era. It quickly decreases and becomes about as interesting as watching how the paint dries on the paint in the form of a scene of numbers. We are left with a boring and sultry film about aristocrats in France of the 18th century. None of the characters are attractive or sympathetic. The pace is so weak, the dialogue is so heavy, and the wait is clearly an alien concept for Romer, so I did not care at all about whose head was tumbling, who was harboring anyone, or what the devil was going to be a revolution. The film would greatly benefit from some semblance of emotional growth and musical score (at the very end, beautiful classical music is used). Despite the fact that he is so "talkative", the film is in many ways similar to a silent film, and the worst film is a boring and uninteresting film about endlessly interesting subjects. Only the most astute French historians will find anything to take from this film, as he seems to be drawing well-known events from a new angle (the Lady is English and royal). Otherwise, avoid this yawn at all costs, unless you suffer from insomnia (I dozed off twice).
