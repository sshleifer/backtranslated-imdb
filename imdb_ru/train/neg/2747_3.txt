I knew it would be like this, but I gave him a rent for laughter and, perhaps, thoughtless fun. Anyone who has read a few of my reviews can see that itâ€™s pretty easy to please me. I really did not think that in the end I would feel it negatively. <br /> <br /> The story of the ancient army of dragons led by a huge serpent that will destroy the world, if only some selected heroes can not inherit responsibility ?? become one with ?? good dragon ?? or something?? I dont know. It was so stupid that I did not bother to make a lot of effort to save it. <br /> <br /> There is a really stupid story in it, full of ridiculous moments and stupid concepts. Many events seemed completely random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I guess there was a studio intervention or something like that, because the biggest problem I encountered in the film is that the story seems like it is trying to be . grandiose and epic, but everything happens so fast and passes so quickly. I feel that I was just struck by a million plot points and sequences of actions in one big ball. The film is like a slap in the face. It does not take long to install characters or drama. Imagine the Lord of the Rings trilogy in 90 minutes ?? You could have most of the epic battles, but there would be no accumulation, and you would hardly care about the results of these battles. Was this the case with Dragon Wars ?? 90 minutes due to the fact that I did not give shit, waiting until it ends. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with good directing, but terrible play, brisk walking and a dull story made it very difficult to enjoy on any basis, I probably would have loved it when I was 6 years old.
