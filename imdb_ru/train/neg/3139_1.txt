Firstly, as a student of the Titanic disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't care how many awards and awards the film received, but for me it is still an absolutely horrible film. Cameron had the resources to make a “proper” semi-documentary film about the disaster, but, unfortunately, she decided to turn it into a romantic kashura with a hysterical face. The fact that so many people all over the world have fallen in love with him shows, in my opinion, the sad state of taste and common sense that film critics and viewers have these days. Who said that in all films the hero and heroine should fall in love? In fact, most of the real events are not at all romantic, and the Titanic disaster was definitely not like that. I feel that this requires a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as few artistic licenses as possible. I almost burst out in the last sequence, where the "dead" lovers meet among the other dead passengers and crew members who burst into applause. Is this a smart movie? Ask yourself.
