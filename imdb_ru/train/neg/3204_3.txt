Although not as bad as it was intended (I have seen MUCH worse), it is still a very flimsy film. In fact, this is Siegel's re-release in Coogan Bluff, the main difference of which is that Clint Eastwoodâ€™s hat has more charisma than Joe Don Baker, the unattractive actor, if any. <br /> <br /> However, Venantino Venantini is excellent (and very fun) like a bad guy, a kind of budget Vittorio Gassmann. He is the main reason to sit down through this steampile, as the rest of the cast delivers mostly a terrible game, especially a girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, it's hard to believe that he was once the romantic leader (see Mondo Cane to see how he escapes from women). It looks like Ben Gazzar's second echelon here, he has almost nothing to do. This is all Joe Don's show, unfortunately. And all this is connected with the general music of the 80s in the "action movie" genre, which cannot be more boring. <br /> <br /> Gradeon Clark can make good B-Movies ("Without warning"), but here he stumbles, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the places in Malta were good, and there is Venantini to try to save the day. 3/10.
