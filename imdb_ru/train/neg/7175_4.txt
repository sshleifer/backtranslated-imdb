Perhaps it was based on historical events, and we know that the creators of this television documentary drama allowed themselves to make it more dramatic - I can put up with it - but it was so badly done! In the case of the crisis unfolding in the air, I was amazed at how everyone looked calm, surely someone panicked, and what an even flight, without obvious discomfort for the passengers - come on! Not sure about the rules, nowadays some of the airline’s safety issues seem like OTT’s stupidity, but why take off your shoes before an emergency landing, common sense tells me that this is not a good idea! The pictures of this massive airliner descending onto this remote airstrip were inconclusive and counterfeit. In fact, it would have been a terrific sight, if viewed from the ground nearby, in this film it was not proportional and looked like a model, which it probably was. A roller coaster appeared on the front and middle emergency doors, but no one came out in front, although the fall was much smaller. After landing, the captain returned to the plane - why? it was never explained. We know that an emergency landing occurred due to a shortage of fuel, but even in this case, there must have been some fuel spilled around the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of an explosion must have been a very real danger, although evacuation seemed almost unhurried and everything They stand at the foot of the rescue slides, and do not go as far as possible, as I am sure I would do. There were too many inconsistencies, mistakes and false actions. I would prefer to see the performance of the drama in real time and with a realistic image of the plane. He had the potential to be quite exciting, but, undoubtedly, because of budgetary constraints, he failed, and it gave the feeling that the plane that lost all the engines does not pose a particular problem, and you will safely slide to some bumpy landing, but no. real danger! - the reality, of course, is somewhat different!
