There are only two films that I would give 1/10, this abomination and "The Man Who Fell to Earth." I remember seeing the protocol in the theater in the early 80s, when I was in high school. The script insults everyone (including the high school student). It completely lost me from the “ridiculous” gag of someone who was shot in the ass. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming, but she looks silly and weak-minded. Then there are offensive stereotypes about the Arabs, for whom Goldie defeats everyone, spewing populist dribbling. The game was terrible, including Goldie Hawn. I could not watch another movie in which it was until MMO redeemed itself in the film “Everyone says that I love you”. This is a movie that you make if you do not want to make an effort to write the script. The worst.
