The easiest way to describe this movie is satire. The goal of satire is quite extensive, from the US government to corporate America. It is also not a burning satyr, but rather a stupid one. <br /> <br /> Think of this movie as a connection between the film “Kentucky Freed”, the series “Airplane” and “Police Squad”, made with a much smaller budget, and not as ridiculous. I see how this film is a satire of many science fiction films about the disasters of the 50s and 60s. I see this film as a great influence on Mars Attack by Tim Burton. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Genetically modified giant tomatoes go crazy and start attacking people and cities. First there is a cover, and then it turns into a full-scale war. <br /> <br /> The film presents a range of characters and characteristics: Lois Fairchild (clone Lois Lane), a very ambitious president. Press Secretary Clark Kent, Mason Dickson (an FIA agent who has not worked since the days of the Gulf of Pigs), a useless president (who, it seems, can only sign his name and attack New York), even the inept Congress, the scruffy marketing and marketing director Mason's team consisting of an obese East German "woman" - a swimmer, a diver, an insane paratrooper of World War II, and an African-American disguise specialist (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler, and finally, under a tomato). I also forgot to mention a lot of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes: from small tomatoes to giant plastic tomatoes, to shredded tomatoes, to tomato juice and, finally, for people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> Besides all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well. They are not so good and seem duplicated. The best melody is definitely the theme of the film (“Attack of killer tomatoes”). This is too contagious, and you can sing or sing in public. Be careful. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is quite funny and shows the absurdity of various life situations, as well as various genres of entertainment. I do not believe that I was inclined to laugh, but mostly I smiled and scratched my head. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of B and C films, but only as a rental. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
