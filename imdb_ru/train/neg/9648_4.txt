In the past, Vipul Shah did a really impressive job as a director. "Waqt - race against time" and "Namaste London" were interesting and interesting to watch. Singh Is Kinng was funny, which he produced. His last performance as a director, "London Dreams" is the weakest in his career. <br /> <br /> London Dreams has a mediocre storyline, telling how success turns friendship into hatred. Granted, he has potential, but when you watch London Dreams, you wonder what's going on? This film may have the worst climax lately. Vipul Shah writer puts Vipul Shah director down. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the climax is terrible. How can you forgive a person who decided to destroy you? I will not Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask for forgiveness from his diaper, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reaches India, instead of slapping or mocking him, does Salman greet him with a baja group and say that he caused the whole fiasco? Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's character as GOD? If yes, then you completely failed. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that you would welcome the person who destroyed you with such a big reception? Write what you feel, do not deceive us {audience}, we are intelligent enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical, but the music of Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. No song remains in your memory. <br /> <br /> Salman is great. He carries the film on his shoulders and really, very well in emotional scenes. But again his character is shown by GOD, which ultimately makes him look like a mentally retarded person. Ajay is equally good, but Salman has completely eclipsed him. Asin wasted, and what a great talent, like Om Puri, does in this film? Ranvnjay Hams, although Aditya Roy Kapoor is superior. Brinda Pareh is fine, like vamp. <br /> <br /> In general, this dream remains a dream!
