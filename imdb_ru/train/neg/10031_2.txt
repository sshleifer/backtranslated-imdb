I just saw a movie in the theater. The film has very few good moments to talk about. Beauty Karina and a couple of songs can be. This is it. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the film will be disappointed, even the Mumbai Indians (only now Chennai reached the semi-finals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I have for the film is the fighting scenes. Now Bollywood is trying to copy the militants from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors have a strong influence on making it look like a real one. But, unfortunately, the Bollywood directors do not have much time. They spend time for the songs and the film's commercials. Now, such overly stupid action films can work in the south, because viewers simply pay to watch their favorite actor kill a bunch of people. But in Bollywood, it definitely does not work. All the fighting scenes that I would like to ship. In the end, even some Chinese appear out of nowhere to defeat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of stupidity. The audience does not pay to look at such nonsense. I think Bollywood must now forget about action movies. They can't do it. The last good thing I saw was from Ghatak and Khiladiyon ka Khialdi. The current scene in Bollywood is very sad for fans of action films like me. Do these people see their film after completion? Can they not understand that slow action (which is performed with the help of ropes) is too unreal and childish? Itâ€™s better not to have battle scenes if you can't handle it. I just want to go back to the Amitabha era, where in films such as Zanjeer and Deewar, there were exciting action movies. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than the scenes of the current era. <br /> <br /> This film should now open the eyes of bollywood directors. Please do not do more militants until you master the art of making it realistic.
