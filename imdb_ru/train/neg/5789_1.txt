My wife and I really had high hopes for this film, but it was a big disappointment. This was the version of the native American Mr. Magu. Pathetic father who fails in everything he tries, for example. fishing, hunting, he clearly subordinates his family to his wild fantasies. His “visions” are not only ridiculous, but in the process he lies to his son many times about various obvious things. Words cannot express how bad this film is. Children and wife are very real, which makes the film even more sad. I do not understand humor ... if you do not like to laugh at other people posing as fools. I do not understand how this could receive awards. Save your money, it is not worth the rent.
