Years have passed since Alex Raine (played by Olivier Gruner in the first film) came across a terrible conspiracy that involved replacing people with machines, but since then the war began between cyborgs and people, and we lost, now a kind of superwoman, which is the character's daughter Olivier Grüner (she also inherited only half of his minimum acting ability), which I think is the minimum connection of films with the first, however, when superwoman is created, she hides in 1980, while the hunter mi from the future hunts her into this confusing science fiction clanker. Nemesis became a cult hit, and I understand why people liked it, although I was not a fan of this film. Nemesis very ambitiously tried to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful appearance and provide a lot of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 doesn’t even have such ambitions, it’s a cheap breakdown of the Terminator with a muscular woman who is so weak in acting ability that makes Olivier Grüner seem like a master fan and the sequence of actions is devoid of explosive scale, which was the main selling point of the original. I admit that I was not a fan of the original, but he deserved a better continuation than this. The original was also a good cast, such as Tim Thomrson, Carey Hiroyuki Tagawa, Tom Matthews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes, Jackie Earl Haley, there is no one in this film, and this time it's just a boring movie with an ambitious atmosphere. In fact, after I saw it, it inspired to add half stars to the original. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
