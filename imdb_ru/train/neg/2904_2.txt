If in the first 10 minutes of this film you don’t understand that the main character, who writes the life advice column, will have tables that I’ll turn over so dexterously, and learn some valuable life lessons yourself then maybe something is wrong . The situation is so predictable that it can spoil the film, even if the rest of the film was good (and this is not so). <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemistry between the presenters, and the pursuer is embarrassing, not funny, by Steve Carell. It is hard to believe that Binosh would be interested in him. Then, after all, everything is so wonderful, and everyone lives happily ever after. Is this not great America!
