Okay, not possible, honestly, the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was absolutely no point in it, there was no plot, characterization, or acting, just nothing. <br /> <br /> This is what I thought when I first saw him on May 28, 2003 ** carefully, this is a warning about a spoiler. I also complain about how bad the film is. <br /> <br /> Okay, the film begins, and the characters get to know each other, but there are no explanations for the characters. as far as I knew, the main character was a newcomer to this school, but apparently not. it also turned out that he lived alone ... then he was a foster child ... then his mother was a violent alcoholic who had lived with him until now. all his friends also obviously had no parents, and they lived on their own. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main story, this crazy guy escapes from a crazy hideout and runs relentlessly. Now our main character is obsessed with this guy and intently focuses on him for the unforeseen circumstances of the film. I think that I must have missed the main plot element, for the main character there were no REASONS. even if this is the point, for no reason why all of his skeptical friends, like 5 minutes ago, suddenly follow him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> so the movie goes on and it gets great. they destroy school, blah blah blah. but wait a minute ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character arranges a "show" here. wait a second, didn't the crazy guy specifically tell the main character NOT to do this? it was supposed to be something unusual. <br /> <br /> and another important element of the plot was missed ... the insane guy had to be not mad ... everyone said he was not mad. but as the story goes, he is VERY CLEAR FROM HIS MIND. but I thought the news people said that he didn’t ... hm ... <br /> <br /> now the film is coming to an end. WHAT WAS CLOSED? WHAT WAS IT? the ending not only did not answer the questions about the main character, but did not answer the questions about the mad guy. Are these people in the same situation? if so, then there are some very simple plot lines that are not prone to this. if not, what's the point of saying “are you in two weeks?”. <br /> <br /> * the end of all this ... * <br /> <br /> this is what I thought. This is pretty much what I still think. it's 6 months in the future, and if I can get it for free, I could give it another chance, but I doubt it. I highly doubt it.
