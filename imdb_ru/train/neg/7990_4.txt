“Anita and I” is a drama about growing up in a multinational Britain, more like “Bend like Beckham”, or, more precisely, “East is East” with which she shares the situation of the 1970s. The tone is decidedly sharp (despite the harsh black accents), but the film lacks “The East is the energy of the East, and the result seems rather meager and trite. In addition, the image of the film’s central relationship, between an Asian girl and her white friend, is not deep enough to justify how the film is structured around it. I'm also tired of films where heroes become writers for years, naturally, these are often experienced by real writers, but this is hardly a fresh element of a fictional story. “East is East” was cheerful and sharp; "Anita and I" seem obvious and boring in comparison.
