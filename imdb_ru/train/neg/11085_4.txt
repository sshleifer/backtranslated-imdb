TYSON <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Respectful, albeit very honest, story about the life and times of the champion boxer Mike Tyson. Given his conviction on rape charges, the film tries not to portray him as a hero or a villain, but draws a bearded portrait of his rise to fame, the pressure of success and the people who shaped his fate forever or badly Restrained by time frames, the script skips through a sequence of relevant details, briefly highlighting important events that culminated in the (temporary) collapse of Tyson in 1995. Beginners will be enlightened by chronology, and boxing fans will be entertained by director Uli Edel A shooting approach to the material. He portrays Tyson’s life as a circus in which he was ultimately confused by the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the script reserves most of its poison for Tyson’s ex-wife, Robin Givens, describing her as an ungrateful gold digger who took advantage of his naivety. Production values ​​are equally solid, and the actors are excellent: Michael Jay White rightly imitates the title character; George S. Scott plays mentor Tyson Cousse d'Amato through acres of gritted teeth; and Paul Winfield was undoubtedly born to play Don King!
