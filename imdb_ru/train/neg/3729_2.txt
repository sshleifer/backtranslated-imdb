First, I watched this movie when I was 7 years old at Christiane Cholla, which I attended. Needless to say, I was scared to death. Not because it was scary, but because the content. Well ... I was 7. Anyway, the cinematography was pretty bad, and acting was fun. This is very bad, considering that I was only 7 years old, and I remember that. One thing that still haunts me is the terrible song "I wish we were all ready," where the chorus ends "... you are left behind." I would not advise to see this. I probably will, just for a nostalgic reason. Also, I'm sure the remake is much better. But the best part of this movie is when everyone “disappears”; crashing free cars, lawn mowers work by themselves ... quite fun.
