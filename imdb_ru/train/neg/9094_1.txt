Well, let me make this out for you guys ... It's terrible! <br /> <br /> If Roger Camble did such an unusual job in the first “Cruel Intent”, then why did he do it so badly? Sorry, but this film is stupid, though, perhaps it would have improved if its series ever went on the air, but let's be realistic ... this film is an eccentric! A lot of bad acting. * * * * * * * * * * * * * In the scene from the shower * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What is this line? "Slippery when wet" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This film had an effort, I will give it to you, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny, giving the house servants wacky accents that actually .... not funny! It was a pity. Not to mention the fact that they made everyone in this film look absolutely NOTHING, like the original cast. It’s like they made them look different on purpose or something! I like to watch it when I really really, really love the board, which sometimes does not happen. For those of you who liked it ... Ok, what did you think? Could you choose this film on top of another, which had a great acting game and amazing Sarah Michelle Gellar? The film is gold, if in it Sarah Michelle Gellar, yes! But this film does not, no offense Amy Adams. Oh yeah, since when did Sebastein have a heart ????? Ugh!
