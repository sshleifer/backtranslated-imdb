Christopher Lambert is annoying and frustrating in his image as GIDEON. This film could have become a classic if Lambert played as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in Rainy Man or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SEM. <br /> <br /> Very bad. Because the storyline matters to us in life, the excellent performances of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters. 3 out of 10
