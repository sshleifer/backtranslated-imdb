If you're wondering where many conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel and international relations come from, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a supernatural Hollywood movie based on some Bible passage. Instead, this film was made by the company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result is many times more like clips from the program of tele-angelism (complete with family prayers and light that breaks through the church windows while playing the harps). <br /> <br /> For ordinary viewers, this may be hard to believe, but many people believe in these things literally, as presented in the film. And this, perhaps, makes the film important. You probably won't find a shorter summary of the bizarre looks of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So, if you are viewing it, consider it as a social / cultural document. If you are familiar with the media at all, you do not need to be warned about unconvincing attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the film.
