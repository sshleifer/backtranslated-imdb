This film was absolutely pathetic. The pathetic script and the absence of any story just made me watch as three losers drool over babies in bikinis. At times I felt like watching a Beavis and Butthead episode. I couldn't even watch the whole movie. Emran Hashmi is disappointing, but Hrshitta Bhatt is not at all impressive. Selina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthy part of the film is the parody of Anu Malik and his obsession with Shayaris. It was quite fun. The songs "Sini Ne" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emranâ€™s lip blocking and lip sync in a cartouter. In general, it seems that Emran does not have a good script from Bhatts to support him this time.
