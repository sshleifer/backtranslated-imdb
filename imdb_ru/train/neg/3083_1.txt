... It is bad to be intentionally bad ... <br /> <br /> This little gem got right on the big screen of MST3k. Although it is obvious that the film is not being taken seriously (I hope its goal, anyway ...), the film is still pretty bad. Hell, this makes Leprechaun In Space a big budget ... <br /> <br /> In short, paint my car black!
