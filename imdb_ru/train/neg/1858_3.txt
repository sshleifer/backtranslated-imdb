The serial killer dies in a blizzard and mutates into the evil twin Snowman Frosty. Then goes to kill. Interesting story. It sounds scary. And it's scary. If you're five years old. Otherwise, it is a bit silly. I saw it by cable, and I am glad that I did not pay the money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget film that can become a cult film. I am sure he has loyal fans somewhere. I'm just not in it. Despite the fact that I did not like the film as a whole, there were some scenes that I found funny. For example, a scene with a bathroom and a scene after the explosion with reference to Picasso. It was also nice to watch the characters try to kill Jack, and he just does not want to die. In short, “Jack Frost” is a good low-budget comedy with a B-movie, but a bad low-budget horror from B-movies.
