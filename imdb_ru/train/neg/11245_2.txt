I entered the theater in the Sky Captain in 2004, expecting a good movie. Almost all the reviews of this film were positive, the effect was tempting, the preview was convincing. <br /> <br /> Of course, disappointment does not describe the feeling I got from this film. It was rage. <br /> <br /> In addition to being boring and poorly written, the reason that this film gets 2 out of 10 stars is that everything in the film was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between tributes and theft: it was theft. More importantly, it seems that the filmmakers did not steal in order to progress the item or promote the plot. They stole to show what they could. It literally makes no sense to show the clip "The Wizard of Oz" in the cinema at the beginning of the film, except to create another scene (I will not elaborate on it), which comes from the same film. It goes without saying that every concept in the film was neither original nor even a rotation of the old concept: it was literally a paraphrase of what I already saw from the pulp-era robots resembling the old Superman cartoons and the recent film "Iron Giant" to the silent minion of a martial arts master who was used in countless films, the most recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> For the real movie, most of the action was completely wooden. Perhaps this is because the entire film was shot on a blue screen, and computer images fill everyone except the actors. To be honest, this is not an excuse for a bad acting game. If a person was ever a child, he understood that the lack of visual help There is no excuse for not trying. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in this movie. The main characters are the only real people here. Almost all the antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters shown during the movie, can be counted on the one hand. If robots attack the entire planet, shouldn't we expect the masses of humanity to flee from them? The performance of the main characters at a low level does not allow us to connect to something here. <br /> <br /> The film was not the worst film, so I did not give it 1 Rather, the film was an example of everything that was not so with modern action films: the filmmakers tried to justify the film with special effects, but without artistic vision or any originality failed.
