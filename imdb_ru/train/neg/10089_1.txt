German filmmaker Ulli Lommel coped with a task that many horror fans considered impossible: he removed from the bed of Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of the director of the worst horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> Lommel is really Ed Wood of the new millennium This film is just as cheesy and ridiculous as the best-worst of EW. I am proud and embarrassed when I say that I watched it as a whole, painfully fascinated to see how low the bar can be set. Answer: underground; Lommel dug a hole and buried her. <br /> <br /> Fun begins with the cast of international nonentities. Only one who lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and postman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many actors who wanted to spew out his ridiculous dialogue with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The main character, the villainous policeman, is played by a German actor with a strong German accent. In addition to being a serial killer, he is also the oldest police officer in Los Angeles. Despite the fact that he stops innocent female drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which is inexplicably the top floor of a furniture warehouse) and does it all in full view of his new partners, LAPD refuses to investigate, right up to physically attacking one of his ninja-style accusers in his apartment. <br /> <br /> Kits are terribly bad. The designer's budget obviously included enough money for a can of paint; enough to draw "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> Since the actors were clearly unpaid laymen — a sad assortment of European immigrants (perhaps deported if they acted on their native land), bimbos, mimbas, and desperate middle-aged women — and so few, if any. the money was spent on sets, special pieces, places or other production costs, it would be fair to say that they were born for several genuine looking police uniforms. Unfortunately, they could not afford a police car; uniformed police walk the streets in the brilliant new hire of the Mercury. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story is about the dirty actions of our abnormal German LA police officer and the futile efforts of two young recruits to stop him. One of these young actors is especially deplorable because he is the only actor in this whole mess, even with an obscure shot in a real film career. The other one comes right from the rockabilly hairstyle and Brando's weary pose, which needs to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film, where the name gets a zombie, as the victims of our killer resurrected after he killed the girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to cast a protective spell on her. Do not ask why the girl from Romania resorts to voodooism in anticipation of the murder, just accept the logic of Lommel and enjoy the absurd trip. <br /> <br /> After a long, long digging of hands from the thatched roadside graves, Zombie girls manage to appear. They look exactly the same as before death, perhaps even prettier, with black glamorous makeup generously applied with an airbrush on the eyes. Not looking like a zombie, they look more like high fashion models, ready for the runway. <br /> <br /> At this point in the film, Lommel borrows a creative note from his illustrious compatriot Boll and introduces large portions of cheese euro. thrash techno to soundtrack. We are talking about the prehistoric electronic bumblebee. Things they could play in a disco in Ibiza when Lommel was still young enough to shake his prey. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel girls speak and function as usual ... uh, I mean how they did before they became zombies. This gives our author ample opportunities to encourage us with even more of our golden dialogue. Yes, it is golden rain. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil anything, revealing the end of the shock. All I can say is that it harmonizes perfectly with the rest of this masterpiece. Ed Wood's spirit lives ... or should I say its a geist.
