I look at the video store, still in shock, as Steven Seagal with his bad militant track record can make three films hit the shelves in less than a year. Sci Fi Genre for our ever expanding Seagal. Before my gullible eyes flashed a vision of bad entertainment in the movies. Unfortunately, this is not the case when there is no entertainment, and the film is as bad as it is. <br /> <br /> Seagal recovered a little bit with the Cheesy but Pleasant Shadow Man the last time we saw him. However, the power of Attack should be his worst movie ever! Do not argue about people Killer, Ticker, or even Black Dawn. Septic bottom here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says that this is Steven Seagal’s return to the form should write a 100 page essay with the word "Taste." <br /> <br /> Segal is another agent / I am the ultimate villain, and again named Lawson wants to avenge the murder of his team, which leads him to a vile plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting Public. Not to mention the fact that dealers did not come from here. <br /> <br /> The whole production, from directing to acting, leaves much to be desired. Was this movie made in the dark? It must be the worst lit film since Howl 2. The action is terrible and very poorly done. <br /> <br /> The producers also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most: throw a double trick after a double trick and terribly duplicate Stephen Seagal. show a little bit of enthusiasm. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> Although it has already been said that the “Power of Attack” was not the film to which Stevie (originally “Harvester”) was signed, and, of course, it should be better than the attack power. fake production did not make it more consistent and made Seagal look worse. I feel bad because of director Michael Keush and writer Jo Hal Hal Touch because they will be judged forever for rash re-filming. <br /> <br /> So now Seagal is in an impossible position to come up with something that can be redeemed in this mess. But looking at how bad attack power came out, do we really want him to make another film?
