So, I was bored, and I watched it all the time. <br /> <br /> This film is soft, harmless and dull. The story is so sweet that it rots in the first credits. The tail of the two "injured" children, learning about the "God" fairy tale, which frankly left me pretty injured. He uses Irish “adulation” in such a stereotypical way that no one hopes that a true Irish will ever see him. Designed for children who, frankly, will be disconnected after the first attempt of the “ORIST” accent. In general, why do they pump them out.
