Wow ... OK. So, after reading a little enmity, I decided that I should watch this movie for myself. This movie is terrible. I stopped watching this. I highly recommend cleaning the cabinet instead of watching this movie, you will be more scared / entertained. <br /> <br /> This is a low budget due to a bad game. <br /> <br /> Anyone who gives this film 10 s is absolutely wrong and should not be taken into account. <br /> <br /> I am in no way affiliated with any of the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Very, very bad movie.
