Stupid and just a strange film about a child who is injured when he learns that Santa is not real (???). He grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart), who makes lists of disobedient or likeable people. One Christmas, he puzzles and is going to kill naughty people - of course, dressed like Santa. <br /> <br /> A boring and just bad Santa movie. If you're looking for blood, it's not here. Only a few of the killings are revealed, and they are not so terrible with VERY fake effects. Most of the film simply contains Brandon Maggart, who talks to himself and slowly goes crazy. The script is banal, the game is terrible, and this leads to the final, which made me stare at the TV with a relaxed jaw. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and look at it again to make sure that I had no hallucinations! Really REALLY bad ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent the movie “Black Christmas” in a scary Christmas movie (the original version of the 70s is NOT a terrible remake). Avoid this at all costs.
