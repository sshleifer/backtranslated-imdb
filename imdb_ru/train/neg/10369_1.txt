As a writer, I find films so bad that I turn them into production by a complete slap in the face. Talk about an insult. I wrote better stories than this in 8th grade. Bad behavior, bad writing, bad direction and, if you put it all together, the result will be a complete and complete failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing that manages to achieve this film is to fool an unsuspecting consumer, wasting his time. Who would green light something so poorly written? It is not artistic, clever, clever, intense, mysterious, scary, dramatic - NOTHING. <br /> <br /> Characters are flat and boring, without development. The plot is redesigned as an aluminum can. They somehow managed to play some very familiar actors who must all desperately need work or hope that one of these low-budget independent films will be the next “Pulp Fiction”. This script should have been used for a cage bird, not a movie. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, a woman weighing 5'2,105 pounds, of course, has the power to kill men and women twice her size without a fight and with one blow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as if it would infect you with an STD.
