I'm not going to worry about the plot, since you know what the film is about, and there’s almost no plot. I have seen several reviewers call ISOYG an “anti-rape film” or even a feminist statement, and I just have to intervene in the defiant hypocrisy of these statements. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do we see on the cover of this film? That's right: slim woman from behind. Was it an attempt by Zarchi to make a statement against rape - and I absolutely do not believe that it was - absolutely irrelevant. The film tells about sex, about sexual abuse and that the material is so visual (everything except the actual penetration is shown) that NO ONE, except a crowd of exploiters with a hard core, would like it. <br /> <br /> Rape (s)) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There is something that can be said to present a terrible crime in such a cruel light, but this scene had no reason to last, it would seem, 30 minutes, no. There was also a slight development of the character of the victim, and only one of the rapists was slightly developed (just a few minutes before he was killed), so the scene was not at all attractive on an emotional level. In fact, it is simply presented to demonstrate extreme sexual abuse, and from the films that ISOYG links to IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.), you can say that it only attracts the exploitation crowd. <br /> <br /> Finally, several reviewers praised the so-called Zarchi documentary style and the lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else is in the film (acting, screenplay, etc.) I suspect that these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary, because it is literally stationed by the camera and let its porn caliber actors do their thing. <Br /> <br /> I'm not going to talk about the ISOYG content. I am all for exploitation / horror and love video shit. In fact, I give three stars to this film only because it really promotes the envelope much further than some other films. However, this is also badly done, and after the rape occurs, it’s just boring for the rest of the film when we see a bunch of Hochma, mostly murders without gore, and wait for the captions to roll. <br /> <br /> This is probably worth seeing once, if you are a fan of the 70s hardcore exploitation, but I tell you that the film as a whole is pretty bad and not worth its notorious reputation.
