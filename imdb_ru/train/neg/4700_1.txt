I totally hated the movie. It was so backward. They need to get some acting lessons ... no, wait, that won't help, because the Naked Brothers group is slowing down. Do you know why I am here, although I am a hater of the Naked Brothers Band? Warn people before they watch this stupid film so that the BNB will not get money from him so that they can no longer make stupid amateur songs that are so backward that any old man could go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only are the lyrics slowed down, they sing badly. Well, I sort of get off the movie here ... anyway, it was boring and they acted terribly. It was NOT funny, although they tried hard to make it happen. I guess they deserve credit for this ... well, the film is not worth your time. Just look at his rating. The film (and the series) is very painful to see everyone who has even half the brain. Seriously, if you like it, you need to watch films in which the actors actually act without mumbling their monotonous plots. I'm at a drama club at my school, and some people are actually BETTER than these guys from Nat and Alex. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of puppies. I don't even know why I even went through half of this film. I don't think it even deserves to be called a movie ...
