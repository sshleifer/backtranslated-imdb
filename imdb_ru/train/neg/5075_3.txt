The animation was good, the images were good, although not completely original, but the story was too long, too confusing, and too dramatic. About an hour later I could not wait to finish it. With so many characters who have nothing to contribute, and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere, this film really was not at all one movie and would be better than short TV shows or perhaps two movies. If you like this typical story, you might like it, but, to be honest, I was spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have a kind of message. Rent a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, and you will get much more from it.
