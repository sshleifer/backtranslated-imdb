I started watching this movie with high expectations. However, an hour later I was disappointed in this film, since he only instilled in me many unanswered questions. This has already begun in the initial sequence and has only deteriorated. <br /> <br /> Why do they bury the Dutchman under the statue? Why is there an Italian comedian? Why did the farmers wife save the Dutchman? Why did he, being saved, not run for his life instead of making love to the farmers wife? Why didn't the farmer’s wife save the Dutchman at a time when the farmer wasn’t there? Why do these supposedly illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did an Italian comedian find out about Dutch gold? Why did he hide it in a cesspool in the middle of the property of evil farmers? These and many other questions arose, and none of them seemed to receive an acceptable answer. So I think that I completely miss the meaning of this film, and I have nothing to do with the story ...
