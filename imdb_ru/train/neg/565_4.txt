The same complexity that I have with the musical version of “Les Miserables” equally applies to “Oliver”. Instead of writing composers in the stylistic period of gaming installations, they simply wrote Broadway-type tunes that were historically non-idiomatic and stylistically distorted. <br /> <br /> Too blatant cruelty and dubious acts of drama. Do not mix well with some shiny sands that permeate the bill. This is an uncomfortable mixture that leaves a distinctly sour taste. <br /> <br /> The cast of the boy Oliver does not help in questions: the test timbre and annoyingly precious, there is something less solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, although the melodies that he is forced to sing have no basis in the manner of performance. <br /> <br /> “As long as I need him” give a sharp performance, hoarse and tense. Two large manufacturing numbers, “Who Will Buy” and “Consider Yourself”, seem overderived when everything except the kitchen sink is added. One thing with all his might, one more thing - to cross the line in abundance. <br /> <br /> The gloom, despair and depravity of most of the novel seem to defy such chants and choreography. Although the novel is considered a classic, I must admit that I have problems with Mr. Dickens' mind, as his works tend to emit negative vibrations. This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointments and regrets. <br /> <br /> Not all the combined talent of this production, whether on camera or behind the camera, can overcome the non-constructive nature of the basic material. All this entails discomfort. <br /> <br />
