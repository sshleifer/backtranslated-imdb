As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely offensive and humiliating for single women over 40, not to mention every woman of any age. It was a sad, pitiful attempt by a man to write and send "a click of chickens", and she failed miserably. Andy McDowell from the very beginning is not too good for the actress, but, given the non-existent "conspiracy" (I hate even to call it a plot), she had no chance. There was no development of character, no reason to feel sympathy for any of the characters, and there was no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And yet there is a mandatory male fantasy about an attractive natural woman who suddenly decided to try lesbianism - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> Not only I would like to get my money back for a DVD rental, I also want to return these 112 minutes of my life. What a rip-off.
