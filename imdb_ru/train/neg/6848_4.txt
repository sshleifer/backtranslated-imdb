I have to say that I am rather disappointed with this horror movie. I was not scared once during the viewing. It is also not very tense ... I was able to guess the ending halfway through the movie ... So ... what's left? <br /> <br /> The Ring is a terrible scary movie. .. I would like other films to stop copying from it (for example, brand: long hair). Please give me some originality. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
