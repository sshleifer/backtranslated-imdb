When I write this review in 2008, we are immersed in the remake culture. Film studios seem to be determined to spoil as many of the classic films as possible with completely meaningless updates, including King Kong, The Wicker Man, and almost every movie that Michael Caine ever starred in. This lazy remake mentality, however, is not a new phenomenon, as the Do-Do Dough proves. Absolutely meaningless color version of Bob Clampett's surrealistic masterpiece “Porky in Wackyland”, “Dough for Do-Do” sucks the life out of the original, splashing color all over Klampett's original material and adding a few new unconvincing shots supervised by Frieze Freleng. Freleng was a totally unsuitable director to intervene with Clampett’s source material, although in fact no director could ever hope to get close to the insane-inspired Clampett. Thus, “Dough for Do-Do” inevitably becomes nothing more than the rape of a classic with a new horrible name. For fans of cartoons like me, this is equivalent to coloring "Casablanca."
