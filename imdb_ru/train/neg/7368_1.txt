I had the misfortune to spend 10 pounds buying a new SS film on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually give up my faith by watching such films. A pinch of salt and some beer on a dark evening on the couch, watching the noisy late evening, shoot at them, perfect for one alpha male like me. I bought this film, thinking that I would see great martial arts and shoot them. <br /> <br /> Damn it, am I? Seagal is old and bloated, the plot was ridiculous even by the standards of the SS, and it was extremely awful to limit all this to the actions of Segal (such as he should have started). So terrible that half of his voice was voiced by a man who sounded ANYTHING LIKE HIM. Either the SS could not act anymore (controversial issue) the teams were so terrible at their work that they could not record the sound properly. A voice would have flashed back and forth between Mr. Shepoth Seagal and the man who makes the behind-the-scenes footage for a Honda ad! <br /> <br /> This is not the point of the plot, because most of the militants work on the same premise as this one, nothing new there. The usual mix of characters who will die awfully like cannon fodder and stereotypical bad guys waiting to be blown up. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if you did not go in front of a high-speed train or a portion of H5N1 bird flu. <br /> <br /> Excessive garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This is a public health alert.
