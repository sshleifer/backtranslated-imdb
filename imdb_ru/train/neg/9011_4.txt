Pretty standard stuff for B-movies. Seriously, anyone who watches Dragon Fighter with Dean Cain and a group of people who make their first film should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist to rework formulas that are popular. If you give them at least an analysis of the tokens, you will ruin the movie yourself (and, perhaps, write some important slanderous review about IMDb). <br /> <br /> I liked the main character Christine Byers. She had charisma, and I thought she was particularly attractive. It was an unforgettable B-movie appearance. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t see where she has been making films since. I will follow her again.
