The film started off well, LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover cop with partner Sergeant. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from Praktika is perhaps mistaken as a bad guy?) Pillages and murders. The act refuses to kill the drug dealer, who arranges the conflict between the dirty policeman and his conscience. Other big names (Freeman, Spacey and others.) Well played, and the film promises. <br /> <br /> The film begins to lose as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollak) appears. If I had the opportunity to make a good film that people might watch repeatedly, or a film that teenage girls would watch once because of Timberlake, I would choose the first one. Even talented actors have to work hard on their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented, and no hard work can save him. I would have thought that he would arrange the best show, considering the fact that he was acting talentedly for many years. Everything he did in this film was inconclusive. <br /> <br /> The fact that the singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums does not mean that they can successfully perform in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the apparent lack of acting talent. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are several holes in the plot, such as Pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly work of warehouse equipment. This film had so many promises. Thoroughly disappointing.
