Oh, dear, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans, it was a nail in the coffin from the point of view of her Hollywood career. After decisive turns in “Girl Can't It It,” “Wave Bus,” “Cracker,” and “Rock Hunter,” it seemed that Jane was already on her way to becoming one of the hottest stars in Tinsel Town. However, the obsession with vibrant advertising and the appearance in this crappy business pushed Mansfield to the sidelines, namely cheap loans in euros, while Fox could not terminate his contract at the earliest opportunity. <br /> <br /> This film is truly a devilish waste of everyone’s time, with the exception of Susie Parker, the only thing in this film is bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jane and her decisive performance for the bad yield of this film at the box office, and although she is a pain in this film, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Carey barely sets the screen on fire, right? After a few very good drama and comedy turns, Jane takes 10 steps back in her quest to become a serious actress, agreeing (just to appear with Grant) to portray this shrill, idiotic threat. Her character Alice is a complete cartoon prank, and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler, her every appearance in the movie loosens your nerves. We all know that Jane could have done much better than this scale, and yet here she is parading like prize pudding. This shame. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this so-called comedy. This is more depressing than amusing.
