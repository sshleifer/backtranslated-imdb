Remake gb The classic film with the chases of the seventies Halitsky is just awful. Along with the Point of Disappearance, Gone in 60 Seconds are typical car chase movies. The remake takes the original and puts it upside down. While Khalitsky gave us 75% of car chases and 25% of drama support, in GISS 2000 we received 25% of car chases and 75% of drama support. Cage, like a super man, rescues his brother, kisses a girl. MTV edits, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least, Khalitsky did not live to see how his child (he wrote, produced, filmed and starred in the film “74”) was so degraded.
