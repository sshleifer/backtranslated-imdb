I just found the series "Mash" banal, preaching, oh, even very "politically correct", boring, pretentious and the biggest sin of all, and what is it? that it was (was) incredibly boring. Your main role is Alan Alda, “(star)”, who is so in love with himself and his cunning that it even became uncomfortable for me to even try to sit in the episode. The original series included both Macklin Stevson and Wayne Rogers, whom I, as I gladly admit, had a certain style and presentation style for their characters. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both individually and collectively, eat caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Sweet, whom I also found boring, was not surprising, too, through no fault of their own, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the film, was tired of watching and acting like a show. Seeing one show per year showed it to me. Jamie Farr was just a comedic eyebrow and is not even worth mentioning here at all. The reason that I did not give him a (one) rating, which will certainly surprise anyone who reads it now, is that ratings of any kind are not only subjective, but also relative. Television, with the exception of a few exceptions, is so rude. Conventionally, Mash had some quality of production (by television standards) of that era today, and therefore it deserves two.
