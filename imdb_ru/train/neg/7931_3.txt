The explosion of television channels should be eternally grateful to the Randolph Scott Western production line, because at any moment there should be one of what looks like a hundred Randolph Scott films playing at least one extrabudgetary station. <br /> <br /> “The Man behind the Gun” is a typical melodrama of the early 1950s with products before World War II, based on the historical plot of the murder ridge, studded with action scenes to hide the complete lack of a character development scenario and, therefore, no waiting. In subsequent years, the role of these films will be taken on by television shows, such as Gunsmoke, Bonanza, etc., and they really did a better job. Randolph Scott, looking especially embarrassed at this, is a good guy fighting against the bad guys against whom he will eventually triumph. There is no more interest in what he experiences emotionally than in what his horse feels, unless you consider whether it is interesting to deal with the initial misunderstanding with female leadership towards the end. Music is a stronger indicator of the emotional state of the “characters” than the action. But it is good if it floats in your boat; and I would not scold you for enjoying "Diagnosis, Murder." <br /> <br /> Professional, pedestrian and rapidly aging. 3 stars for being competently put together; 0 for artistic creation.
