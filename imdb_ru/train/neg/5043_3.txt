I'm a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and will go to any movie to see her, which led me to Purple Butterfly. No matter how much I want this film, I have to agree with many others who have commented on it. It is very confusing and very slow. Since the entire film seems to have been shot using a hand-held camera, much of it is out of focus. <br /> <br /> There are very few dialogues in the film, and what is there says little. There are endless scenes with people who just stand, smoke cigarettes or sit in a room, looking at each other without talking. The way a movie’s time changes is also very confusing and difficult to track. Even after reading a few reviews and having a general idea of ​​what the film was about, it was still difficult for me to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew in advance that the film was not remotely similar to previous films with Ziyi Zhang, but was looking forward to seeing her in something else, but unfortunately I was eventually disappointed . She never smiles in this film, although, admittedly, in most cases she has nothing to smile about. I could have done without sex scenes, since they were about the same sexless and without any obvious feelings between the participants, as you might hope to find.
