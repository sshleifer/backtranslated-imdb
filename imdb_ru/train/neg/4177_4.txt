The second film in boxing. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this film was rather average. In some places it is pretty boring, but there are some good effects of blood, but they are not very good. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have largely captured the whole world. The V-SAN squad (Vampire Sanitation), which also has its own spacecraft and is headed by Churchill, captured by vampires, receives a message from the Earth and the crew formed by Quintana (played by very hot Natassia Malta). ), rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Aaron Pearl from The Wrongly Accused) plays the role of Roman.) Later, V-SAN meets the vampire leader Muko, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans for a peaceful life with people, as he aspires to world domination. <br /> <br /> Although this film was not a waste of time, I doubt that I will return to the DVD player soon.
