This film can really be a thoughtless pleasure for 2/3 of the way. Unfortunately, the film is too "confusing." Although I know that some of the tricks in the plot are standard for the “friend” films, I was attracted to characters who brilliantly deceive each other, but in the end the film relies too much on episodes of chase as a support, and I lost interest. /> <br /> The filmmakers did a great job so that the characters were left alone and went about their business, and we found out who they were and identified themselves with both policemen in the early stages. We formed our own opinion, instead of forcing them to feed them with a look because of constant disputes. <br /> <br /> In the end, too much is happening, and this greatly diminishes what could be a pleasant escape. , As for Joe Gavilana (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate transactions 2. His love affair with a radio psychologist 3. He is being investigated by internal affairs 4. The investigation into the murder <br /> <br /> If you add to Casey's concern, you will love that he wants to become an actor and take revenge on his father's death. Now some of these things come together and even go well together, but all the elements of the plot come together during this fake chase, so long and pitiful that I hardly have time to break my boredom and spit on what has just happened. Impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot cope with poor filmmaking. <br /> <br /> As if the absurd chase sequence was not bad enough, the one that had four separate sections and could last for about half an hour was not bad enough Joe Gavilan Fields calls about his real estate deal, chasing the criminal with a weapon . All these out-of-class storylines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether the criminal is caught or not. We have already forgotten or no longer care about the plot of the murder, because the multitude of plot lines and the hint of the chase stunned us beyond all understanding. <br /> <br /> Although I could go on about the persecution and how they would destroy a decent story, I will not. It could have been a very nice formula movie, but it became too big for his pants and turned into a waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually performed well, and it is worth noting the small appearance of Gladys Knight. Unfortunately, none of the actors can help this hopelessly erroneous film to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Although this is likely to be better than in films such as Hulk and Lara Croft II, which still do not. good movie I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed that he was making only films that he thought would make money, I am not sure if this is true or not. What is true is that in order to get an excellent box office, you do not need a good film or a great actor, this film does not have any of the leading roles. My advice to Harrison Ford is to stick with Indiana Jones, because at least you can still run.
