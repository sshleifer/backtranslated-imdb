What a disappointment ... admittedly, the best of prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is in a hurry, and the end result is just a collection of scenes poorly implemented and unprofessionally glued together. There are numerous succession mistakes that clearly clash with the original films, and the appearance of Darth Vader was treated so badly that what could be a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a stupid fool who will make fun of for many years. I will not complain about the terrible dialogue, as it is “Star Wars” ... three original films had style, cult feelings and amazing stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were petty attempts to make more money, and this lack of love manifests itself in peaks. Totally disappointing.
