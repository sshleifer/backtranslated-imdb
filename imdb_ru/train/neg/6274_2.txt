I generously give this movie 2 stars. The line about "have you ever seen a wizard from Oz" was the best part for me! with terrible scenarios and actions similar to what is shown in this film, it is not surprising that so many people are taking useless reality shows. do yourself a favor and leave the house and play a baseball game, you'll be glad you did it!
