Not exactly my genre, this street fight on DVD, which I met just because a friend put it on while we had a few beers. I am a relatively open-minded and quite a fan of Yonna Walker, so I leaned back in my chair, ready to have fun. <br /> <br /> “Blood and Bone” is a story about Ishia Bon, a former prisoner who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons that ultimately unfold during the film. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> What a tedious movie. I understand that such films are not very dependent on the plot, but do they need to fill such a stupid, predictable and completely stupid storyline? It may not be important, but damn, it annoys me. Better without a plot and pure action than a mad stupid mongrel narrative. Filled with completely unreasonable and unattainable sentimental nonsense, it is the cinematic equivalent of thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten guts. Probably at this point I must mention that, of course, is the main feature of the film: the struggle. Even the struggle itself is rather poor. Bones manages to kill well-proven strong street fighters with one blow (a big or two jerk is a ridiculous attempt by directors to correct this discrepancy); fighters who never conclude that attacking one on one is a stupid trick. Even this is repeated and stupid, hands are broken, and faces suffer from constant greed, which we see again and again. <br /> <br /> Run of the mill, a movie by numbers, which fully deserves it right on DVD status, without doing anything new and everything that we have seen again and again. And even not particularly good.
