Usually I don’t feel much incentive to comment on films that I don’t like, but in this case, like this one, I just have to say something. This film is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many flaws in storytelling that I don’t even feel the need to dwell on this because it’s time to give up this experience. However, the most unpleasant moment is that in no episode of the film no one explains whether the motives of madness of Bacon’s character are due to a power failure or a physiological response to his condition. <br /> <br /> Of course, the effects are impressive, and in the past, Paul Verhoeven did some good things (the directorial version of Robocop on DVD is great). However, this film is stupid and, as a rule, not suitable for explaining the essence or technical aspect of the subject, but instead agrees to predictable actions without any pleasure. Tell me (sorry, I haven't read them before ...) - stay away from this movie!
