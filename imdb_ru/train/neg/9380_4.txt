The last couple of weeks in the life of a dead stray woman are told in memories. Like the tramp, the film wanders aimlessly and rather meaninglessly. Mona, the lazy, sullen and drug-addicted title character, is not cute, and Bonner does little to make her interesting. Although there is some pretentious dialogue trying to explain why Mona chose this pitiful way of life, her motives are never truly clear. The episodic nature of the film, in which some random characters are involved, becomes tedious after a while, which makes it seem much longer than the time it takes to work. It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman will not attract more attention from men.
