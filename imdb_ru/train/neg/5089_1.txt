It's so sad that the Romanian audience is still inhabited by vulgar and uneducated people who enjoy such cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and cruel as the series “Garcia” or children's games “Vacanta mare” ... The difference is that Mugur Mihayescu, Douro Octavian Dumitru and other similar artisans can never claim that their show is an “art”. Pintily, who shot a very good film 40 years ago (“Duminicä la ora sase”), followed by another quite good (“Reconstituirea”), tries to declare his films “works of art” - but, unfortunately, he does too limited level specifically cinematic means of expression. Thus, “Niki Ardelean” again offers the sample “HOW NO” - this is his only merit.
