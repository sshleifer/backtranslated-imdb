Yes, I know that "walkie-talkies" had just been invented for the cinema two years earlier, when it was filmed in 1929, but this film showed that much needed to be learned about the art of making films. It’s like a scene from the Hammy with actors casting their lines melodramatically, rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more suitable for a silent movie, which I think was normal in teaching them to make them look more naturalistic on the screen. was toughened during editing as it slows down the film considerably. Now this is of interest only for Titanic lovers who want to see an early example of this sea wreck on tape. In the following chronological order, they could see “Titanic” (1953) “Remember” Night (1958) “Titanic” (1997) to see how the cinematographic image of this tragedy developed over the years. Many documentaries and television films were shot, including the brutal SOS Titanic (1979). On the DVD, David McCallum gives an idea. It was he who played Harold Bride Marconi, Junior Wireless Operator in “Nights to Remember” (still the best feature film - please read my comments on “A Tribute to Walter” to IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk) and gave a comment to a series of 4 video clips entitled “The End of a Dream”, so he was qualified enough to give the story. Of more interest, I found a recording accompanied by real photographs of 1912. US Senate hearing, which is also on DVD. The actors speak real words spoken by the 2nd officer of Lightoller, J. Bruce Ismay, the managing director of White Star, Harold Bride, and others, including Gloria Stewart (“Old Rose” in Titanic 1997), whose voice is used for one of the surviving women first class
