I and my friends watched this movie about a week ago, and I consider it absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who read it) that this film is not only among the five worst films I have ever seen. but actually has the honor of being number one. I have seen quite a few films, but none can compare with this by stupidity. You could say that I suffered while watching this ... my only excuse is that we waited for several hours and could not go anywhere without freezing. I do not recommend this to anyone. At first I thought we were watching some really bad porn movies, but I realized 10 minutes later what was wrong. this is not a comedy, this is not a drama, this is not an action, this is not horror, this is just horror!
