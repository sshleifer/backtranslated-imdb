Films such as Amazing Grace and Chuck are a great example of how the left in this country simply does not understand this. They never did. And liberalism continues to go farther and farther into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This film is about a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. For obvious reasons, the boy is ridiculed until a group of professional athletes led by former NBA star Alex Inglish joins his case. Not only some of them join the case. By the time his movement reaches its apogee, whole leagues of professional and university sports should cancel their seasons, since no one else will play. Just to promote this review, I am ready to provide them with this premise. Even if it doesn’t happen in a million years, I’ll just imagine what could have happened and then went from there. <br /> <br /> I don’t quite remember how, but some agreement was reached, and the Boy decides to return to the game he loves in an incredibly juicy and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing the message of this film, let me say that this film is poorly written, shot and directed. Even if we agree with the position of the boy, it would be impossible to overcome how poorly the film was built. And this is a shame, because there are a lot of good actors who are wasting. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Nevertheless, Alex English copes with his character as well as he could, and I would like him to try to play in several films. Alas, it is probably much easier to find a job in the world of NBA coaching. I would like Mr. Inglish to teach more modern NBA gangster types how to shoot stone a little better. Alex, of course, knew how to pass the ball through the hoop. <br /> <br /> With regard to the message of the film, it is just a mistake. Simply and easily. All these nuclear warheads are hidden in these missile mines in the west. PREVENTED WAR !!!!! For this boy and his flock, it would be one thing to protest against real war or the use of nuclear weapons. This weapon was never actually used, and it was the genius behind their existence. Neither side was so crazy during the Cold War to launch one rocket. Without this weapon, who knows what could happen between the USA and the USSR. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film obviously intended the children in America to get down to business and follow in Chuck's footsteps. Children in America, however, are smarter than the left wings that created this dirt. <br /> <br /> The film is rated only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a great film about the dangers of nuclear war, stay with Dr. Strangelove. <br /> Mr. Newell, you are not Frank Capra!
