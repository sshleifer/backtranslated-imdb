I stumbled upon this movie on a rainy Sunday, intending to tune in to something else. Out of curiosity, I read the comments here and found that I was watching them to the end. I really didn't do it with intent - it was one of those films where you are “fascinated” and watch it “for a couple more minutes”, until you finally just watch it through. And the indictment in most of these comments made it more fun to watch. One comment, where the man really liked it, seems to be solely the result of Ladd and Spano’s sympathy, and their earlier roles. But here you can’t find anything good anywhere - stories, performances and especially absurd hi-jinki in the courtroom. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the 300 pound mark) and Ben Matlock was given some freedom to jump around the courtroom, instead of being bored with the chair. And Matlock is especially privileged to enter the exhibits often, simply by going to the jury and showing them before the judge and the prosecutor are even informed or shown to them. No real judge or prosecutor would support this. <br /> <br /> Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the trial, refusing to acknowledge the real killer. In fact, Perry almost always did this, but often Matlock simply presented irrefutable evidence of the true culprit, declared it “reasonable doubt”, and then left the police and prosecutors the right to oppose the guilty party - sometimes on camera, sometimes assumed at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> But that said, Holland Taylor's histrionic and the amount of freedom of action granted to her, in the courtroom section of this story, made Matlock / Mason's actions more like slow, often boring details like television in courtroom and in real courtrooms. <br /> <br /> Each character in this presentation was either tasteless, not sympathetic, unpleasant, boring, unbelievable — or a combination of two or more of them. <br /> <br /> The ending was the most banal, absurd, and even the stupidest possible - but, again, exciting because of it. Ladd and Spano are attractive personalities, and T.V. the films will show their best strength - probably the best in the 2 main (perhaps better, the “3rd”) roles, even in this place. Taylor can be appointed aunt or mother of one of them. Give it 1 star in history / performances and 3 extra for the admiration factor.
