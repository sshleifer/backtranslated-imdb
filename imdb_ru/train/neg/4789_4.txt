The "Ghost" of 1979 was a very atmospheric, creepy, scary and very original horror film and, in a word, a cult movie. The first continuation of 1988 was awful, witty, intense and very interesting. However, after the first continuation, Don Coscarelli, the creator of the Ghost, clearly lacked new ideas. The “Ghost III - Lord of the Dead” of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is even very interesting, but there is no more originality in it, and desperate attempts to bring something new, sometimes tedious, which makes it quite disappointing compared to its predecessors . <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> At the very beginning we reveal the secret of mysterious watch-making spheres (flying silver balls, sucking brains). Henceforth, a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters (such as Tim, a small child at home alone, who turned out to be good at shooting, Rocky, a cool and super cool nunchaku — swinging black chicken with a cutout from the team)) introduced. The film also has its own qualities - Reggie Bannister is very cool again, as is Reggie with a tailed tail who plays the guitar. Angus Scrimm is still rather creepy, like the Tall Man, but the fact that the Tall Man talks a lot in this film makes him lose some of his creepiness. Mike's character is played again by A. Michael Baldwin (replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), which, in my opinion, is of little importance. The blood also makes the film interesting enough to watch, but it is still disappointing, especially because trying to make up for a lack of ideas is annoying pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> Taking into account all the circumstances, “Phantasm III” “is an acceptable waste of time, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two Ghost films may try, but I do not recommend overstateing your expectations too much.
