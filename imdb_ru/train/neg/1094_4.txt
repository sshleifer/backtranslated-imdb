It’s hard to describe it - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer’s films in those days, you will probably be pleased to see that Haji still looks very hot, although Forry Ackerman doesn’t feel so good (what is he doing so far? Are these films? If I approach him with a camera, will he be in my film?) comedies by Joe E. Brown (or Abbott) and Kos YELLOW, if that's your thing) - basically just quibbles. However, I found this movie fascinating to watch for two reasons. Good job, but still fundamentally fragile production.
