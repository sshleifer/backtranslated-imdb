Holy cow, what a piece of shit in this movie. I did not know how these directors could take a book of 250 words and turn it into a film. I think they did not know either! I do not remember that in the book were perdezhi and belching, is not it? <br /> <br /> They took it all the time for children's classics, added farting, belching and sexy Inuindo and turned it into a joke Kaki. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers think. I have to say visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that such things are funny), I don’t want the children I know to think it is. <Br /> <br /> Do not take children with you, do not rent a DVD. I hope that the ghost of Dr. Suess will come and haunt the people who made this film.
