One day my neighbor was renting this movie, so we watched it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually positive, because the entire film is shot in this bright, grainy texture after MTV. Fast sequences, steep angles, wide camera movements - at the moment when you feel that you want to watch another “jerk” at the moment ... <br /> <br /> When the plot really starts to unfold, it starts to feel, as if one overdose amphetamine. things just don't make sense anymore. I would not want to spoil the pleasure of watching it by distributing certain scenes, but, again, the film is so bad that you really should NOT watch it. <br /> <br /> At first you think this is a crime. The story is told in a conversation between Kira Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation does not provide any coherent narrative. Rather, the lesbian Domino came across character Lucy Liu during the second part of the film, which simply confuses the audience. <br /> <br /> Then I thought that maybe this was a film about a girl from a rich but dysfunctional background that became a tough bounty hunter. In any case, this is a message transmitted by the opening scenes. But after that, the question of the character of Domino is completely lost to the criminal conspiracy. In short, NO, this is NOT a movie about a Domino character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was probably the story of one robbery. Pretty bloody heist. 10 million were missing, bounty hunters chase suspected robbers, execute mafia children, put away their hands, Domino tries to hack why this time they have no certificates with awards, etc. But soon this impression dispelled another reversal of the plot. <br /> <br /> This time we are confronted with a sad story about an obese African American woman who forges a driver's license at a local Ministry of Interior, and at 28 she turns out to be the youngest grandmother. Stars Latishi on the Jerry Springer show are trying to publish some new stupid racial theory and at the same time trying to find money for their sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main plot? Well, well, no one knows. Except that the director had to explain to the audience where the headhunters would charge their collectors 300,000 in fees. <br /> <br /> Then at some point you start thinking: “Oh, this is about our society and media distorts "things." There is a reality show team driving with bounty hunters and doing some violent filming. Bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors who all the time whined that their noses were broken and they drag around too many crime scenes. oh NO, this is not a film about the media, they just appear sporadically throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many other side stories: a crazy Afghan guy seeking to liberate Afghanistan, a love story between Domino and Chocco, mescalin episode, FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> Can I mention all of the above in a movie in 2 hours? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - this is a real mess!
