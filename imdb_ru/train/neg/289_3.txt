What made the original Killer Tomatoes fun is that they were made by people without a budget who just fooled around for a couple of days ... <br /> <br /> It was something with a budget, but it just wasn't so much fun John Astin from Adams family glory makes an effort to be comedic, but he is supported by flimsy actors, cheap special effects and funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The plot. Dr. Gangrena (Astin) escapes from the French prison and decides that he is going to put the claimant to the throne of France ... The hero, his French girlfriend and the Gizmo-like "Fuzzy Tomato" decide to stop him ... Unforgettable nonsense right on the video ...
