It seems that now anyone can make a movie. It's like all you need is a camera, a group of people who will be your actor and film crew, a script, and some money, and you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation, and often such low-budget films turn out to be losers. Video store shelves are filled with these so-called films. This is not even a feeling of guilt, it is just a waste of celluloid, which is better to forget. Troma Entertainment is known for creating junk movies, but most of their films are cinema gold. However, some of the films they released had nothing to do with the creation, and some, such as “Nightmare Weekend,” did not deserve any form of release at all. <br /> <br /> Pros: actors do their best with lousy material. Some unintended gaiety. Moves at a good pace (follows 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Cons: a terrible letter, including rotten dialogues and countless holes in the plot. Badly lit, especially the night scenes and finale, which you can not see at all. It makes no sense. Bad scored. Cheap and very outdated effects. Complete lack of character development, and you will not take care of anyone. It is assumed that this is a horror film, but in this area it is not enough, and it is not at all terrible. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary stuffing. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I never expected it to be some kind of forgotten gem, but I never thought it would be so bad. I don’t know if this was the worst movie ever made, but it’s a definite rivalry. Troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release. Do not make the same mistake as me and let your curiosity overpower you. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
