For me, every work of art must be judged by the following criteria: form, function, and meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to the forms: good frames and sometimes interesting acting. Long close-ups offer a function that the viewer can perform himself. Due to the lack of texts, the story becomes a quiz. The introvert man offers to have depth, but sometimes it turns out that he has nothing to say. This film acts like an introvert. If you have not read the brief review, you will not see that suicide (and the unanswered question “Why?”) Changes Anna’s view of life and makes her suspicious. "Why are not you talking to me? asks Sebastian. Anna does not answer, she only begins to look at him for a long time, without saying a word. What is the function of this shot? What does it mean? My question is like that of Sebastian: what does this film say? What is meant by this film? The answer for me is: it shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their life is simple and boring. The motives of their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes. Beautifully and artistically done, but meaningless, without having "instructions for use." In my opinion, this film is made for colleagues, not for the general audience.
