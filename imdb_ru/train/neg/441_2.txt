We do not have this on television in England, but I watched it through the Internet on YouTube. It's stupid, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas Tennapel, I have never been keen on this cartoon, but I must admit that it is better than this one. The cartoonist hasn't done anything for many years. For Doug Tennapel, this is a return parody and a record low price! The story of three cats who inherit the house and a lot of money from their dead old lady-wizard. They argue and continue to disagree on what they want to spend their money on. "Boring"! The animation is terrible. The main characters should be cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Just strange monster-like animals with big mouths, sharp teeth and bulging eyes! Human and other animal characters are also terribly drawn! The theme of the song is terrible and annoying! In addition, the stories are inconclusive and most likely copied from old shows. I was surprised how this show got 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television is really not what it used to be! But now most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of you on the site may not agree with me, sorry, but this is a waste of money and a complete and total waste of your time, and you feel that Britain is too tolerant of this shit if you have digital, you should) but I do not so it's not my problem! Jonah! 2/10 (and I was very lucky to get it, because I gave the worst show!).
