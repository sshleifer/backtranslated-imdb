The film looks great on paper. A romantic comedy in which a mad lover gets sucked into a smuggling thriller should be the common gold to cross, especially with this magnificent romcom. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Lawrence Casdan just gives too much to his two stars, although the rope and they properly go and hang. The scenario of Adam Brooks may well be to blame, but you expect more from Kevin Klein from Water called the Fish. Instead, two ping-pongs from each other, and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never satisfactorily reconciled with the reason they both rush around France. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno amicably plays the role of a policeman with a Heart, and I think I would like him to be a star with a part. Keep in mind that he continued to do a remake (s) of the Pink Panther, so maybe he was fine with that ... 3/10
