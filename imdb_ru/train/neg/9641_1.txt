If you are watching this film, you are either a fan of Fred Deer Ray, you found it on the shelf for $ 4.99 at Suncoast and thought, â€œWhat am I supposed to lose? and made the first film that your finger touched. <br /> <br /> This film is hysterically bad. It has everything the horrible movie needs: a script with a stunning dialogue and incomprehensible workarounds in the plot, a wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through the wormhole in time and space, actors who are not only wooden , but it also seems to border on confused, useless nudity (not everything is what you would like to ask for), and, of course, the 5-inch monster, which, I believe, is played by Fred Olen Ray's child. <br /> <br /> Underneath it all, however, has something like a heart - as if Mickey and Judy decided to gather all the neighbors' children and make a movie with a monster (hey! My dad can do it! Yes! We can use the red paint from my father Johnny's Household Appliances Store, and I know this former stripper who can act in him!). <br /> <br /> Watch your reeling on loans - you will find out why the final version of the film was so shitty. <br /> <br /> By the way, Biohazard II ... Alien Force is also worth a look, but you should not have the same crappy veneer like this.
