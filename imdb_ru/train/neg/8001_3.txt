MONSTER - He was great; I liked the special effects that created this monster, which looked like an updated version of Creatures from the Black Lagoon. The scenes with this monster wandering the earth and exciting people ranged from good to stunning. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENT: Most of the history occurs in the field of quarantine, as doctors (by order of the government) claim that there is a disease similar to SARS. In a nutshell, we get a familiar government story of hiding. You know, I expect that this liberal-paranoid thinking with Hollywood films always portrays our government as corrupt, but it seems that Koreans are copying the format, and this is very tiring. Here, it takes away from the excitement and expectations of this "monster." It just pulls the movie down. The main family shown in the film should be viewed from a distance, while the young girl in their family, supposedly dead, was pulled out by this creature. <br /> <br /> MORAL: a typical "do not pollute the water message, because this is what can happen - a terrible mutated monster. Previously, it was a message about the atomic bomb, which appeared in 1950, when radiation caused in these fantastic scientific - fantastic films of giant ants, spiders, fish or something else. Now his "environmental issues" are in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> Humor It was mostly stupid. I usually laugh at the farce, but it was not funny. I don't know if the Korean sense of humor is so pitiful, or the film was deliberately trying It was going to be very trite, taking old Godzilla films. Let's hope this is the last one. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - the video went well. It was a clear image and the sound was decent, with a lot of noise in the rear columns. I watched it in Korean with English subtitles. This could be a mistake, as the sound of the Korean guttural voice became annoying in half an hour. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a promise, but it turned out to be a big disappointment and even boring in too many places that is unforgivable for a modern mon movie tra. Two hours was too long for this story. How this film attracted record crowds in Korea, I don't know. They should not have a lot of movies to enjoy and maintain.
