“A deadly look at love” is, in fact, a “fatal attraction” with the addition of a couple of turns in the back half. The finale will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three films of the week. This is another cautionary tale of resisting the temptation, and it does not add anything new to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who, as it turned out, has a significant trust fund. Despite the fact that he has everything, he risks losing everything by starting a double side story with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a blonde with blue eyes from Cedar Falls, falls heavily in love with Brett, and she doesn’t take it very well when he realizes his engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett is found dead in the main bedroom of a large luxurious house in which she shared with her new husband. When the police interrogate Brett, he quickly points his finger at Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to be becoming more and more crazy every minute - not that she used to be a model of stability. Her lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and obsessed with evidence. <br /> <br /> Did she do it or not? How will this end? You can find out the answers to these questions the next time the Deadly Look of Love will be aired on your local station. And do not miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
