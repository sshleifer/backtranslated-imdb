I just watched it because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and showed Claudio Cassinelli, the actor I love. I was, of course, disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that the convicts will fight to the death for television ratings, overdone with Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner and the new movie Death Race, which certainly sucks I entered because they are Jason's stars Statham <br /> <br /> This was just a bore for the most part. The “Kill a Bicycle” campaign was ridiculous. "Training" was a replay fest. It just never fascinated me or made me want to take care of anyone, including the Dallas star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others mentioned, and you will be better off.
