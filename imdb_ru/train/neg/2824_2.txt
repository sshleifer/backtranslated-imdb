I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Chaim, now an inexperienced star of the 80s, abusing drugs, as usual, is soft and comments on his back. from minor characters / actors would be meaningless; Needless to say, they were all very average. This is a cool film, like a trip to the memory lane in the 80s - with some strange clothes, good pictures against the background of Colorado and a very harmless, albeit stunning storyline. <br /> <br /> In general, please do not waste your time watching this, if you donâ€™t like 80s movies, Corey Haim or something like me, love the old school Porsche (this one in particular , looks great) because life is too short to watch shitty movies.
