A very stupid film filled with silly links and Jewish links. It was a serious film, but it should not be taken seriously. The familiar plot of the film ... To be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The brutal story with Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too regulated. I noticed that Al Pacino's acting skills seem to be declining. Trouble remover, but nothing more disturbing than Pacinoâ€™s dreadful Atlantic accent. Damage inspection should fix this damage to the film. Okay, my one-night coppers are bad, but not as bad as in this movie. This film can be not only boring, but also disgusting. Usually a disgusting movie can be watched for the wrong reasons. This movie is not available for viewing. I managed to sit through it. The plot, if you write it a little better, perhaps with a slightly better game and the elimination of the terrible plot and even more stupid jokes, could pull this thriller out of despondency. What we have left is a boring, stupid film that traced Eli Wurman to be a Jew. Embarrassment for all the good Jewish people everywhere.
