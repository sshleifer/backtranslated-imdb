First, let's get this out of the way. Yes, this film steals a lot from Waterfall of Darkness (2003). The plot of "The Falls of Darkness" looks like this: the Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman hiding her face due to disfigurement, kills people who look at her for revenge. In The Tooth Fairy (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (which, yes, hides its face) brings its fierce revenge to almost everyone. Too much like a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But you need to ask the following question: if you are going to directly steal the exact plot from the film, why choose something as mediocre as “The Fall of Darkness”? ? Of course, he earned a few dollars at the box office, but it was a purely theatrical impression of the film. A low-budget, direct video movie will not have the same effect. And it is not. <br /> <br /> When I watched the first 15-20 minutes of the film, my expectations actually increased. There seemed to be at least SOME production value. The story did not seem terrible, just plain frustrated. In the first episode, we see good characters, including a former doctor with secrets (played by the guy who looks like Busie) and a hot veterinary student (Jennifer from “The Master of Horror Argento: Jennifer”). However, after these few minutes the film just slowly goes down the drain. He serves all the main horrible cliches, including but not limited to: some crazy old man with an inattentive warning, a lover of a dull jockey, a psychic and a stripper with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems of this film was its inability to stick to the target audience. This is similar to how the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for any character who was on the screen at the time. When adults were on the screen, they had a more mature feeling. When Star (stripper) and whatshisface (jock) were on the screen, the dialogue moved to a more stupid, mistakenly immature level. When the child was on the screen, it was like the episode "Are you afraid of the dark?". just less scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, film is everywhere. Visual effects range from pretty good to boring. The letter is poor quality, as is the acting skills for the most part. On the positive side, there are some excessive bleeding in details (including a rather steep (but painfully predictable) scene of a woodcutter and a rather cruel scene with a nail. In addition, if you are looking for something sexy, there is a small topless scene (but if you want to see this topless chick, there are better films to do this). Other than that, there’s nothing to worry about in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of the Falls of Darkness (do they exist?), you can probably check it out. to see the story differently. but this is the only reason I can see it. <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: 3/10 -AP3-
