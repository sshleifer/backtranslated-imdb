1999 will go down in history as the year when a film critic confused the public. At first they sent us to STEP EYES. Then they launched BLAIR WITCH and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst film of the year. What is it about? Who the hell knows. This is full of pampering and loaded with a bad game. I always like to stay and watch loans, but when it was over, I could not get out of the cinema quickly enough. Most of the viewers who attended the show, which I attended, felt the same way. Dates were arguing with each other, as well as with strangers. This is an ugly and hateful movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
