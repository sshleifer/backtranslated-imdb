Like all movies about Carnosaurs, this is a joke. The way dinosaurs move reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls, because they can't be tougher or more fake than they were. <br /> <br /> The plot had no meaning. I mean, first they are on the bus, then in the warehouse, and then suddenly on the boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a pair of dinosaurs can stay together on a van or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit in a moving van. It sounds silly, even if you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I put this figure is that it is still interesting. I found it better than the first (not yet watched the second). Just don't give up. I saw it on TV and this is a good thing I did because I would not want to spend money on rent.
