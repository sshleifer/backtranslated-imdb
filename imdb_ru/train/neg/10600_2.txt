I will be honest. The only reason I watched this movie on TV is because it’s at the bottom of the IMDb 100. And now I’m wondering if my hour and a half worth of my life was worth another “check” on the same list. <Br /> <br /> Van Damme is Luke Devereaux, who has entered into a serious fight with universal soldiers after the main computer pulled out HAL to protect himself. And yes, after all the obligatory explosions, shootings and chases, he is the last one on his feet. Combined with a terrible game and a little boring tuning, he ensures that his place on the infamous list is simple. <br /> <br /> Only for idiots like me who want to see this complete list. 2/10.
