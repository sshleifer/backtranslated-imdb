It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was really expecting a bad movie, but I was caught off guard, believe it or not. The plotline is traditional, all clichés are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so poorly written that you even laugh at the half-stage actors trying to make it sound real. The photo is not too good, the music is so bad that it actually makes me angry, the actors don't even try, although the script makes it almost impossible to expect more from people who have been acting for 30 years and the so-called action scenes really lack the “action” ". <br /> <br /> I don’t understand why such bad movies keep appearing, who finances this shit? Where is the screening? And why would the actors take on this impossible mission scenario? <br /> <br /> In this genre, there are a million Hollywood films, even without seeking to get to the cinema, but even those things that can be watched directly in “Video” really manage to watch Professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can’t say anything positive about this, except for a name that explains everything, I feel taken away in 2 hours of my life.
