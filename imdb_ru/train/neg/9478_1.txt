If there was some strange inverted Oscar Academy Awards festival, this film would have won it all. There are all the gods, a great plot, extreme special effects combined with extremely good acting skills and, of course, there is a celebrity superstar in every role. Well, this could be a scenario if the world was turned upside down, but it is not. Instead, this is the worst horror movie ever made, not only by bad actors who seem to read scripts from a teleprinter with poor dyslexia, but also extremely low levels of special effects. For example, the devil costume (which, by the way, is a must-see), is one of the most fun ones I have ever seen. Whenever I saw this red-black so-called monster on the screen, I could not help laughing. And, to top it all off, it seemed that the funny creature was transported using a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake as me. Checking IMDB, seeing that the film was released in 2003, had less than five votes, and thought: “Well, it's worth it, it can't be so bad.” <br /> <br /> Yes, it can. /> <br /> I'm not even going to waste more words on this movie.
