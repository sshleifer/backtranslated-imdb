I think that Elizabeth Rum, although she can try hard, is not very good at all. I guess it was because of the budget, that she might have been the only one they could get for this price. I mainly watched him on the performance of Myron Natvik, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most plausible and, without a doubt, the most convincing to watch. When it was not on the screen, this thing died. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me goosebumps, but be sure that in real life he is a kind, cheerful, compassionate person. He even said that this role gave him goosebumps. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™ll see something with him, but Elizabeth Rom - never again. It was as exciting as the law of order and order. Maybe a very good man, but not an actress.
