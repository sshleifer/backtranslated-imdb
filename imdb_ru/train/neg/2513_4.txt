When I first saw this film, I thought that it had to come from the children's section - it is very fun, and sometimes funny, and actually a pretty good story, but it lacks the “romantic chemistry” that such actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to deliver. I must point out that Walter Mattaw is perfect for the role of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but this is the only exception. This film looks a bit intrusive, the directing lacks content, and, oh, yes ... the music is ridiculously awful, this is not a very good mood. But if you do not expect a clever, well-thought-out comedy / romantic story, then this can certainly be interesting, as I said ... it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense desire to steal the heart of Meg Ryan. A very controversial film, but as long as it is not taken seriously, it can be a good film.
