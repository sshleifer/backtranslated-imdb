Oh my god, that was so bad! The story was weak — at best — and the animation was flat and lifeless — even childish. This film takes itself too seriously ... unless, of course, they wanted to be funny. I saw it last week at the London Fiction Festival, and the whole audience laughed at every scene. I think my favorite was “don't you study medicine at Oopsalof”! And I also think that they tried to see how many times they could squeeze into a single line of the character of Nikal “we will be together ... this is our destiny”. Sorry, but after the first time the words have lost all meaning. <br /> <br /> And what about the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend this as a lesson for Americans: you cannot revive, so please do not try. You just confuse yourself.
