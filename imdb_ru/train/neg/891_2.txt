I really liked the film “Paris, Je T'aime”, and I very much expected this film, and, I confess, I had high hopes, but I was very disappointed for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I did not expect a reinterpretation of "Paris" in New York, I expected the same structure. What I liked about Paris was the breakdown of quarters. You understand the style of each director and the story they wanted to tell. In New York, there is no clear division of stories; in different parts of the film, characters from different stories collide with each other, which leads me to confusion about who I see and what exactly is happening. In addition, the change of direction was obvious, but confusing, since there was no flow. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked in the film “Paris” is different views on love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely middle-aged woman, thirsting for love, etc., She explored many layers of the complexity of love between people. "New York" seemed to go only on acute sexual sexuality. There were several redeemed shorts (the older couple spent their whole lives together, Julie Christie was short), but overall, the movie 'NY' did not cause me any emotion. I have not contacted any of the characters, as with "Paris". I remember watching “Paris” and felt deep sadness, loneliness, longing, hope, surprise ... he just had so much soul. For me in the movie "New York" was not a soul. <br /> <br /> Maybe, if I had entered this without seeing “Paris” in the depths of my brain, for comparison this film could have produced a more favorable response, but as a repetition of the same name, “Bet Je T'aime “I was very disappointed.
