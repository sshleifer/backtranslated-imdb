Cannon reflected the real visual beauty of the medieval epic, which seems fascinating (with the exception of the dragon's prop). Now, how did the old studio, known from the films of Chuck Norris, generally face for the first time with a complete lack of knowledge? A case in point: an amateur game and a horrible plot is a sign that the revival of a medieval legend is not a cure for some lousy execution. They actually went further and made another cheap exploiter with hundreds of lascivious toys to make this image even better. As for the two “barbarian brothers,” they probably know how to make strange sounds, how to become brave warriors, strong and brave enough to save their native land. This is the biggest waste of potential that I saw in the “expensive” low-budget film, and even worse for the ax to mercilessly hit the gorgeous prints. All this followed an advertising campaign selling T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS! One movie makes a great souvenir!
