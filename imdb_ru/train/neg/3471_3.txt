there were more holes in this film than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck did NOT seriously try to act in any way, in any form. He just sucked. Nothing in the film was believable. The first problems were in the introduction, when a person gives all the valuable things of the Salvation Army to Santa Claus, but does not show why. And then the grandmother shoves her head in the oven - really beautiful, and absolutely has nothing to do with the film - it is not even in the same tone as the film. There was no explanation of the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose; there were no believable reactions from the family he chose; and people hesitate here and there for no reason to be rocked (Example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's heroines roll down a steep slope - a case that makes her suddenly fall in love with him. It was a funny moment or two - but were rare in the film. It seriously needed another rewriting (or 4). Hope you have fun!
