I tried to watch this so-called comedy, but it is very difficult to bear. This is a bad, narrow-minded, played a clich√© film. Definitely not funny, but very boring and annoying. Bad script, bad game. This is a waste of time - and there is nothing more to be afraid of. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
