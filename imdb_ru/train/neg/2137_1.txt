Even the first 10 minutes of this film were terrifying. It’s hard to believe that anyone but John Cusack would invest money in it. With a series of anti-war / anti-war films that have already been destroyed at the box office, it is almost impossible to imagine that a studio of any kind would want to associate itself with this scenario. <br /> <br /> At first it may have seemed like a kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Aroyd and Cusack (s) over and over. But just 90 seconds after the beginning of the film, it becomes obvious that this is a worthless attempt at DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I liked so many Cusack films that I decided to take a chance on watching the DVDs of this film. I have to say that I don’t know if Cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another role in which he played the main role again if someone else cannot vouch for it. It seems that Cusack has so irreparably suffered from his hatred of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq, that he is ready to commit career suicide. Tom Cruise has never been so close. Not even close.
