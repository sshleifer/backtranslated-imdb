A feature film (it lists stories based on history, although it has a “documented” credit) about a group of scientists traveling to the wilds of Canada to try to find a snowman. device). A lot of scientific stupid songs are mixed in what is really boring about people wandering in the desert. There are several attempts to create tension and scare, but, to be honest, there is nothing worth seeing outside of some great pictures of wildlife. This is the perfect definition of a movie about exploitation, it promises so much to you, to look at the snowman, but in fact it gives very little. Recommended only for insomnia patients.
