It's hard to believe how Rick Sloane managed to make five films than cold fusion. This film is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie, I thought “Manos: Hands of Destiny” is the worst piece of shit I've ever seen, but at least Manos is moving so slowly that you can fall asleep, thereby saving your eyes from pain, which he will suffer. The greatest tragedy of this film is that the old man who holds the Hobgoblinov locked up, gets into the final scene. The time I spent watching this film was a complete waste of my life.
