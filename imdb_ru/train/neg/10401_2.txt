Dear dear dear dear dear ... me! I had the strength to figure it out ... But why ?! <br /> <br /> The first two films were funny and actually quite good. But it is so bad that we had problems viewing all of this. It was some kind of tremor for children. I can not believe that this film was made at all ... it looks like a prop taken from some bad western series (for children), and they just did everything they could with it. <br /> <br /> What is the audience for this film? I can only think of 12-14 years. If you are older than 14 years old, you will have serious problems with this film. It is not only slow, but also so boring. The characters overdid it (not only a little) and were stereotypical, it's fun for a while ... but not long enough to make you throw tomatoes on the screen. You know everything that should happen, because yes ... you have seen this BILLION earlier in any series of heroes on children's television. I chose all the survivors and the entire tremor as soon as the characters met. It's so bad .. so wrong .. so ... crap. <br /> <br /> But well, we laughed from time to time. Not only in stupid plot holes, but also in some scenes where it is worth replaying either two ... or one scene where two baby shivers rush at one of the obvious guys with a tremor. This is a really great scene that made us replay it over and over and laugh sincerely. Still makes me smile when I think about it. But this happened only one more time, unfortunately ... and that's when the fierce fighter discovered and miraculously replays his part ... this and one comment: "They arise from the ground, like some DEMONIC WORKS!" At that moment we almost cried with laughter. But after that ... nothing can surpass it ... (?) .. so it is pretty much down. <br /> <br /> So the tops here are demonic forts and replaying. If anyone ever tells you that this is a good movie ... it’s either a “plant” or a vegetable, or someone very evil. This film should be the worst of the jolts to date. I look forward to seeing Tremors 3, it will be the box office compared to this ... this ... * goosebumps * no .. I will leave it at that.
