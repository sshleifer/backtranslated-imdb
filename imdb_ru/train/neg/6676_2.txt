I may not have been Blair Witch’s biggest fan, but nevertheless appreciated these efforts, so I was looking forward to Change, especially after reading the superlatives cast in various IMDb comments. “Unique”, “intelligent”, “Classic of the future cult” and so on ... you need to wonder where people come up with such things to describe such meager efforts. <br /> <br /> Because, alas, Altered is a bad, weak film that does not show any respect. Stupidity is not funny. Horror and blood are not terrible. And no matter how “thinking” aspect some poor creatures saw in this film, it was associated with serious misconceptions, because there is nothing deep or clever in this mess. <br /> <br /> Good, so we know that nothing stands out. Is it even tolerable? Is it worth the experience in any way? Unfortunately not. To begin with, a very bad acting game. This is not to say that most bi-films these days show the best acting. Plot? Boring and dirty. Dialogues? Many lovers actually do better. <br /> <br /> This is really a direction that is puzzling. I did not expect significant improvements over Blair Witch, but at least I made some small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have deteriorated over time, completely ignoring previous experience. <br /> <br /> If Altered has a serious flaw, then this is the main set. Most of the plot takes place in one place where the main characters are limited, but Sanchez could not give this place any individuality. Given that in the Blair Witch, the forest plays an important role and is the same character (antagonist, if you will), like three students, you might think that the director will understand that the same thing is needed here. But no ... this place has no individuality due to the careless direction and lack of attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There is nothing suitable for salvation. Ruthless Blair Witch fans better follow Daniel Mirik. Although his results are far from golden, he demonstrates a better structure than Sanchez, and some lessons from the Blair Witches apply (unfortunately, in weak stories, but still).
