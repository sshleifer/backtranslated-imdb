Do not drink composure. <br /> <br /> This is an opinion disguised as a documentary. And to call it “truth” is just crap. The global warming controversy is far from over and will end only when eco-zombies begin to recognize a mountain of evidence contrary to their favorite theory. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science", and you will find a river of information that refutes almost every link in the chain of logic of Gore sites. The reason why self-education is so important for people is the catastrophic economic impact that global warming measures can have. Wake up people. Anyone who has a computer, a little time and common sense, can find many reasons why this theory is not even close to trust. Do not just read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis to do, in fact. The theory simply has too many alternative possibilities and counter-evidence to have even the most basic level of scientific certainty. In fact, it is so unbelievable that it can be the greatest deception in the course of human existence. The time has come for people to begin to oppose this kind of propaganda, and the time has come for people to recognize themselves and others, that you can also be a defender of nature, and recognize the obvious conclusion that hysteria of global warming is a big lie.
