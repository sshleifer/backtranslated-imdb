The "House of the Spirits" is pretty terrible. I live in South America, in a country where a military dictatorship has suffered, similar to the one that the film is trying to describe, and although everyone knows that films may be far from reality, this particular film views viewers as ignorant and stupid. Everything is not as simple and linear as it seems here, and, of course, the political process is much more complicated and interesting than the plot in “The House ...”. If you cannot show this complexity on the screen, it’s better not to make a film at all. There are many examples of how to be serious about politics in cinema, without so many common places. In some places, I felt that Carmen Miranda could appear among parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things, you must not only be careful, but also respect the intelligence of your audience.
