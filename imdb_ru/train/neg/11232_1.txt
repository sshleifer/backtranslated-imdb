It's so sad. Despite the fact that it was filmed with a film, I think it stinks a bit more than films like Blood Lake, There's nothing there. The music they play in it is the most fun thing I've ever heard. I like the brother and sister in this film. They both do not really try to seem sarcastic when they say something like “My friends will be so jealous!” Hey, what about the killer who wore a mask in the beginning? This is retarded! I practically ignored the other half of this. My favorite part of this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer uses an ax. Exactly the same sound for each chop!
