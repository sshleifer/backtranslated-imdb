This film has a lot of problems with it, which makes it look like a low-budget class project from someone in a film school. I have to give him credit for his civility, though. Many times throughout the whole film I laughed hysterically. Sometimes it was so bad that it was funny, which made them a fun time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a low-budget film-slash with psychological horror and a little ridiculous funny Then insert a bowl of popcorn, invite friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other remarks that the sound is very bad. The dialogue is almost impossible to follow most of the time, and the soundtrack seems to be there.
