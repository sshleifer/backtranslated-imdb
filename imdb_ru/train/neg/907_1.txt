I wrote a review of this film below, after I bought it on DVD and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch it again, after reading a few comments made since then. Being a student of the film and making similar budget films on my own (i.e., without a budget, shot on a digital camera), I stick to my initial comments. This is not a budget student project (and not particularly good) released on video / DVD in order to look like an award-winning film (if you are reading the cover). Thus, deceiving the public, she thinks that it is not. I want to return my money in accordance with the act of describing transactions! Full trash!
