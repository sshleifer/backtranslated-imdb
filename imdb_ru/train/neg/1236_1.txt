What happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he did a typical summer fodder that anyone from a film school could manage ... and in fact, they probably would have done a better job. They would at least put half of the thought in a horrible script. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some kind of wormhole and landed on a monkey-driven planet. (gasping!) With the exception of this time, the monkeys twist because of the decent moan of dialogue, senseless conspiracies and spectacular special effects, which constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could be invested in about 10 independent films that could be considered. ” masterpiece next to this prank. <br /> <br /> No matter how much I like the excellent acting talent of Tim Roth, his acting as the evil leader of monkeys Teid is nothing more than an intense composition with a stoop and heavy breathing. Fortunately for him, the make-up allows him as an actor to preserve some dignity, and most of the crappy dialogues lie behind his moans and ridicule. <br /> <br /> And, alas, the always reliable Hollywood tradition of taking men and women leads and connects them at the end without any development of relationships or reason. And "haha, we're so smart, aren't we?" Thus, Hollywood mixes links from the original POTA into this one. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this, spend the night and call some friends and rent “Ed Wood”, “Edward Scissorhands”, “Batman” or, to a lesser extent, “ Sleepy". Emptiness, ”and remember the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... and not shame and ridicule.
