6/10 Acting, not very good, but good. <br /> <br /> 4/10 The director makes some stupid decisions for this film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, the story does not make sense at all and has a huge number of flaws. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overall rating of this film. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this film, and it may be too much. Characters are so exaggerated than they can be in real life, and some rather inexplicable things happen “in plot”, not in a good way. Because of the style in which this film was shot, you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow movements and camera shake and fast forward movements). It is always good that the film uses music to make the story smooth, but there are too many tracks in this film. In the first hour almost 50/50 dialogs and music
