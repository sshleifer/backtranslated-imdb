I saw this film in my international cinema class and I was extremely excited. This film is nothing but one scene of blatant shock after the next. <br /> <br /> The fourth person talks about the alcoholic writer Rebe, who has visions of his impending danger. He meets a woman named Christina when giving a lecture at a local book club, and decides to stay with her only when he finds out how attractive her boyfriend is. Simply put, Riva likes Dutch sausage. So, Reeve comes up with a plan to seduce Christine's boyfriend so that he can eventually have sex with him. But later it turned out that Christina had 3 previous husbands, whom she had killed all. Now Reeve and Christina's boyfriend can be the “4th person.” The storyline makes sense without holes in the plot. Editing and everything else that is technical in this film is wonderful. The film is only rough, and I felt the need to tear in some parts. In fact, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Reeve getting out of bed in a T-shirt. So at the very beginning, you see how the lovely Pecker Rive flops when he walks through his cramped apartment in a state of hangover. Later he had a dream where scissors were cut off with his knife, and they show him along with the fountain of blood that follows. The roar caresses the statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in the mausoleum. Plus a lot of blood. More blood than all the films about Freddy Krueger combined. <br /> <br /> Not that I had anything against the “shocking” scenes, but this film is so blatant when it comes to shocking. The whole film revolves around the meaning of shock. <br /> <br /> So if something from this is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far far away from this. My mind is still scarred.
