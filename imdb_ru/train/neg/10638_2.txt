Proof that not everything that concerns Tarantino, turns into gold. This is definitely plastic, completely. It is easy to see that without Quentin's participation, he would probably have been on the shelf for years, that is, he assumed that he would have been produced at all. We are talking about a woman with the charm of death, who arranges for cleaning up after the crime scenes, Angela Jones is not convincing in this role, William Baldwin is better than the serial killer who keeps Jones at work! All in all, rather poor.
