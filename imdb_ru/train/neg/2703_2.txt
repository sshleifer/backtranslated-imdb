LITTLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I just sat up late and watched this movie, mainly because I liked and appreciated some of Singleton's early work as "Boyz n the hood". However, I have to say that it was a big disappointment, and that’s all I hate in the contrived, cliché, so-called “messages” of films. <br /> <br /> Acting is basically bad (pop stars and models don't necessarily make good actors ... pay attention), difficult situations to swallow (rape victim becomes a lesbian overnight? ... please! ), but worst of all, it reinforces every broken stereotype that you can think of. By the second half of the film, he became cartoony, as in his characterization, because of what you lose all the sympathy for your one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> No valid comment has ever been made on the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it simply ends with a sensation of the results of these problems. This message is contradictory, which leads to confusion and a general lack of cohesion of the plot. As for the output of the films, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and slightly offensive. For a film called Higher Education, I have to say that all I learned is to avoid seeing it ever again. <br /> <br /> If you want to get a true commentary on some topics that this film is completely unable to work through then hire “American History X” .... unless you watched it for Tyra Banks, then hire a life .
