I made this movie tonight because it looked like a funny movie. I thought that you really could not go wrong with the concept of a former girlfriend with supernormal abilities. <br /> <br /> ... but the film was confusing and meaningless ... <br /> <br /> it seemed that at every step the writer was throwing garbage. Also, the writer also threw a lot of toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenager could love. <br /> <br /> It seems that it would be so easy to draw a story from a superhero "Deadly Attraction" ... but I think not. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny romantic comedy about which it was advertised. You could not take the child to see it, and you would be embarrassed to see this date. <br /> <br /> If the author could write the main story about the high concept and clear it - the film could have a chance to win. <br /> <br /> Serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> b
