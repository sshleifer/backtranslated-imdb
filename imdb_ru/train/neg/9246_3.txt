I refused to watch it when it originally went on the air, keeping the memory of the last episodes of the 1960s with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I was never able to withstand the challenges. I should have known better. Not quite a remake and rather a parody than a tribute, this series did not know how to play, and is full of infantile comedy and animated scenes and characters. The three main characters were nothing more than caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could play (Bob Mortimer hurts to play a direct role). The supporting cast were just familiar comedians of Vic and Bob, who wanted to be part of the joke and were too aware of the situation to be convincing. And CGI, although the effects could not help improve those that were available 30 years ago, just hit the viewer with light and camera work, and did little to disguise the poor quality of scenarios and dialogue. The whole style and no content. (Although the 1960s show scoffs at the fact that it is very time consuming, this “update” is now also very outdated, with the fashion in the “Matrix” style, the obligatory scenes of “female power” and less than subtle tension between the two leads.
