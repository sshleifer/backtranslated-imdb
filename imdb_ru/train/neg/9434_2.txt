Banned in the UK as the “Video Nasty”, Unhinged naturally gained a lot of ill fame. However, the most shocking thing I found in the film was his amateur work in all departments. The bloody bloodshed I could cope with: a terrible game, crappy editing, a terrible guide, a lousy script and a terrible soundtrack were much harder to take. <br /> <br /> Three girls heading to a music festival crashed into a ravine during a thunderstorm. They were saved by a friendly stranger who took them to a nearby house. The owner of the house, an old batting lady and her kind daughter, greet the girls, allowing them to stay for a few days to recover. However, someone does not want girls to leave ever! One by one they become victims of an invisible attacker. <br /> <br /> Having spent a lot of time starting to perform, and having shown some of the worst performances in a horror movie (and you need to spend some time on it), Unhinged is really a terrible movie. Music is a complete mess (it sounds like a three-year-old child was released on a synthesizer), and therefore it perfectly complements the film. Only a couple of bloody scenes at the end and a little unreasonable nudity save Unheded from getting as few points as possible. <br /> <br /> If you are terrible full (and, unfortunately, I), you will want to watch this to mark it on the Video Nasty watch list. But be careful - this is really very bad.
