A really awful movie, shot by a cinematographer who became director Ted Tetzlaff. A decent enough film, but for a movie with a time bomb, completely devoid of any tension. Ford, as someone said here, is sleepwalking, although this one with its characteristic grin. There are some details thrown around - the former army of Canada or the RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife leaves him - but none of these prehistories amount to much. The bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up this batch of mines? By the way, what time period are we talking about here? World War II or post-war ?? I suggested the latter, which makes the motif of the bomber even more noticeable. Actually, the truth is just a terrible movie. There are a lot of good time bomb clicks to skip this one. Watch any episode of "Danger UXB" at a more exciting time, around the same time.
