***** THIS REVIEW MAY BE USED - but this determination would be insignificant in such a classic and famous story ***** <br /> <br /> The story of CINDERELLA is considered to be my favorite fairy tale. The world will never have enough of this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. This may not work if the story is rejected or is trying to throw some interesting ideas along with some kind of magical photo and stunning production design with bad direction and editing. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is more like the Ugly Duckling who never hatches or, rather, never turns into a swan. <br /> <br /> All production values ​​that can be bought for money cannot acquire good cinematic time and dramatic development — or good play. <br /> <br /> The entrance of Cinderella at a ball so badly done, there was no waiting drama, no excitement from the discovery. <br /> <br /> The letter made me very nervous too. The charming prince was the most unwelcome of memories. Why does any girl want to marry a boorish prince who does not like women? <br /> <br /> Turner's turn to the stepmother's role was an embarrassingly painful show that showed a single line longer than the actual nuance. <br /> <br /> Even the role of Cinderella did not arouse much interest or sympathy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt: the 90s are so cheap, <br /> <br /> What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excesses is a great photo, a matte job and production design. It was nice to see the scenery, scenery and scenery as the story progresses. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella stories, you need to choose two gems: <br /> <br /> 1) Rogers and Hammerstein's “Cinderella”. with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious stage television - 60s view on televisions, this is the best version on celluloid - without exception. Star composition will make every effort to provide the highest entertainment. Entertaining, distracting and memorable composition and music. This is a classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Ever - this gem of Drew Barrymore retains a historical perspective, changes the storyline, but not enough to thwart the effective development of the essential moments of this classic story. The characters of the main and all auxiliary roles were written intelligently and acted well.
