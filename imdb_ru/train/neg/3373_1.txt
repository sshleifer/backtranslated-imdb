I was lucky to see “Pripevskaya Line” when she came to my city ... I was younger then ... but it was a great play ... so, someone, please tell me why, in heaven, they made a movie of it .. Why is Michael Douglas ??? He was not suitable for this role .. this film really took a LOT of time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is NOT to shoot this film .. save your money on something better, like "Cats" ....
