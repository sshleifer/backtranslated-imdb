The film seems incoherent and generally poorly written. The script moves as if it was written by 10 different people, and none of them spoke with each other. Obviously, they wanted to take a page from the movie “Miracle on 34th Street” (original), but this is done so badly that the movie is falling apart. This film is intended only for the very young, and even THEY will see the fact that the one who wrote it knows almost nothing about baseball. For example: <br /> <br /> ?? When the angels are in the dead last place, the owner does not seem to care, and it does not bother the fact that his manager just had a fight with a jug ?? On the mountain ?? or that he has recruited a team game by announcing a game on the air. However, when a team wins a Division in one game, it loses form because of the story (from a 6-year-old child) that the manager receives help from a child who claims to have seen real angels. What sounds worse? Losing a cruel out of control manager whose team lost 15 in a row? Or is the trainer-winner on the verge of a playoff who is a bit eccentric and helps to raise children? The reaction of the owner does not make sense. And he decided to change his mind from Maggie and her speech “straight from the cliché” during a press conference. <br /> <br /> ?? It is assumed that the angels will play for the Division in the final series of the weekend against the White Sox, but at the end of the game the announcer continues to say that the angels "won the pennant". The pennant is not defined until someone wins the LIGI Championship, and not the name of the regular season division. <br /> <br /> ?? Whitt Bass, the jug of the little fool is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the angels bad luck? - then this is the starting pitcher? DAY. <br /> <br /> ?? Mel Clark (Tony Danza) said that in the ninth inning he threw 156 innings in a low-scoring game. As a rule, in games with a low score, the number of steps is MUCH lower than that usually around 80-90 pitches. <br /> <br /> ?? “AL,” says the angel at the end, “Championships must be won on their own,” although he and his angels manipulated and corrected games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, as there are MANY other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> This film can be interesting for children under 10 years old. This is very bad ?? done right, it could be a classic. Made wrong as it is, and it is a memorable mess that will always live like washing the UHF / Cable on a Saturday morning.
