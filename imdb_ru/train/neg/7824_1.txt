I saw the movie last night, and I really wanted me to like it. My expectations of the film have been growing since I heard it being filmed. Some days I saw something exciting, and sometimes I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I was a fan of his, I had high hopes for this film, but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I like Richard Donner’s films, I didn’t like their impetuous nature or the changes they made to Superman’s character and power. <br /> <br /> However, Singer decided to take the worst elements of Donner films and put them in his version. <br /> <br /> Although his Lex Luthor is a bit darker, he is still nothing more than a jester, a crook and a common criminal. He is no more clever than when Gene Hackman played him. Kevin Spacey is trying his best to play Luthor well, but in the end he becomes a victim of a crappy letter and an inconspicuous dialogue. <br /> <br /> His minions are more two-dimensional than even the minions from the comics. Most of them literally have no dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD ***** Kitty Kowalski is almost the same character as Ms. Tesmacher. She seems to be as evil and cold as Lex Luthor, but she turns out to be just a subordinate who melts after seeing Superman in trouble, and quite predictably betrays Luthor. <br /> <br /> Frank Langella was the biggest disappointment in the film. Perry White. I was not a big fan of the excessive Perry White in Donner films, but at least he had a soul. After all he said and did, a veteran reporter who cared about truth and a good story. Perry White Langella is nothing more than a corporate puppet. He wants everyone to focus on the stories about Superman, because they sell newspapers, although every other newspaper does the same. He doesn’t care about real stories, real mysteries, such as darkness, and what Lex Luthor planned so far when he got out of prison. <br /> <br /> The worst thing in Langella is that he is Dull! Some actors may be quiet and sober, but at the same time they have an undercurrent that lets you know that calm waters flow deeply. Frank Langella - a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Ruth is not a bad actor. He is fine, but again, there is not a single memorable line in the whole film. Not the fault of the actor. His movements obviously should look graceful, as if even the slightest movement of his fingers affects how he flies. But it still looks choreographic and artificial. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, while poorly written, was surprisingly well played by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again, for a journalist and a writer who won the Pulitzer Prize, she is about as eloquent as any teenager on Dawson Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was my favorite actor throughout the film, mainly because he looks more like Superman than even Ruth. Without any supernormal abilities, he manages to find out the message of Lois Lane, flies an airplane to the place, sits on Luthor's yacht and saves Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> The only touching moment in the film is when they all captured the storeroom, because it is flooded with water, and the ship sinks. You see how they slowly sink into the water. You know that Superman is going to come at the last moment to save them, but still you can't help but feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is very messy. Unlike Singer, this is not a film about the return of a superhero and trying to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns, the world will meet him again with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy about his return. Even Luthor is glad that Superman is back, because it gives him a chance to get even with the steel man. <br /> <br /> Superman is probably one of the silliest heroes in the universe. A large green piece of meteorite stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor was released from prison, he now knows about Superman's strengths and weaknesses, and yet he still cannot connect the dots enough to realize that Luthor will use kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the film, Superman is only good for lifting really heavy things. The sequence of actions is incredibly predictable.
