The cover (with the image of a man holding a scary gun in his hands) will create the impression that this is a martial arts film. (Hardly.) <br /> <br /> I wonder if the real name of the film is “Trojan Warrior”. (Troyan is a condom brand in the USA). This film is filled with homoeroticism. If you like these things, then this movie is not so bad. However, pay attention to the following points: <br /> <br /> There are many close-ups of the groins and the asses of the actors (in one scene even each actor with a convex erection in his pants is depicted.) The film also bathes in tasteless colors like lime , peach and red. From the point of view of the cinematographer, this film is a transvestite! In several scenes, the characters stand EXTREMELY close to each other, occasionally touching each other. In addition, the hero's cousin loves women, and every guy in the film tries to kill him. Is there something that filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Should I go to the battle scenes? (Yes, someone's personal belongings clutch in one battle.) The scenes of martial arts are short and unimaginable. There is nothing unusual here, just your standard movements, which you would see in the old Chuck Norris film. There is also a car chase scene, which may be the first ever low-speed race captured on film.
