After reading many of the comments here, I am surprised that no one recognized this as a basically too long remake of the 1960 Twilight Zone episode entitled Mirror Image with Vera Miles in the title role. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective creepy story in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis in 88 minutes with this tedious repetition. The short piece can be effective with a mysterious and inexplicable ending, but the feature film should have a little more content and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, the essence and meaning - two things that are missing in the "Broken". Yes, he has a few points, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some further observations: although this is clearly a modern story, not a single character in the film has a mobile phone! And although a car accident is an event that develops this story, neither the insurance company is mentioned, nor the person who drove the other car, nor the police, who would have to make a report. My advice: skip this feed and watch the original!
