Only a couple of days are left before the championship, but in New Orleans, everything is not as it should be. From players with family problems to drug overdose, from gambling problems to the killer at large, life interferes with what must be an unforgettable, wonderful time. Can you put things in order and kill the killer before the big game collapses? <br /> <br /> Despite what you think when you first read about the Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a plot device and an afterthought. Instead, the Superdome is another one of those lousy 70s TV shows created for Hollywood-populated televisions and never will be. The actors lunate their way through the thing, and no one looks good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role, looking generally lost, why he is there. The plot is boring, uninteresting and incredible. Donna Mills as a hit man? Yes, right! It's as believable as her love affair with a drink soaked in by David Jansen. The film also lacks speed. Attempting to insert all four or five storylines into a movie kills the stream Superdome might have. Without any drama or suspense, the Superdome turns out to be a very bad example of a 70s movie made for television. The only highlight for me was the voice acting of the late Charlie Jones - a sports actor whom I miss listening. The eloquent way in which he exaggerates the intrigue and exaggerates the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese in all its glory. <br /> <br /> Like most others who have seen the Superdome, I also did this thanks to the Mystery Science Theater 3000. This may be one of the episodes of KTMA open access, but this is one of the best examples of an early start to the show. So, although I rated the Superdome only 2/10, I will give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
