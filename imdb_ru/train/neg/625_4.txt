With all the excessive violence in this film, it could be NC-17. But the blood could be pg-13, and there were quite a few curses when my mother had a real girlfriend with bad hair. There was a lot of character development, thanks to which the film began to look better, and then, when the child returned to life as a scarecrow, the insane hour came and ten minutes of his killing people. The violence was excessively excessive, and I think that the number of people was above twelve, which is a lot for films like this one. Almost every character in the film was stabbed or cut off his head, but the teacher who called him “white trash” and “hooligan” (although the character is not a hooligan, not even close, I know the hoods and I am part of the hood, they draw in class, they sit there and throw things at the teacher). The teacher deserved a more horrible death than any of the characters, but was just stabbed to the back. There were two intense scenes in the film, but they did not last long enough to be scary. As I said, the killings were excessive, and sometimes people who had nothing to do with the storyline were cut off their heads. If it really was fun to see blood, it would be nc-17. Two children describe the body that they find in the corn fields, they describe it as much more terrible than it actually was, they explained to the cop that there are larvae crawling in the guys' intestines. His stomach was not even cut, so there were no larvae in his stomach, although I would like to see it. The action was miserable, the heroes were losers, and the scarecrow could perform many gymnastic tricks. I propose to rent this film for the scenes of death, I will not see it again soon, but I enjoyed the excessive violence. In addition, do not worry about the continuation, I watched five minutes and I was bored to death, it sounds good, but it is not. The original dummy actually interested me.
