Dude, really !!!! where have you guys been the last 20 years, this is shocking in every way, horror? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low-budget, but it is a laugh. If you want to look at the classics, the Freaks of Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Immortal Monster, Ernest Teziger, Paul Wegener Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you cannot compare him, he gives him notoriety, bad game, bad script and t D. Full waist of money and free time, watched a lot of films, were my favorite at all times, I was really speechless, I had nothing more to say, please, do not make an effort to watch something so stupid, please understand
