Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes team up on the basketball court. Well, that sounds good there. It leaves a lot of room for a good comedy and a good story. But in the next boring moments of this pathetic film attempt such an event did not happen. This film has become redundant, backward and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds have passed. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite shows. characters, Woody from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But, having seen his “acting performance”, I came to the conclusion that he should continue to play silly village hits that are bartenders. His game was as boring and poor as in the movie. Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez. I used to like films with Perez, but I decided that the reason I liked other jobs in her career was that she wasn’t the main character and she didn’t have as many talking lines (“Do it Right”). But now in the movie “White People Can't Jump,” she has become the main character with many lines, which means that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and aching voice. Therefore, having seen this film (the term was used loosely) and having heard Rosie Perez much more than grateful, I can now say that I am a white man and I am preparing for jumps. , from a twenty-story apartment building.
