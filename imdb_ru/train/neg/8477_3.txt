I personally hated this film because it was predictable, the characters were stereotypical, and the whole idea was a break from the Cutting Edge and the Cadet Kelly. <br /> <br /> The main character is a snotty girl who is sent to a place where she does not belong. All this hates her, and, even worse, there is a hot guy who doesn't seem to love her (well, damn it, the school can't stand you). Surprisingly, she finds a way to fit in and make everyone like her plus, makes the guy head over heels in love with her. Then there is the choice of where she should choose between figure skating and hockey. She chooses hockey, then goes to figure skating competitions and enters the Olympic team. There is nothing surprising in this. <br /> <br /> This entire movie was damn predictable. You knew what was going to happen even before you saw it. It was so terrible that I almost burst out, and by the time I finished watching it, I had a terrible headache and a desire to shoot myself because I was looking at it. Do not watch it if you are under ten years old, or you really do not like crappy teen films.
