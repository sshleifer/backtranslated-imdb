I believe that many people comment / review their first IMDb movie because the movie was exciting or terrible - I write because of the last one. <br /> <br /> I was excited about the continuation of "Wargames" .. I thought the original was pretty good, given its time and content, I felt it was worth seeing more than once. In 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this film. Computers, games, terror, military excessive jealousy have greatly grown since the release of the first film, and Wargames: The Dead Code has the opportunity to bring them to life. <br /> <br /> The film failed at almost all levels, but I especially blame the writers and all those who have spoken about the realism of the game aspects. “Dead Code” is a flight simulator in the 1990s, when several people on the ground waved their hands. Meanwhile, Will Farmer presses the buttons of about 7,000 teams - none of which affect what happens on the screen. Until, finally, he “wins” by clicking the mouse on the screen with a mouse that releases gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (no one is close to gas). Since he overcame 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLI (a real military vehicle) that he is a threat to high-level terror. <br /> <br /> Even any 5–16 year old can perform the same task - the Government believes that it represents a deadly threat to humanity. They say something like “He has expert knowledge about bioterror” ... He showed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the wiki article about bioterror. Thus, this is followed by a chase scene that continues into the movie, with 0.01% of the budget and the excitement of any of the Bourne titles. They have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and sort out the issue. Sometimes they are angry that they almost miss him ... but sometimes they skillfully create opportunities simply by allowing him to deliberately follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I would write more ... but I already spent 1.5 hours watching this, I would prefer Broderick and Joshua to play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours .
