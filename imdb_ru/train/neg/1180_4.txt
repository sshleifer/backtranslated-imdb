Infamous for more than a quarter of a century (and often forbidden), its obscurity was its greatest asset, as it seems. Hey, it's often better to talk about them than about what you really can't see when the “legend” is not backed by content. <br /> <br /> Recently, a movie was played in Los Angeles several times and is available on a home video, so that the veil slowly rises. Despite the fact that there is still a lot to offend the masses, rather, they are annoying than to arouse real passion. With the exception of the gratuitous and lengthy sex scene XXX between a pair of horses (“A Nature Documentary,” Anyone?), It takes almost an hour for a sadly arranged marriage melodrama. <br /> <br /> As soon as sex and undressing begin, this is a non-stop sequence that includes masturbation, a very quick glance at the supposed beauty and monster meeting and the nude woman running around the mansion (no one, even her supposedly protective aunt, seems Even thinks to put clothes on her!) In the video, I think you can quickly go to the banality, but it is not worth the effort. Nude nature does not go beyond what can be seen in something much more significant, for example, in Bertolucci's Dreamers. <br /> <br /> Try your best to find “morality” or “symbolism” in carnal life, I doubt it is worthy of anyone's efforts. Unfortunately for LA BETE, now that you can see the film more easily, fame about something that was once “forbidden” has been shot. And this beast was tamed.
