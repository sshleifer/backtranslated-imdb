We have a film about how the pursuit of money and revenge can spoil your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director famous for his remaking the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew on with it. <br /> <br /> His use of a modern film noir to solve the topic of a man who frees himself by swallowing his pride, being nice to the enemy and giving all his money falls right on his face. When Jason Statham's character is no longer afraid of Ray Liotta, this obviously drives Liotta so much so that he loses his head in the final scene. What for? In fact, you cannot create a mob like the character of Liotta, who apparently got to his position in life, demonstrating the ruthless behavior that manifests itself throughout the film, only when he is driven to suicide with no more than a pitiful smile Statham's character face. <br /> <br /> Before someone starts talking, I miss the point ... I don’t. I get it, ok? Give up the search for wealth, and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be kind to your enemy, and this will confuse him. It seems that this is the essence of the film, and in itself is a good prerequisite for the story, although it is hardly original. The problem is that Richie simply lacks the ability as a director to deal with it. At that moment, when even Guy Ritchie is aware of this, he seems to be bored with the story, and he begins to insert red-haired herring: the scene when Statham is knocked down by a car - Why? Shooting some scenes in the form of Marvel comics ... again, why? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there are so many free topics and unanswered questions that you can get about this all of 2001 and try to figure them out, or just accept that there are no answers, and every viewer will interpret things in their own way. Yourself? I was so bored by the pompous tone of the film that I didn’t care. Honestly, the ending could not come too soon, so I did not have to go through this pretentious psychosis anymore. <br /> <br /> Loss of two hours of my life.
