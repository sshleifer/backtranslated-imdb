I am 47 years old, and I spent as much life as I can remember, a fan of horror and science fiction films. Whether they are quiet, black and white, without a budget or with a large budget, there are very few of them, and I cannot find what they like. Nevertheless, I will give credit to this film for the good effects of blood and creatures, but that’s all. This is a case of influence on history. The truth is that we live in a time when there is very little left that was not visible in the horror film. Therefore, for any film to really entertain it, there must be a good original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and a bad game, but a bad story with a good game and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie doesn't even have a good acting game, only good effects. So if you can’t just talk about blood, pass it on.
