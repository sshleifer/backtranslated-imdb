Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat there and both thought it should get better, these actresses are too good to waste their time on this nonsense. Unattractive characters, a hackneyed script, and a sluggish rhythm make two long hours. I really couldn't hack it and went off to shop at the store (cat litter being more attractive than this film). The husband stayed and confirmed that it wasn’t getting better — by the time Buddy was killed, you wanted all of them to be hit by a car and end their miserable life. It would be infinitely more interesting. Beautiful landscapes and costumes cannot support this.
