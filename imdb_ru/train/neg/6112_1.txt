I was thirteen years old when I saw this film. I expected a lot of action. Since “Escape from New York” in Germany received 16 ratings, I got into the movie as a backup. It was so boring. Then I realized that this is just crap when the husband exposes his wife. I mean, today you do it over the Internet and pay for instant access. This is more than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I spend my time on this film. This is a soft porn for schoolchildren. Strip Bo Derek and paint it in color - nice. But then they should call the film "Stripping Beau and Draw Her."
