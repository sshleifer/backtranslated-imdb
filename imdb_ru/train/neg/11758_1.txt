I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It is so bad that in fact it is funny and very worthy. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely terrible, I mean, he just can't act, period. He must surrender now, since acting is clearly not his business. His colleagues are about the same caliber, I'm sure that my 5-year-old cousin could work better than all of them! The director should be ashamed of having put his last name on something so funny. For some reason, I don't think Oscar is on this guy's cards. <br /> <br /> I never wrote a comment on IMDb, but this film was so bad that I felt obligated to do so. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this film, do not do 0/10 if it was 0
