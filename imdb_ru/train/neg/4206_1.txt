I was at the premiere of this film at the 1997 Toronto Film Festival. After the show, when the screenwriter / director and some actors suggested answering the questions, no one even bothered to ask them. Rarely was the film so badly directed (why the hell did random footage be ripped out of some scenes?) Characters behave completely out of character for no reason, except for the fact that they force the plot to move in certain directions. In the end, the film comes to a completely random and meaningless end, which should "really make you think." Unfortunately, it makes you think: "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life, I will never come back."
