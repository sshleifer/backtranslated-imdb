(spoilers) One really memorable part of this otherwise pretty dull and cool piece of British cuisine is the Henry Steiner rinse, one of the worst colors in the world. This and gorgeous crawler eyebrows on the old evil guy who tried to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does a wonderful job of making a funny boring and gray film. I especially like it when Crow kills Mike with his “touch of death”, and when he revives him in the theater, Mike cries: “Guys, I died, I saw eternal truth and beauty! oh, this film ... "It would be a chagrin if you had to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of The Projected Man." The film can bring good luck by being sold as a dream mate. Some of the puns in the film were evil police inspector - "electrocution! Crow -" Shocking, isn't it? "Police inspector -" This is Low, everything is fine, "Tom Servo -" Very low, right on the floor! "police inspector-" Can I I get? "Tom Servo:" He is dead, but get out "MST3K is definitely the only way watch this snooker.
