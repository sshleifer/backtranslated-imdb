I rented this film because I hoped that the whole family would like it. Although the film is suitable for family viewing, my family did not like it, because it gives a false impression of God. If you obey God and follow Him, you are not guaranteed success. Your football team does not always win. You will not magically get better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always receive a promotion. Sometimes you get stuck in an old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to satisfy all our whims. Rather, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we glorify Him most when it seems to us that things are going badly. To live is Christ; die is a win.
