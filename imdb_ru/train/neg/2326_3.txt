Dr. Mordrid is terrible. I would not advise either adults or children to look at this if they are no longer vicious killers. There is so much dirt in this movie that it hurts, yes. Speaking of the eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against the background of stars. Only the devil himself could imagine such an evil thing. I rented every copy I could in local video stores and crushed them with a 5-pound crucifix. This film should remain locked in the basement beyond the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting hellish beasts. This is where this movie belongs. I suggest, if you want scandalous entertainment, rent All Dogs Go To Heaven or Angels In The Outfield. These films are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love horrible movies, you need to see Dr. Mordried.
