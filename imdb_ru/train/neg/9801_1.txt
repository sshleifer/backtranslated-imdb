I remember this series, which I showed on television when I was a child, in the early 1990s, and there was rage when children with blunt swimsuits were doing kung-fu with each other and rolling in plastic dinosaurs. This was called the power rangers. I remember that small children would go around beating each other, and then shirts and things from the show were banned in many school districts across the country, because this show taught children how to fight each other in resolving their differences. <br /> <br /> I never thought of it as a show, especially when the best shows, such as The Tick, were playing Fox Kids. Most older teens have always looked at the Rangers ridiculously and scornfully, and it is not difficult to understand why. Frames are ridiculous at best. The multi-colored Ranger costumes look like things in which you would work, and dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get into acting and, of course, these really funny hairstyles. All the guys run around with earrings, half of them wear mullet from the 90s, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then change into swimsuits that wear power rangers. <br /> <br /> Toys are especially funny. and was a joke of many leading night talk shows. And, of course, two of the worst films ever made, and I mean that two of the worst films ever made were based on this show, and almost every critic has smashed both films and TV shows on which it was founded. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers are nothing more than a bad promotional video for especially bad toy merchandise. As an adult, I do not look at it with love, but rather as the next embarrassment of children's shows of the 1990s, fashion and earrings guys.
