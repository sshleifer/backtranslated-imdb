<br /> <br /> As soon as I ignored some improbables, it was a pretty decent horror movie / monster. So, first I will give some good comments: - the dragon was pretty convincing, especially when she rummaged through the tunnels in search of dinner (hint: she likes people). - the action was quite non-stop, and after a weak start, I was completely absorbed in the plot. - sorry, I was a little sick for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the film. <br /> <br /> Now, about incredible things ** maybe some spoilers **: You were hunting a fire-breathing dragon in 1100 AD. Would you break into his cave with a gunpowder under your arm? Duh. - a female character with a common American name, blond hair and a clear Slavic accent, trying to pretend that she is Spanish? BUT? - a leading scientist whose Slavic accent can be cut with a knife, and he was supposedly born in Chicago, was educated in the USA? - the pilot of a military helicopter, who repairs himself, flies a huge transport helicopter without another crew, and is he an expert shooter and fighter? OK. Yeah. I will not even mention that he gave 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. <br /> <br /> This is still better than some Japanese monsters from the 60s, but not by much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although, of course, the final left this opportunity wide open. Or maybe next time they will hire a real director. <br /> <br /> Despite everything, I gave this movie 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <Smirk>
