There are so many bad things in this film, but to summarize: a terrible game is so bad that it must be on purpose. bad script - they may have had some good ideas, but it was not the best way to present the story. A ridiculously bad ending — in some cases, ending a manages to save a film — is not the case. if you manage to watch the whole movie, you will want to kick yourself at the end, because the final is not even worth the wait. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Sitting in this film was a complete torture, I would appreciate it if someone warned me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing to do. Even then you will regret having subjected yourself to unspeakable torture.
