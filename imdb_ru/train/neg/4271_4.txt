The typical thriller was made many times before. A simple plot scheme; Policeman Liotta becomes Russellâ€™s obsessed wife, and he tries to beat off the good old Kurt so he can take her. It is impossible to predict, not even try to guess, the plot is the plot, and there are no thoughts here. I think the only reason to see it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done initially or interesting. In fact, nothing can be said about this film, it is not particularly bad, but it also has no positive moments. Russell plays Russell, and you know what you get when you see him in the film. The same liotta. Wu Stow is an annoying Sher Esk voice. I read the plot plan and saw a movie in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I watched it, and he rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as I imagined. I did not feel a drop of emotion in everything. I have no feeling for this film, as if I had never watched it. Given this, this is a pretty pointless movie, isn't it? However, I will give 3/10 for some reason.
