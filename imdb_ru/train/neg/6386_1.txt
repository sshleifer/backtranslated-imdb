I really wanted this movie to be liked, but it was just impossible. The acting was incredible, the plot was annoying, and the pace was slow, sooo slow. All the while, sitting in the theater, I wanted the film to end. Twenty minutes in the movies, and I pray for the ending. Of course, some of the visual effects were good, but guys, I mean it really! And for a movie about a guy setting up magic tools, there really wasn't a lot of music to talk about. The music there was annoying and boring. From time to time, loud, shrill noises sounded, they also irritated. Mainly, this film managed to tire me and at the same time scare me. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I need to go see "Tideland" and wash that bad taste from my mouth.
