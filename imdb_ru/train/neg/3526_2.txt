(Spoiler is on, some will say) <br /> <br /> This film cannot be taken seriously. In some places it is so terribly stupid that I just can not stop laughing at all this. Try me in a sequence where the character Stallone jumps about 20 meters with full climbing equipment or (and this is really my favorite) kills the bad guy, attaching him to stalactite. Yes, what godless power did he gather to accomplish such feats? I do not know, but he certainly gives reality for money.
