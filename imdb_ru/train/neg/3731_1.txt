I grew up in a "very Christian" family from birth. I was saved before I saw this film and the rest of the series, and was forced to watch it in a youth group in my church. This film was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old, and I literally had nightmares about it for years. Before, I lay awake in bed and listened to the sounds of my momâ€™s steps upstairs. If I had not heard her footsteps, I would sneak upstairs to make sure she was not delighted. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation, because I was afraid that Jesus would forget me. This is definitely not something that I will show my children until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to get rid of the fear this film gave me.
