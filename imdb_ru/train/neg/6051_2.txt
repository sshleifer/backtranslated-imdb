Urgh! 3 things that the film needs: a good script, a good plot and a good casting. I watched this movie, expecting it to be terribly awful, and was, unfortunately, disappointed when it was just awful. I lost the desire to live halfway. The only thing that prevented me from poking out my eyes with a fork was Rose Byrne (which is why I looked at her first). She did a good job, since Rastus and her appearance have not changed much since the age of 13. It was a fantastic first attempt at a movie. the dog was also very good. both did an excellent job with such terrible stuff. Sandra Bernhard, I think, was the biggest mistake of the film. she was completely mistaken, and I don't think she ever got a character. <br /> <br /> I give the film 2 out of 10 - and this is only because of Rose.
