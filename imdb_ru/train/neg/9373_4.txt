The peculiar charisma of Martin Koslek gives a certain credibility to his character as a disappointed artist. He fills his dialogue with a strange sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a persuasive person. The character manages to seem like a real person, not an ordinary villain from the movie B. <br /> <br /> The storyline is nothing special and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Cosleck and Rondo Hatton in the role of Creeper. Koslek’s talkative, philosophical character contrasts with Hutton’s restrained, monosyllabic approach. The Creeper character does not evolve much further than the base level of monsters, but Hutton offers untapped opportunities and makes you think about his background. <br /> <br /> This film was in Shock Theater a lot when I am a child, so I have a certain nostalgic love for it. In any case, it is worth watching once for those who love Forties horror films.
