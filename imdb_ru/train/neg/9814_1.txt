This is the film that you regret for putting in a VCR. This is some kind of weird bad rip off version of Stephen King's film Unhappiness (1990). I can not understand how this film got 5.2 points, because there is no history in it, and when the film finally ended, I felt relieved. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to be released as a short film. instead .. much time is spent on the same thing. As in any bad movie, everything happens at the end of the movie in 10-15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Therefore, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put new batteries in your remote control, because you going to do a lot of fast forward ... do not worry, you do not miss anything important.
