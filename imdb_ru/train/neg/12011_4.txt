John Pressman (Michel "I should call Ditech" Lerner) works in the doctor's office as an orderly. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes him to kill people who see that thoughts have offended him. But it turns out to be a movie inside the film, but soon the lines are blurred when John goes to kill in the cinema. Inviting a guy watching a movie to do the same. In this Lerner comes up, but Zelda repeats the lines of the dialogue over and over again. This is quickly annoying. But not as annoying as two girls who watch a movie in a movie. As this horror film fails, it is too busy trying to be smart, trying to convey a message and, it seems, forgetting that a slasher should evoke a feeling of tension or at least a jump or two. No, we have the worst slasher here: art house. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
