I really saw this film in the theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words that I had never heard in the theater, either before or after: “No refunds!” As soon as I heard these words, I had to just wave goodbye and go home. But no, foolishly, I entered and watched a movie. This film did not laugh anyone in the theater. Not even once. Even by chance! We were mostly in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so, someone shouted "This film sucks!" The audience applauded enthusiastically, and then sat in a stunned bored silence for another ten minutes.
