Worst movie ever made !!! Please see the real movie reviews from the professionals of this film. Check Rotten Tomatoes on the Internet to find good independent reviews of this film. The comments made on this site seem to belong to people with some financial interest in this film. I find positive comments very misleading. I find it striking how negative comments are so bad for this film, and positive comments sound like an Oscar award. Do not waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This film is retarded !! I can not believe that such a film will ever be made. Why does Hollywood waste time on such junk? This film is an attempt to nothing. I ask myself what kind of loser could spend his money making such garbage. I went to the blockbuster, and the assistant even told us not to waste our time and money. I did not listen, and I wasted my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! This is truly "The Worst Movie in History!"
