The "true" story of three girls who go to the jungle of Connecticut and ultimately prey on a maniac in the forest. This is the film that would play in America thirty years ago for various reasons. The film does not work very much with low budget and mixed results. The film is watchable, but not at all scary (this is to blame for some of the scenes of the attack). This is a movie that you will probably forget when you're done. Most likely, you will never think to see it if someone does not give it to you and does not say “look here,” which is what happened to me. If you are handed a copy, give it away; the film is not worth the effort to watch it, even if it can be watched.
