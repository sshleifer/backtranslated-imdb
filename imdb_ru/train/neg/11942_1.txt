Absolutely one of the worst films I've seen in a long time! It starts badly and just gets worse. Katherine Heigl is terribly mistaken in the role of Lolita, and Leo Grillo courageously struggles with what is essentially a cardboard character. The only actor with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who considers him a villain and completely interrupts his role. The script is terrible, it is terrible, and there are large enough holes in it to drive through a double-decker bus! It is also the most sexist film I've ever seen! The character of Katherine Heigl is not at all sympathetic. She is considered an evil, meaningless temptress who seduces a poor, innocent married man to deceive his wife. Throughout the film, it is assumed that she is underage, and the message that accompanies this storyline simply does not believe! In the end, she cannot even redeem herself by shooting a man who (ha!) Is clearly mad with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, thereby redeeming herself in the eyes of men everywhere. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
