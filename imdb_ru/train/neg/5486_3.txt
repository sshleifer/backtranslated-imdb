First, this film begins with a very stupid note: a 10-year-old girl playing in a moving vehicle decides that it would be funny to shut her mother's eyes with her hands, and then cause a terrible accident that kills her mom .... uh. .. sorry, there is not a single 10-year-old who is so stupid. The rest of the movie doesn't get much better. After the death of his mother, the obvious most stupid 10-year-old on the planet, dad takes his family to Genoa, Italy, where he has to teach at a local university, but here’s the decisive argument: he does not speak Italian! Then the little girl has “visions” of the mother (which she killed), and often the subsequent nightmares, which always end with her father holding and caressing her. Then we are forced to observe how this family is constantly lost, and then embraced, then cry, lose, and then find (and then, of course, embrace and cry even more) to such an extent that I really want some kind of natural disaster, just erase all those stupid, ignorant people from the planet. Don't get me wrong, because I love indie, but indie about stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is ridiculous and meaningless. It really is a shame that this film was based on such tasteless characters wallowing in such backward scenarios, because the language was interesting.
