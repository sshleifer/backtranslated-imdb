It is interesting to see in what form Pierce Brosnan's career was, before Bond appeared on the scene. In this “tense” thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the tender Patrick, who works with ghetto children in “trust courses. He starred in a novel with a woman who, in the mid-90s, had a swamp guy with a mop named Eric. The drunk ex-husband of this woman soon appears on the scene and begins to mess with Pierce. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time Pierce innocently makes "vegetarians." Husband enters Pierce resumes cooking vegetarians. Then the husband attacks Pierce. Little pieces of an uneaten vegetarian bell drop out of Pierce's mouth. The fight ends abruptly, not showing the result. It's as good as a movie. <br /> <br />
