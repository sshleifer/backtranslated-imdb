So that you, fans of cinema, understand the meaning of this film, I decided to write another review. Last time I missed a few things ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Secondly, acting skills. Third, Jesus Christ, what they thought about, creating such garbage, and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redemptive traits from beginning to end, except when Joseph Fiennes finally disappears crazy in a very uninteresting climax !!! <br /> I can not believe that I wasted my money on it when I could give it to a homeless person, street vendor or SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> Do you get the picture?
