A film without a conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a gangster for money. Then they cross it twice. In the meantime, he falls in love with the wife of the deceased, and, not knowing that he is a murderer, approaches her. Then he "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. Then, in the spirit of heroism, he takes revenge on the bandits who have crossed him twice. The first problem is that, by agreeing to take on the murder for hire, the tramp loses a sense of sympathy, dignity and heroism. We cannot accept anything good in it, and as a result the rest has no moral center. We just don't give a damn about such a guy. And the wife (played by the charming Kari Ukhrer - the sheriff in the film “Eight Steps”), a high-class woman performing a mission for the homeless, also loses her sympathy by jumping straight into bed with a homeless vagabond . And when she finds out that he is a guy? what does she do? She locks him in her house (as if all houses have locks that cannot be opened from the inside) with her and continues to scold him. Stoo-PID. George Wendt, however, is awesome as a muscular thug. Directed by Stuart Gordon dealt much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
