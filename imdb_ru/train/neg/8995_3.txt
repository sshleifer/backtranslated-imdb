I missed the start, but I saw most of it. A friend got it on DVD in a cheap room at FYE. <br /> <br /> All the parodies are very short, but most of them are still too long. Most of them seem to have forgotten something funny! It has quite a lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor, parodies based on stereotypes, or parodies that use racist terms for people. <br /> <br /> I’m trying to remember everything that seemed ridiculous to me, and I’ve had problems ... The Tunnel Vision network logo is lipstick in the mouth with an eyeball. The mouth opens and closes above the eye like eyelids. Kind of creepy. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors went for the best, and, fortunately, this bomb did not keep them.
