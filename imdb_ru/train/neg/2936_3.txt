I, too, was intrigued by the high (8.5) rating of this film and was very disappointed. I just watched a couple of good foreign films and waited impatiently to make it three in a row, but it shouldn't have been. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same. There is not much plot, if any. I don't necessarily need this in a movie, but it must somehow entertain or attract me. The best I can say is that he seeks to be a film in the spirit of Altman, albeit with a very small ensemble. Of course, there are moments, but a few minutes are easily thinned out for 97 slow minutes, nothing. I do not understand the appreciation of this film. I give him 3. <br /> <br />
