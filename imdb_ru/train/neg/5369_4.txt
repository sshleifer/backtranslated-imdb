It seems that the brilliant team of Shonda Rimes handed over the writing of this work somewhere offshore, maybe in MediocreLand? “PP” reminds me of any of the many tiresome, promising at first glance, but predictable clicks of David Kelly during season 1 (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so outlandish that they barely cause sympathy or sadness. And that is what really makes good medical dramas ticking — the dramatic situations that you fear, “It could be me.” They are not funny either. <br /> <br /> Actors are not bad, but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to life. I am a psychotherapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most incredibly incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Whoever wrote her materials, they piled on ethics and transfer / countertransference courses at Stanford. Someone must give them a code of ethics to read (an episode with a bleeding wife and the participation of a therapist in this). No psychotherapist is so bad. <br /> <br /> Women who yearned for the men who crossed over died, we all ended with Sex and the City. Addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she loves is very unsuitable in age, looks so unnatural for a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress herself does not believe in it and does not do very well. The only successful / enjoyable developments are Addison, struggling with his decision to move to Los Angeles, and Doctor Wood and his struggle with widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept can work with a whole new team of writers.
