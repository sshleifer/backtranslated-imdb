For those looking for a sequel for the wonderful 1980s South African mini-series, this is not true. Nor is it a historical drama. Rather, it’s a boring little fantasy that has nothing to do with the historical Shaka, but simply uses his name to give a certain meaning to Sinclair’s idiotic story of an African superhero, which is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. . <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are several ludicrous moments, for example, when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained, and kicks some serious slaver. You know how Jesus would have done if he had not been so weak. <br /> <br /> True, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can't imagine that twice as much shit would be better. <br /> <br /> And what's the name of Mungo ?!
