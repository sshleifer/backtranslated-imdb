This film was made in very bad taste. The script was really bad. I am very sad for the late Gregory Peck, who took on the main role in the film adaptation of the B-film of one of the greatest generals of history. This film was politically incorrect and completely insensitive to others who fought with the Japanese in World War II. There was a scene in which I almost vomited. In the film MacArthur in a bunker on Corregidor Island, he spoke to the troops as an experienced politician when he faced a wounded, one-legged Filipino soldier. The soldier, bleeding and dying, manages to sit up straight when he sees the general, and says: “neither fathers, nor mothers, nor uncle Sam”, and MacArthur says that the Americans “will never leave” the Philippines. The scene ends with a soldier inspired by the words of MacArthur and gives him a smart salute. I mean, if there was a more indulgent scene depicting the USA as the great white savior of the world, please tell me, because this one takes the cake. This showed that Filipinos are poor girls who are incapable of honor, and they have to rely on great Americans exclusively for their redemption. This clearly and deliberately eclipsed the contribution of the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces in the Far East) members, Filipino volunteers who were integrated into the US armed forces during World War II, who died side by side with the Americans fighting with side with the Americans on the march of death Bataan and defended the island of Corregidor, launching a guerrilla offensive after MacArthur went to Australia with his famous speech, "I'll be back." My late grandfather, a Filipino veteran of World War II and a USAFFE soldier, was one of many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for their native country. I think that this film does not give them the honor and thousands of other people that MacArthur relied on to prepare intelligence for his famous return to landing at Leyte Gulf.
