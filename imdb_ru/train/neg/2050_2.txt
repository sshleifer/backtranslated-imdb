Not that “the film by Ulli Lommel” gave me hope, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER managed to fall below my lowest expectations. Recently, young cinematographers have tended to use digital video for their early projects, which is good in order to give these children the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film distribution. But many of these young cinematographers also came up with the idea of ​​filtering the finished film so that it looked more qualitatively similar to celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video actually only works in the “mockumentary” style, because it never looks like anything other than video. This is the main problem of ZODIAC KILLER. Watching a movie is like a daytime soap opera about a killer. I do not want to watch a movie. What is even more inexcusable is that Lommel is NOT a young director. He should know better. He should know that it is almost impossible to cause horror (or even unknown!) In the video. For God's sake, this guy was in charge from the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve his career for forty years. And we were lucky, he also wrote the script! Thus, you can expect confused actions that mean nothing, unwarranted behavior and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you completely unhappy. Please, please skip this movie. You will thank me later.
