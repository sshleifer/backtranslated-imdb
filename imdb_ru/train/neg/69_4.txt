I thought it was a very clumsy, uninteresting version of famous Australian history. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good at their roles and gave their characters some personality; but it all seemed forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> The beginning could be much more exciting; perhaps starting with shooting, and then flashing back to remember how they got there or the like. And I felt that each scene is usually predictable and labeled as a very bad television soap. <br /> <br /> I was really looking forward to this movie and was hoping for something much better. The only thing I can say in his favor is that he surpasses the version of Mick Jagger, but not by much.
