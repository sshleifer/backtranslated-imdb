Before watching this movie, I could already say that it was a complete copy of Sow (complete with a shack-like place they were in and a black guy who wanted someone to break his arm to get out of the cuffs). The name MJH in the film, as a rule, distracts me (ugh, you can say GROSS?!), But I still wanted to try. <br /> <br /> At first I was a little interested. The acting is absolutely terrible, and I laughed at almost every reaction of the characters (especially the person who played Sally). MJH was even worse, but I kept looking. <br /> <br /> However, the final was the biggest joke of all! I was seriously in shock, thinking: â€œIt was the end ?! This is a comedy ?!". <br /> <br /> I thought that a bunch of crap is funnier than the scary "Scary Movie" parody, and it REALLY says something!
