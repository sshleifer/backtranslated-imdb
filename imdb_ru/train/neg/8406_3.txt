A memorable line from a short show. After watching the episode in which this line was entered, my football team inside the sister flag began to use this line to break our relationship in the attack. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarterback defender said FOOTBALL, and the rest of the team responded to YOU ​​BET! A funny way to overcome vanity when our opponents scratched their heads, as very few of them watched the show. Using this line has added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. We had the best season at the time when I was in college, and to some extent this was due to the fun we received using this line. The show was pretty nasty, but it continues to live in the memories of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi football team in West Virginia.
