I did not expect much from this film, but, oh brother, what an abomination. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a giant box with a terrible $ 5 DVD at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this disc, I feel cut off. Special effects looked like in high school, camera work was overshadowed by shaky tripods and surface lighting, and acting was an excellent example of a “Christian school.” One can imagine the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" on the part of the production company when they saw the rush returning - the people who financed this thing had to have serious anti-biblical feelings for the inept production company that provoked this thing. Think of their torment when they saw that their investment of $ 914.86 was growing in smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian films are so bad — perhaps the creators of Xian’s films need to watch good films and try to copy some of the things that make them so good. Believable stories and characters, less hysterical arms waving and bigotry, oh, and a story that attracts everyone, not just true believers. That is, Stop the sermon, save it for the church. Take, for example, the series "The Omen or Prophecy." Excellent movies with compelling storylines, great cinematography and rich music. No hysterical flapping. No sermon. <br /> <br /> If there was laughter in this film, it would be MUCH better.
