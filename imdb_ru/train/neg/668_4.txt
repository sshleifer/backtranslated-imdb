So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror movie and thriller. I'm a big fan, and I was scared to watch this movie in the beginning, but seeing it was not a horror or a thriller. <br /> <br /> I basically made fun of the film in its place, because it was so predictable. You can predict what will happen next. The young actors played their characters well, but I must say that the killer was definitely on top of the game - acting wisely. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will give props for the plot, because it was good, but it is not exciting and not scary. The “jump in place” scenes were almost nil. So, do not spend ten dollars on watching in theaters, wait until it comes to DVD.
