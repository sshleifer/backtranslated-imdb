Remembering the dirty details of this insidiously meaningless "movie" is like digging a chestnut with a rusty salty spoon. Perhaps Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) was a bit predictable, but this pathetic excuse for the film is just one of the most shameless commercialization rates I've ever heard of. A boy fighting spies / terrorists when he is home alone in a Chicago suburb with chicken pox? Funny! Why does this film have to be made? I am the person who believes that even horrible films are not a waste of time, but rather a learning experience. However, this is actually a waste of time. This should be avoided at all costs.
