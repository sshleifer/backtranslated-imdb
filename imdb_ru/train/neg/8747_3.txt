AntiTrust could be a great tool for Rachel Lee Cook, but the director shot her best scenes. In the scenes she is in, she’s just a zombie. She participates in the plot, which is similar to the plot in Get Carter, but she better copes with the plot in Get Carter. (I blame the director) Director’s respect for Hitchcock was commonplace. (This is a scene in which chef Ryan Phillip understands that he may not be able to trust Tim Robin’s character, at least I think this is a homage to Hitchcock. The cut scenes are shown on the DVD. Not listening to the test audience.
