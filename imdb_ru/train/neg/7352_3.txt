It was not funny in 1972. Now it is not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I do not blame the film because it is incredibly sexist - I quote that I liked it, or rather, I liked the reaction that it causes to annoying people on the PC - I scold her because she is poorly written and acts. <br /> <br /> The only truly memorable character is Blakey, whom the British will recognize for 25 years immediately after his appearance. For a long time he was a favorite of the Impressionists. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
