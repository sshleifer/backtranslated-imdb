This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, the script is pitiful, and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script went through the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies, from deep dramas to more male-oriented ones, they kill everything you see, like films, so I can't say that I am picky. I struggled to find something to compare it with, but I just couldnâ€™t think of anything that could fit this star ship 2. Witch, in my opinion, makes the gods of the movie cry, and I'm thinking of throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this, its effects are great. Acting excellence and screenplay should be awarded. You know, when a movie is bad in a ridiculous sense, guys, this is not one of those that kill your soul every minute.
