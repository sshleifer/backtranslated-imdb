Stars Lorenzo Lamas is a CIA agent who takes off some exotic beauty named Alex, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight with her former employers. O.J. Simpson is also on board to secure the line of acting confidence in a not so talented ensemble. I have to admit, I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his films. He stinks. However, compared to O. J. Simpson and comas' wife of Lamas, Kinmont Lamas looks like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I saw the CIA only because of the renewed interest in the case of O.J. Simpson, you understand, because if your parents had cable television and additional channels, you would not be able to avoid this film. in 1994 you could go to the Amish community, and some jerk could play it on your portable TV. The film itself is a collection of episodes with unconvincing actions, and it would be intriguing, although the shocking value of O. J. Simpson, jumping after fireballs and exchanging, would be one liner providing unintentional humor. Also, where were Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic? <br /> <br /> * of 4- (bad)
