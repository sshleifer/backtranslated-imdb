It would be a * great * silent film. The acting is really good, at least in Look Ma, I play a really big part! sort of. <br /> <br /> Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFILE! Every scene is destroyed by human tragedy! <br /> <br /> Most of the time I felt that I was choking. However, like any train wreck, I could not take my eyes off. This dialogue could work on stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, randomly, beaten, and in almost all the other stereotypical negative adjectives you can come up with to describe really bad dramatic work. <br /> <br /> If you like your melodrama in huge, heapy doses, you * could * enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. Despite all this melodrama, this thing is surely playing at its own pace. <br /> <br /> This script must have sounded very different when the actors involved read it for themselves. It just does not work as soon as they start delivering it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB sometimes does us a disservice when he uses his stupid computer-controlled “weighted score”. The curse of a starving class deserves less than 1. Fiction is good, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops without a plausible explanation for their growing up or development, this is not true. character development! Your characters must have motivation. Being drunk and waking up in the field is not character development. This is fiction. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or at least watch it muffled. Perhaps you will get some pleasure from the way the characters are waving their arms. <br /> <br /> Yes, and the word wise - to prove that this is really an artsy film, you see James Woods in all his languid men's fame "look at me, I am a figurative and literal picture of a man's naked vulnerability." <br /> <br /> Don't say you were not warned.
