Wow. In the sister cities we have a station that shows “Big Bad Movie” from Monday to Friday. Tonight's nugget was a film with Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a really annoying woman who is eventually killed when gangsters burst into her house. Beah (Beatrice) returns to pursue her husband. She wants him to take revenge on his killers, so "she is back." And she won't let him rest until he does it. She annoys him endlessly ... and the audience too! This film is truly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Hey, I love bad movies though (my favorite movie is Xanadu). I really shook my head throughout the film, wondering who thought this would be a good idea for the film. Bea is just so annoying. The plot is stupid; acting is bad; story ... well, you understand my drift. In any case, if you want to see a really bad movie - really a very bad movie, watch this one. You will not be disappointed. Heh.
