Someone might have made a great documentary about Jerry Springer’s show, but this fictional version simply succeeded in drawing something genuine and interesting from the trash TV phenomenon. There are dozens of famous bad films (for example, “Manos: Hands of Fate”), in which there is more creativity and spirit than this dreary, senseless waste of film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not a documentary about Jerry? Springer Show, which would begin to answer some of the real questions, such as: who are these people? What happens to their life after they appear in this show? How did the mayor of Cincinnati get here? <br /> <br /> One good line: during a “orientation” session for guests: “People, I can’t emphasize this enough: NO WEAPONS!”
