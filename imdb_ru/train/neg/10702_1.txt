Dialogue: stilts, clichés; Acting: Hammi, cliché; Plot: predictable, cliché. <br /> <br /> What is Christopher Plummer Nastassja Kinski doing in this “B” trash? Plummer was well known decades before this film was shot, and behind it were such masterpieces as Tess and Cat People ... They must have been in despair. <br /> <br /> All bad guys have bad guy accents - * bad * bad accents! (Especially Plummer! Where * did * learn to speak German?), And most of them also have the ridicule of the bad guy. All innocent bystanders are too overzealous to make you laugh. A good guy survives, among other things: * A 5-inch throwing knife, buried deep in his shoulder with a handle — just takes it out, and after a few seconds he easily uses his hand; * Marine machine gun fire (I think someone mentioned .50) in the leg, which he sorts, tying a bandage around his leg, and after that he barely limps; - first in the door frame; * Falling back, from what looks like a third floor, to the sidewalk without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience. The script has exactly 3 smart lines, the rest of the time is all so boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Good, not so bad. Plummer really brings a certain class to his role and undoubtedly the best actor in this film. Of course, this does not say much, but he can make a soulless villain without resorting to the methods of ham that most villains use here. His lines "Ve haff vays and meance" are sadly sad, but you always know that you watch as Christopher Plummer plays the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of time. The acting game, as it is, is a kind of 70s film, the “Wooden Line” film corresponds to very clearly falsified scenes of the Bruce Lee fight, but not even as good as the Roger Moore film 007 or Bruce Lee. Do not worry
