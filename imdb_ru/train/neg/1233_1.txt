Oh my God. The idea that this film is a thriller is an absolute joke for me. except that it seems to be written 5 years. The plot, action, and even the details and filming of this film were just shameful. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t usually criticize a single film, because every person has his own style. But this film, however, was probably the worst film I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this film is unknown, and I think it should be so, because such films turn the thriller genre into a joke. /> <br /> I advise anyone who is a fan of thrillers or even films to stay away from that.
