I also saw this film at a local show about a year ago. First, I want to say that it looks great. Cassella is an incredibly talented and fantastic cinematographer. I wish the film was as good as it seems. I wouldn't call it a scary movie. If you take a few shots of a decomposing ghost, this is not a horror movie. There is no secret, no waiting, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> This is a drama. You know what happens to both sides of the entire movie. The game was fine, I think, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the slogan "Revenge can be deadly" ... right? ... they have to check how many hundreds of horror / thrillers films have the same slogan? <br /> <br /> It hurts me to talk about it, but I know many people who have worked on this film, and I know that they donâ€™t want people to blow smoke. their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
