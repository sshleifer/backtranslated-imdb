I mean seriously, what band will sing about the crazy car? So, if there are ten of them, It’s too immature for a small child to sing about being “my woman,” I mean seriously! The name is also trite, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants ??? AS CREATIVE. I do not understand why they need a TV show. I mean, most artists don't need a TV show about themselves, especially a group of naked brothers. Damn, how many of them in this damn group. But seriously what about the movie? God, Nick, to be the bright light of my years in childhood, but seriously. Group "Naked brother"? So many parents will not allow their children to watch this, especially with the name of the group “Naked Brother”, this is a stupid, uncreative show that cannot be broadcast on TV.
