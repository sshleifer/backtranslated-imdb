How sad it is that there is no way to rate below 1. I watched this piece of nonsense and could hardly believe what I was watching. Every part of the movie was terrible. Music, acting, directing, history, everything, just everything. In fact, I found myself laughing out loud in different parts of the film. I especially liked the episode in which our hero rushes through the hospital in slow motion with slow focusing and knocks the clipboard out of the nursing hand, because ............. well. Just like that. Product placement? Crucifixion (Crucifixion?) Everywhere. If you are an adherent of Christianity and are very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to go out more.
