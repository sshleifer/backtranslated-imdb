Heavy moralism. Writers who use characters as mouthpieces speak for themselves. Predictable, far from the point of the plot (say, five times faster). Children's imitation of Britney Spears. This film has all the signs of a lifelong special failure. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo decided to create an emotional film that makes you think on a complex topic, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, that who by definition is the perpetrator is not necessarily a bad person, and that there may be extenuating circumstances, especially when someone puts the well-being of the child in the first place. Nevertheless, their seriousness ends with the fact that they are directed to the preaching dialogue and banal situations, planned to advance the plot. Worthy production values ​​and the interesting use of documentary style footage are not enough to achieve their goal when the script and acting skills fail. <br /> <br /> Logic is often at risk for the sake of creating tension: first, Soid tries to blackmail Pablo to participate in her documentary film in exchange for helping them escape, and then in one breath basically tells him not to trust her, because does not help them out of altruism. Well yes. And for a man on the run, Pablo is too prone to hysterics. Cristina’s well-being is so important for him that he runs out of prison and deportation for her, but he is willing to risk it all to calm her when she does not want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk above overly permissive parents. Third, when employer Pablo Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright, she is surprisingly unprofessional, especially given her work experience - did she really consider herself convincing? Oh yes, I would give up. Detective Weems from CCH Pounder can wipe the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I would like to list the things that I liked. I liked the dwarf. And I liked the fact that the dwarf was called Sexy. There is a change of clothes, always a plus; juvenile crossdress, no less! Harry is infinitely prettier than Christina. But my favorite moment in the film should be when Christina kicks Detective Non-Bright. I also find it interesting that in the cast with a minority (which, by the way, I really appreciate), the black character is racist. It is a pity that he was simply thrown away and no longer studied. <br /> <br /> This is a distinctive, unconventional assessment, but, nevertheless, it usually does not depend on the context, does not raise mood or tension in any scene, except for miserable, painful cries. every time the protagonist is in torment, as if they think his game doesn’t show it enough: “Just in case, if you’re not sure, he’s upset and we have musical signals to prove it.” <br /> <br /> Unstable, cliché dialogue leads to the depressing lack of subtext; everything should be stated in the dialogue, even when the body language was up, and then pass it just fine. For example, every passionate speech that Pablo utters and Mrs. Knight's complaint that her child will not crawl with them in the morning in bed. <br /> <br /> “Papi, tell me once again about mom” - that shamelessly Stupid exposure, representing the clan's dead wife! (She is always the most beautiful woman that a widower has ever seen, the kindest person he has ever met. Why can't we see a man crying because of a woman, like Shakespeare's - she can be fat, ugly , unpleasant, but his love for her is deep as the oceans? Now there is a story that would excite me. <br /> <br /> The police, who are literally a step behind, give many scenes the sensation of an inappropriate French farce. kicking in history - Bright and Lightning is so out of shape and easily fooled (he, horse but, not fast, like lightning, and she, well, I don’t feel the need to expose things.) Some guy drags a small child with him, overtaking a bicycle policeman, complete with a macho biker involved in a fight, but then felled by a child? To quote Margaret Cho, this is so sad. Will we ever see it on the “Policemen”? <br /> <br /> Lively and excessive deus ex machina: as an employer, you would really refuse to check his green card just because that he can quote the author by inspirational speaking on a poster at his desk <br /> <br /> Plus several scenes, including the above, threaten to turn into porn: “Well, I will do this service for you, while you do something for me ...” “I almost hear“ Baum- Chika-Baum-Baum ". <br /> <br /> When parents view Pablo's repentance footage, the grieving mom's excitement becomes the most real thing the film feels, Unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely inclined to his emotional speech until it becomes ballistic. A more ambivalent view would be more convincing here. <br /> <br /> I am constantly delighted with the stupidity of the main character, who does things for the sake of the plot: keeps the store without a mask, visits the grave of a dead girl. And why doesn't the mother recognize his face when she saw him before he left ?! “You look terribly familiar ...” <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this completely unnecessary, somewhat useless scene with Soid and an artificially improved bartender? Character development? PM Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary traits that have not gone away, Detective Lightning says that skeptic Detective Bright, Scorpio must be, shows how little he really knows about occultism. And I do not think that faith in fate may well be considered a voodoo mambo-jumbo. <br /> <br /> At the end, when Bright holds Pablo, how he dies - wait, why doesn’t she care? Her character is as contradictory as that of Soida. What, she should shoot him only because she said “Stop, or will I shoot”? (She still cares about her honesty.) He was unarmed. There was no need for lethal force. What is wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him? <br /> <br /> Finally, Christine's childish consent to the death of her mother gives Dr. Knight peace in connection with the death of his daughter - so violently. And the trick of the family whose child was killed, becoming Christina's new family ... I’m angry that she could be a "substitute" for their little girl. It is also unrealistic that the white couple will accept the Latin American daughter of the man who killed their own daughter. I am not saying that there are no generous, loving people who do this. I am simply saying that the characters here never developed so far that I could believe that _they_ would do that. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that, of course, as a woman, she was moved through lush scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that do not become sentimental in an artificial manner. <br /> <br /> Co-writer, co-director of Sky, says he himself wore too many hats during this production. Too many cooks can spoil the broth, but only one cook can end up making a special offer after school. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the title of this film has less to do with history and is more associated with the feeling of regret, helplessness and loss, the accompanying revelation that you will never see your money again.
