First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and start doing work. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman is leaving to do some work for his masters, why spend almost a third of the film on these episodes. Then Hackman stops at the hotel, and the storyline never goes anywhere again, just proving to us that Hackman is under close supervision, and everything he says or does is known to the masters. Again another 20 minutes. Then they spent more time reuniting with their wife. All this should take no more than 10-15 minutes, just as a setup for real action, intrigue and plot twists. By the time the real events began, I felt so bored that I just wanted the film to end. Hackman, as usual, is great, like other actors, but this is very bad.
