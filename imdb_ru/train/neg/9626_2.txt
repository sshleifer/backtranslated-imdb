Do not make any bones out of it. There is a lot of bad stuff in this movie. This is all a cliché, not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start from the beginning: characters. There is a boring, unlucky guy who gives Stiller another mark in his boring, unlucky guy - supposedly wild, but in fact just normal, love interest - which Aniston plays well, but really didn’t need any effort to do it - a fat cheerful friend, and then an assortment of clichés: an annoying bold Australian guy, a confident Spanish guy, etc. Storyline: the beginning is a bit unusual, but after that goes in the standard style of any movie, with every turn of the plot, as predictable as your about A little joke The biggest problem was that the “development” of Stiller’s character seemed to come from nothing — like your school play, the writers knew where he started and where he finished, but they didn’t make enough effort to correctly tell the average bit. Finally, the supposed “jokes” were nothing more than heavily diluted versions of the standard coarse humor; there was a scene of chanderna regulation, fat sweaty men, etc. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the simple fact about this film is that studying the meaning of the word “chart” was the only good thing. Hamburg did cook a dog dinner here, and Stiller's and Aniston's sugar coating might have enticed the audience, but the taste left at the end was just as rancid. <br /> <br /> Last comment: this film may have I was terrible, but Aniston still chose a better movie between friends than the odious Marcy X Kudrow.
