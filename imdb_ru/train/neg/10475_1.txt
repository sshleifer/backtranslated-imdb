I am the wife of a youth pastor, and we took some young people to watch this film. Then we spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They did not understand, and I did not like it. It is based on a concept that has covered all three major religions of the world (the Bible Code, the Torah Code and the Code in the Quran) and is so dubious that it causes laughter. This is not a step forward for Christians in art; it is a step forward for those who believe that we are testing our brain at the door.
