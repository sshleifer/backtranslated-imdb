It's a kind of genre thing, meaning whether you like the musicals of the 1950s or not. If you do, you will love it. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals with the dance talents of Astaire and Rogers, Eleonora Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple and so on, but songs of the 50s are slower Dance numbers and soap melodramas decades - all this distracts me. <br /> <br /> This film is a good example. The first song was fine, but the following three did nothing for me. By that time, the story did not have much appeal. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another drawback. I don’t think I’ve seen the film in which she starred, and which I liked, including this one, where the pretty English teacher in two shoes, which she portrays, spends half the film, threatening to leave Siam. (I had her!). <br /> <br /> However, separating themselves from likes and dislikes, one cannot deny that this performance by Rogers and Hammerstein is very attractive for many, especially for those who, a decade later, liked “The Sound of Music”. There are similarities in R & H musicals. So, if you liked the Julie Andrews film, you should like it too. <br /> <br /> This is a generous production with a capital "L." This is the type of musicals that you rarely saw after this generation. You also get dubbed singers, unlike today, where the actress can't really sing, so Marnie Nixon comes to the aid of Kerr, as she did with Natalie Wood in West Side Story and Audrey Hepburn in “My Fair Lady.” “<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner -“ King Mongkut ”and a stereotypical traditionalist, good directors always portray negatively. He’s not“ progressive ”, as the leftists say, but the teacher of education (Kerr, like“ Anna Leonovens ”) will correct him Today's secular progressives always put teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! Nevertheless, Yul is good in this role and even uses some comedy along with his character “barks more than bites.” Justifiably, he is a big star of this film. Brynner had magnetism, even in the "Magnificent Seven" U was the only cowboy, who had hypnotized the audience. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good film for its day, and millions of people have enjoyed them. I'll leave it at that.
