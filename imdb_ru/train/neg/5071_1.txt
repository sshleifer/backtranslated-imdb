I can not even believe that this show lasted as long as and. I guess this is all part of America's stupidity. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked the show more when it bore its original name - “Seinfeld”. What bothers me most about this show, besides the obvious, basic sense of “humor” and general impudence, is the pretentious way of labeling episodes. Truly great shows are still funny after many replayings, such as “the one where Rob is randomly hypnotized,” on the “Dick Van Dyke Show” or “the one where Lucy and Ethel work at a pastry factory.” In other words, it is a great honor for the audience. The fact that the authors and producers of Friends will have unbending arrogance to actually headline the episodes themselves, thus, even before someone even sees him a second time, speak not only about mediocrity and the lack of original thinking with the parties of these authors, as well as the ordinary minds of their viewers. <br /> <br /> You read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a distinctive feature of the card type Neverland, filled with mood for greeting cards. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. It is assumed that these people work in coffee shops and are looking for work for actors, but somehow they manage to live at $ 4,000 a month. apartments? Become a real one. All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live an idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all this. This New York does not exist for those who earn less than a serious six-digit income. But, good luck with all this, anyway. Now shut up and hand over to Soma.
