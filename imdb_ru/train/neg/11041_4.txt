The show is average. It does not make me laugh especially. However, I think Courtney really knocks it down. She doesn't look natural. She has three ways to communicate, all robotized. She speaks quietly (without intonation), speaks normally (without intonation), or she does what she starts to say normally and starts screaming gradually. However, her scream is like “let's pretend that I scream because I shouldn’t be too loud on the set”. <br /> <br /> She is constantly aware that this cute actress is doing this funny thing. It is annoying. You cannot get her identity because she does not produce emotions and does not get upset. She has this husband who does all this nonsense, and there is no reaction from her. Very dry and simple action.
