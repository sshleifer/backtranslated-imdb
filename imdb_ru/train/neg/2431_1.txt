As a Turkish man who now lives in Sweden, I must admit that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most, if I never understand them. I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched the Polish Wedding film with my Polish friend, and we both said that this is the worst film we have ever watched. Unfortunately, I was wrong, this film “House of Angels” is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the so-called star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that no one can believe it. I think from the very beginning all this is a mess. a lot of bad play, with the exception of Selldahl and Walter. Ahmed Sellam
