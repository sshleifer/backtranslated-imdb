Well, where to start? Straightheads presents me with a small dilemma. If this film came out of Italy, for example, in 1975, and was filmed by director Ruggiero Deodatto with David Hess in the lead role, then I would have performed it faster than Labrador drinks water on a summer day. Since while Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere in deference to the Grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed has created his own picture of Greenhouse Rape / Revenge in England, and seemingly the same budget as Rodriguez to turn Rose’s leg McGowan's machine gun. Because if you want to play greenhouse bingo, let me call the “numbers”: <br /> <br /> 1. A rich, high-flying career woman improbably meets roughly from the wrong side of the track and, no less improbably, gets for it lust Check it out. <br /> <br /> 2. Hateful shots of the mentioned high flying career of a woman in various states of nude. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 3. The intricate and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters who exist solely to do what they do and that cannot be supposed to exist outside the scenes in which they are located. Check. <br /> <br /> 4. An overly graphic scene of rape being committed by a gang of men without any appreciable depth of individuality or lineage, except that they exist to rape. Check it out. <br /> <br /> 5. Sandy and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to complete it all. Bingo! <br /> <br /> The Straightheads are pretty simple things: Dyer meets Anderson, and she invites him to a party in a pile of the country that belongs to her boss. On the way home, they upset three locals at Landover, who are taking revenge by giving Dyer a good shoe and a gang that is raping Anderson. The couple then proceeded to revenge. So, "Straw Dogs", "Late Night Trains", "House on the Edge of the Park", "I Spit on Your Grave", etc. And so on. So, why didn't I really think about this film? For a number of reasons: I believe, first, the likes of Gillian Anderson in the lead role make me expect more, but this is a complete lack of honesty than most. <br /> <br /> Because whenever someone sits down to watch Hess and his relatives terrorize women and kill their men in those periodic plays of the 70s, and then they always know exactly what they get - low-budget posts, designed exclusively for shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator. The villains terrorize and kill the treats, the treats turn over the tables of the villains and kill them back, and everyone leaves home contentedly, their desire to see some cruel violence has died away and is safe, knowing that the world order has been restored. <br /> <br /> As a writer and director, Dan Reed clearly believes that Straightheads can say much more about the state of the human psyche, and desperately tries to absorb his film with a philosophical depth that simply does not exist, for example, when Anderson and Dyer plan to get revenge on their attackers, they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter, who is the object of desire for two men with whom he hangs around. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he confesses that he raped her only so that his two friends would distract his attention from his daughter !!! The random and audacious way that Reed throws this little revelation into the plot is simply overwhelming, almost as if he expected that this simple mention of pedophilia would be enough to throw the moral compass of the audience into overload and force them to leave the movie, thinking that they just experienced something significant. To make sure that we “understood”, at this moment we are shown the second time a sequence of rapes, allegedly from the point of view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter, but Reed guarantees that we will get much more shots Anderson rudely and raped through the hood of his car . Free is not included. <br /> <br /> After explaining the reasons for the rape, Anderson ties him to the table, drags the working end of a sniper rifle (complete with a bulky silencer, just in case someone isn’t found). I do not understand the phallic images), but he lacks the courage to pull the trigger, telling Dyer (who has no such moral doubts) that "it's over." Dyer argues otherwise, and their moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell may have discussed in their rooms at Cambridge over tea and cake. It is almost impossible to find in its absurdity. <br /> <br /> In fairness, Mrs. Anderson plays her feelings throughout the film. Obviously, she wants to leave Scully far behind, and, bless her, she certainly does; I wonder what Mulder would have done if his former partner squatted down to get on the side of the road and then rape a man with a gun? Dyer, on the other hand, does what he did in almost every film he has shot to date, that is, he plays a guy with a bobbin, with a fraudulent smile, a cheeky face and a face that most people will never get. tired of being hit. This is especially true in the final scene, where, after the cold-blooded murder, Dyer looks into the camera, as I am sure, and it must be an expression of existential agony that encourages us to sympathize with the fact that he dealt with the fate and moral difficulties that he had to overcome , but instead he is a lot more reminiscent of Oliver Hardy, who stares into the camera with irritation after Stan put him into another beautiful mess. Which, by the way, sums up this film quite nicely.
