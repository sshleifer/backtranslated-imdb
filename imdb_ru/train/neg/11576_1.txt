Saw it at the loud UCSB festival and was * shocked that he won the Golden Drum award. I was not the only one, considering that the public had a mixed reaction to the work. I thought there were many other best films, but then I learned that the judges were deeply rooted in the field of movie theory and other cunning crap. While cinematography and editing are not inferior to many other shorts, storytelling is nothing but your usual material for a student. It seems that “serious” student films should include one of the following categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and possible suicide — Nick and Kate deal with everyone and include all three. Please be more original! <br /> <br /> Yes, perhaps this is the opinion of my stranger, but the guy from Montecito sounds a bit fake. Does anyone else think so?
