Despite the rave reviews this film has received in New Zealand, unfortunately, there is no merit in any hype around the production. In addition to the plot, intended only for clich√©s, the film is disappointed with a weak acting game, accents and a complete lack of tension. <br /> <br /> Despite the general view of a large budget (for New Zealand), the feeling is definitely a small town of Kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who have, will immediately understand the similarities ... I heard the comments that scenes such as boys playing basketball, etc., were filmed in order to make fun of the cliche "boys talk" shit ", but it looks like coercion ... <br /> <br /> I suppose that Oscar Keitley considers himself deeply ironic, but again his delivery always seems just vaguely shy. <br /> <br /> Those who have any doubts that the culture of the Samoans living in New Zealand deeply, I hope, not forever, is affected by American speech , culture and everything between them will no doubt be decided at the end of this film. Robby Magasiva always looks good on the screen, but the script brings her. <br /> <br /> It always annoys me when in the comedy there are scenes that are set up in such an obvious way you have the feeling that you have a good moan on the shock line - look what you want to be a white boy ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this film is very fun, however, this person has the brain of a tadpole, and he will try his best to pronounce her name if he will offer a million dollars .... <br /> <br /> This kind of sums up the mentality of this film, well, but not great, fun, but not funny ..... Wake up, New Zealand is NOT a 5-star film, despite all the glowing (middle class white wine ?? :-)) reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? if you watch it, get drunk first !!!
