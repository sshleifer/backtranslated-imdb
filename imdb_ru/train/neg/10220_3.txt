First of all, this film can be divided into three stages. A promising ambush with some cavalry by the Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with Candace Bergen and Soldier Blue completely erroneous traveling together to achieve the security of the army garrison. Miss Bergen utters irrelevant four-letter words every time she opens her mouth, and it looks as if she just left a Jack Nicholson film from the 1970s. I mean, she maintains zero interest, with zero plausibility. The third and final section is devoted to a completely free slaughter of an Indian village. It is so obvious that to overdo the anti-war propaganda that it looks just long, outrageous and far-fetched. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacob (comment above) Here's an idea. Why don't you actually watch the movie you comment on instead of chirping your liberal nonsense. This is not a political site, it is for film reviews. - MERK
