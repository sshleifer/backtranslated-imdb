Man, the ending of this film is so horribly ugly and outdated that my whole movie aesthetic class was laughing like crazy. Now most of the movie was fine. He had some unintentionally funny scenes, but there were some really good camera and editing shots. Yes, Alderich is a great director who made, among others, “The Flight of the Phoenix” and “Whatever Happens to Baby Jane.” The problem is not leadership, action, or something technical. The film is simply destroyed in the third act. What for? Killings, turns, turns, and characters revolve around the NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the hell did a writer smoke when he invented it? The way it came out of nowhere may have been the largest Deus Ex Machina in history. Despite all the complaints about the planet of the monkeys of Burton, the life of David Gale or the infamous, I think that this is the worst end of all history. What a disappointment.
