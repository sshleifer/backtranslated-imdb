This remake of the original 1962 film 'in the book has some very good parts to compliment it and some wonderful performances of some great actors - however Scorsese picks the most formal twists of the plot and the embarrassingly overvalued demise of Shakespeare by the end, which made me look at my watch. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is a great actor who has dedicated himself to giving all his strength to the work he does, but he needs a direction to focus his talent, and the film is not enough in the last five minutes. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's cameo is sound, but no more than that, although Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with so many lines. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte gets better performance than Lorenzo oil, but not in the same form as weeds. Joe Don Baker has great features, and Juliette Lewis proves once again that talent sometimes skips a generation. <br /> <br /> Any good moments? Starting credits (!), First look at Cody's back, when he makes failures in prison, the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowden in complete panic, outwardly calm, but frustrating Cody's superiority. <br /> <br /> Worst? "Woman-cleaner - BUT NOT REAL !!!" part. Cling with your bare hands to the bottom of the car for a hundred miles at high speed. (In the US, there are no speed shots?) "He is dead - BUT NOT REAL !!!" partS and the above ending is rambling. <br /> <br /> I can look at the original again, but I havenâ€™t had the temptation to watch the remake four years after it was viewed.
