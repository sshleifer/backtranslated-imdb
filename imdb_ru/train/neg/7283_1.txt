Facts about the National Lamphun goes to the movies, a.k.a. Madness in the cinema of the National Lamphun: <br /> <br /> 1. The film is bad, even by typical Lampoon standards. 2. This is not funny. 3. No one goes to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> So, after I finished watching him, I began to wonder why he was called "The National Lantern Goes to the Cinema", and why he had ever thought, much less is actually done. It's like calling Austin Powers an “American guy in a movie.” How lame. He is not an American, and he does not go to the movies. None of the characters in Lampun’s so-called “satire” is funny, and no one goes to watch movies, which causes problems. I was hoping that it would be something in the spirit of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This was the first National Lampoon film after Animal House, although the quality of this film isn’t. Poorly developed, rude and amateur by any standards, it causes headaches not a good sign for an 89-minute film that seems twice as long. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. Are really bad movies usually renamed? and this little catastrophe falls into this category. He has two separate titles — probably to help try and promote it to people who are too stupid to remember how poorly panned it got from critics of the home video in 1982/83. "Hmm, movie madness ?? I have never heard of this movie before! Let's rent out! And then the realization: “Hey, wait a minute, it's just“ National Lampoon Go to the Movies ”!” <br /> <br /> He was postponed by MGM / UA, he was never released to the cinema or on DVD; sometimes he appears on television several times in a decade, and this is the only place where you can find him. <br /> <br /> Is it divided into three plots ?? a parody of a video on self-improvement, oil and corporate ruthlessness, and police films about cruelty / friendship with the police (I guess). In the first segment, Peter Rigert (Animal House) plays a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does other things. I'm not sure that because it was so boring, my mind began to drift. Until the sex scene has surfaced. <br /> <br /> Part II about an exotic dancer, raped with a stick of butter (do not ask), who decides to become the Queen of Margarine, so that she can cut off the stock of dairy products. Oh! Here is the only funny line in the film: “Only I can make love to my son!” If you think that this sounds not very funny, are you right? is not. And just imagine ?? This is the highlight of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III about a cop who stalks a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd), only to lose composure and shoot the guy. Does it have one funny scene, but is it extremely overloaded ?? only Lloyd really demonstrates humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, but strangely surreal. The part where he is strangling his victim, and the meek policeman stands watching the whole thing unfold, at least causing a laugh or two. <br /> <br /> It is a shame to observe how such a composition of half-known names resorts to low standards. The authors of each segment clearly believe that they are very ironic and smart, faking the so-called stereotypes ?? the blame is that the film becomes one huge contradiction, giving preference to the standard T & A instead of the plot; rude humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired ones. It is easy to see that none of the actors were delighted with the material mumbling their lines, often so embarrassed that they rarely can look into the camera’s eyes. <br /> <br /> As I said, the film is not funny before. I laughed once, only on one line, and even then she was indecisive. Two laughs, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies look like ordinary tracks for laughs. <br /> <br /> I like the National Lampoon vacation series (or at least three out of four parts) and their classic Animal House, but their recent killing of bombs for live videos, such as Golf Punks (along with this great comic genius tom arnold), are a good example of why their magazine came out of print more than ten years ago. It gets really old, very fast. <br /> <br /> It is sad to see that the new film, called Gold Diggers, is being released with their “seal of approval”. Is it like condemning a movie before it goes to the cinema? maybe they should not advertise their name everywhere? <br /> <br /> Distributor: “This film is bad. It receives the National Pamphlet seal of approval. This will teach you not to do something terrible next time. <br /> <br /> Forget about the death penalty. Just put a group of criminals in the room and make them watch it again and again every day for a month. <br /> <br /> This is so bad that I can't even begin to explain his rotten meanness. I give up.
