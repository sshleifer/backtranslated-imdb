Before I explain the Pseudonym comment, let me say that The Trail of the Desert is bad even by the standards of Westerns who watch The Three Puppets. In fact, Carmen Laro portrays the welterweight girl Juanita, when you hear her Mexican accent, you immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic short film The Hurry Rescued by Beauty. <br /> <br /> In “The Footprint of the Desert,” John Wayne plays Mo Howard’s character, and Eddie Chandler plays Curly Howard’s. Like their colleagues from Stooge, in the 53-minute film “Me,” Curly plays with a gag. Wayne's character, the hooligan skirt, is not very attractive, but must be a good guy. <br /> <br /> While playing the cowboy rodeo, Wayne holds a rodeo cash register under a cash register and takes a prize pool that he would have won if attendance was good - other riders had to pay 25 cents per dollar (in fact, even less after Wayne robbed the cashier). No explanation is given, as Wayne rips riders and is still considered a hero who gets a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> At this point, things get complicated, because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his partner Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix, who will play Sheriff Mick in the TV movie “Shooter”) will see Wayne Rob box office, and then steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Mo and Curly are blamed. <br /> <br /> Moe and Curly move to another city to get away from the law, and they change their names to Smith and Jones. Who they meet first, but their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the second half, loves love (senorita Rita left behind the old town and no longer appears in the film). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is beautifully played by the radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman (now she has grown, but in her younger years she was one of the first actors in Hal Roach’s shorts “Our Brigade”). Kornman is the main reason to look at the mega-slowed western, and her scenes with Mo and Curly are much better than the others in the production, as if they were using a completely different film crew for their filming. <br /> <br /> Even in 1935, the sequence of actions in this film was extremely weak, and the technical shooting was amazingly bad. The two main chase scenes end with video footage of a horseman falling from a horse. Both times the editor removes one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film’s stock is completely different, and the character is dressed in clothes different from the stuntman. Video footage is widely used elsewhere, and none of them are even convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to watch is the scene in the middle of the film, where Mo and Curly get on their horses and leave (on the screen to the right) from the cabin, as the squad jumps to the left of the cabin. , The operator monitors the two puppets with slow panning to the right, and then panning to the left to show the approaching squad. Outside of home movies, I have never seen anything like it, not because it looks stupid (what it does), but because a competent director would never put a scene that way. They shot two outgoing riders, and then rearranged the camera and filmed the squad as a separate action. Or, if they felt creative, they would put a sequence, so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and a squad approaching in the background. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
