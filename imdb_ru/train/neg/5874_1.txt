one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Pompous action scene and really bad game also do not help. The only good point is the details of Gary Buzie, but this doesnâ€™t make the film much. He corresponds to his B-film rating and is successfully passing the test. Wasting my money, although I found it interesting to start with what gets annoying after a few hours. I do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or as a gift. (a gift you can ask for and send back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Valid BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
