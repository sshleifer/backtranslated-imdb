A friend of mine bought this film for £ 1, and even then it was greatly overrated. Despite the fact that it featured such big names as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Bert Young, this film was as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it right in the ear. It uses tired comedy techniques - they constantly break the fourth wall while Sandler talks to the audience, and seem like pointless installations of “hot girls”. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to become a successful comedian to succeed with women. When a comic resident of the ship - shamelessly called “Dicky” due to his inconceivable success with the opposite sex - is considered lost at sea, Sandler's character Sheker gets a big break. Dickie is not dead, he is rather locked in the bathroom, probably sick by the sea. <br /> <br /> Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst movie of all time.
