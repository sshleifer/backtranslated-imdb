This series has its ups and downs, and the last case is here. There is a pleasant amount of spatter with the creative implementation of the “Trolley Cart” weapon, but the editing film is not seriously connected, and the process of making the film itself is more rough than usual. From time to time, the action slows down to crawl, as the camera monitors the dumb walk of the “baby”, who almost got lost early. In general, disappointment. <br /> <br /> However, in music and action there is a spaghetti-oriental quality that can be approved by loyal viewers. This release spends most of his time after minor misadventures of a little boy, who begins to look into the abyss of death, which his father opened for him.
