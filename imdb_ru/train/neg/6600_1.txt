Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and experience a good mood for him, you are better than me! This film, although it is a great attempt to “imitate” Laurel and Hardy in appearance, sound and routine, is very far from honoring them or is even a film of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue is cut off from the old L + H films and sown in an unrealistic way, the plot is confused with the useless characterization of other unnecessary colleagues, Pinchot's accent was strange for Stan, and although Sarten coped well with Ollie's accent, he too tried to create a wonderful mix that Mr. Hardy was. Where was the (good) music number? Editing is intermittent, acting is tough, the lines are terrible, physics is implausible (although maybe they tried to give him a sense of cheap sets?), And in general this is a terrible thing to testify about. Watching is even more painful than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made his last film in the horrible writing and photography of the 1950s era. Do yourself a favor and watch as many ORIGINAL films about Laurel and Hardy as possible and find out how it all happened. You know what MAGNAT is, right? Stan Laurel didn’t answer constantly with half-crazy jokes on every sentence. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for those who believe that IT was a worthy update / honor for the boys. Where was the classic song?!? Why tear down "Here's another great mess"? Why miss "any wiser"? Why was there a pointless flock of colleagues? WHY MISS THE GULCH FROM THE STORE? WHY WILL LARRY HARMON BE IN THIS? WHY BOSO!? AND A LEARNING CHANNEL helped finance the thing? <br /> <br /> I mean really. For God's sake, joke. <br /> <br /> Fart.
