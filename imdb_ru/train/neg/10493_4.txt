It is difficult to classify the film. I never gave him a 110% concentration and, therefore, as simple as the plot seemed, I could not say exactly who did what the American FBI characters did and what their roles were. I could not seriously take the Irvins as heroes of the film, when all their lines and scenes were in the style of one of his shows, and not played out. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a celebrated episode of the Discovery television series. the show, with a largely insignificant ongoing storyline that seemed to only get in the way. However, since any Irwin show is always worth seeing, this film is also worth watching, but not at Christmas. Speaking about this, I also have more important things to do than here. <br /> <br /> High 4/10
