I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess what I did not do before viewing the TLB, and I must say that I was very surprised to see a higher average rating on IMDb. I found that he had a complete lack of history. You just get into it (and, unfortunately, not in the sense in which "Salvation of Private Ryan" threw us into the film), and he also had a sudden end, which was very unpleasant for me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the wounded soldiers looked quite realistic for me, especially given the small budget. But get ready to laugh ... Some guys are thrown into the air after the explosion, as if they are Olympic gymnasts. An air spin or a flip during World War I is too much for me, especially when it happens countless times during a movie ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that really made me laugh until I was almost cried were scenes containing melee. Screaming and screaming German voices ... incredibly funny. It seems that they are spoken by one actor / voice performer, because they all sound exactly the same, and it just sounds like a “typical” German voice. <br /> <br /> I would absolutely NOT recommend this film to anyone except people who just want to laugh because of the sad and banal quality of it.
