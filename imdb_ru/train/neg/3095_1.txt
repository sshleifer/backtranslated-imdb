Wow, I finally managed, after several attempts to finish watching this horrible movie, only to find out that Rick Sloan and his film crew completed the direct shooting this year. <br /> <br /> Of all the films watched by MST3K - and they are really digging from the bottom of the trunk, demonstrating the reputation of the bad “Manos”, “Werewolf”, “Incredibly Strange” and lesser known disasters such as “Lazerblast” Zombie Nightmare, '' and Time Chasers' are by far the largest pile of trash they have ever shown (which makes it ideal for a riff). Very simply, a film about a bunch of gremlins, similar to Manchy, is free, exploiting people's desires for fame, luck, skill and, of course, sex, in such a way that people eventually die. But this is a film in which acting is so ridiculous (for example, the test of masculinity is shown by two guys fighting in the front yard with garden tools), the script is so forced (for example, often described). the scene of a gremlin hanging on the hand of one girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time in the film, it happens), and the story is ... rarely paid attention (hence MST3K riff about "the law in the future, when films are to be made by FILMmakers"), which you actually support, that the fluffy puppets kill everyone on the screen. Worst movie ... ever.
