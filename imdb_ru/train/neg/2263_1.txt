Well, let me say that I didn’t expect the starring film with Jerry Springer to be cinematic, all I asked for was cinematographically ... and not even that. It was like someone else's bad home movies. He acted badly, wrote scripts and brought to the extreme the nakedness of the most unsightly people I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> “The plot” of the film is dedicated to a lower class family who decides to go to the “Jerry Farrelli Show” to discuss several cases between the mother, daughter, stepfather and daughter's daughter. From there the film exhales and turns into a unique experience : white trash pornography. Is there sex, interracial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film inspired me to want to run out of the theater and make a second circumcision. At least it was fortunately short. Disgusting and humiliating African Americans and the working class of America should take offense. (Howard Stern must be pleased, however, he did not miss his attempt to get fame in the movie. He was smart, funny and entertaining) <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F + (daughter was hot)
