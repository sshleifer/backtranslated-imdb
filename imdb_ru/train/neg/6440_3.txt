It was one of the worst Restlemania I have ever seen. It just didn't stand out in reality. As for the cards, I thought it would be pretty good, but every match seemed to fail. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs. MVP One of the best matches. Benoit carried it. I just did not think that MVP was so good, but Benoit saved this match. <br /> <br /> Kane vs. Hali Wow, these two guys don't talk. Or maybe this is Khali, and any other living thing does not mix. Horrible match. <br /> <br /> Melina vs Ashley I'm not a fan of female wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was delighted with this match until I saw it. Indeed, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB match so far. Just a big disappointment for many people in the ring at the same time. It just did not live. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs Umaga OK not very impressive, but not the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs. Undertaker This was probably the best match of the night. It's very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Sean Michaels. I really feel that this match deserves to be the last. People argue that Batista is against Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I'm getting tired of Sina winning every match. Getting a little old. Now, I must say, I feel that this match is the best of the night, but I am a big fan of Sean Michaels, so I am biased a little. Batista vs. Tucker may have been better, but I am biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best matches of the night, and most of the rest failed.
