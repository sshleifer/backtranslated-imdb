In this film there can be no questions about spoilers, the director also beat us all and spoiled this film in many ways. <br /> <br /> This is a clear theft of such things as Critters and Gremlins, this film falls through. on so many levels to bring back the humor and horror of those films that were made better. This ends in a miserable waste of time when bad actors lead a bad dialogue in front of an idiotic director who sometimes throws soft toys to them. They struggle with these toys in much the same way as the old Tarzan films, which used rubber crocodiles, swaying them while screaming and trying their best to make it look a little threatening. It hurts to look at it, and the mental fashion of the 80s, which the cast wears, does not help. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy little aliens who fall into the trap of an aging guard on a movie set are finally released after the tenth. years of imprisonment, and begin to telepathically hang out with people's minds. The rookie guard, the idiot who released them, despite repeated warnings, gathers his gang of friends from the 80s together, and together they set off on small adventures, trying to get Graham back ... Hobgoblinov. <br /> <br /> All life is here, with a gang consisting of a fool, his girlfriend, whores of the 80s, a frigid and cute girlfriend of the hero and a young hero who lacks self-confidence and who wants his girlfriend still extinguished. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this is the infamous rake fight scene, where a former military athlete shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully, swaying the hero's know-it-all with the wrong end of the rake for several hours. Then they run, ending with a real style of fighting with pies, ending with a night club with a hiss, where comical hand grenades explode everything except the people standing next to them. Then the film ends, and all is well that ends well. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. It is like looking at a train wreck, it’s impossible to look away, it’s so bad. Great fare in Mystery Science Theater, but damn, it's terrible if you try to watch it alone. The Fashion Police still have a number of outstanding casting orders, and I dare not laugh at anyone in direct mockery of the rake. On a good day, this estimate does not exceed 2 out of 10.
