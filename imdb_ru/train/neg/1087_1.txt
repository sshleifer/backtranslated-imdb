This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. With the participation of good actors, the film does not meet expectations. The most dramatic thing in this film is music, which pretty much sums up the film: it compensates for a bad and confusing storyline, having well-known actors, loud and dramatic music. This does not change the fact that this is a very boring movie. Earned a bill 1.
