This film is the crappy and unforgettable car of Sean Connery. The performances are generally shitty, especially Capshaw, Fishburn and usually solid Ed Harris. Connery seems to be mistaken as a Harvard Academician. The film is getting worse and worse. This is the third step of the mystery, which becomes extremely far-fetched by the time it is revealed. The film squanders a great cast. George Plimpton also finds himself in a minor role to add a bit of seriousness to Connery as they discuss the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere intersect the mystery / thriller of the third level, which is the highest degree of manipulation. Scenarios and guidance are extremely bad. Connery's charisma and presence on the screen is the only merit of the film. Manipulative, Cruel and Funny. 2/10 Avoid this.
