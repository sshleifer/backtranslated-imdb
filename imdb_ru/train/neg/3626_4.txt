I don't know what Oscar voters saw in this film, but they must have seen some pretty difficult things to see in it, to be able to reward him with the best Oscar picture. All I know is, fortunately, Gene Kelly to play it, or it would be twice as bad as I suppose. First of all, I do not think that Leslie Caron was really able to play such a role. She is not so talented, she is not a great dancer, and she does not look good. It is a pity that one actor or actress can spoil a movie, as if he had played in it, because if Leslie Caron had not participated in this, he could have made a stunning film. The story was clever, the direction was good, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I don’t say all these things about Leslie Caron, just to criticize her, I just say that, because I think this is the worst part of the movie. She is probably a good actress, but I can’t say because I haven’t seen her in anything else, but I think she was pretty bad in “American in Paris”. So, if you want to see it, go ahead, but I tell you, you better watch "Singing in the Rain."
