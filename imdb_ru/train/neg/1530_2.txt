I wish I recorded "MEN IN WHITE" so that I could watch it again. <br /> <br /> “What? You mean you really liked it, Theo? ”<br /> <br /> No, I mean that I could see it. again to see if it was as backward, stupid and as embarrassing as I recall, <br /> <br /> Many people claimed that it was made for children. May I suggest that this was also done by the children? because there are no disciplines on the part of the producers and writers in the whole structure of the script, and most of the film sets seem to have been included, because it seemed like a good idea at the time. <br /> <br /> Cast does not help, but I sincerely began to pity them. Honestly, you can believe that during the filming of the actors had to lie to their families that they were shooting a hard core porn movie such was their embarrassment due to the need to appear in something as dark as this. To give you an idea of ​​how bad the acting game is every time when BAYWATCH baby Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the narration, I waited patiently for her to appear, and after a few seconds I forgot that she was in the film. Got it? A star from BAYWATCH appears, and after a few seconds you forget that they are in the film. It tells you about everything you need to know about the MEN IN WHITE standard <br /> <br /> It is fair enough that he is trying to be a living fighter like “GOODIES” (although “DISMALS” would be the best adjective for this film ) Although, perhaps, the film deserves praise for the fact that it never goes down to the toilet humor, but considering that this is a children's film (this did not prevent ITV from broadcasting it at 11 o'clock in the evening), in any case it should not have humor
