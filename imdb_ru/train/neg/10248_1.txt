The end of the world looks like a good movie on the cover of the box, but be careful, it is bad. Being a big fan of mega-star actor Christopher Lee, I was fooled. like tentacles (77) a good cast doesn't mean it will be a good movie. the beginning looks promising, then it turns into tedious, in many parts of the film it is too dark to see what is happening. the rest of the cast is shown briefly: Lew Eyres, Dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as a guard. I would have expected more from the group of Charles, who made good funny films, such as “Reanimator” and “Dolls”. said his co-stars are José Ferrer, John Carridin and Dean Jagger. Well, Dean Jagger is there, but the other two didn't (lucky for them) if you make a film about the end of the world, use a larger budget and better storyline. 79) Sue Lyon (Lolita) is also in the film minus her lollipop. If you crave punishment, then watch the end of the world, which I dare say, woke up during the entire movie. 1 out of 10.
