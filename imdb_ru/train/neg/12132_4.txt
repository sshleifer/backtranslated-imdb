A trio of criminals with a low standard of living led by Matt Dillon fails the nightly burglary. They run, but quickly intersect with the police, who accidentally pursue terrorists. Of course, the police take a burglar gang for a terrorist, a real terrorist escapes, and the robbers are forced to take refuge in a small dive at the bar, taking hostages, not knowing why the police are so eager to catch them. And guess who else chose the bar as a bed? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And from there it goes down the slope. Spacey gained a lot of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Fay Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but they are all in vain. Mostly because after all the characters are stuck in a bar, all they do until the end of the movie is a dispute. Infinitely and aimlessly. Long before the end of the film, you no longer give a damn what happens to them.
