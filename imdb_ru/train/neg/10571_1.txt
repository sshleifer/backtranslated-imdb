my wife is fanatical on this show. In this case, I bought its seasons from first to third, and the fourth season in order. I personally think that the show is one big farce, the cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano should stick to other films she has made, such as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire, and others; other women supporting the cast are equally out of place in their images. I saw the best special effects in the old Republic Pictures series that I saw in my childhood. I can understand why male leaders stayed on the show for such short periods of time, although I donâ€™t know whether it was their own choice or not. You are welcome. please don't renew for another season, enough Bob
