I can't tell you how pissed off I was after watching this movie. Characters are not at all interesting, the plot does not exist. So, after waiting to see how the lives of these characters influenced each other, in the hope that the last two and a half hours would lead to some significant ending, what do we get ??? Storm frogs. Now yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the main topic, but, firstly, it was presented absolutely without permission, and secondly, it will be lost to all who have not read the Bible (a significant part of the population) or Charles Fort (another big part). As a person with a good style, I thought that this film is a self-satisfying bad imitation of an episode from the series. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. It would be better to spend on reading ... <br /> <br /> ... well, to be honest
