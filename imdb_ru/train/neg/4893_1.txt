The film is really too slow. There are some good images, but it can't outweigh the fact that the film is actually boring. You see intercourse a lot of watermelons and intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little more. It may even seem interesting to someone, but believe me, watching it for 2 hours is not fun at all. Although you laugh a few times, but this is really not enough, and it may be more from despair and disbelief than from fun. To break the boredom, the director tries to insert several video clips into the film. These are really colorful clips of absurd songs, perhaps from the 50s, but it's hard to say for sure, and they try to be so funny that it is really sad. Several times you had the feeling that the plot could develop into something that created a powerful scene, but in the end it just somehow evaporates, that's all. In addition to clips, there are almost no dialogs, let alone music. The director tries to be original and artistic at any cost. Personally, I can not recommend the movie. I believe that art should not be boring. During the show around the movie I yawned, which only confirms my short review.
