It was a kind of enjoyment of this film before the appearance of problems with Ed Norton's facial hair. Without revealing the details of the plot - one day he had a bright beard, but by the same evening his beard had disappeared, and his mustache was very lush. It was much fuller than the mustache that came with the beard. Later, during the dark night under the open sky, the mustache disappeared, and he seemed to be cleaning the shelter. It was a case when stopping to shave would not be an option. These inconsistencies of continuity completely distracted me from the rest of the film and destroyed any authority he had before. In addition, I found that the long scene of a cowboy in his bedroom is too reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver. Even if it was to be a tribute, it was too tight for this viewer.
