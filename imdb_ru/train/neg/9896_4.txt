The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, and Caesar is the father. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. Therefore, it is difficult for me to examine this film in detail, because I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, the role is very complex, and I found that for a newcomer, Leonor Varela just plays. She is strong-willed, but also very supportive, a gentle soul mate. Timothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect, and their romance is the main thing in the first episode. So, in fact, this is not a documentary or Basque, but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After paternity comes a new lover (Marc-Antoine), but the taste is gone: we always remember that our first love. So, I found the second episode boring, and their tragic fate is not very convincing. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the production is luxurious: the scenery is large, tastefully decorated; Moroccan habitats are exotic, and the cabinets are great. The producers probably have a lot of money, but they do not spend anything on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, sphinx) that it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would really like to hear it in French or English to form a final opinion on these two films.
