There was not a single original idea in this story. Topics were taken from various sources; some of them are Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter film), and The Ring. It even got to the point that he showed the same damned glowing circle from the “Ring” and used it as the film's namesake. The soundtrack of Cody Carpenter was almost filmed from Suspiria. I hope no one will be against this comment, vomiting the word HOMAGE. Yes, I saw Argento Deep Red playing in the theater. To assert that a tribute would be nonsense. It was at the limit. Throwing blood and "disturbing" images into the pot does not make a good horror film. Carpenter knew this. He must disappear into obscurity or purchase a time machine.
