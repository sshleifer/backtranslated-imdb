Blimey! I watched the trailer for this film, and although "no, this one is not for me." I watched the faces of my husband and our friend during the trailer and knew that this was a “film about a boy”. I mean, hello! several dancing bartenders with tiptoes - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then I started watching it, it didn't look so bad. so I kept looking. I watched it to the very end. what a cool movie anyway it's chick. these girls are related. This is a really good movie and a little love story. really leaves you with a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story of a girl from a small town who became big in the city after the usual big city passed with **. There were several of them, this is almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think about your life and what you have achieved. well i don't care I think this is because all the work in the script of the bar is very familiar, not only for me, but for many people I know. Do not trust trailers for this - it is aimed at attracting people.
