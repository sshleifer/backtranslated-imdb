Why did I spend my money on this on the last day of Sundance? I want to return the money ... Can I get my 16 dollars back? While I watched this movie, I was all waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was to read a story that really didn't look like a movie. Why did the director zoom in with a handy camera, and then zoom out? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu, who sawed her nails for fifteen minutes? Why, when the actors tried to talk, did they sound like they were reading? Or was it a point? I felt that “Ghost Love” had no history at all, and, frankly, I felt that my friends have holiday videos that have much more entertainment value than this film.
