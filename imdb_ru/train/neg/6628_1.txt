If the scale became negative, I would be happier. It was pleasant to watch Sushmita Sen, and Nisha Kothari had a great future, but the producer and director ruined any pleasure in this story. The choice of angles, the choice of lighting and all well distracted from trying to remember what kind of story. Oh, if the songs and dances didn't make you tear your ears off your head first. The film could have been shot twice in 1.25 hours and would have been pretty good, like “The Seven Samurai,” but the director and screenwriter didn’t take this path, even if the “citizens” finally found their basis and wanted to help. This film fails on many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script — name any aspect of this film — it was BAD — probably the food from the provider was also bad. I have never seen such a horrible movie in 6 years of watching Indian (Bollywood) films.
