Contrary to its name, this film does not offer spices and, as such, viewers are subject to a tasteless dish. All humor seems forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of those Pakistani plays, available on video, including even manners. Everyone shouts, shouts and does strange things for no reason. The package looks interesting, as it is a direct excerpt from the Hollywood Boeing. John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all his films, is completely inappropriate here. If we leave aside the moral factor, even then strange events look trite. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Raval, two experienced players, try their best to make a film to be natural, but in vain. At least, the characters of the three girls should be contrasting to bring some interesting elements, but, unfortunately, and here they all seem brainless lush bimbetchiki (3B), who speak, behave and even shout exactly the same. The main hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls in their home, pretending they would never know each other? Just having sex, what else? The same can be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore, there are so many drummers for no reason - this is not something that the audience easily learns. But, of course, great flesh shows and enticing promos always give Educational films a great start. Now for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pitiful taste. Such moviegoers' sense of humor is undoubtedly distorted and crazed to such an extent that they connect with a sadistic, strange and maddening type of humor, when characters, not themselves, laugh at the characters, but at themselves and at the disappointments that look so meaningless. , that in order to laugh, we must endure such things?
