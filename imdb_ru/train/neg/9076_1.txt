It was by far the stupidest, roughest, most disgusting film I've ever seen. I was tempted to turn off the video recorder, but, as in an exciting way, when I watched a terrible car accident, I literally discovered that it was FOREVER INABLE in all possible ways, and brought it to the end. I am by no means a hypocrite who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen. “Animal House”, “Porky's”, “Something is in Mary”, I found the American films about cakes, and even the notorious Freddie, which I woke, very pleasant on their own rough terms. Mamie Van Doren bath sponge is the worst form of naked geriatrics since The Shining. The film, clumsily edited and filmed with incredibly annoying performances by Devon Sava and Jason Schwartzman, ended without one day making me laugh. The only useful purpose of the film is an example of a textbook on how not to make the big picture. Oh, and it would also serve as a good fertilizer for lawns.
