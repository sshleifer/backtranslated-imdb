Ahh, boring TV shows and pilots who were ripped off in the 70s to make TV equally boring. films! Examples include The Journey to Death (the most hysterically stupid of all), Lingering in space (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International (terribly boring and incredibly confusing), and this boring piece of Quinn Martin glamor . <br /> <br /> Filmed in Hawaii (although you don’t find out about it from the outside), this is clearly the unfortunate pilot for an unsuccessful spy show. The real problem is that you don’t like most of the characters, including the gray protagonist Diamond Head, who looked half asleep throughout the film; his boss “Aunt Mary”, who had a really strange delivery of his lines and scaly white hair, and a tan that looked like it had plaster; A friend / colleague of Diamind Head (damn, I don’t even remember her name), a thin, wooden woman with a flat style of speech who is simply not sexy or interesting; and Zulu's singing companion (again, I can't remember the name of his character), which was not bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the whole performance was Ian McShane, who was a bad guy, but he still proved his acting posture. Despite the fact that the disguise, which the so-called "chameleon" used to disguise, was simply ridiculous. I absolutely do not know what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the laboratory, because of which he dressed as an American dictator and an American general. And I don't care. The plot was just not interesting enough to hold your attention even for ten minutes at a time, not to mention an hour and a half or so, so it goes. Just call it - Hawaii Five No!
