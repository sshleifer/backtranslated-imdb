I usually talk a little about the plot in the first part of my review, but thereâ€™s really nothing to talk about in this film. Just a hodgepodge of other FAR best epics about sword and witchcraft. Lack of cohesion flourishes, as is commonplace. Even the main character, who refuses to wear clothes that are different from the loincloth, is rather boring, since she has mostly the chest of a young boy. At best, funny in its incompetence, and at worst, far behind. Lucio Fulci broke the bottom of the trunk, and it shows. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Additional materials for DVD: gallery of posters and frames; Lucio Fulci Bio; and American and international theater trailers <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Xiani is topless everywhere (some may find it attractive, I didn't); various additions are also topless
