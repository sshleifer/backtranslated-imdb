If I could, I would give ZERO stars for it, but unfortunately, I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is not a single scene I could laugh at ... but the game is not made me laugh too. So, if you are some poorly backward people, go to the local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people have already done. <br /> <br /> but for me ... in a film where children are shot to achieve humor ... good taste goes beyond ... this was the third time I spent my time watching a movie about Boll and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... Iâ€™m ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE LEAVE IT TO MAKE MORE MOVIES !!!!!
