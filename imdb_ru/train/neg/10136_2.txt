No one may like this film for its merits, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy Schloch’s films for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. He occupies the “Road House” there for his ridiculous characters, scenery and storyline. A bad letter really shocked me: "I want you to shake off these guys" instead of "... shake those guys off." F-14s take off from an aircraft carrier, but when they come into service, they are F-16! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Seagal returns to work for a general who, just a few minutes before, had watched Seagal's secret “mind clearing”. Seagal runs out of bullets and runs to the knife to kill the guards. Naturally, all the guards throw weapons and fight with knives! A hand grenade is stupid, but it explodes anyway. A small stealth fighter can fly from California to Afghanistan without refueling. Then Seagal sends him back to California - a long way, that is, through Europe - although the carrier provides him with air support at a distance of 20 minutes in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the holder consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat screen televisions and images of sensors and maps on the walls. What a cry!
