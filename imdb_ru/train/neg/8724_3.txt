Good - minuses in the first place: compulsory alligator of the 70s (everything is in order, correction - caiman) with fixed limbs worsens for large-scale miniature underwater pictures (with a full length of reptile comparable to the size of the boat) using a toy alligator orbiting a toy boat in high water - even for night shooting! <br /> <br /> Unlike most primitive films that kill and exploit Western people, superstitious natives fly with the **** and seem to start slaughtering the rest this time unreasonably. Nobody really insulted the natives - exploited, yes, but from ill-treatment. In the end, it was one of the natives (who assaulted a spoiled supermodel during the forbidden full moon) who put the curse on the Demon River on them, right? <br /> <br /> It is easy to annoy holiday-makers (with noticeable exclusion from the “old soul / slightly blasphemous little girl who takes a hero into the light” sign, which you often see in “Euroflicks of the 70s”) but does not deserve violent death - unless they were your next door neighbors, mind you. The couple is actually killed, being heroic - it is remarkable that none of them performs the role of assistant. In the entire film, only two villains in a row, so the demise seems arbitrary rather than cathartic. <br /> <br /> The sequence in which a giant caiman crunches and scarves thirty tourists in less than five minutes is likely to strike you unintentionally cheerful. <br /> <br /> The point at which the natives decided not to wipe out the surviving Westerners and practically say, "Hey, you're not so bad, sorry for this fuss last night" - because they blew up a monster lizard - makes shake your head when banal music starts to sound. You know, the local military dictatorship will destroy the village for tourist trade after the rental of loans ... <br /> <Profi: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You ALL know WHY you are interested in this film, right? I thought so. If you are a Bach's plenipotentiary, get a DVD reprinted with NoShame films earlier this year (digital remastering without any additional additions to the director, who mourns the current state of international distribution of films). <br /> <br /> The hero is not half bad, being far from the idiot (always a plus in movies B), and the cynical little child provides most of the comic relief. <br /> <br /> Worth a look, but get it cheap!
