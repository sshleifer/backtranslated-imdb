OK, another movie bought by me and Joe Swatman. Well, it's not the worst movie I've watched this week, but it still sucked. we had a lot of fun watching this shit. <br /> <br /> Monster Jigsaw is a mixture of all these dysfunctional student ideas, you just know that you are in trouble when someone gives it a buzz The shotgun pilot, the film was not as bad as we hoped I mean death from a heart attack. Again, I think that acting sucks, the amount of the actors should be a porn star and one to get into her undies for what ever reason. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the worst part is the final, it leaves it open to Jigsaw 2, but this will never happen, let's face it. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br /> <br /> funny ridicule 4/100 (how much fun we made fun of her) 73/100 game 8/100 in general 12/100
