Vincente Minelli films are usually worth your time; Meet me in St. Louis, the Bad and the Beautiful. I was waiting for this film with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Came Running is a scene behind the scenes of hopeless fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack who has returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing battered man hanging on him, living in disappointing excavations, as the girl convinces him to finish his disappointing letter project. The film has a great dramatic conclusion, in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and McClain, and something disappointing happens. It is assumed that the sequence is filled with tension, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he is so distracted by beautiful colors, he does not notice that the scene wheezes like cliches, and the characters are so finely drawn and poorly developed that we don’t care that they are shot. (especially McClain) But this is the only real cinematography in the project. Otherwise, we look at the constipation of the characters standing around the bars and living rooms, which irritate each other for two hours. Apparently, damn it, other people. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after World War II is more cleverly solved in the “Best years of our life.” And either of the two Inge products, “Splendor in the Grass” and “Picnic,” covers the despair that they are at a dead end, with much greater urgency.
