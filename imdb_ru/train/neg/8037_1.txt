OK, movie slasher. very, very stupid slasher movie. <br /> <br /> We made your stereotypical teenagers do their homework. We have an FBI agent who saw Dirty Harry once too much. "So what's the secret .... punks?" We got about 4 different small snapshots from the camera and the scene that don't make any sense. “Hey, man, I'm fixing sprinklers” ((this guy was my favorite part of the film)) Suddenly a preacher is tied up on the couch who watches home movies, they kill him. <br /> <br /> They follow the killer to nowhere, without the cops. Suddenly she is in church in a wedding dress I swear this is the stupidest slasher movie I've ever seen.
