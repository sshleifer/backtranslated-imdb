Given the low expectations, the opening of the new video “Husbands” (lasting more than five minutes) was a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new material was class A material, but it provided a very solid basis for what “could be” a good original film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1955. , for one day shooting schedules. After the new footage, Jules White decided to simply record video from the film “Groom without a bride” in this short film, creating a not so smooth transition to the story that Jules and Felix Adler try to fix with a small piece of the new material at the end, giving us the old worn out boys ending (Moe and Larry in this case) shooting ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
