If half of this movie looks strangely familiar, it means that you are watching too much of this terrible Italian cult shit! You see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this film, he also allowed himself to reuse the most sadistic murder sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) Cat in the Brain. The first scene, in which the prostitute is brutally decapitated with an ax, appears in the later film Fulci, as well as another bunch of murders and unpleasant moments. Andrea Bianchi's "Massacre" fails miserably because the search for a sadistic killer among a horror film crew is almost irresistible and disturbing, but it's still good fun if you get into cheap and shocking trash. The inconsistent script represents a whole bunch of disgusting characters who are all potential maniacs, but none of the red herring Biachi comes up with is plausible, and you can almost immediately point to the killer. What remains to enjoy is the truly misogynous effects of the make-up and the hilarious, awesome acting of the ensemble cast. Whenever there is no bloodshed on the screen, for example, between the first and second murders, the “Massacre” is slow and almost unbearable, with its meaningless dialogues and completely uninteresting photography. Fortunately, in the second half, women slaughter fences, and the males are repeatedly struck with rusty spikes. Music is crap and the use of filming locations is very inconceivable. I would advise to skip this puppy and go directly to the aforementioned "Cat in the brain." That one shows ALL the excellent "Slaughter" moments, and then some.
