I donâ€™t envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weiss, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for filming this movie. In a word, boring. Perhaps the fact that it is too predictable, the more than the exploited role of the loser, Ben Stiller, or the not quite funny scenes, makes this film just something to forget. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken ends in a pitiful way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's game. I loved it in most of his films, the last one I saw before that was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not so bad. About Jack Black ... Well, apart from high fidelity, I have never seen him do something good. What about school of rock? Oops, scary.
