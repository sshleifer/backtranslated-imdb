You know Jason, you know Freddie, and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: Killer pins! That's right, in the movie “Killer Workout,” in the movie “Dumb Slasher,” if I've ever seen it, an invisible killer sends its (or her?) Victims with an oversized pin with a novelty. Of course, this is a strange choice that deserves an explanation. Naturally, the film is not even trying to figure out where the killer bought such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the name suggests, the crazy killer is under siege from an aerobic gym and everyone is suspected. In fact, the film gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer, almost everyone in the film is a potential killer until they are killed. And since almost everyone except the killer is dead, it’s actually just a process of destruction. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, although the entire composition of the name is killed, aerobics classes continue in earnest. In fact, nothing can stop the dance. While three people are being killed in the next room, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; one character dies, but is still noticeable in later workouts. Directed by David Pryor, he knew what he did when he was called the film "Killer Training, Not a Logical Training." <br /> <br /> Police pursuits, explosive tanning beds and hundreds of shots of unprotected women's flesh are added for good measure. Just like a woman stuck in a tanning bed, I felt very embarrassed by the end of the Killer Workout. Finally, fortunately, the END flared up on the screen. What happened next? You understand, pictures of women work. Even the end of the film can not stop them! <br /> <br />
