Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered light compared to dramatic films (just look at the Academy Award nominations each year). But, nevertheless, good really art. Look at "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless in Seattle" and classics such as "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night." I like a good feeling when I see two people who are destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This film is trying to create something resembling a romantic comedy. But no one believes in the romance between the main characters, and there is nothing funny in filling this main drawback. Modin is no longer a leading person, especially a romantic one. I am sure, as an executive producer, he had the means - but not a good point - to play himself. And Gershon ... I see the possibilities of some comedic talent, but she had no script and a poorly developed character. And whose idea was an English accent? It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Others talked about this, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly thought out, poorly executed; the actors are terribly wrong; and the characters, well, we just don't scream about them. <br /> <br /> Artistic form is not. Go rent "Moonstruck" again.
