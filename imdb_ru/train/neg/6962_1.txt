How could such good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carol Bouquet be involved in such ... well ... such a thing? I can't get it. It was awful, very palely played (but some of the few leading roles), jokes are stupid and absolutely not funny ... I won't talk about this film anymore, except for one small piece of advice: don't go watch it will be a waste of time and money.
