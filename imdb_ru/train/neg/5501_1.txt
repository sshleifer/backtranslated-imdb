I thought My Favorite Martian was very boring and stretched !! It was not at all funny. The audience just watched the whole movie and did not laugh at all !!! Even the children did not laugh !! This is sad for a Disney movie! I thought they could find someone better to play a Martian than Christopher Lloyd !! He was really stupid !! And he was not funny !! I thought the talking suit was really stupid !!! In the original television series, the costume does not speak or move! In my opinion, they should not have wasted their time on this film !! I give him two fingers down! Really a waste of time, and I would not recommend the movie to anyone !!! Thank you!!
