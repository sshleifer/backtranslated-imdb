Justifications of what happened to his film, from the point of view of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and administrators doing scripts, are rewritten to the side, let's just take this film, as suggested, without any other explanation. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible for God. Straight up trashy. Instead of rephrasing what might be the plot, I’ll have some bright clips that made me scratch my head. <br /> <br /> One out of five students went on an excursion for a history lesson. until the middle of an awesome Ireland. These students may be Canadians or Americans, it is difficult to say. The fact that it was filmed in a Canadian forest, and not in Ireland, is also pretty obvious. One student doesn’t seem to know anything about the story and is mostly a “stupid athlete” character from the 80s movie, except when he broadcasts Randy from Scream. One character can be Chris Klein's backup. He has a girlfriend who is probably being killed, but he was never able to establish whether this is true. One character is sullen and removed from their peers ... just ... because ... and then there's the blonde. Yes, blonde. <br /> <br /> In Ireland lives 2 years. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called “sir” more than once. He is very sinister and wears a knitted hat. His cousin is scattered by a porn star with the worst Irish accent on a dirty film in my life, and most likely outside of it. <br /> <br /> Scenic Ireland has many Canadian forests and wetlands and 2 ducks that appear more than once in cutting scenes. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers received a discount on bulk fake insides. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Without my knowledge, horribly inbred freaks have access to new hunting knives. Perhaps there is a nearby outlet store where the blind and deaf clerk works with the register. <br /> <br /> I also don’t know if you have inbreed for about 600 years, as the story makes us believe that this has happened, you end up to some degree lumpy, but surprisingly sharp and rather strong. Genetics is a great dice game. <br /> <br /> This film may or may not have more than one freak. A link is made to “them,” and we see the shadows, but only one strange looking dude is ever seen. And when one strange looking dude is finally killed, obviously, the whole danger passes. I run with my initial assumption that no one thought it was necessary to put on the second person in full makeup, so they just used one. In any case, on the screen it looks like this. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> In addition to these new shiny knives, inbred freaks have access to some Chic leather gear, as soon as Richard Greco cuts his ties, there are new ones that are ready for the next suction cup, which is tied ... runs away, because the chains give you enough sagging to just unbutton them, making you wonder why they even try to tie someone. <br /> <br /> The dead body in the shack will be filled with maggots after what I assume will be about 2 hours. The said corpse will also be wearing glasses when the characters do not wear them. Curious. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson appears for no apparent reason to the left of the scene, chatting for 2 minutes, disappears from the scene to the left. In the middle of a giant forest. This is not unusual, since Gary can also appear from nowhere, which is also known as what exists on television, from the screen. <br /> <br /> Ms. Jameson dies sadly, and for some reason her clothes disappear, as my hopes that this film will not be spoiled by the wind. <br /> <br /> I offer a special bow to the Breeder character, a poor girl who was used by freaks for several months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes. The poor thing, who still has eyeshadow and who is on the camera of emotions with all the passion and conviction of stuffed chihuahuas. <br /> <br /> The end of this film was clearly hurt by a drunk man or a person with a severe mental disorder. a disability that has been cultivated and encouraged by excessive use of gasoline over the years. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this was not a random nonsense that I discovered in the network of films late at night; obviously, people heard about it and even watched this movie through its production. How sad for all of you. I have nothing to say. May God have mercy on us all.
