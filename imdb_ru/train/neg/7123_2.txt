Welcome to the bad ghost story and someoneâ€™s nightmare. This horror story finds a recently married husband (John Hudson) and a wife (Peggy Weber), haunted by memories of his previous wife and screaming skulls found in their empty mansion and a lily pond. Is the husband really trying to drive his already excited bride crazy? Or is it an experienced gardener Mickey (Alex Nicole), who took care of the territory of the mansion after the death of the original housewife? This low-cost horror movie has a storyline that keeps you through all stages of the final. The special effects are pretty bad even with the 1958 standards. Sometimes I swear that the screaming skull sounds like it should be in a Godzilla film. In the movie "Rev. Snow" is also the character of the actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the hidden gardener (Nicole) is the director of the film. You can catch it as part of Monsterfest AMC.
