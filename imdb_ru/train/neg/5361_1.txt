Saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970s and hated, hated, hated it! This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life. I donâ€™t know where Lee came from, but this is one of those films where you want to shake the characters so that they open their mouth and talk. The name speaks for itself, because there are no saving moments in this film, just a long and long silence with people who cannot clearly express their feelings (presumably). If you want to see something that makes you drink, then this is for you. If you have nothing to do for two hours, insert the plug into the toaster: the experience will be infinitely more enjoyable than anything you get from it! Yes, Lee came up with many really useful things much later in his career, but he missed this one.
