Frankly, it looked like seven hours of boredom. What is it? What is it about Will Smith that I just can't stand it anymore? I guess he is just too obsessed with being taken seriously and getting an Oscar. I understand how biased it is, but if he does not pass several new lessons in acting, I can never see him as a winner. His huge name, and therefore he is usually confused with a talented and diverse actor. He just does not. I give him his due for the fact that he tried so hard and could cry without delay. That's all. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds was for me a kind of dummy from the very beginning. The 911 suicide call didnâ€™t intrigue me. I was not interested to know why he calls his suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson are good at screen chemistry. In addition, I do not know her name, but the Spanish woman did an excellent job with her role as a frightened and battered wife. Woody Harrelson had a very limited screening time, but I would say that he stole the show whenever he was on it. <br /> <br /> In general, just an unusual story of the mill. I could not help but ask myself the whole way why I cared for any of these people. Never regretted Tim / Ben. Did he kill himself with a jellyfish? Was the only survivor in the accident 8 people? Geewiz ... did not expect anything like that ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
