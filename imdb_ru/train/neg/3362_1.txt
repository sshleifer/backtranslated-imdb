The Haunting is another bad horror remake with false special effects and a lot of favorites on the screen, and it has no expiatory qualities, except maybe cinematography. Yes, the remakes are not all bad, but there are definitely remakes of the director Jion Da Bont. I think the A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson) are here to distract us from the boring plot, funny special effects and terrible attempts to scare your audience, but this is a film, not a tabloid magazine. it doesn't matter whose we care about the heroes and talk about two things that this film missed. The storyline is how to take the classic Ghost of the Hill novel and snatch four chapters, and then use what's left for the film, it's so boring and much of it is inexplicable. The characters are pretty thin, and although the acting is good, none of the characters matter to you at all. Lily Taylor performs a terrible performance and sounds like she is 8 years old. She is old when she says her lines, not to mention how awful she is. Lily Taylor is not created for the horror genre at all. Ghosts are stupid and stupid, they look like a bunch of Casper, the Friendly Ghost and the ghost Hugh Caine looks like a fat guy, dressed like a grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine. On the roof of one of the rooms there is a creature with a giant purple mouth, and this is not even funny, unintentionally just sad. beautiful and well thought out, which is probably the only positive thing in this film, it looks beautiful, but it does not save him from his brutal everything else. I can honestly say that I felt that I was spending my time watching “The Ghost” on TV without any price. so I would be even more displeased if I paid to watch it, but fortunately it was on Scream. In general, The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.
