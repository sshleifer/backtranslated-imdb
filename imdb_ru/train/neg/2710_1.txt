Somehow they summed up the results of the 60s, ten years, which radically changed our country, in four hours. And how painful it was four o'clock. They humiliated major events and events, and they "claimed" that they were two families, but you barely saw an African-American family. If I were on NBC, I would be ashamed and ashamed to have thrown such garbage. What was funny was that this happy family, which you saw at the very beginning, was tortured in different ways, but she managed to attend all major events of the 60s across the country. And the second family was not such a factor. They have dedicated this family to maybe five or six scenes. This poor son ... Please, NBC, do not make films about any other eras ... leave it with PBS and the History Channel
