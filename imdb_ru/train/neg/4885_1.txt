I had to listen. I was warned, and yet I paid the money for it, after reading all the reviews, learning that the original is “so bad it is good,” and that part 2 does not fit into this category at all, however, even then I could not resist . What exactly happened here? The first part was “Merry”, there was so much political correctness in it, and other “Crazy”, “Fatty Entertainment”, and this one simply could not be the worst continuation of God's green land, nor “Case with basket 2” even the "Troll 2". This is indeed the worst sequel in history, and it really speaks of something, given the innovative qualities of the bottom of the original trunk. Criminally Insane Part 2 was just a completely different bad brand. Filmed, zero points, zero entertainment, 1/3 consists of memories of the original, and on top of that, the crazy, fat Ethel lost some of her girth. I mean, honestly, is this some kind of sick joke?!? Thank you very much, Nick Billion. 1/1
