Ram Gopal Verma has established himself as a very innovative and competent director. He did a remake / reworking of the Godfather with Sarkar, and succeeded. The same goes for Lolita, which he shot as Nishabd. <br /> <br /> Scholai is a film that he says inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake. <br /> <br /> The game ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan dignified as the villain Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were terrible and forgotten. Song Mehbooba Mehbooba came out as a second-rate music video. <br /> <br /> The worst part is the pace and the dialogues that could be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie in the theater I found myself waiting for a break, and then ending. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the film. Ultimately, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Verma.
