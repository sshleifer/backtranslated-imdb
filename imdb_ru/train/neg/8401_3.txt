Having just seen this on TMC, it is fresh in my memory. Obviously, while puppets are stars, they do not actually control the show. First, they are divided into 2 groups - Mo, as “Shorty”, and Larry and Curly, as a couple of vagrants, so there is not much teamwork. The love story that feeds the plot is uninteresting, two ladies are the only ones who have acting skills, there is another group of musical puppets who are not funny, unless you consider their attempts to be funny too sad. The music is tiring, they drive cars on the ranch, and then they depend on the horses, the silly western clothes are stupid, and there are a lot of films in the film without puppets. Incidentally, this is obvious after Curley’s first strike, and his reduced energy level is obvious. Vernon Dent appears early in the role of uncredited. I liked everything that these guys have ever done, including everything that was not in Curly, but this little dog is pretty disgusting.
