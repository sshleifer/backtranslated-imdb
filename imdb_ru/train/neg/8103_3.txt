This is arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't care what the critics say, this is bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. The point is not that it is invulnerable; just like 99% of his work, it's pretentious and overdone. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters look like a navel, and his novels are generally misogynistic. I read many of his works (even his poetry of the socialist realists. It was really awful) - I just don’t understand what I’m talking about. Characteristics (eg, self-absorption) in his novels are infuriating when reading. In the film, all the things I dislike about Kundera have been increased. Maybe I just missed something, but I don’t think so. On the other hand, I cannot believe that this is a DVD from the Criterion Collection. In no case is this film important.
