*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this film - the working role of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the game is terrible (this does not help the brutal script). The worst culprit is the villain Buntao, head of the Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I laughed at my head when he expressed his “rage” because he lost a lot of money; terrible performance Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line “this is a hostile takeover” (this is the remainder of the title of this film) was voiced as badly as possible. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress has distinguished herself in this film. Next we come to the plot. This should tell you all you need to know: in the original Fury and Honor, Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the center of the city. Now she is C.I.A. agent (or was it some other government agency - sorry, but this film was so bad that I don’t even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine that this is C.I.A. The application process was similar. Interviewer: What past experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Good; you are hired! I give him only 2 because of a decent game and a good plot twist at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, will be caught).
