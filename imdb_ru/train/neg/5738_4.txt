“Darkness” was somewhat interesting, but it seems that it never had a plot, and there is more such a film than other films accused of this damage; that is, "bad taste." It started really well, with a person running from something. It was very creepy in those first few minutes, but after a while the film simply became entertaining at the level of blood, which was difficult to make out at some points due to poor lighting and terrible recording quality anyway. The film was hard to believe because of the youthful role, which in most cases looked like friends talking to a video camera, lining up on the move. Due to the absence of any plot, it looked as if the film had been started without any script and ended without it. As already mentioned, the blood was the only point in the film that was difficult to make out.
