My friend bought it (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought I would never watch it, because I knew it was a joke, and the DVD cover looked pathetic, but then my friends and I missed out on it and watched it. from the beginning to the end! I know a great achievement, but it is truly a masterpiece. it's hard to describe. You have to see it, this is a real lesson about what people are capable of, when they consider that they are creative, smart, but in fact - not. “Acting” is a place (sometimes you can see how the “leading lady” laughs, she is definitely the worst). “Story” is stupid if you sum it up, and in fact everything in this film sucks. please pay special attention to the "sheriff". the guy is an adult, and therefore he has absolutely no reason to participate in this. he is also very bad. Whatever it was, he had fun moments. check it out haha
