In 1987, John Hughes wrote and filmed Planes, Trains, and Cars, which was a fun and sharp comedy. the best he ever did. Ten years later, he resumed the reworking of the story “Home Alone” in the second sequel, which is not related to other films, but equally dull and sadistic. Four rogues is true, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for making this revolutionary change to the series! ?? killed by electric shock with metal chairs, brains with a barbell and blinded by paint, ha ha ha ha ha ha aaaaaa, and the new child is even less charming than Culkin. You might think that leaving almost all the key players from the first two films will not allow Hughes to become petrified by the same old procedures, but the only surprise is that even he did not appear on Home Alone 4.
