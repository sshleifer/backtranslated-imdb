LOL! A good way to start. I thought it was original, but then I discovered that it was a clone of the 1976 KING KONG remake. I have never seen KING KONG until I was 15 years old. I saw this movie when I was 9 years old. Cool disco music of the movie will get stuck in your head! Not to mention the subject of the film, which was performed by the Yeti. These are the worst effects creatures I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains the holy grail of B-films. Memorable quotes: "Take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank, and you will have the power of the Yeti." I remember seeing this movie on MOVIE MACRABE, which Elvira shot. There is one scene where it was like KING KONG the other way around! In KING-KONG, he grabs a girl and climbs through the building, but in this film he goes down the building and grabs a girl (who was falling)! Also in the same year, another clone MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) appeared from Hong Kong. There are many traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts. This movie will leave you laughing. As I said, just another clone of KING KONG. PG rating for violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
