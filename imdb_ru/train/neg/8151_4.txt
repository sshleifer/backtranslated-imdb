Leslie Sands' walking piece "Deadlock" becomes the unfortunate choice for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, immediately after their joint success in "All About Eve". After killing her husband, her husbandâ€™s best friend visits an intriguer who pretends to be her husband when others start to go to the house. Irving Rapper, one of the best directors Bette from her peak years, unfortunately cannot raise this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously removed and kept to an outrageous finale (where, fortunately, she pulls out all the stops). Production and auxiliary cast are strictly second-rate; only for Bette Davis. * 1/2 of ****
