After watching the first ten episodes, I have to say that this show sucks. <br /> <br /> What worries me most is that the show was filmed in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they had to shoot it in California so that we could see the scenes in the desert. That would be more true for the movie. The first scene where they are in another world is in the mountains, where there are a lot of pines, where it is cold. This is not a very Egyptian feeling. What worked well in the film is that you felt in ancient Egypt. Here it seems that they run, fighting with aliens in a Canadian forest. And it is so lame that on other planets, apparently, comes and fall. You can see leaves on the ground in forests that look like forest supports outside of Vancouver. This makes the show even more incredible and stupid. <br /> <br /> And then Richard Dean Anderson. He is not Kurt Russell. Of course, he does a decent job, and he tries to copy a little of Russell’s presentation, but he’s not as cool as Russell. And not such a good actor like Russell. And Russell had a way to play Oh Neil, well, he was much more cynical. Andersons, O Neil, too soft. I liked the fact that the Russian version simply didn’t let go and blew up the bomb without any problems until the very end of the film. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks copes well with the role of Jackson, although he gives way to James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'k is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! Former bodyguard of the pathetic character of Ra, seen only in the pilot and in another episode. Tealc speaks and speaks like a robot. I have seen the best game from Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Tilk, the character of Ra and the people they saved in the film can suddenly speak English, is also incredibly stupid. In the movie, the aliens were so frightening that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But very rare effects in a real show are poorly made and look cheap. Especially the planet they visit with crystals. It is so obvious that they are walking on the sound stage with a poorly made picture in the background. For us, the audience, this is an insult that they made it so cheap. Especially when they could do it in front of a blue screen with a background cgi. <br /> <br /> The X-Files gave the best effect when they released their first episodes in 1993. This was 4 years before the start of SG-1. And they didn’t have an obvious budget of two million dollars for the episode that SG-1 allegedly had. They must have spent all the money on food. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> An incredibly boring and pointless show that could be great if it shot a Hollywood show with a big budget, the best writers and the best characters.
