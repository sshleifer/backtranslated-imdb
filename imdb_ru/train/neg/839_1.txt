The only redemptive part of this film was the price I paid. At least, all I lost is $ 3, and the time spent behind this bomb. The crew member who was responsible for the continuity missed the boat. When the woman leader and the FBI guy went to the place of the alleged killer, Mr. FBI handed the woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver magically turned into a machine gun. It remains to be considered whether the FWP agent will give the weapon to a civilian? I think no. Miss Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It is a pity that the rating of "P" did not allow to see its most. It would seem that the film editor cut out what could be the best parts of the film.
