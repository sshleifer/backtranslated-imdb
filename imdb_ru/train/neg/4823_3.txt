The lame plot and two-dimensional script made the characters look like cardboard cutouts. Needless to say, this hampered a feeling of sympathy for any of the characters, especially the groom; He looked and behaved more like a cartoon. In general, I think you could say that it was on a par with your typical television drama. He uses almost all the cliches in the book. Exhausted classical musician who wants to play salsa. The freedom-loving bride is engaged to “the confrontation of the beans”, which she does not love. I will not list them, otherwise it will be a spoiler, because I will distribute the whole story. The dances were fine, but nothing special. I have seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The group was really tight. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see them in the theater. I'm still a bit shocked by how many good reviews have graced this film.
