I saw about a thousand horror films. (my favorite type) This movie is one of the worst. For me, the idea is driven by a movie. Thus, even a poorly played, cheap movie can be a good one. Something weird is definitely cheaply done. However, this can say little. I still do not understand how the karate scene at the beginning is related to the film. Something strange has little to offer. Save yourself from the pain!
