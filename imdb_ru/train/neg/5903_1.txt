I live in Salt Lake City and not a Mormon, so why did I shoot this film? Well, because I live in Utah and thought it would be nice to see the places I know in the movie. I really knew, going into it, that I was not going to get inside jokes, so I was not surprised when I was sitting with a deer in the headlights. What surprised me was the actions of non-Mormons ants that were included in this film. <br /> <br /> I know that this is a Mormon film intended for members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people who do not belong to their faith. Every non-Mormon who was little, drank, smoked and had an amazing attitude to egoism, why? <br /> <br /> It really annoyed me in this movie, they made the Mormons so clean, but the rest I believe that the state of Utah is full of punk psychos just because they don’t follow the LDS Church Scriptures. <br /> <br /> I understand that the plots revolve around all SPD members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not even close is true. And, as I said, not the Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunk assholes, please! <br /> <br /> I think I just don’t understand, because I don’t belong to their faith, and I suppose they never will.
