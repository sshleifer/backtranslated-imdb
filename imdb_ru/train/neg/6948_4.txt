An interesting idea (four African-American women, crushed under the boots of society, revenge by robbing banks), is destroyed by F. Gray Grayâ€™s terribly slow direction and agonizing scenario (Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier), full of unintentionally funny moments. Instead of giving a harsh commentary on the role of urban women fighting to stay afloat in a world where men violently abuse them and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to beat their unsuspecting audience with high notions of opera tragedy. This is melodrama at worst. Gray makes his actors linger on every tired line, and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to catch the slack, preferring instead to keep his camera trained on the embarrassed faces of the performers. And they are stunned: although actors like Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise, and Vivika A. Fox, have extraordinary talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth, and as an actress she is a great rapper), they need a more reliable hand than Gray to lead them and as a result they seem shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Stay away.
