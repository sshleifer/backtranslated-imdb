- The film crew shoots a horror film in an old, supposedly damned house, where seven people mysteriously died over the years. One team member finds an old spell book, and it looks like it is ideal for use in some of the ritual scenes in their film. This is because the spells in the book are written better than the script they use. But when the book is read, the outer graveyard suddenly comes to life. Now the actors and the film crew are in real danger. <br /> <br /> - IMDb indicates running time of 90 minutes. The first 60 minutes, nothing happens. Too much time is spent on the film inside the film. Should we be scared by the horror movie they are filming? We already know that their film is not "real." These fears just don't work. <br /> <br /> - In the “House of Seven Corpses” there are few things to enjoy. The game is terrible. Most of these “actors” would have had difficulty playing the game in primary school. The account is terrible. It is very similar to the television series of the 70s and does not create an atmosphere. Speaking about the atmosphere, except for a few minutes at the end of the film, nothing to talk about. The logic of the characters is almost absent. Even in the film, you expect the characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I do not think that I remember one scene where the character did not choose the most illogical way available. And finally, there are those first 60 minutes of the film, which I have already mentioned. Can you say bored? <br /> <br /> - I didn’t rate “The House of Seven Corpses” below, because the film (perhaps by chance) really works. My two favorites are the beginning and the end. The introductory part of the title represents the death of seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the film. And the final scenes on the massive staircase, as the zombies threaten the film crew, are somewhat effective (what a ringing approval). In general, these moments are not enough to make this film a good one.
