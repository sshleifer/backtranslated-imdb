We rented five movies on New Year's Eve and first watched this one. All I can say is that there was nowhere to go except after seeing it. It was pointless and gone. Harvey Keitel's script should be easy to write - just make two out of every three words a curse word. Andy McDowell is amazingly good at character, but the film has nothing more to recommend.
