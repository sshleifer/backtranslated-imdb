Possible spoilers possible. I must say that “Cinderella II: Dreams Come True” is one of the worst films ever made. First, the film was shot during the peak of the Disney sequel. It was created at about the same time as The Little Mermaid II, The Jungle Book II, and Peter Pan II, and they all did a disservice to their original cinema classics. (Disney also shot Notre Dame II and Atlantis II, but I’m going to drop this topic because their original films have never been a true classic.) Let me say that I’m an avid supporter of good Disney movies, and I absolutely adore Disney's original Cinderella. However, the continuation of "Cinderella" was a waste of time. Cinderella's character in the continuation was so unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very unusual moments with an expression of the current era, like: “I am going to make this banquet in my own way!” Let me also say you, this new Cinderella (as I affectionately called her), says: “Ewww hell? Why? They did everything to be like Lady Tremaine and Drisella are just awful family members for poor little Anasta. My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original Cinderella while creating this sequel? Well, this is definitely not the case. If I remember correctly, Anastasia also insulted Cinderella, as Drizell and Lady Tremaine. I am for redemption and forgiveness, but in this film there was no point in redeeming Anastasia. In the first of them, Anastasia was angry. In the second she is good. No one can leave such a story. I hope that Disney understands that this film, in addition to other films, disgraces the name of Walt Disney. Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone, events will begin to take shape around the Mouse House.
