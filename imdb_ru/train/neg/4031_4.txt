In fact, this is a terrible deception of the film. His 70-minute work time is very well supplemented with video materials. The rest are indescribable exteriors and gray interior scenes. The exposition of the plot is very poorly framed. All of them - just sloppy scenes, as if strung together. In the scene selection, no drama attempts are made, and the drama is transmitted by the intensity of the actors. Please do not ask. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns a rocket, radiating a million degrees of heat around the Earth five miles up, threatening to destroy the Earth. This is a real-time threat that needs to be distracted if you can make a special hydrogen bomb and place it in an experimental rocket for an hour. There is nothing special here, apart from reporting the scientist's crazy speech against the project, because there could have been some kind of life on board and thinking about scientific possibilities, but this speech, made mandatory by the idiot liberal, was rather passive by that time. /> <br /> That which saves this film is somewhat unique - these are frames. I have never seen a large selection of jet fighters of the fifties in any other film. This is not a complete list, but only some of the aircraft that I was able to see. There is a brief interception by the pilot, flying in turn, the F-89 Scorpion and the F-86. The first to intercept interceptors are the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and the F-86 Saber Jets (or Canada-built CF-13) and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> Then for some reason B-52, B-47 and even B36, as you can see, take off. Additional Information. <br /> <br /> “These Canadian aircraft travel at 1,200 miles per hour.” I do not think so, since one of them seems to have been the Gloster Meteor during the Second World War, the rest of the F-80. Meteors click on the attack, and one turns into the late F-84F with the flight of the early straight wings of the F-84, attacking in the ranks. <br /> <br /> There is a strange tandem version of the F-80 cabin, which doesn’t seem to be a training type T-33, but some temporary version of an all-weather interceptor with a radar in the nose. They climb in a blizzard. <br /> <br /> The aircraft carrier with a corner deck is visible from about 500 meters. He launches F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors. The air force is fighting the F-86 and the F-84 and more F-89 than you have ever seen in your life, as well as the F-100 Super Sabers and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F-100s push their attack with a very large indentation. F-89 defuse their missiles in the pods of the wings on the slope. The F-86 shoots, the F-102 releases the Falcon, even some F-80s (F-94?) With missiles in the middle wing. There is a very strange snapshot of a later F-84 model (prototype?) With an early F-85 model with a straight wing over it in turn, the producer’s advertising film (Republic Aviation) is obviously showing the differences between the old and the new and improved F-84 ThunderJet. About how he got here, you can guess. <br /> <br /> There are other great videos about Ottawa in the old days, when the capital of Canada was widely covered, and especially the great New York Times footage. The square during one of the civil defense exercises in the early 50s. <br /> <br /> I think that we also have to deal with the fact that it was filmed in Canada, except for the possible automatic pursuit, which is seen at the end of the picture, when the Pacific Ocean appears in the background. Using Jowett Jupiter is staggering, and there is a good TR 3, which can also be seen. Canada must have been cheap, and it was used fairly freely in the background. <br /> <br /> With regard to the real story of the film, there is little to recommend, other than the mystery of who Ellen Parker is. shows a finger at the end of the picture And she is definitely cheating on someone. Maybe R, like in Robert Loggia? A director who dies before the release of this film? Her career, how was her last loan? <br /> <br /> This is like a newspaper, in which a wrapped gift, was more valuable than a gift.
