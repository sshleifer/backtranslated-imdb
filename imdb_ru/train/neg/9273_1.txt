The first question that arises after watching this garbage is: who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the name of Omen in this film? Shamolic, embarrassing, pathetic attempt to continue the Omen franchise. When the movie starts, the music sounds like it was shot straight from the cartoon "Bugs Bunny", and since then the movie gets worse! I don't know who wrote the script, but I bet they got E — for this, when they took him back to show my teacher! After some time, it is difficult to say whether it is a comedy, because what happens is so funny and does not correspond to the truth of “Omen”, which requires faith. The game is ridiculous, especially from leading lady Fay Grant. Does she keep pulling stupid faces or is it hard not to laugh? It is hard to say. Worst sequel I've ever had misfortune to witness. 1 out of 10
