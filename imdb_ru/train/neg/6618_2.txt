GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS: - Finally, the long-awaited AAG hits the screens. Unfortunately, this could not set the progressive audience on fire. The first thing that is better to talk about the film is the idea to remake the mighty SHOLAY. And Varma made a good choice by changing the general background of the film. If he repeated the same von Ramadh, people would say again that this is nothing new. The different background is grateful, but the way he presented it is not worthy. From the very beginning of his SIVA Telugu career, he used the same lighting and background. I seriously do not know if this guy Varma is thinking about lighting or not, or maybe he doesnâ€™t have any other lighting technology except Gordon Willis DIVINE. It's all dutch dutch dutch. Why do some bodies use so many Dutch corners and extreme close-up shots !!!!!!! Splitting shots is lame. The characters could not carry emotions, the performances were not up to standard, the storytelling was even worse, the story is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz reoriented to his work. VARMA created great villains such as Bikumatr, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he failed to cut out the best Hindi Cinema heroes. There is no comparison of Gabbar with Babban. Babban - rather crazy, than a villain, but he has a couch for his brother (this is a gift in this film). Amitabhz performance is not in his favor. His very appearance is pathetic. The scar on the nose symbolizes forgotten villains from a black and white movie. The fact that they have ever worked on Babban is not successful. Babban can not be compared with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first best thing about this character is not to disturb the audience because of his hands. If Varma did it, it would be like teaching an ABCD to get a bachelor's degree. It is good that he revealed the secret early. But the memory is pitiful. Varma could not use such a great actor as Mohanlal for his purpose. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with improvement. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and is used in accordance with the story. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body bothers or at least does not consider this character. The complete failure of the film begins when the director cannot work for the close friendship between our heroes. These characters do not carry anything in this film. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is deteriorating, deteriorating. AAG can be fully viewed as a C. Sholay film - a fire of revenge, a city problem, meaning for Dharmendra true friendship and appreciation of trouble and fun. AAG never carried emotions with his characters. The narrative is too weak for viewers to feel sympathy for the characters. Do not compare AAG with sholay, but you will not like it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie. You will be burned alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
