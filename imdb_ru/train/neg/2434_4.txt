A realistic film, of course, except for the fact that the characters don't look scared. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not look like that. That's why I do not like his performance in this film. Tom Berenguer again plays soldier. No good thrill, realistic consistency. Not always shooting, this is one great thing. Well shot. I hate the sequence of helicopters, because only one terrorist kills almost the whole sea heap ... I give it ** and a half out of *****
