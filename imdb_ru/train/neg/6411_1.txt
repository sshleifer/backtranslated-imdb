“Return” is one of those films for that niche group of people who like films that annoy and embarrass them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame mistress who does not kill vampires and does not undress throughout the film. I was ready to put up with it, but I didn’t want to put up with the worst montage ever combined with meaningless memories. In the end, it turns out that she bumps into her car when she was small. Or maybe I'm wrong, and it was just a memory. With this film it is impossible to say. Can you believe that the same dude who created The Army of Darkness produced this shit? A much better idea is to stay home and watch the Army of Darkness on Sci Fi. In this film there was everything: sluts, zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for the hand. The Forgotten did not even have any of these things.
