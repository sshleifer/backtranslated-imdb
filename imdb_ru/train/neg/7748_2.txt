This film was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel, so I watch all the original films that play on it. I really do not know if this film can be called original. Creating a zoo / theme park on a remote island sounds quite familiar. What was it, oh yeah, the Jurassic Park. But instead there are saber-toothed tigers here. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that several stereotypical college students spend on the island some treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying a rather awful death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood was very similar to ketchup. Also in the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber-toothed tigers as possible so that people can enjoy them. Three of them have already escaped and are going to eat tourists or people invited to the island to see the tigers firsthand. Again sounds like a Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was a 1000 pound saber tooth, which crawled on its front legs, killing a mad scientist with a kind of dental statue, which is somehow compressed and passes through the guy's neck. The funniest death I've ever seen on TV. <br /> <br /> The acting is very dumb, the special effects are terrible. CG tigers could almost pass for clay models, and even some sounds were cut off. For example, when one of the college students tries to escape, he uses an ax to break the door, the ax enters the door, and after about 2 seconds you hear a sound. This film was pretty bad. However, cheese deaths were pretty funny.
