They changed the name of this atrocity to Unexpected Love. Worse only the movie itself. The script contains dialogues that will laugh because of the performance of the third class. At some point, when the wife leaves her husband, the soundtrack sounds bad cover All by Myself! No kidding. Actors are trying, but failing from an inept, incredibly awful script. The direction is amazingly bad. No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How to make such things? I turn off the TV before it ends!
