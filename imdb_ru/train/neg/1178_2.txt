Absolutely ridiculous film "Period" is only a subtle excuse for his extensive graphic depiction of the heroine's novel with a "monster", a monster that supposedly appears every century to rape some women. This is largely what he does, and the image of the beast in the film is really terrible; This is basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC pipe for a sprue that splashes with plenty of white liquid. For lovers of fake pet porn, I think maybe this is a real inclusion. However, I was amused by the first shots of horses having sex in a public square.
