This is the second time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These comments come from someone who thinks Kane and Amberson are amazing, decent films. But the rest of Wells's career, unfortunately, was wasted on material unworthy of his talent and too fragile to withstand his cinematic embroidery. And when he does a cauldron like Shanghai, the absence of anything substantial to hang his cinematic stunts is just sad. I could not tell you that he studied here. It's all as well-educated as the idiot Irish ford Well; which requires a lot of effort, but adds an absolute zero to the film. Several Wells projects have become so developed and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (choose a version, any version) - a project similar to the same. Material is irrelevant. It simply cannot bear the weight of all these noodles. For a director who trades in reality-based drama (like here), he never feels any craving to link his heap of vanity with reality; or in a coherent story. The murder scheme for hire is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos Wells, however, for having Hayworth cut her hair and got this presentation from her. The camera loves her. She is the coolest, most upscale, sultry and delightful femme fatale ever filmed. But her betrayal appears in the film so late that it seems like some sort of desperate decision, made in such a way that the film has a genre into which it fits. Cinema cannot be saved by the noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done in L.F.S., convolutions for what? to convince you that you saw something thoughtful? give Wells more to do? make you roll your eyes? Wells is not sensitive to the scale of the story, nor to the story of the story directly. Interestingly, Shanghai will say to someone who is not a billionaire handicapped person who organizes a murder scheme for hire four times or a fan who is in love with cinema vanity devoid of meaning or content. <br /> <br /> Overworked, ridiculous, imperturbable.
