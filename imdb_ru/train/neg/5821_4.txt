As others have noted, it should have been an excellent Hummer film, and it seems to me that this is how most of the actors were instructed to play it ... but the script is so leaden, with a bad tempo and filled with many boring monologues (poor Timothy Dalton is burdened with most of them) that he is too bloated and overconfident. This is an uncharacteristically weak performance by Dalton, although he quietly resorts to the climax scene, where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he has done. The only actor who really does well is Patrick Stewart, who is the most desirable spectacle. Freddie Francis may have been a great cinematographer, but he was a lousy director.
