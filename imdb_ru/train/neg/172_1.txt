Returning to the Lake Cabin is by no means original. With the protagonist alone (Stanley) returning to continue, the film is not even worth 2 hours of your time. I’m a big fan of the first movie, the storyline and acting was really good, but this is one movie I’ll never watch again. In fact, this is the same as the precursors to Urban Legends and Blair Witch, but with a much worse game. I personally saw how best to play soap operas, it's so pitiful that you just need to laugh. I by no means recommend this movie to anyone, watching it will simply distract from the first one.
