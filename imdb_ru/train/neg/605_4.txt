I will be brief, because such a film does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> Given the situation, this film could be something really special. It could be another “28 days later” or even “Project Blair Whitch”. <br /> <br /> I was really excited about the first 20 or so minutes of the film, the director did a decent job with cinematography and uncertainty, although I don’t think that he managed to capture the real eeriness of the empty London Underground. <br /> <br /> The characters were very disappointed. Our “heroine” in this film is a useless piece of shit, and you really don't care if she dies or not. As many people have said, I was rooting for the homeless and for the black guy who managed to make me laugh or two (be it intentional from the writers or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain, the first half of the film is kept in ignorance, but when he was revealed, I was very disappointed. I will not spoil it, but let me just say that my 10-year-old sister could beat him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> In general, this is just another mediocre horror film that falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula. This film had a lot of potential, but it really couldn't hit the mark. <br /> <br /> To emphasize how this film sucked, the characters in this movie had to at least FIVE TIMES to commit suicide and kill the main villain. , TOGETHER THEY WILL BE AHEAD.
