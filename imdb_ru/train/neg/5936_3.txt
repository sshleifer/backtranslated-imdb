This film was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with the performances of the "next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with Bono and Edge, as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who towers above all others in the film with his commanding but gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as a saint Leonard or as an Old Testament prophet. Many of the submissions are forgetful exaggerations (especially of Rufus and Martha Wainwright) or weak failures. Only Beth Orton and Anthony were within reach of their own versions of Leonard, using a little restraint. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are scattered throughout the film - like unfocused overlapping red spheres on many shots of concerts and interviews, shaky blurry camera, using digital delay in some comments by Leonard Cohen (which makes it difficult to hear what is said) and creepy, pretentious low drone in many segments of the interview (an attempt to add seriousness?). To see the present, see the documentary "Songs from Life", filmed by the BBC in 1988.
