Continuing the movie “Walking High,” of 1973, the real drama continues around Sheriff Tennessee Buford Pusser, but this episode sounds like a flimsy television film. Bo Svenson assumes the lead role from Joe Don Baker, but he is too soft for this role; he comes off as a country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors such as Richard Jackel, Luke Askew and Robert DoCuey can do little in the end. I would give the film one star strictly about his good intentions, but the script is a transparent and lazy mass of routine difficulties, and the production is cheap. In 1977, “The Final Chapter Walk” was released, and in 1978, the television film “The Real American Hero.”
