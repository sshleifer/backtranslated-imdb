This film is viewed by some as a classic - I have no idea why. It's terrible to the point of being ridiculous. The only salutary grace in this film is trashy strings that are so confusing that you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> This is a pair of good songs and a good choreography of the film, but SO THAT! There is no plot, it is installed in the theater without a change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressed as ever. My brother once made me watch this movie because he said that I would not believe how bad a movie could be! He was right. <br /> <br /> Usually with such a terrible film I would recommend that people not watch it, but in this case I think that people should do it, as it will put any other bad movie that you have seen in perspective .
