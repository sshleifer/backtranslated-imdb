I remembered this show when I was a kid. I couldn't remember too much about it, just a few minor things about the characters. for some reason I remembered that it was really intense. it was also really very early in the morning in PA. Finally I, while looking around the web, found the episode. first episode no less. Criminey! This show was so terrible. Obviously, this was done in order to show the children playing a laser tag and having a great time. The show begins with what Bhodi Lee says to his mother: “My names are not Christopher, I’m Bhodi Lee - PHOTON-WARRIOR !!!!!” then we have to watch the children playing the laser tag for the song “Foot Free”. and not just a bit, but the whole song. Ahhhhhhhh, my brain hurts just thinking about it. oh yeah, and as if i couldn't get worse, you can't even see the laser beams from their pistols. Looks like they are just running around the whole song "Foot Free". later, after Bhodie goes into space or anywhere else, they have a crappy laser-gun battle for Phil Collins' su-su-sudio song. ah, trust me, you don't want to know the rest. what can i say ...... LIGHTLIGHT !!!!!!!!!!!
