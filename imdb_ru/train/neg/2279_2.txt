God, what a mess it was. But it lasts only an hour, and I paid only a dollar for it, so I will survive ... unlike the entire composition of this gangster of 1933, which is already covered in dust. <br /> <br /> One way or another, bodies begin to appear in a small village that has been drained from all their blood. Local collars start talking about vampires, of course, and a little louder after each body is found. The city sheriff or constable, or whoever he is, is played by terrific actor Melvin Douglas, who tries to tell them otherwise. When he mentions the fact that the dead have one big hole on each side of the neck, instead of two close holes, the locals simply say that this is a giant vampire bat. The constable insists that there are no vampires, and it must be the culprit for the killings. <br /> <br /> But Melvin doesn't seem too worried anyway. He spends most of his time trying to get into the drawers of his candy, played by Fay Ray. Also in this mix is ​​the urban bluff, played by Dwight Fry, who, by the way, seemed to play the same role in every film he made. He further enrages the townspeople, catching bats and drinking his own blood. Lionel Atville plays the city doctor, who seems to be trying to help the constable solve crimes. And boy does he ever stink like an actor. In this role, he is as close to cardboard as he could have imagined. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this role ... many big names to be such a bunch of guano. <br /> Besides the terrible wrong name of this film, the alternative title “Bloodsucker” is much better, this film is also boring and stupid and just silly. <br /> <br /> For me, the high meaning of the film is that he watches Fry, he nails a strange strange city, but this film besides gives little. And then, when you find out the cause of the strange deaths and see the special effect that requires all this blood, you will be really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi took a lot of horrible pictures, but at least he was fun and interesting to watch. from this film, like the really bad fool Lugosi WITHOUT Lugosi, and you will feel how terribly bad this mess is. <br /> <br /> If you can't make a good horror film from the 1930s, at least put Lugosi on it.
