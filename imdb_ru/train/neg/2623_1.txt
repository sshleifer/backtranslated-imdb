Sly Stallone - perhaps the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother Frank ... well, now, get these awards! The hairy mullet, the goat Frank, seems to think that his every role calls for him to play the role of an American / Italian sage refugee from the Godfather. Please, someone will make him a valid offer "he can refuse!" This film just stinks, even a terrible replay of this, Frank still steals acting disgrace. All people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting out their lines and waving their arms, gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of style with silent films. <br /> <br /> The plot, that there is, does not make sense when a meteor lands and turns all women into insane sex nymphets, but since this is a film with 15 certificates, it simply means that they undress to the bottom underwear and make moans like dogs in the heat. What happens at the end, I'm not quite sure, because I lost the desire to live long before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague and watch Deep Strike for a sensible film about a meteor about to fall to the ground. <br /> <br /> NB Practice: when one of the women's bandages undresses to underwear, her panties / panties are under the waistband / suspenders belt, she puts on the suspenders so that women can go to the toilet with less effort. Perhaps the trivial moment, but shows how stupid this film is when they can't even get it right!
