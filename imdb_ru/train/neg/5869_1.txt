It's been almost 30 years, and I still hate everyone who participates in this film. It remains the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I had never thought of Rivera before, anyway. After watching this movie, I had an allergic reaction when I accidentally saw her on TV. <br /> <br /> I was drawn to this - contrary to common sense - the pressure from peers. However, after leaving the theater, these friends swore to never again cancel my choice of film. Almost thirty years later, we still bear the psychological scars from this film. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I wasted, hoping that this film could be better. It never happened. <br /> <br /> If you are ever given a choice, you would prefer not to watch this movie with your own eyes. <br /> <br /> I checked in for IMDb comments only in the hope that maybe I can warn others from watching this movie. If I can save only one person from viewing this, then my existence on this earth will be justified.
