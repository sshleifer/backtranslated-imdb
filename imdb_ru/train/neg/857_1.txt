Many King fans hate it because it has moved away from the book, but the film is another means, and the books have to change when they take the jump. Despite this, the film does fail completely, but it fails completely under the terms of the film. I would like to slap people who tell me that this is the worst movie ever made. I always ask myself: “Really ... what scene scared you?” Every fan I asked is silent. Sometimes someone, lost due to a decent fear (they are not ...), calls the jester "Grape juice, shooting from elevators." If you are afraid of this, I do not know what to say to you, except maybe you were easily frightened. I just rolled my eyes, watching how these awful ideas of z-rank unfold in this disgusting, incoherent film. <br /> <br /> One place that distracts from the book and is really tasteless is the boring work that the film does to get Mr. Halloran to the Overseer just to kill him; with the most stupid member of the audience who knows that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the hallway, that Halloran will FOREVER go down. Indeed one of the most stupid sequences ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a good choice for the work of Mr. Halloran, Stanley! The black light of an African-nymphomaniac really adds to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Was there ever a more “out of place”, inappropriate, shot in any film? <br /> <br /> I consider it a miracle that I was able to circumvent this piece in the end, and I agree that Kubricks 2001 This is a really important film, given the huge “bad will” generated by this stupid, stupid film and cult unfriendly, but indistinct fans of Kubrick, who could not describe the idea at work with each resource of the film to the Library of Congress in front of them. <br /> <br /> Throw in the grotesque reassessment of Jack Nicholson, the presentation of stupid one-lines at tense moments and in the nomination for Razzy for the role of Shelley Duval, and you get a very crappy film.
