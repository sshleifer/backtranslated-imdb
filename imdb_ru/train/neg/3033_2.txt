I'm a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is terrible. At that time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong, and he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could from her, making this big budget porn movie. Now I know why they don't make big budget porn movies anymore. In the fantasy world, a porn star can act, but this is the real world, and they cannot act. That's why there are porn stars, if a woman is beautiful, how Jenna could act, she would try to go into regular films, not porn. Just because your beauty does not make you a movie star. A great example of this is the Traci Lords, when she was a teenager before the age of 20, she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth. She made her go to low-end mainstream movies and could not play. Where is she now? I gave her a rating of 2 instead of 1 just because Jenna is so cool, but there are better films than Dream Quest. Come on, Jenna, we don't want you to talk, just as we want to see you have sex. In addition, you, Jenna, would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you were in an anal film.
