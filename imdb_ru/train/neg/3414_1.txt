This is just awful, really awful trash. Yes, we have beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. But while this can work in the mechanism of porn ?? may even have been hit like a porn movie ?? it tries to disguise itself as a “movie” with real things, with real emotions and struggles. This is not true. This is a reason to strip some girls and have fun. I am sure that all these women (and men) in this particular film could have been streamlined decently in the 1970s movie industry. but not in the real movie business. <br /> <br /> Acting was beaten, so bad, I mean terribly. The letter was even worse. I can not blame these actors ?? they had nothing to work with. A very broad structure or plot of the film could be made and made well with good scriptwriters and competent actors. A very broad structure or plot is a psychotic person who spends time shooting people from afar like a sniper. These executions were motivated by men who did not respect their women. If there were more to write - it is better to write, it is much better to write - and less gratuitous sexual images, we could have something to work with <br /> <br /> This film should have been shot, made and sold hardcore porn film all together. ; it would make more money. This is practically a hardcore porn movie already, and it remains the only non-porn movie that I have seen that shows a male erect penis.
