Saw a trailer for this on another video and decided to rent when it comes out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is very boring, the acting game (except Christopher Walken) is bad, and I didn't give a damn about the characters, except that I really wanted Noraâ€™s husband to be beaten. The role of Christopher Walken is so rejecting, what a teasing!
