I was thrilled to see a comedy series that we hope will be representing Indian Candians, but I found this show not funny at all. Producers and actors are probably happy to receive both bad and good feedback, because, as far as they know, they are talking about it! I was ready for some stereotype and have no problems with it, because stereotypes exist for the reason they are usually true. But there was nothing funny about these stereotypical characters. Dad "fresh from the boat," who does not understand his daughter. A radical feminist Muslim daughter (which, by the way, is a terrible actress), and a young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can (he is a pretty good actor, I only see that he is recovering). /> <br /> this is very contrived, and the dialogue is not so good. The potential for something like this was so great, but unfortunately, I think that it failed, and I donâ€™t really want to watch another episode. <br /> <br /> However, I really enjoyed watching the great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy, she is a treat and naturalness in everything she does, too bad that her daughter in the series does not have the same acting skills!
