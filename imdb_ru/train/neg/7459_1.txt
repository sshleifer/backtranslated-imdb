please save your money and see something else this movie was such a piece of shit. I didnâ€™t want to go, but I had to, so I thought I laughed at least once, NOP. not a single laugh, it was so terrible! Chris Kattan will never get a good comedic role after that and "Roxbury nights". this film is completely obvious, it has no clever humor, it just repeats over and over again. listen to me and go as far as possible from this movie!
