Most likely, if I watched it again, I might be physically ill, the film is so annoying ... if you donâ€™t believe in psychics, reincarnation and other focus-focus, which it promotes on a large scale. "Repeated circulation of souls," they call it here. Pooh-liz. <br /> <br /> This story has already been made several times with films such as Heaven Can Wait. This has also been done much better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Sybil Shepherd, Ryan O'Neill and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least this is a rather tamed film in terms of language. This is the only redeeming quality of this film.
