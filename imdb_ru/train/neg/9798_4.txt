15 years ago, Power Rangers were one of the shows that captured nations, especially young people. When I was a three-year-old child living in the Philippines, I watched this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (channel 2 there). When the film was released in 1995, I was shocked and shocked when I watched it with my father and two uncles. My grandparents even sent me a “Balikbayan” box full of “Power Rangers” items (including an easy-to-assemble Megazord figure and Ranger stuffed toys). I even played video games and loved only one of them (“MMPR: Fighting Edition”), which was really sad. In any case, it was a show that served as the starting point for my interest in a series of robots (especially anime furs, such as Gundam). Now that I am 18 years old, I would like to think that this show is pretty silly for me now. To prove this, I went on a memory trip, buying a 2-set DVD collection from MMPR: The Movie and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and watched them both. I was like, "Ugh. How terrible. Just another garbage in the attic for me." For all of you, people of my generation, this is NOT a show that you would like to watch again and again. I am not saying to leave it for the rest of my life, but sometimes it is not bad, is it? Instead of “Power Rangers”, I would recommend something like “Mobile Fighter G Gundam” (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED), “Ninja Senshi Tobikage” (aka ninja robots) or even ORIGINAL Sentai shows that formed the basis of “Power Rangers”.
