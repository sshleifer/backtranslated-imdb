Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are some of the actors that I’m always interested to see, despite the reviews. I always found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and attractive actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Klein is almost always worth watching. <br /> <br /> I say “almost” and “almost” largely because of this film. <br /> <br /> First of all, Meg Ryan doesn’t play a cute character, she plays a weak whiner who starts to annoy you shortly after the opening credits and doesn’t give up until a few days later. However, Kevin Klein's character is even more annoying and less likable. So even if you usually like these two actors, I recommend that you give this film a pass.
