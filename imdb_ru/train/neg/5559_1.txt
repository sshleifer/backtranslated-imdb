This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The Avengers kept this dubious honor ?? but no more. The acting game in Jill the Ripper is terrible and only eclipsed the plot. This film is also intellectually stimulating, like the teletubies. He doesnâ€™t know if this is a S & M movie or a really bad thriller. Look only in a state of severe intoxication or if you are lying in bed and you need to escape from the skin. This script should be reworked into porn, it will not take a lot of effort and will have a long shelf life. Porn, even bad porn, will not hurt Dolph Lundgren's career in the way that this film has.
