Joe Don Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there ... he was fine in the Golden Eye and made a pretty good Bond Villan in Living Daylights and starred in other films. One thing he cannot do is carry the movie as a leader, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie in Malta. Partner Joe Don is killed, so he kills the murdererâ€™s brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys force the plane to land in Malta and the killer escapes. In the rest of the film, Joe Don is chasing the murderer here and there, Joe Don is detained several times, Joe Don is torturing the bartender, interrupted, and so on. The film is pretty bad, and you won't be exactly in the role of Joe Don's character. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don hero gets hit with one blow and how incompetent he will be. The crown of the film is that Joe Don pursues the murderer throughout Malta with the murderer in the clothes of the priest, and then they get into the boats and he pursues them throughout Malta. This film also features one of the worst closing lines to complete the film ever.
