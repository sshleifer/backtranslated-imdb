This film is so incredible; - all the room - bank; the fact that a serial killer (a vampire or other) could fly without a trace and kill as many people as the film suggests is ridiculous. The vampire himself would not have looked out of place in the film Bela Lugosi. Most of the acting is so wooden that the actors need to be treated for dry rot. I am waiting for the day when someone will make a decent film from Stephen King's novel (except, perhaps, “Stay with me”). This film suffers from what most Stephen King films do - the lack of money used for “special effects”, bad actors, terrifying performance and dialogue. This film is cheap, tasteless and fails in everything it tries to do.
