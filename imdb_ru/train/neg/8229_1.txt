- Contains miner spoilers - <br /> <br /> I have seen some decent indie horror films, such as Hamilton, Boys Love Mandy Lane, and Cab Fever; Unfortunately, I felt that Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category. From start to finish, the film is harassed by an amateur game that resonates with a very bad scenario, God only knows why the authors wrote dialogues like "No, don't go there, don't go there, she will receive" you: if she catches you, she will kill you, and if she kills you, you're dead ”is the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie has very little character development, and, to be honest, I didn’t care. less about how much pain and torture they have caused, as they are just a group of dirty college students, who barely show redemptive qualities. ” All they do is cry and cry throughout the entire film, and if the girls don't cry, argue; when they communicate, the topics are completely random: about dating with boys or how one of the girls-girls was cremated recently (relevant topics when a psychotic killer pursues you). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also awful to show banal techno music during the opening and ending credits (although hearing the sound of music, knowing that the end is approaching, seemed heavenly). <br /> <br /> Filming is terrifying and sometimes makes the film inaccessible for viewing. I assume that because of the small budget or lack of it, the director was limited to one digital camera, which is located in the girls ’car almost the entire film. I think it was an attempt to bring the audience as close as possible to the action: to feel and experience what girls are going through. But because of a very shaky camera, a grainy picture and too close to the action, it can be difficult to determine what happens during the fighting scenes, and this is simply chaotic. It's one thing to make a film subjective, and another is to have an action on the screen that viewers cannot decipher due to bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a budget indie film, but this does not justify extremely poor quality. There are no ransom factors in this film: bad game, bad scenarios, bad camera work and lack of history. In the light of all this, I decided to give the film 1 out of 10, as he very disappointed me; wishing the meteor fell to the ground, bringing me sweet relief. At 94 minutes from her, stupid college girls cry, argue, run aimlessly, and have occasional inappropriate conversations. However, how many times do you see girls defecate and throw shit into the windshield of the haunting car.
