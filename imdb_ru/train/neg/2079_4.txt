I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman - I loved Evolution, and who didn't like ghost hunters? From the trailer you already know that Umaâ€™s character will be dropped by Luke. So the build-up clearly goes to the moment when she brings down her superpowers. But there is simply no payback. Throwing a shark still managed to get a (slight) giggle, but again, it was all in the trailer. <br /> <br /> Nobody held his breath, just like Uma, and Luke is Owen's diet on his good days. If it wasn't for Rihann Wilson, you would be sitting with a constipated smile, while the cheeks begin to cramp. This is a comedy, isn't it? <br /> <br /> It's not terrible - he just sits there like a stale burglar behind the fridge. It could have been such a brilliant show of superheroes and feminism films, but not in both cases. See if Jason Reitman can save his last name.
