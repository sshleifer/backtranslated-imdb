In the films of Houston, there are often couples that do not mix well with each other (in the general sense of the term): “African queen”, “Heaven knows Mr. Ellison”, “The roots of heaven”, “Inconsistencies” ... “Barbarian and geisha” ( check the name), so to speak, another good example. It seems that the Japanese things were fashionable at the time, as evidenced by such works as "Sayonara", "the world of Susie Wong" and "the tea-house of the August moon." Houston's efforts may be the worst of this rather bad game (with the exception, perhaps, of Suzy). John Wayne fits perfectly into the world of Ford, in Houston he is like a bull in a china shop. His Japanese partner is absolutely soft. dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who are completely in love with every work of Houston should choose this among all their other great films.
