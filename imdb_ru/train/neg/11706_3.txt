Roman Remarque. A cast that looks great on paper. Left-wing refugee struggles to stay in Paris between the wars. Undercover Gestapo officer. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there is no synergy. Pieces and pieces never merge. <br /> <br /> Stories about left-wing refugees in France should not be so boring. Read the memoirs of Arthur Koestler, "Rabbit of the Earth" (if you can). Or his frightening "Dialogue with death" (the same). <br /> <br /> The only interest in this film for me is in some random details. <br /> <br /> Leading spend a lot of time drinking Calvados, Norman apple brandy. I welcome any encouragement to have a piece of calvados myself. It certainly made this film go faster. But, according to the film, it is sold only in cheap low-class salons. Vive le tabac parisien! This is what I said. References to intoxicating drinks abound here; It would seem that this is a concern for screenwriters. <br /> <br /> I like films made in France because it can be fun to wait for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to appear on the background of the wall. I was not disappointed. This time it was a very unusual choice for Birr. This film would have been rated at 10 points, if only we had judged it by refining its frescoes with drinks. <br /> <br /> The film’s indifferent rating is Louis Grünberg. Grunberg is known, if you can call it that, for his opera The Emperor Jones, based on O'Neill's play. The premiere took place at about the same time as in the version of the film with Paul Robson. Opera survives today in one or two recordings of Lawrence Tibbett. It should appear again soon, though; they end up potentially selling operas for rebirth. <br /> <br /> Opera seems to be a suitable subject for reference here, since the character of Charles Boyer acts under his “Czech” pseudonyms. Two of them - “Wozzeck” and “Gunther”, both famous roles in German opera. Is this just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> The removal of the name seems to be part of this movie. Please note that they call "Himmelstoss" by phone. Himmeltoss, it turns out, is one of the main characters in Remarque’s early novel, Everything Is Quiet on the Western Front. <br /> <br /> Well, all the jokes are in place; I think there was no time to develop drama.
