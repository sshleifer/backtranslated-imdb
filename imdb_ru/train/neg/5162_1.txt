This film very much reminded me of The History of Violence, which pretended to be a thorough study of violence and violent behavior, but eventually turned into a cheap action movie disguised as some kind of film about thinking. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and face endless persecution from local drunks, who only do that they hang in the pub all day and create problems. Do these people have no job? In any case, Dustin takes everything he can take, and by the end of the film he delays in his house and fights with each of the drunken attackers with such terrible means as boiling whiskey, poured on someone, legs are knocked off with a shotgun and head falls into a bear trap. It's funny that someone will need such a big bear trap in a small British town, except, perhaps, to put a human head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckepe, who made “Wild Bouquet”, which also covered the topic of bloodshed, violence, from which no one had spared. But it was done with style, and you believed it. Straw dogs are not believable. First of all, this is the wrong location and does not work. Why is this place in England? I would think, maybe, in some urban area or a small town in the American South in the 30s or something like that. Secondly, I do not understand why these people are so quickly subjected to violence, unless they got drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Pekingpah missed the mark. this.
