I waited a long time to see DUNGEON DR. TARRA, and after I looked at it, I was really disappointed with it. This is not a baroque movie that I expected. The trailer (which I saw on the Something Weird DVD) is much better than the entire movie, which we surprisingly forget. There are almost no outstanding scenes in it, and the appearance is interesting, but it doesn't even come close to other Baroque films from Fellini or Khodorovsky. The characters are boring, and almost nothing dramatic happens, even if we see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was that it was a conversation. - more than anything. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the film to have moments of silence, moods or something like that; instead, we chat endlessly and listen to the main characters chatter about boring things. <br /> <br /> Missed opportunity.
