Favorite part one, Impossible Planet, but, unfortunately, what a disappointment, the second part of "The Pit of Satan." The thickening of something, obviously, rising from the pit, - nothing came out of the pit. Then for ages they crawled around the vents to sketch a story, the Beast is a roaring thing, devoid of intelligence, so I did not expect any confrontation between the doctor and the villain. The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit, despite the fact that the pit was not open until the TARDIS fell through the crust of the planet. And finally, another ready-made solution that existed without a logical reason - I mean, why not plunge the Beast into the Pit as soon as the pit opens? Why not immerse him in all these years ago instead of imprisoning him? Why not - I could go on, but I lost interest ...
