My rating for this shit is: 1/10 1 for technicals only. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that does not make sense. Obviously, creating a good script for a movie or television is an almost impossible task. <br /> <br /> Although it is easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are one of the biggest liars on the planet, itâ€™s hard to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We must believe that people are mistaken for morons. Perhaps this was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are crap. Because they are stupid and funny and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When you look at the price we give the Oscars, we better understand why we continue to make films more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And oddly enough, it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education, but for health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this with ** t, press the fast forward button (at least 20 times).
