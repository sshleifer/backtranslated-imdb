I do not remember ever leaving the cinema. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. Uninteresting plot, characters from clay, violence without meaning. I didn't care when the good guys died; I didn't care when the bad guys got it. Fantasy and magic were laid thick like liver pudding, and there was no consistency. In short, great fun if you spend eternity in hell.
