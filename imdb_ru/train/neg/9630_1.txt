I understand that several Ben Stiller films will come out or come out this year, but maybe he should insist on quality, not quantity. <br /> <br /> I was stunned by what the filmmakers considered to be a comedy in the movie "On the Way to Polly". " <br /> <br /> Stillers Reuben loses its spirit, has no charm and is considered one of the worst performances of the year. Sneeze styler becomes tedious. He certainly has a comic talent, but he needs to either find another game, or take a break, find some fun stuff. Because his films are transformed from insanely painful to painfully bad. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, and this is a shame, because she is a good, smart actress with a promising career. As long as she continues to make more films, such as “The Good Girl” (in which she is amazing), and not as “Here is Polly,” she will have a career that she can be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston is desperately trying to overcome the sluggish material with which she works, but it is not an easy task for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin, as the boss of Ruben Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Ruben Sandy's best friend, this horrible film is not funny. Other characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria’s accent is not only stupid, but terribly unfunny. <br /> <br /> The premise of “And here is Polly,” certainly promised. Unfortunately, he needed a writer who could turn him into a good comedy instead of the lame, boring, boring excuse for a comedy.
