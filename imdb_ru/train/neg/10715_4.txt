What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and believable premise with a decent and talented actor, but somewhere the film loses. In fact, it never worked. There was a bit of excitement when we found out that Angie wasn’t really pregnant, and then we found out that she was, after all, but that was so. Steve Martin, a very talented man and usually brings a lot of things to the movies, was terrible, and his whole character wasn’t even close to the film, except to make it longer. I would really like to see more interaction between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and, perhaps, try not a pure comedy, which, unfortunately, it was not, but, perhaps, a drama with comedic elements. I think that if the film did it, it could be very funny, since both actresses are quite funny in their own way, and sitting here I can recall the numerous scenarios that would be a riot.
