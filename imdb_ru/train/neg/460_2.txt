I had to watch a movie for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I was paid), but I still found that the film sucks a lot more than average. The jokes were inconclusive, the two leading actresses ... well, if you take advantage of the separation of the female age "First Wives Club" in Hollywood, they are no longer at the age of hot chicks, but more at the age of the "district attorney". What really pissed me off in the film was the storyline, which pretty much completely plagiarized Beavis & Butthead Do America (in which all the boys were amazed that some dude offers them money to â€œmake his wife "Without realizing that you have to kill her). In general, a soft piece of shit.
