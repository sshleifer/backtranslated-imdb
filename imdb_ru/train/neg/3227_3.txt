This is a contribution to the infamous guinea pig series. A short Japanese television show that was canceled after a psychopath admitted that he was inspired by the murder of a young schoolgirl show. This short film, like all other films in the series, has almost no history. A group of guys captured a young woman. They bind her and continue to torture her to death by shooting her on video. They beat her, poured boiling oil on her, applied pliers to her, and finally, in a “loving” close-up, they pushed the needle into her eye. This is the easiest of all guinea pig films and one of the first. It is probably this film, more than any other, that gave Guinea Pig a rumor that he was sniffing. They certainly inspired Nicolas Cage’s 8 mm film. These films have become quite popular in horror circles. They turned to more polished, but equally graphic films, such as Bare Blood. They are likely to fill the void left by the films of Mondo, which were a little cleared and became reality shows. It is not recommended, but it will probably interest those who once see something, and wonder why then I know what I did.
