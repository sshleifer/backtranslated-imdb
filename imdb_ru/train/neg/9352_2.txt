It can often be said that the film was not as it should be with heavy use of the narrator. This film shows this device everywhere. Richard Jobson is not completely satisfied with what he writes directly, and even finances part of this film, replenishing his merits, reading excerpts from his semi-autobiographical composition, combined with some nice editing, can dull the boring, depressing story he must have mistaken for a real art house. Kevin McKidd shows good results. All the others are fine. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints meant that all the scenes are shot in daylight, although most are obviously intended to be at night, although if you know serious alcoholics, they mostly work during the day, so for me it adds a touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this film is the waitress who does not stand a single day for more than 20 years between her appearances â€” a more extreme version of the problem that McKidd has been facing. goes from 18 to 30 without dressing up more than his clothes.
