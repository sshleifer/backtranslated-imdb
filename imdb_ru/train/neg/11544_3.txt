I was really looking forward to it, because I love Danny Dyer and I think that Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Then he quickly moves to the main story, which is attacked by a group of strangers, and Dyer is beaten very badly, and Anderson is raped. Then they decide to go for revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it is not. The story gets boring and detached, and some things get really weird. I will not disclose the details, but it happens that I, for example, do not want to see. I like to give doubts all the films, and I really wanted this film to be liked. It just did not work. I give it 3 out of 10, mainly for acting.
