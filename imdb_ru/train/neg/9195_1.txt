Laid out and pumped up with drugs, when the kidney stone went through my merry way through my urinary tract scars, with absolutely nothing better than letting painkillers go berserk, I accidentally caught this movie by telegram. I would not want someone to think that I paid to watch it at the cinema, or rented it, or ?? Heaven protect! ?? that I watched it DIRECTLY. <br /> <br /> Having played this sensationally horrible video game and eagerly making my way through the doomed rooms and terrible aisles of the House, fighting the Chariot (Type 27), the Hanged Man (Type 041), and other impossible sentries, my curiosity was offended how the game goes to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Banal plot revolves around the group "crazy kids" ?? a la Scooby Doo ?? visiting a remote island for a terrific "rave" world ?? whatever it is. (Do you guys today with your hula hoops, miniskirts and Pat Boone ??) After you have bribed the boat captain thousands of cash to smuggle them in there (stupidity, which requires your own network of rhetoric), they find "rave "" Deserted. <br /> <br /> The passing mention is made of "house" ?? presumably the title house of the dead ?? but most of the action takes place on fake street shooting sites and in other places separated from any similarity of the house with haunted. <br /> <br /> A fallen video camera acts as a filler in reminders, showing the island in the throes of a party ?! Is it it? Oh, so this “crazy” thing is just a “party”? In the great tradition of paraphrasing “used cars” as “used” or “shock” as “ post-traumatic stress disorder ”, the word“ party ”is now too square for you with drugs, silicone implanted, metrosexual jagos? <br /> <br /> It became known that the party was overwhelmed by frantic zombies. Intellectual thoughts stop here. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that dumb girls who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the myths behind the re-animation of zombies. Zombies can not die ?? they are NOT DEAD. They do not bleed, they do not know pain. If their bodies are not completely destroyed, they will continue to come alive. At least that's what my priestess of the Jamaican witch tells me. <br /> <br /> This means that a .45 shot at their “hearts” will not stop them, just like a machete on the body. And a shotgun shot in the chest, of course, will not cause gout blood. At least in the logic of the video game, the shooter pumps so many monsters into each monster that he is completely destroyed, leaving a fetid mess that cannot reanimate himself. <br /> <br /> Yet each model of the actor-slash gets their moment of the Matrix-circular chamber, killing zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers from Return of the Jedi, which are unsettling when Evox confuses them. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the screenwriter of the film, Mark Altman, did not write too much. “Free enterprise,” was considered forced to insert a mention of Captain Kirk in the form of Jürgen Prochnow, who must have desperately needed dairy money to succumb to the appearance of this litter litter. There is also a mention of the main role of Prokhnov in the magnificent “Das Boot”, when one of the unprepared B-actors mentions that he “looks like a submarine captain”. "I wonder how many of the target audience of this film pigs with square eyes noticed ANY obscene links to other films, such as, for example, when Prokhnov declares:" Give my regards to my little friend, "anticipating the moment of your machine gun. Targeted on demographic, which do not have the means to understand the Sisyphean uselessness of the concept of a video game (that is, the game ends when you die - you cannot win), this is just a slasher film for insane and mindlessly in the soul. Accordingly, everyone dies in due time for is including the heterosexual pair of Attractive White People. <br /> <br /> The best use of this film’s meager but untargeted budget might be to send the cast through the Acting School, although Ona Grauer's left chest did a good job, like her right breast and those running scenes with a crowbar: priceless! I especially liked the final scene in which She tried to act as if she had been slaughtered, but it looked as if she had just eaten cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Attempting to do something more Tensely spending time, I pulled out my widescreen anamorphic Manos: Hands of Fate DVD, dedicated to the 35th anniversary of a special edition dedicated to digital restoration. Oh yes! ?? the drugs were suited to insanity - now HERE there was some quality filmmaking ?? <br /> <br /> (Cinema Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
