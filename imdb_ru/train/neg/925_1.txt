well, this movie is damn correct. it is without doubt one of the most technically inept movie works ever made. absolutely terrible, but you MUST see this. rent it with friends and think up a game with drinks or just have fun, it's fun. and backroom hardware proves it, you can do anything with paper plates and finger painting. cool. Okay, rent it only for this one scene: the two characters actually walk in the spot for about 3 minutes in a row the director (in the comment) says: “Yes, the tracking was so smooth that it seems they ...” Yes, the right person, they completely walk on the spot. It's very funny.
