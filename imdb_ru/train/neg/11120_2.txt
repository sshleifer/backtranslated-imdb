You know that a movie is bad when its main point is the opportunity to see a short moment of “Danger!”. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing in “White people can't jump” is that he has great potential. For several years I lived in an area quite similar to what is depicted in this film; racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about the participants of this “basketball culture” could be very interesting, but the mediocre play and the meager scenario in “White people cannot find work” left much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events in the film is cyclical. First, Billy either wins or loses money playing basketball. Then he returns to his home and rests with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories grow to a climax, but the “climax” that I saw was just another sequence in this repetition (in this case, “Billy either wins or loses money playing basketball”). <br /> For the development of the plot it is necessary to solve some dilemma; and this dilemma should be interesting if the film is interesting. The authors of The White People Can't Jump, apparently forgot this rule, since the plot can be summed up like this: "Billy must pay the bills." I appreciated the change in pace from other sports films, but - sorry - it was just awful. I would not care if Billy had the money to pay for the apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, “White people can't jump” is a successful film. Apparently, some relentless sports fans will give up the terrible letter for a few scenes with a basketball ball in them. Others, I am sure, were attracted by big names, starring. It makes me wonder: if the cast were completely replaced by previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced by lacrosse, would anyone bother to watch this movie? I really don't think so. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie two stars out of ten; extra star for "Danger!" a scene that kept me awake for a few minutes. Thank you Trebek.
