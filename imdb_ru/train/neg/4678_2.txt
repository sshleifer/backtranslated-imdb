There were a few Andrenaline kickers in this film, but this is an old story that simply could not happen. The naval protocols will never be able to break so much that the crew, much smaller than the XO, can go so far against Captain. I will take Dr. Stranglov any day if I want to see this plot. Sidenote - The US Navy did not support this film.
