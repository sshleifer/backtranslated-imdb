One of the worst films I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, “The Fan” is a meaningless cliche exercise in a slasher. He is trying to unleash or distort the genre with the ridiculous storylines of a crazy fan turned into a psychotic - the film turns into nothing. (spoiler) We have to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access and kills a baseball player in a luxury hotel without witnesses, guards or cameras? The film is nonsense, trying to pull the strings of the heart through a baseball plume, which ends mockingly with ingenuous and useless. Not sure what all the actors thought about when they got on board this razzie. This is such a big folly as they come. Stay away if you prefer thoughts in your movies.
