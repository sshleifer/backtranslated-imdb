This is a tangled and rambling mess of endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. This is not an exaggeration: you must make great efforts to even try to take part in it. <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to tell why Erwin / Elvira commits suicide at the end but instead in every scene someone tries to explain: “when he was young, it happened ... "and" he just came back from Casablanca and ordered everything to be cut there ... ", etc. Soon <br /> Soon in the film Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughterhouse, talking to a prostitute girlfriend ( Of course, carnage is the best place for a pleasant little conversation) and tells her the story of Elvira’s life. , Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after another. It is difficult to choose between focusing on disturbing images or on what the transvestite says. Of course, we come to a very violent and coarse symbolism: "I have suffered a lot in my life and am going to die." <br /> <br /> In one of the rare moments when something really happens, Erwin / Elvira meets a former lover who only after doing an extremely fun choreography with two other guys (as if she is seeking the necessary level of homosexuality) learns Elvira . <br /> <br /> There are some interesting pictures and ideas I have to admit (for example, when a nun tells the story of young Erwin), but all in the film is wasted because of Fassbinder's pampering.
