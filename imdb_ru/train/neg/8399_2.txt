I'm a big Stooges fan, but the only quality in this film is that it is Curly. Made long before he started drinking heavily, he is his classic “me” in this (and Larry is not bad either). Mo character is a direct part (mostly), and this film is better called “Curly and Larry Kino”. Not that any of the Stozh films was very good (in my opinion), but, as one commentator said, how sad it is that this film had real potential. The casting was good, it was well-directed, filmed and edited, but the storyline tried to be serious about something, adding only some of the Stooges antics and musical numbers (which I thought were good at the time). make for yourself during this movie, if you really believe that it should be better than mowing the lawn, and garbage collection (which is to be discussed) is to wait for Curly / Larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest.
