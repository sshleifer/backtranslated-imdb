First, I must admit that this is not a good film. And I would never have watched this film if there was no Pacino in it. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the strange 24 hours of publicism. And he is overloaded with work, dizziness, nausea and sometimes regret. like a character at all. It's really boring, in 20 minutes you can fall asleep. And I don't understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible movie. Just because of the money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I am an avid fan of Pacino, I bought this 2002 film People I Know. If you haven’t bought it yet, don’t even think about it, it’s just a waste of time.
