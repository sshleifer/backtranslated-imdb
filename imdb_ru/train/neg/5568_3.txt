Stars Dolph Lundgren - a former policeman / boxer who is looking for a strange scene in Boston to find out who killed his brother, who was well thought of in the community, but along the way he finds out how his brother enjoyed perverse sex and that the serial killer should be to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this film, in fact, thanks to his performance here, it would be possible to forget that Lundgren became famous for his role in action movies. Nevertheless, the material does not give Lundgren anything to work with, in fact, Lundgren has absolutely nothing to dry in a dark thriller, which is both predictable and incomprehensible. The collaborative star Daniel Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett is at the center of his attention, and if the film had spent time studying their relationship, the film would have been pretty decent. However, the film is dull, the action does not exist, the plot has not been studied enough (B. is too boring around the investigation of his brother's employer Landgren), and the film is too bloody and funny. Once again, Lundgren is actually really good (as is newbie Daniel Brett), but the film just flows from one sequence to another, which makes this film especially disappointing. If anything else, it shows how landgren is undervalued as an actor. <br /> <br /> 1/2 Out of 4- (Bad)
