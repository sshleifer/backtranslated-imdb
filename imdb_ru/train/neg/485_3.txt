When I saw the preview, I thought: it will be a great movie. And indeed, it could be. The actress playing the main character was very trustworthy, and the beauty of the shooting is undeniable. However, the dialogues cast a dark shadow over the whole picture. The language level was too familiar and too modern for action to take place in 1610, and he took most of the magic of the film. However, I have to congratulate the translator, because the English subtitles were more refined and suitable than the original French replicas, and this probably explains the good rating of the film received on imbd!
