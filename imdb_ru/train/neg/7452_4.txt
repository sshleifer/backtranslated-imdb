It seemed to me that this film simply went bankrupt. The main problem for me was using Glover as a serial killer. I do not know whether this is due to the casting or simply because of his behavior, but I doubt that Glover will ever portray a convincing villain. He is a good guy, and it is always obvious in his speeches. In addition, the film - your story about the serial killer of the mill. Nothing special.
