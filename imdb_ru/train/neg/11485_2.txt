The Forbidden Siren is based on the Siren 2 Playstation 2 game (so many 2). As with most video games that turn movies, I would say that most people don’t translate well to a different medium. And this is also painful. <br /> <br /> There is a rather long prologue that explains and establishes the prerequisite for the story, and the mysterious island on which the writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son of Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) come to relocate. Villagers do not look too friendly, and pretty soon give sound advice about the siren on the island, to stay home as soon as the siren starts to cry. <br /> <br /> Naturally and slowly, everything starts to go bumping, and our brothers and sisters go on a mission, beating the bushes to see exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants. But in truth, you won’t worry about what’s happening as folklore and fairy tales are added to confuse the plot. What really pushed him into the realm of a bad comedy was his unwittingly irrelevant moments that didn’t meet the norm, which simply caused a pitiful giggle of his absolute stupidity until it was explained much later. It is one thing to try and think up something clever, but another thing is to do it convincingly and with closed loopholes. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it happens in less than 90 minutes - I think this is a horror movie phenomenon - to have it as a benchmark - it gives a nearly two-hour sensation with its slow build-up to say what he wants. Things start to accumulate closer to the last 20 minutes, but this is a classic case when too little is too late. <br /> <br /> What saves the film is how it changes tactics and reveals at the end. Again, this is a common device used to try and turn a seemingly simple horror film into something a little more, hoping to surprise the audience. It turned out quite satisfactory, but leaves a bad aftertaste, as you will feel a little deceived. There are two ways you can feel the turn - it either raises the film to a memorable level, or it gives you a sense of hockey. Unfortunately, the "Forbidden Siren" belonged more to the latter. <br /> <br /> The grace of salvation will be in cinematography using light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be frank - it’s still not worth the time, so it’s best to avoid it.
