A crazy shotgun is driven out of revenge by truckers and an obsessive mess “Dad raped me when I was 12”, I was handcuffed, all latex prostitutes are just some of the characters with whom you will meet in this complete disgrace of the film this can be easily see on any cable television station (for example, Skinemax) at 4 am on Sunday evening. (?? And yes, I know that it was a whole phrase, but people are with me; this is a boring review of a short meaningless movie). <br /> <br /> Shot in “somewhere” in Canada, almost without a budget, the plot for this ugly show is trite, the police there obviously have never heard of “state jurisdiction” because they end up Chased by Miyu (Hookers) and Trent (idiotic, anal retentive, generic, unsafe college student) throughout the US (and I thought that only the FBI could do this). The camera is trembling, sex scenes are mediocre, and the action is so bad that it can cause unintended acid memories of films such as Ishtar and Leonard Part 6. <br /> <br /> As for the scenes from Skene go (which is the only reason for even rolling this film without even thinking about buying it), there are two of them. The first one is the only one that is worth seeing, although this is the “Sex Dominatrix” scene with Kari Salin and ____ (insert an unknown actor here, he obviously did not do anything worth paying attention to) in the dirty, disgusting room of the Motel (the one with the broken a sink that drips and a soda dispenser on the outside, which has only a blue tonic, remained in it). These are all S & M people (horse stands, handcuffs, hot wax and lick of underwear), and finally they leave him in a motel room, without money and police officers waiting at his door (this will show you guys don’t Let the prostitute connect you to the motel room "in the middle of nowhere"). Unfortunately, Kari does not show skin that is worth remembering, and this in itself can cause deep traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so this is definitely a negative impact on this film. <br /> <br /> As for the final, * Snicker * Snicker * I know that you probably don’t mind if I open it to you, but I don’t, you have to spend your hard earned money on it. In general, I give him 1/5 per action, 3/5 for the skin (see. The last paragraph) and 0/0 per action, character development, or complex plot twists. <br /> <br /> - Laughing man
