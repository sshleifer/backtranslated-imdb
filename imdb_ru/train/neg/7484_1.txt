For 15 minutes, my whole family was rooting for the death of Goldie Hawn's character, or at least Steve Martin’s character left her. In 40 minutes we turned it off. There are only a few films a year that we are trying to make so annoying that we cannot even digest them long enough for the story to be established. <br /> <br /> I usually like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. And I remember how I enjoyed the original by Neil Simon. Therefore, I blame Mark Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of “What's the worst that can happen” and the author of “Miss Congeniality 2,” and I think this is what we end up with.
