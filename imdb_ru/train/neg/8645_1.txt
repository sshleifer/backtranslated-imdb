I’ve just returned from this free show, and this “Witch of Osama’s Project” is the worst film I’ve seen this year, worse than even Catwoman, which had the decency to impersonate. <br /> <br /> In “September ribbons” a “film crew” from “documentary journalists” goes to Afghanistan - despite the fact that they are completely unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh, yes, their psychotic and ridiculous vendetta The leader of the filmmaker avenged the death of his wife on Sept. 11 - to track down Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They “made” eight ribbons on their journey, which now “document” their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (Fortunately, all eight tapes end up in important moments of the narrative, which is convenient for a “documentary”.) <br /> <br /> A psychotic, idiotic hero who makes long and meaningful speeches that he probably learned to watch “MacGyver “- he doesn’t care about his own life or the life of his innocent team, as he is endangering further and further through a series of stupid failures. I don’t know why he didn’t just carry a sign with the words “Shoot me” on his back. <br /> <br /> Translator of the team, presumably due to common sense, does a little more than whine. and bewildered as an idiot hero leads them to death. <br /> <br /> You would like them to bring someone with you on a trip to call them all morons. <br /> <br /> Around "Lenta 4" I began to root for the terrorists who shot the film crew. ,
