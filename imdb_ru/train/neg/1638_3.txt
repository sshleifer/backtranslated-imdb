I was looking forward to seeing Amanda Pete in another good role after I had recently rented "Whole Nine Yards" - by the way, it was easy to hire - but this was not the case. </ i . So, I convinced two friends to come to see this movie with me one day. This review is my repentance. <br /> <br /> In the first act, we have three lead studs telling about their victories in the diner. What should have been funny, or at least telling, is pretty pathetic. Was there any redemptive quality in these three men and their clashes that we had to choose from this? <br /> <br /> [And although I don’t mind films that are vulgarly funny, I kept wondering why no one in the diner turns around when the studs are talking loudly about sexy and skitogical details. Do they do this every week at the same diner? You might think that someone would complain. Oh wait, I forgot: two other visitors noticed in the same scene. But this is just an installation on the highlight. Everyone else in the diner is deaf.] <br /> <br /> In the second act, the three studs all fall in love with Mia, and then develop brain rot without asking each other about what actually happens between four of them. And I kept asking myself, since the studs continue to behave like they, what redemptive qualities does she see in them, in order to stick to them longer than one date? Does she start with a brain rot? I kept hoping that Eric's character, a married friend, would be more than just an annoying punching bag in this act. His role is to clearly advise on being married. But why do they even talk to him when they don’t talk to each other? And his advice? Oh god <br /> <br /> The third act decides what the plot is, but by that time I was already looking at my watch. My friends told me that they were still waiting for something really funny, and I had to agree. The scene, which explains that everything was enough, and managed to explain all the questions and mysterious moments of dialogue throughout the film, but we just checked them from the list. (“Oh, well, that's why Brad did it, and Jonathan said it and ...”) <br /> <br /> We laughed at the nonsense of the plot, not something funny. Even the results during the credits were not very funny. In the end, I have nothing left but a desire to warn people of this film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
