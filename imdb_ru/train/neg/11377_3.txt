Good. for starters, the cab driver is awesome. this, this is not a taxi driver or amazing. that is bad. but I thought it was very funny, which means that he had some redemptive qualities. like a dialogue ... wow. there was more or less no plot, all the characters were stupid, and the film was preaching. there were some places where I thought the film would plunge into a taxi driver type of violence, which would have hit the head at the end of the film much more. I can't even believe that there are 20 more people who watched this movie. Yes, it is worth seeing if you are very bored and you want to confirm the fact that anyone can make a film or at least try.
