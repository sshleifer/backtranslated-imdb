This film might have been very good, but very short. Cheesy special effects and so-so acting. I could look past this if the story were not so lousy. If there were more background history, it would be better. The plot is centered around the evil witch-druid who is associated with this woman who gets a migraine. The film drags on and never explains anything, it just keeps fooling around. Christopher Walken has a role, but it is completely meaningless, like most of the film. This film had potential, but it looks like it was really poorly made for a television movie. I would avoid this movie.
