Has anyone else felt as loyal as me? The first hour or so was pretty solid, but the last. Oh my God. It seemed like it was predictable and cheesy. Not grandiose and epic, as the whole series was. Most of the read reviews are glowing, but I really can't understand why. I seriously predicted that the general ending of WAY ​​was earlier, but then I refused it because I thought: “No, they will never do it, it’s too stupid”. I can hardly stand it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm going to go out the door to sell every season. Anyone please Change mind. I want to love it. So bad. Someone will tell me why I'm wrong. Great show. A terrible ending.
