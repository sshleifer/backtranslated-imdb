This movie was terrible. The script is FULLY unrealistic, but it is written for the real world, the editing and lighting effects are worse than in most of the first film school projects. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to those who A) know any details about the world of police or covert operations. B) knows any details about the creation or evaluation of the film. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film for an average or below average, I think it would be nice if I was dumber. If you want to see this movie in full, I highly recommend some kind of intoxication. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of the small production value that it has.
