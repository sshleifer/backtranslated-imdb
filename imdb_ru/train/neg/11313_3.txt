and it's not Rohmer's case that after a few years, Siberberberg appeared and did an amazingly great job on the topic (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Perhaps this film did not help. It looked so gloomy when it came out, without a film about a siberberg with which to compare it, which probably was filmed on an even smaller sound stage with less resources. In fact, I cannot remember whether there is a horse in the film about the siberberg. all I know is the German version is pure magic, while this one looks like some kind of student production, documented on tape for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> the music ... la musique ... is not even attributed here, on IMDb ... but someone founded it on "the air of 12-14 centuries" or something like that .. Well, it doesn't really help the film. he sounds unreliable and trashy. !!! <br /> <br /> Rohmer is one of those French authors who like his leading people, in general, is also very unattractive, and it does not help. Parsifal from syberberg was amazing and can be seen on German television today. selling some special bike that he invented. ... <br /> <br /> I’m scared to think about what it looks like watching the film "Siberberberg" on video. I remember that the last time I saw a movie in a theater, the press was so bad that this experience was a colossal 5-hour travesty. But even in this case, I am afraid, he will have to surpass what this version has to offer. <br /> <br /> Points for seriousness, for arrogance, but ... this film just needed more impact. it does not look like a medieval manuscript, it looks INEXPENSIVE! Bon Marsh! oh, yes, it’s just very arbitrary that Parsifal goes to church, and this funny game of passion is interrupted ... blah!
