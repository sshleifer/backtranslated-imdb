This is the worst cr4p piece I've ever seen in my life. It barely made sense. It wasn't scary at all (aren't you as scary as loud noises and screams?) Sarah-Michel Gellar should stop making these horrible horror films. I think everyone in the movie agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the loans curled up. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst films ever made, hereâ€™s what it would look like: <br /> <br /> 1. Return 2. Booth Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> < br /> I did Silent Hill 3rd for the reason that there were some frightening scenes in it, but the rest was absolutely immaculate. The same with the fever in the cabin, did not make sense, but the return topped this list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever combined
