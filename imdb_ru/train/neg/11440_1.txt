Otherwise, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen - and I mean ever. My wife and I missed out on 10 minutes. Not to mention boring, it is absolutely unbelievable. Women (not lesbians) do not bathe together and kiss "not by chance". Brothers and sisters do not live to be over thirty, run on a swing, dance together and run in central park. Men do not know that their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding, and then never discuss it with their wife. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in the movies today. She smiles when she should cry, and vice versa. The only film she ever was good at was Boogie Nights because she didnâ€™t play. <br /> <br /> I can not stress how bad this film is.
