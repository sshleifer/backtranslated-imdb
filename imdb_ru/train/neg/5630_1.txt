The only reason I watched the movie to the end was “hope” to see something interesting. The film is really bad, and the performance of the girl is really, very bad, to be honest, I am not a film critic or expert, but you just need common sense to notice that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> The first thing that occurred to me as soon as she started talking was: "She has an affair with Willem Defoe, and he agreed to help her with the script and appear in her film, since she is a brilliant director ". .. surprise, surprise, the day after I watched the movie, I discovered on the Internet that Jada Kolagrande is his wife. Awful story and terrible performance.
