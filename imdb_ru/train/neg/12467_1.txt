This film was slower than Molasses in January ... in Alaska. A person who has set himself a preview should receive a reward for having managed to put each of the 30 seconds that were in the preview. I had to wake up the people with whom I watched it several times. After it was all over, I felt bad from waking them up. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is busy hoping that something will really happen, but nothing happens. It was easy to lose people's motives, and the characters were flat and not intersecting. By the end of the movie, you were just hoping everyone would die. All run around being despicable, petty or pathetic, and usually all three. <br /> <br /> And even worse, we watched a minute or two of the added features, just to understand how you kick and giggle, and all we saw was that people were smug as far as they are socially aware. If they had spent time on a film that was patted on the back, it might be worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I was led in anticipation of excitement for 24 years. I received a lecture on social awareness through the dirty eyes of a sandy person.
