This place is on my top list of the worst films I've seen on Starz on Demand. It seems that they take away everything that can be found on the DVD, and put it here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Obviously, anyone with a digital camera and a limited budget can come up with a horror movie and put it on television. Honestly, it looked awful from the moment I saw the trailer, but I really gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to keep an eye on low-budget films. Some of the best films I've ever seen were films that worked on a limited budget, or in other cases only a large budget was required. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. <Br /> <br /> You already know the plot, I'm sure if you read this. Either you heard about it on Starz on Demand, or for some reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. We are talking about a miserable and tearful girl, whom we will know in all 3 minutes in the incredibly bad heavy metal music video. Whoever did this should have thought that it looked really interesting, but in reality it is not. In any case, she is killing herself. Then she has someone. Then the murder begins. It is really unforgettable and as medium as possible and boring. When the first shot is heard in her apartment, it sounds pretty serious like a piece of popcorn. Was that the best sound effect they could come up with? I could find the best sound effect for free use (without copyright) on the Internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Don't let other reviews claim that this is a 10-star movie fool you. Obviously, they are either distributors of the film, or perhaps even a director trying to convince you that this piece of garbage is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Ludicrous.
