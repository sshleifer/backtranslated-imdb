This record of Drummond lacks continuity. Most of them have their own elements of stupidity, a delayed wedding, and so on. However, this is an endless series of events taking place in the dark, when characters run from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo J. Carroll, who is such an obvious suspect that no one seems to even look at. He is a stranger and behaves rather suspiciously, but Drummond and the people don't seem to understand anything. Nevertheless, this is a fairly good action and a good ending. <br /> <br /> I know that Elgy should be a comic character, but like Nigel Bruce in Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films, he is so clown that itâ€™s hard to imagine anyone with a taste or intelligence around him. Is there a story behind him that explains how he and Drummond became partners?
