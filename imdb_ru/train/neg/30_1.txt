I didn’t like the idea of ​​a female tortoise since 1987. We knew that the TMNT is four brothers with its teacher Splinter and their enemies, and each of the four brothers is named after great artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Rafel and Donatello, so that Venus here makes no sense This is an important role, and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one that contains Venus. As a female tortoise will not add any action to history, we like the history of TMNT, which we knew about in 1987, that there are new enemies in every part - this is a good time to have some kind of action, but to have a female tortoise is very weak a place to have some kind of action, we want to see more of the new TMNT series, but just like the same characters we knew in 1987 without this turtle.
