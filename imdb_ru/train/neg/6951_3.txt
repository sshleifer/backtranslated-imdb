Do not you hate it when ordering a steak, and the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> So I felt, watching the so-called "Battlestar Galaxy". One can argue about its quality, but the fact remains that this is NOT what the fans ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you were sitting in that famous restaurant I mentioned. You've been waiting for years for them to return their famous steak from the New York Strip, which you loved. When your food arrives, you will find that they have applied the name "New York Strip" to the chicken dish. You complain, but the waiter simply declares: “But damn, this is really GOOD Zir”! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted the New York Strip - STEAK! Then the waiter explains: “You the hell want the chef wanted to do, like you, zayzing zomezing NEW. We felt that ze cheeken would be more popular because we gave it the name of our previous delicious dish. ” You ask if you will ever find the original New York strip on the menu in the future, but you were informed that since the restaurant now has a dish called the New York Strip, you will never see the original New York strip - ever again. <br /> <br /> This is the case with the creation of something NEW and the blow of the namesake "Battlestar Galactica" on it. <br /> <br /> * This mini-series insults all fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the film crew responsible for this new version clearly despised the original. The team responsible for the revival of BG was to LOVE the original series, trying to improve what the fans loved, and not shamelessly try to sell this new series using the name Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> If you wanted a SciFi channel to give us a new show, then do it! Give it a new name! Do not use the name that we remember with love, trying to lure the audience. This effectively makes it impossible for us to see any semblance of the original in the future. <br /> <br /> We waited 25 years to see what we knew as BG, because we liked something in the original! We didn’t just like NAME and remnants of the basic concept. There are things that we LOVED in the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the BEST elements of the original were probably the ones that were omitted. Of course, the original BG was flawed and could use some updates. This mini-series, however, was not an improvement in any respect, but in the form of special effects (which were good, but not the most unusual by today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will argue about the quality of this material. NEW show, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> As the saying goes ... I will offer a few comments on the merits of this new mini (not compared to the original): <br /> <br /> The sequences of battles were the best. Obviously, efforts were made to make the effects more “real” in appearance and less “wow - look at this effect”. I would not say that these sequences were exceptional by today's standards, but they corresponded to the original films created for cable television. What was the deal with this "pseudo-live camera"? Some species attempted to mimic the effect of a “real” camera with delayed tracking and sharp scales. However, it was overused, given that there was no obvious SOURCE of these cameras. Infinitely smarter TV series, Babylon 5, is the only time I have seen such “live cameras” be effectively used when they allegedly witnessed actions by security cameras. <br /> <br /> Script, you ask? The script felt like it was written by a teenager, FOR other teenagers. The characters felt cardboard and stereotypical. In fact, the whole story felt connected together with other well-known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were the few elements that were saved in the original series. It was obviously "stupid" for digesting your average television audience. <br /> <br /> Human interaction was pathetic. Instead of drama based on subtle views, expressions and exact terms, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to such a degree of obviousness that he lost all ability to move any sophisticated viewer. This was evident in any interaction between Adam and the son. The director must have tried to make the most intimate and unfeeling viewer not miss it, even if he did not pay attention. Sorry, but real people do not behave as they do all the time. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this a BAD exhibition if it stood by itself. Nothing great; it will never be honored by true SciFi fans or artisans, but it will watch the masses. I personally could live without it, though. I just looked at him to see how he really caught the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> The way this mini-series is forever remembered is a symbol of how the quality of storytelling was discarded to attract more. As even the channel SciFi Channel "put out" their performances to please the masses, unlike their real niche market, fans of science fiction. This will be the time when we asked for a steak, and they insisted on giving us a chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you with one thought - <br /> <br /> NO "MUR". <br /> <br />
