From time to time there will be a film that will be so terrible that I will be forced to warn people. If I work all my days and can save only one soul from watching this film, how great will be my joy. <br /> <br /> Where to start the discussion of pain. For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. We had a swear word, a fat man who eats donuts, a stupid foreigner, etc. The script felt like it was written while shooting a film. The production value was so incredibly low that it seemed to me that I was watching a video presentation for teenagers. Directors, producers, etc. Have you ever seen a movie before? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with each new record. The concept of this movie sounds so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a few legitimate actors? But believe me, when I say this, everything went wrong, VERY WRONG.
