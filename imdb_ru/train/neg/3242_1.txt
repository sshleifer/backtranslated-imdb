Here's a review for people like me. This film sucks from start to finish. I threw popcorn onto the screen and resorted to MSF2000 style entertainment. The plot is based on random events and relies on the stupidity of people who need to be smart. Lead falls on the fraudster, and it does not occur to her that she can be deceived ????? And she is rich ???? And she is a famous psychologist ????? Come, people. She enters the bar at the most convenient moment, when everyone is going to talk about how to deceive her ??? It was so dramatized that it seemed like a slap in the face to even indecisive viewers of the film. The rain man would be offended. I also admit that I despise Mametâ€™s dialogue with the passion that some people have for meat eaters who start a war and wear fur. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I will do it. That it shouldn't sound real is great. I don't care. This is what everyone says the same. Mamet cannot create characters; all he can do is impose his voice on us mercilessly through various actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They are embarrassed by the fact that all people are the same character. (However, his later films do improve.)
