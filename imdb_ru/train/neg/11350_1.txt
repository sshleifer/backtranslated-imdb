As long as there is 3d technology (I think it is the 1950s), animation was created for it. I remember specifically, the cartoon of Donald Duck with Chip and Dale in it. I don’t remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald worked in a circus, fed elephant peanuts, and Chip and Dale stole peanuts. This was made to be viewed in 3d, probably from the 1960s. If you happened to watch “Meet the Robinsons in 3D” in cinemas, they showed this cartoon before the film and explained the details of its origin. There are probably about 100 cartoons created specifically for viewing through 3D glasses. This statement was a bad move, because it is not difficult to prove that they are wrong. In addition, it looks like a bad movie.
