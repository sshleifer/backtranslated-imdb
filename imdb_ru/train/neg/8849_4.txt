This is a pretty bad movie. But not as bad as his reputation suggests. Production values ​​are not so bad, and there is a strange effective scene. And he has schizoid plywood of the 80s, which means it's always funny. Also beware of Jimmy Nail's brief appearance - his attempt at an American accent is so astounding that it is fantastic. Sybil Dunning's breasts are also fantastic - they appear briefly in the film, but the scene repeats countless times in the final credits in what can only be described as a 12-inch remix of Sybil Dunning's boobs. Like a horror movie, it's not scary, the effects are stupid, and Christopher Lee comes to sleepwalking through his game. I think he was buying a new home and he needed some money to deposit. The two main characters — the man and the woman’s man — were so insignificant that I almost forgot about all of them, and I just watched this movie tonight. Werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original film, in fact, strange, sometimes they look more like strongly burned monkeys. The European setting is pretty good, and the music presented by the new wave group Babel, although quite terrible, at least gives the film some added cheese. <br /> <br /> Overall? Good for a laugh. Not good quality, but are you serious? Cunningly expect it to be? And at least you always have Sybil's hammers.
