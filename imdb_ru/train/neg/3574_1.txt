I just could not finish this movie. I disconnected after what, as I would say, put forward my candidacy for the most pitiful attempt to reward sexual suggestions: a scene in which Pia Zadora is at a picnic between two boys who want her. One (good boy) begs her to see the mistake of her way. The other (bad guy) just asks if she wants a hot dog, which he then gives her. At the level of the crotch. I hope I donâ€™t ruin anything to say that she turns around and takes a hot dog with a smile. Just a pity.
