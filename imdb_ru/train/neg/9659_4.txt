After watching this movie, I was genuinely disappointed - not because of the actors, the story or the direction - I was disappointed with the commercials of this movie. <br /> <br /> Trailers assumed that the battalion “chose the third way out” in addition to surrender or die (Polish information was even misleading that they had a choice: to be killed with their own artillery or German weapons, they even translated the name is incorrect as an "inappropriate battalion"). It tickled the right place and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> Frustration began when I realized that the third way was to just sit down and count the corpses, and then sit down and count the corpses ... Then I started thinking: “Hey, this story can't be so simple. .. I bet this clever officer will find some clever way to save what is left of his troops. ” Well, he did not, they just sat and waited for something to happen. And me too. <br /> <br /> The plot was based on real events of the First World War, so the writers could not fully use their imagination, but even thought that I found this film really seamless and even a little boring. And, as I wrote in First of all, it is not the fault of actors, writers or directors - their marketers raised my expectations far above the level that this film could handle.
