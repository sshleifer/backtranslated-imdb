This time the hero from the first film became a man, and this time he uses fists and leg combinations against super universal soldiers and a computer, which broke down and is ready to take over the world. Iâ€™m pretty sure that it was the Double Team that convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme no longer deserves trust in the provision of watchable fighters. However, it is precisely this that has forever tarnished his authority. While Universal Soldier: The Return is not as boring as the Double Team or The Quest, it's actually pretty awful anyway, without the style and grace of the original and no star couples. This sequel is made simple for children who love professional wrestling. In retrospect, even the episodes were not so exciting, and therefore this film is a useless deception. In other words, another muffler on the Van Damme conveyor. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (bad)
