Are we talking about one movie? This film is completely ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. This is a typical direct DVD / TV movie that includes all the necessary ingredients for a terrible movie: replaying with the actors, plot side effects that were left unexplained, GIRL SHOWS IT * why why ??) people donâ€™t react real life. I will not even bother you with details, it will take all night. Well, well, only one: if two people were killed in front of you, when you walked down the street, one of the victims practically dies on your hands, his blood would spill from his head wound everywhere, would your first anxiety be? "Oh, he left the world, and the last thing he saw was my evil face!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
