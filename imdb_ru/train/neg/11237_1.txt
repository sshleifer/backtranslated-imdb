I went to watch this film with low expectations, but hoping to be fascinated by seeing my hometown on tape. Unfortunately, that's all I got. The story covers familiar territory (high school reunion), but the plot is muddled, and the supernatural element adds little to this worn theme. Although the quality of the game was generally good, the content of the film was terrible. The sexism of the film was blatant - women, apparently, were not fulfilled if they were not married, did not give birth, or were not both (although this was accepted as a post-feminist choice). Worst of all was racism — a piercing Jewish mother, a black man who still lives at home — and unreasonable cruelty (torturing a class geek). We should be ashamed if these characters are believed to represent the residents of Kalamazoo, and writers should be embarrassed by the fact that they have displayed such wide and cruel stereotypes.
