After two long, long introductory scenes, one of which my brother saw the final conclusion, and the other absolutely no joke, we begin the fast-forward festival, which is GROOVE TUBE. Naturally, very stupid little boys from the fraternity who still use JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea that feces come out of some kind of pipe, SEX OLYMPICS (I really don't want to give you details), and the clown is basically this is a “not very cute clown”, which, I think, I have seen about ninety times, now it will eat it like dung beetles: well, more power for you. <br /> <br /> I just want to express it, despite what you heard, this film was by no means a model for many endlessly funny films such as KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or something else. The film about parody has already been shot and now for something completely different, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, and so on. And much better done.
