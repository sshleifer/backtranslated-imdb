A manipulative drama about a glamorous model (Margot Hemingway), who was raped by a defiant, but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon) - which she presented to her younger sister (played by a real brother and sister Mariel), whose music teacher he is. While actions in the central courtroom attract attention - thanks in large part to Anne Bancroft’s teamwork as a Hemingway attorney - the film is too often just glossy, but also extremely unconvincing: the jury allegedly takes the side of the musician because a) the girl invited the attack from - because of the sensual nature of her profession and b) she did not offer resistance to the alleged aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and accidentally saw a married couple in bed. What the hell?!; she was obviously connected - what resistance could she really offer? <br /> <br /> The second half of the film, which tells Sarandon’s rape of her sister, who curiously awaits irreversibility (2002) in the tunnel, is rather far-fetched: Mariel’s character should have known better than to trust Sarandón after her sister, but Margo herself foolishly repeats the work that indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately! The culmination of the moment — when Sarandon gets his fair desserts, when Margot suddenly turns into a fearless and resourceful vigil — becomes a crowd of spectators in the style DEATH OF WISH (1974); by the way, behind both films was the omnipresent Italian film mogul Dino de Lorentis. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that the lives of the two Hemingway sisters differed sharply from each other (this was the debut in the cinema of both): Margo's career never developed. off (despite her undisputed appearance and meritorious participation here) - while Mariel will soon receive an Oscar for MANHATTAN Woody Allen (1979) and, interestingly, she will play a glamorous victim of violent violence when she writes the role of real life Playboy , in the spotlight of Dorothy Stratten, in the Bob Foss film "STAR 80" (1983). With the additional pressure of a couple of failed marriages, Margot took refuge in alcohol and eventually died from a drug overdose in 1996; It is terrible that the Hemingway family had a history of suicide - in particular, the grandfather of the sisters, the famous writer Ernest, who died as a result of a spontaneous injury in 1961.
