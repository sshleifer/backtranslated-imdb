Townies is the laziest film I've ever seen, and I saw Blair Witch films (parts one and two). He seems confused in what he wants. It's not funny enough for a comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough to watch. There are scenes with a man engaged in a "whim / bloody karate", so I think, oh, this film will be in the spirit of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then, without warning, he jumps into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally retarded) woman and a gullible mother. Then he gets into the only good role in the film, which seems to be set up as a comedy without tracks of laughter. The part Iâ€™m talking about is the lonely Tauni, who is so alone that he finds solace in a rotting corpse. It was the only part of the film that gave me ANY feeling. The rest was a belt of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne, at the end of the film, Wayne (director) makes fun of Toby (star) in public. It made me sick. Although The Nerd Killer and The Nerd Bride Killer (the other two films of Wayne) are not the best, they are at least so thought out that you can have fun before the final credits. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, he had wonderful features that I still use. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like elevated films, and if you like to watch your legs, just rest, wherever they are, you won't like TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of ****) <br /> <br />
