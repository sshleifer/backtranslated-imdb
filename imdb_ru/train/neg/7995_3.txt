I remember watching this film when I was young, but I could not remember the name for it, then, watching horror films, I found it and thought to myself: “Is this a name?” This film is a kind of combination of a disaster / movie film about insect attacks with fewer noticeable stars. It's also a bit boring, since it has a television atmosphere where you can see the movie disappear for commercials and the like. On the plot there is a resort of the kind that is attacked by ants. I think they were a little concerned about the construction or something that is happening nearby, but do not quote me about it. The most memorable ant attack for me for this entire film was the first one, in which a child participated, which fell into the pool after swarming, and, of course, the scene of Summers’s attacks, too. What else stands out in this is a very blunt end, when survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end, though, as in most television films, this film is very tame and not very scary, unless you panic at the sight of ants.
