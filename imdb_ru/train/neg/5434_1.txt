Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few complaints. - The screenwriter has excluded two main characters from the book. - The plot was grotesquely altered. - The voice-over sounds as if it were directly removed from written passages (which can be well read, but are not the same during a conversation, especially in the style of Chabon’s writing). - The game is more wooden than a log house. (Esp. Bechstein) - This is to be installed in 1983 ??? It looks like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> Honestly, I couldn’t bring myself to finish watching this film, so it’s quite possible that he bought it himself ... (sarcasm). I sincerely hope that no one paid to see this, or at least someone who reads a book, hoping for something decent (a la Wonder Boys). I love Shabon as a writer, but he should be ashamed of this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Without stars.
