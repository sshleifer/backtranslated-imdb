In general, the killing of college students, can a new teacher stop the madness ?! <br /> <br /> Believe me, you don't care. <br /> <br /> With a title like Splatter University, one could immediately understand that this film is not high art. But worse, Splatter University is not even suitable for fun trash. Splatter U is so poorly made - the story is meaningless, the characters are simply thrown away, and the entire film lacks the essence of imagination. Needless to say, there is no waiting for either the atmosphere or the panic. This nonsense is not enough to dare to throw nudity (for the cheapest sensations). So everyone around this infinitely spoiled slasher does not offer anything in the way of entertainment (even cheap laughter) and simply becomes a complete bore. The bottom of the barrel, people - even dying slasher fans will want to think twice before watching, let alone pay money for this film. <br /> <br /> BOMB of ****
