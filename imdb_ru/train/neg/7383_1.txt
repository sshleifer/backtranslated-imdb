I feel happy owning what is known as the worst Steven Seagal film ever made. I knew that I was getting ready for something special when Stephen opened his mouth and a voice rang out. By the middle of the film, my eyes began to hurt, and I almost fell off the chair with an uncontrollable laugh. <br /> <br /> Stephen - Stephen (with a constantly changing voice) and quite incredible in his role (as always). Who the hell lets into the Forces of people with bad cedars with tails? He also always enters himself in absolutely unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years younger than him. All acting actors look as if they were shot in the dark - by the way, did they shoot this film in the dark with a flashlight for lighting? <br /> <br /> This is really disgusting in all possible ways. Invite all your friends and make a public event out of it - this is a truly special event.
