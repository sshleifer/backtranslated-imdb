Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and two dollars for rent in my life. If nothing happens before I die, it will be the greatest regret in my life. Anyone who has even thought about this film or financed it deserves a kick between his legs, because that's what they thought about when they shot this film. It's about an overweight guy who is hopelessly romantic and writes pretentious nonsense that tries to impersonate poetry. He joins his love friend on a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls and things like that. Only a fat guy does not start a girl. Skin shocks do not irritate me, I take them for good coin. But this film is trying to be more than just a film. We are talking about Fat Man, who is looking for love from some girl, but then he meets another silicone girl in a bikini who enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, which brings money for his family and impressive ladies, only he has his lady anyway. The dialogue is super terrible even for film C. It supports tons of black stereotypes, no character development, this is a glorified porn movie, without any porn in it. Never watch this movie.
