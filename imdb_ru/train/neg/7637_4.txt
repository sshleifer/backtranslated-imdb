It could be a very good movie if I could watch it. The hand-held camera was very jovial. From the initial credits, I was worried. Some of us watching this felt very sick to the end. But we stayed until the end, because it was such a charming and interesting film, which told about young pop culture in South Africa. Black and white film reinforced his cunning. The game seemed very genuine. Some dialogue was a bit hard to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to find most of it funny. If you have any motion sickness, you can seriously consider skipping this movie. It's weird, but not worth the nausea.
