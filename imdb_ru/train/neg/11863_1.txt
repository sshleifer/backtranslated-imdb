I thought these films were a disappointment, I expected it to be much better than it was. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this movie, and that I didn't sit in the cinema for that. Where to start in this film, the acting skills in this film were average, the humor was terrible, and just the general storyline of this film was not special. I thought this movie should be great, but it was nothing more than a waste of time. I think that it was terrible to play in this film, none of the actors of this film had chemistry, it just wasn't there. I think that maybe if we had a different actor playing the role of Kirk than Jay Baruchel, maybe it would be better, but all the time when I watched this film, he looked high and I didnâ€™t have a feeling that he does not play in this film. Alice Eve did an excellent job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this film were not names and had very little influence in this film. The humor in this film was not at all ridiculous, there were several liners in this film, which were fine, but it was not worth telling your friends that they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith was having a hard time with this because he could not decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I genuinely think he needs to stick with the Burger King advertisement. I think this film could be better if the writers went to another director. The plot line of this film is the same as that of any other hot girl, just good, the guy's love story is boring. I think it would be better if it had more originality, but what a disappointment. I honestly would not recommend anyone to go see this movie. I think you will have more fun at the dentist than in this film. So save yourself from the agony and just do not see it.
