This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher in a Catholic school, watching the Ravandan genocide unfold around him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief explanation of Rawanda's past history and rivalry. He then turns to the story told by the eyes of a young idealistic "NEW-COMER", a young teacher who does not take life or the situation too seriously. When he and the driver approach the checkpoint, he plays with his drivers ID. not realizing that this is a serious moment, and that if the driver cannot identify himself as a person of a suitable tribe for the soldiers, they will be killed. And this is how he relates to the unfolding history of chaos and unfolding around him. Suddenly he realizes that every Ravandan (including his driver) is involved and that European soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. Media cameras cannot stop the machete, and too many machetes with the militia also shoot. The name is derived from an army captain who says that he will shoot at dogs eating corpses around his complex, but will not shoot at militias that kill people around the complex. Mainly because they have not fired at the soldiers yet. Finally, he realizes the hopelessness of the situation, and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to leave his place for one of the alleged victims, runs with a tail between his legs, and does not face the inevitable death with schoolchildren, he promised not to leave behind. <br /> <br /> This is rather a study of the nature and moment of the coming of Jesus for one character, than the story of the genocide in RAWANDA. This film should not have been shot in RAVANDA; it could appear in any of the Hell genocide holes that are going on all over the world at any given time.
