I first saw this movie on MST3K. And although I laughed at jokes, I donâ€™t really think that this film was so bad. Of course, it was a little difficult to understand that it was rather obvious with a low budget, but it had a very similar to Hitchcock plot, and I can honestly say that when I watched the non-MST3K version, I was genuinely entertained. This film calls for a Hollywood remake.
