Just when you thought it was safe to return to the water ... <br /> <br /> Another computer generated a mutant crocodile on a hunt for a human meat lunch, released by another of those crazy science objects. Gereco Biotech is fooling around with research on growth hormone by accidentally releasing a baby crocodile that develops at an accelerating rate. <br /> <br /> The cast of the B-film adds a lot of fun to this "Monster Movie Genetic Bug" trial series. Kostas Mandilor recalls Mick Dundee, an Australian accent, hat, big ass knife, working as a crocodile expert hired by Gereco executive Joan Pakul let the beast in its institution free innocent people). Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger, and Jane Longenhecker is his hot daughter, who works at an animal shelter. The soap opera star Matthew Borlengi is the love interest of Longgeneker, a local artist who welds sculptures (.. his brother is the victim of the Crocodile). Of course, this skill is very useful when our heroes install the created crocodile trap, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. <br /> <br /> The crocodile itself will never be a bit convincing, because it rages through the stock in search of food, special effects of low quality. Regarding Roger Kormanâ€™s productions on monster-dinosaur renegades, I stick to the Carnosaur. The monster is, in essence, a crocodile standing on its hind legs, often upright, chasing potential victims. I felt that Mandylor and the filmmakers were faking Crocodile Dundee with his crocodile hunter, and this imitation might be amused where the monster itself fails. Borlengi and Longeneker have pretty good chemistry on screen. As expected, Pakula gets her pleasure in a fun fashion (.. sip).
