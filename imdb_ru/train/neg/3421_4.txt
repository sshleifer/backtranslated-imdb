STARS RATING: ***** Works **** simply do not hit the target *** This is a bit between ** Lagging * Pits <br /> <br /> Some plutonium disappeared, and some very nasty people now have the means to developing a bomb capable of mass destruction - so Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his daring young protégé Dick (Judson Mills, another actor from the previous film) using his adopted daughter Josh Kue (Jennifer Tung) intended to stop them. <br /> <br /> This was another film dedicated to terrorism a year after the events of September 11th. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself even later commented on how terribly the storyline to the film resembled what happened in the center of New York that day, therefore there were those who would be in the mood for the film, where Norris and his side ... kick some terrorist ass kick if nothing else. In addition, he is as interchangeable as anything that ever was in Norris. It makes you wonder what the original did to make a continuation, and whether this film could become “Presidential Man 3” soon. <br /> <br /> If you saw one Norris film, you really saw them all, and nothing new or unexpected happens to it, but at least you know what you are getting, and, as I said, Perhaps this was what some needed to blow off steam. **
