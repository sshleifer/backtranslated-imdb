What time do we live when someone likes this Joe Swan - no matter what the hell he thinks is a good director ... or even a director! Where is the new crop of cinematographers with brains and talents ??? We need them badly, and damn it, damn it! <br /> <br /> This film is about nothing, just like the characters in the film mean nothing. This terrible, so-called Gen Y, is full of bored idiots, some of whom declare themselves directors without bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles directed. John Houston was the director. Fellini was the director. Dreyer directed and so on. D. Modern films like these show how stupid young so-called “cinematographers” can be when they believe they are coming out without a script, without directing, without thinking, without legitimate “camera work” (all terrible, DV), there is no editing craft, there is nothing that means “rebellious” or “advanced” filmmaking. No, this is called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation in the movies (and in fact you have a “shot from the nest” in your face, so be ready). <br /> <br /> Watch the early films of any experienced "indie" director: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... no one did anything as tedious and aimless as that However, Swan - be that as it may, he still drives SXSW every year and is hailed as some kind of fearless new talent. This shit! I cannot imagine that anyone would like it, and everything else that the so-called director did (everything I saw) is just as bad (new material, clearly made to attract a wider audience, one of the comedy committees) . Stay away if you are not a friend or family member of those involved ... if you think about it, if you are a family member or friend, you will probably be ashamed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations .... <br /> <br /> Extreme debris. This is not art. This is the exact opposite of this.
