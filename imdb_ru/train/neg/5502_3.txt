Foolish, often absurd hype associated with the landing of a spacecraft and the chaos caused by Tim (Jeff Daniels) and people in his orbit. <br /> <br /> Daniels always amazes me. He showed such depth and promise in the “Terms of Conclusion” of 1983, as Shirley MacLane's son-in-law. Years passed, and Daniels could not get a good meat role. Instead, he is filmed in meaningless comedies such as Dumb and Dumber. <br /> <br /> As for this picture, it fails because of the subject. At the very least, the television show has caused a lot of situations. In this film, we see permanent farces, and people turn into monsters, because the government prevents to capture the Martian Martin. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Brown’s participation is a great example of a film’s failure. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed an ugly man who found herself in a situation when the Martian left her at a loss. In the film's version, the blonde bomb in the role of Brown is trying to become entangled in a romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> TV star Ray Walston plays a small role as a government agent, or is this really true? <br /> <br /> A very big disappointment for those who liked the TV show so much.
