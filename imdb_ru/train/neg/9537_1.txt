** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "Thesis" in English) thanks to the later work of director Alejandro Amenabar "The Others". Based on how brilliantly measured and terribly effective this film was, I assumed that his early efforts would be of the same quality, and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead, I came across the most tedious, ridiculous excuse for a film with brain-slaughter, which I have seen since the time of the German film Anatomy (which I was reminded of). <br /> <br /> The plot has potential, but it is thrown out during the first 20 minutes. She revolves around the thesis of an innocent-pretty psychology student Angela (Ana Torrent - the killer of Jessica Harper) on the topic of violence in films. Due to some far-fetched circumstances, too stupid to go here, she finds herself in a “snuffbox” film, in which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. Angela and her friend Horror Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked, but intrigued by this record and decide to find out who is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never give a reason for why the girls want to find the killers (as they resolutely refuse to contact the police during any unfolding events, even when their own life is at risk) and the secret itself is limp as well, like Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one correct “hint” (the type of camera that the killers use), and this is: a) very weak and b) roll out in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called “disentanglement” occurs only thanks to blind luck, more and more ridiculous plot twists and horrendous terrible, transparent and completely senseless red herrings, which are simply discarded to delay the time of the run. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar may know his materials about ghost stories, but he obviously never read a detective book in his life. The key to good nonsense is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and eliminate them one by one with smart reasoning and the gradual discovery of new and new evidence before moving on to the final turn. In Tessis, POTENTIAL SPOILER FORWARD *, the killer’s personality is correctly guessed by amateur detectives almost instantly, and then we get 100 minutes when the writer tries to uselessly throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas and throws his hand up and says: “Well, you understood me, it was him in the end”! As for any logic or motives behind the crimes - not such a luck. You are watching the wrong movie, if you aspire to this. <br /> <br /> The only thing that pulls TESIS away from being just a stupid, poorly written thriller is how he tries to do it. some kind of ridiculous, confusing "point" about the violence in the movies. I have no idea what position he is trying to take on this issue, but he seems determined to squeeze a ton of misinformed, entangled psycho flow between the rest of the gibberish and say, “Look at me! I am a politician! ” The final scenes in which the “point” of the film is supposedly crammed home are so absurd and childish that one cannot help but wonder whether Amenabar feels embarrassed now that he is watching it. If he does not, he certainly should. This is a complete "amateur night in the house of slashers". <br /> <br /> In general, I can't believe I spent two full hours on it (it seemed at least six), just hoping that something could happen. The urban legend of “snuff films” (and that's basically all they are, despite the fact that this film tries to suggest that they are some kind of criminal phenomenon that has swept the whole world!) Is an area that can be it is painful to use horrified films (“Videodrome” anyone?), but it is so easy to step over the line to the nursery “isn't it cool if!” the territory is with him (that is, “My little eye”) ... reached a record low for the "snuff film" genre. At each level, this is best left dead and buried. I give him 1 out of 10 for good coverage, but that's all he gets.
