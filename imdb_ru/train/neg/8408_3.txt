Wow, this is very unusual in one respect: usually the first movie in a long sequence of sequels is the best of all. People are surprised when the sequel is actually better. With Tarzan, I thought this movie was the worst of the many, or at least the first six that make up my Tarzan Collection DVD collection. I’m happy to see the sequels several times, but I’m sitting through this turkey thanks to several characters. <br /> <br /> Well, let's start with good news: <br /> <br /> GOOD - Lots of action games with lots of wild animals, even if they are just videos. You see the attacks of lions, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you call it, and you see several different tribes of all kinds, including the pygmies (called in the movie "Dwarves"). Since this film was made almost 75 years ago, I cannot be confused with realism, because it has not been in films for a long time. They are doing everything possible so that you put up with the actors talking against the background of fake backgrounds. However, Weissmüller did many battle scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan make up a well-built beautiful couple, if she was ever in these golden years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is of historical value (with so many sequels) because it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and began to learn English. <br /> <br /> BAD - Since Tarzan shoots Jane Parker, almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in hysterics, screaming and screaming. after the scene. This is enough to cause a headache, and it will destroy the film. Fortunately, she calmed down in the sequels, but not in this film. The film also does not contribute to the image of the Great White Hunter, where C. Aubrey Smith, who plays Jane's father, and Neil Hamilton, as “Harry Holt”, a safari guide, shoot each animal within sight of whether the animals are threatened. or not. These people are happy, especially Smith. On the other hand, it is very unfortunate that there is nothing here that would explain how Tarzan found himself in the jungle. There is no history or video of his growing up. He is right there when Jane and the group get to a certain point in Africa.
