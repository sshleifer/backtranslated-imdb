This film should not be watched because it was supposed to be a failure. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to do it with a remake of the classic Bollywood film "Sholay", but after having problems with the original creators, he decided to continue the project and ... I think I would leave all the good parts of the film (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action and etc.) and make a film just because he has already hired a team. A waste of money, a waste of time. After making films such as Rendzhel, Satya and Company, he put Coppola (The Godfather) on us; What were you thinking about the RGV? In any case, the story, though difficult to understand, is almost like Old Scholai. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, Sholay) and Ajay, the new kid in the block plays Ajay (Jay, Sholay). Both "bad but funny" friends help the policeman to catch the bad guy first. Later in the film, the now retired policeman hires them as personal security and protection at the hands of the most wanted Bubban, played by Amitabh Bachchan. If you haven't watched Bollywood movies, the Good Guys won out. There I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
