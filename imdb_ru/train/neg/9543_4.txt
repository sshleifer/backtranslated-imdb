Let's face it - if you rented a continuation of the STDVD forgotten stone of the 80s and expected that it would be better than the above, then you are an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code combines a long list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market so easily fills. Such films do not need spoilers, because you already know them. <br /> <br /> The “plot” for this “film” is this: the nerd meets a girl; girl loves a nerd; nerd loves girl; nerd accidentally communicates with the computer "Top Secret"; the nerd and the girl go to another country; the botanist and girlfriend are eventually persecuted by government lawsuits in another country; the nerd and the girl meet some important old man who dies at a crucial moment in the “movie”; nerd and girl were captured; top secret government computer is going crazy; nerd hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd defeats Top Secret Computer using the same Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames movie; nerd saves the day; the nerd lies <br /> <br /> the end. <br /> <br /> The game, the script, the effects, the score and the cinematography are what you expect - B-class. There are a few familiar faces, and if you're not a big fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid it. Of course, the film will not make you so mad as to eat your own toes when you see it, so if you like cheap STDVD sequels, then you are right at home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Matthew Broderick is also associated with some kind of “masterpiece” that he could not even make a five-second cameo in this. But can you blame him?
