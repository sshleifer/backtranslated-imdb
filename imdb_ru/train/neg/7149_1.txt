Anyone who wrote Redline as a great car movie should be paid off by Daniel Sadek to promote this incredible soaring bunch of amateur crap. Easily the worst car movie or any film ever made. It makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take every crappy clich√© from an 80s action movie, insert some really crappy special effects and flimsy characters into it, and you have a living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write scripts and not make films, but must remain in real estate. <br /> <br /> This is such an unconvincing film with such an unconvincing plot and the most contrived episodes in history. What offends me is not that the creators of this film are idiots, but the fact that they consider the film to be released is idiot enough to fall into this nonsense.
