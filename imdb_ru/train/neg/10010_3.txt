The plot should not be discussed, even if he hints at corruption, murder, power and other topics related to thrillers. Characters are interesting, although sometimes. Not realistic, but still interesting. <br /> <br /> Development is slow, like a tea ceremony. The visual effects are not great, but good enough to ease eye strain. A good movie to watch after dinner before bedtime is nothing too shocking, nothing too excited. Style comedy sitcom. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody - great performance. I had to deal with the inadequacy of the plot and do the work quite well. The rest is tolerant, but very predictable. In general, it is watchable and better than most TV shows.
