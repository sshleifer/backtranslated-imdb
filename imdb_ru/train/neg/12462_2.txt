I saw this movie last night after a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to constantly try to understand who is who and what all this means, you will hate this film. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to understand the roles of the actors. in this film, the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to truly empathize with any of the roles. <br /> <br /> For politicians and those who are interested in corruption in other governments of the world, this film Perhaps this is not bad, but for the average movie viewer this film is awkward, sometimes very boring, and you leave the cinema confused and annoyed - because you paid the entrance fee. 100% for every minute details or policies interest you. I donâ€™t see if you really enjoy watching movies.
