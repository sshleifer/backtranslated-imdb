I made this film in the hope that it will look like the merry "The Gamers" from Dead Gentlemen Productions (by the way, highly recommended). Boy, what a disappointment! The film was shot in this fake documentary style, which became famous for the office, but could not be delivered. The reason is partly in a tough game, but mostly in writing and directing. True, it may be fun to use every single cliché about role-playing games, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene you know what this “joke” will be about. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is depicted from above. There is nothing subtle in this film, if there were inscriptions "LAUGH NOW" or a cheap track in the style of the 80s, it would not matter much. In some scenes, you can't help but think: “Yes, I understand why they thought it would be funny,” but the way this is done takes away all the impulse from a possible joke.
