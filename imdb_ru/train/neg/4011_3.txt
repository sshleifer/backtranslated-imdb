For each series that goes on television, 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilot projects, and one, only one, actually does it for production. As a result of this selection process, we can believe that the end product must be a cream product, for some other reason, we could reject so many ideas to give us one television series. <br /> <br /> And so with True Blood; all the stars were in alignment, and what began as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a scene, a pilot, and finally a series. Unfortunately, sometimes this can be a long journey, and on this path there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and clean, and show that production people feel best for evaluations. Oh, how wrong they are so often ... <br /> <br /> True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has turned into one of the poorest storylines, worst characters and the dumbest plots, like anything in a recent television show stories. Its international composition of relatively unknown actors struggles to find their voices, but continues to stumble over their fake southern accents. Alan Boll's not-so-secret desire for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us a fresh, naked snapshot every week, although often this has nothing to do with the storyline. The character of Tara’s evil, dark-skinned woman cannot connect, and you discover that you secretly hope that the vampires will quickly remove her before she starts talking about suppressing whites by attending the ceremony for the Glorious Dead of the Confederation. Sam finds repressed love for Sookie, and suddenly we begin to believe that he needs to look after her morning, noon and night, despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship. <br /> <br /> With regard to Bill Vampire, his moral superiority quickly surrenders as soon as he can make love to Sookie and has no problems getting a quick bite to her (although she remains somewhat unscathed). We find that other vampires are not as popular as Bill, but they really want to be accepted by the public when they see life as Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> Despite all my efforts to suffer in the first six episodes, I came to the conclusion that no matter how long you watch a bad show, it’s still bad. Something dies for a reason, even vampires. Maybe this show should.
