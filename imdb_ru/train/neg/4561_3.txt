Trailers lead you to the film, but the film just wasn't worth my 8.50 ... it has some good effects, but the storyline ... yes, I love Tommy Lee Jones and will be a blacksmith as actors, they both made some good films, but I'm sorry they didn't add this to their resumes. To be honest, the book is better ..
