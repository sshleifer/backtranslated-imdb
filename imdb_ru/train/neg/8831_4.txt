Having heard so many people who rave about this film, I thought it was worth a try. Besides the fact that I am incredibly slow, to which I do not mind, while the wait is worth it, but it is not. As many others have said, there are so many discrepancies, and most of this film just doesn't sound believable. The reaction of these four men switches from shock, horror when searching for the body to complete indifference, while they catch fish. Of course, if they were one of those people who would like to fish, they would simply report their body and say that they only discovered it after a fishing trip. and then tell everyone that you found the body 2 days before? It is so difficult to watch a movie, knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so contradictory. As for the rest of the townspeople, you might think that at least one of them will show curiosity about the one who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked, except for panties .... what scenario leads to this? If she was raped, then why are still panties? If she was raped with clothes, then why take it off after the panties are closed? If she was not raped, then why remove all the clothes from her pants ... leaving yourself with the evidence to get rid of? I really can't come up with any realistic scenario that would lead to this, except to kill someone to steal his clothes, so that you can fill your clearance tray! Oh, well, it is watchable, but only fair and only because, despite the bad script, the game is strong.
