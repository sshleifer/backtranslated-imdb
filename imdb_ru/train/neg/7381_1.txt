Well, firstly, Seagal's voice is duplicated by about 50% of the film ... Why? Because, apparently, the script and the story corresponded during the filming, and they need to change his dialogue to continue the story, because they have several versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch your head, because the overlays are not only distracting, but also have no meaning. <br /> <br /> However, the story still sucks and makes no sense at all. When I got the end, I just scratched my head, because the film was so meaningless, and the ending didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. This movie made me stop watching Seagal right on the video, because they are getting worse and worse.
