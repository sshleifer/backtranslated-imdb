“Smile like yours” is a pitiful comedy that really doesn't make sense. I do not mean that the story was complicated, but the whole plot is based on one thing: desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children. People who have tried so hard have certainly forgotten about the type of adoption to which this film does not apply. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, a complete contradiction to everything that offers the women's liberation movement. , showing almost no sense of independence. She is a rather boring character, like a dreamy housewife, who has nothing in her head except children. Like the romantic comedy of the silly 50s, Greg Kinnear is her humble husband, who also shows no individuality, no independence, and no interest from us. <br /> <br /> These are the two most boring and often annoying characters, and they are hardly suitable for comedy scenes, in which there must be a lot of failures that may arise from the fact that the couple is doing everything possible to get pregnant . Except that they actually do nothing, except to go to an infertility clinic and put in a lot of money to do what they could do in their personal lives (except for this amount of in vitro fertilization). The plot hardly admits any setbacks, because the couple does nothing to create some strange situation. They just go to this clinic. So what? <br /> <br /> These scenes are intended to test the couple’s loyalty, a necessary moral element of the story, as the couple plans to conceive children together. Jennifer works in a new era store with her friend (played by Joan Cusack), and they are engaged in the development of aphrodhesiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays an interested buyer, and Jennifer is a promising negotiator at an attractive price for her and her friend. The plot hardly offers much to interest you (although Joan Cusack is quite funny in a restaurant). <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect who finds an opportunity to earn extra money to cover the hospital bills by taking a job in Seattle, where his boss is a rude seductress (also another hopeless, helpless woman) trying to influence Danny (no matter how stupid he is) to start a love affair with her when everything becomes comfortable. with him and his wife (for reasons I don’t want to give). Jill Hennessy is good at this role, but her character is too predictable, and too formal, as a much-needed element to create conflict for Danny. This is stupid and again, hardly interesting. <br /> <br /> The film itself is generally very boring and not at all funny (with the exception of the restaurant scene and the airline’s flight). The plot does not offer anything that really attracts attention. Even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive, the authors could find out some funny failures from this. Secondly, the main characters are completely boring. These are complete silhouettes of the silly comedies of the 1950s with a happy wife and an ignorant husband. Thus, even without the accidents present in the plot, the heroes themselves do not offer anything interesting, not to mention ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack was supposed to be in the lead, and someone else was supposed to take part Kinnira. Cusack would even make a crappy story incredibly funny (as she sometimes does in her lead role here). This is definitely one to refuse.
