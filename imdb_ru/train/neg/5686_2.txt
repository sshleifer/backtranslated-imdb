Hey. This is my first review of any movie I've seen. I did this to tell everyone that this is literally the most disgusting film I've ever seen. I feel that the film was made in an amicable way, and I will give some insight due to budgetary constraints on its creation. I felt that I was watching a very bad remake of the film. What I can agree with, I also saw very clearly, but I really liked how I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The scene where he puts the hammer to the head of the bound victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene I've ever seen. The scene lasted almost forever, well, actually, it was about 5 minutes, but still. I want to point out that I like some horror films, and I give my due, if they are good. this director, Uwe Boll, and his group of people who made this film should think before doing another one like this one. Last note, ha ha! FOR ALL THE PEOPLE horror Go with a more budget film, as seen, for example. I can not believe that people actually make such films. In any case, sorry everyone who loves Uwe Boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion on the film.
