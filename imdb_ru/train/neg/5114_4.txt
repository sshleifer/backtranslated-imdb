This film was bad. Bad game, bad direction, bad writing. But it was not bad in a funny way. It was badly boring. I watched "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. There was no Do not make the mistake I made. There are many more pleasant ways to spend an hour and a half, such as observing paint drying or reading a dictionary. Seriously.
