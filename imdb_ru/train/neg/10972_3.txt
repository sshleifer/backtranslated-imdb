It was not a Trainspot film or Guy Ritchie. It was a great imitator. He wanted to be a sharp, nervous laugh, a film confirming the city life, but itâ€™s rather a camera passage, a mess. It is much easier to imitate something different than to create a real story with real characters. From the very beginning I did not care about the characters or what they were doing. They always beat, wrote or cried at each other. Only there was no substance in what they were doing. The dialogue between the characters should be frank, frank, instead it becomes commonplace, and one scene after another is predictable. I know that there are viewers who really liked this film, so I could be wrong.
