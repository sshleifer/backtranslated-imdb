I do not care how many nominations this garbage received for the best and that, and this film is smelly. I did not know whether to turn off the TV or file a lawsuit with lawyer O.J. for improper damage to my mental health. I rarely get so bored; calling it dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie goer across the planet. The whole story was stupid, acting was boring, the “drama” was unemotional. I am grateful that I did not have to pay for this unsatisfactory experience.
