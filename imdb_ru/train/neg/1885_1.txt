If you are looking for a film that tells about the senseless and boring existence of the middle class, entangled in the web of non-communication and false ideals, then this film is for you. If you are also interested in the film and keep your interest, then you probably should look for something else. There are a lot of movies that make it so much better. For example, try some of the darker films of Bergman. The filmmaker believed that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he should expose the viewer to one painfully boring and meaningless incident after another, until the film finally reaches its painful and pitiful demise. If you value your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours, for example, to clean your house.
