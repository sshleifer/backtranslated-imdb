My single-line summary should explain all this, but I will try. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, this film seemed like an unnecessary soap opera, and that's all I can comment on. There were several interesting scenes, such as “The Big One”, which appeared in the middle of the film, but wait, this ? Earthquake * is choking *, wait a minute! This is Dante Peak! Well, this is partly disfigured and hit. I can't believe how bad this film was made, “borrowing” scenes from other, much better films. Interestingly, according to the director, the viewers are so stupid as to believe that there are large mountainous wooded backgrounds in downtown Los Angeles, at the peak of Al Dante. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget about Bond Bath, Nash, in this movie. and go for the real thing (again, someone with Pick Dante is coincidentally.) <br /> <br />
