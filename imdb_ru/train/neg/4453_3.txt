I am sure that for people who are watching this move outside of Britain, this film will be interesting, but for someone from the UK this is painful because of his mistakes. <br /> <br /> At the very beginning of the film, Elijah Wood receives from a tube at a coast station, which was destroyed. He says to his sister, with whom he meets: "What happened here," and she replies: "Oh, Tottenham, I was in the city yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in the city ... they are part of the city, they do not need to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans, the last place on earth they would do was the bank station, which probably has more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are several other similar mistakes, but the biggest setback for me is the actor who plays the main hooligan. He clearly decided that he should not try to speak with an East End accent, and instead chose a Dick Van Dyck mockup that made my ears bleed. This was underscored by the fact that the rest of his gang spoke as you expect from West Ham fans. This mistake made him incredible in the role and really spoiled the movie.
