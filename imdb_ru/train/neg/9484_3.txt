If I have to give this film an estimate on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low rating of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was interesting, and there are some good things that can be said about the movie. <br /> <br /> Candidate for psychiatrists James Bishop is sent to St. Andrews hospital for his resident, and he is very concerned about the desire to change the world. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning in the film you know that the evil truth is hiding in the hospital, but James thinks that he can make a difference and does not recognize this evil. <br /> <br /> History is built quite well, you always know that the fact that patients tell about some evil evil is true, and you wonder when and how James finds out about it. In addition, when a break comes, evil people hunt James, and you feel some anxiety until the “battle” is over. <br /> <br /> Add an innocent beautiful girl who arrives at the wrong time and other standard elements of horror, and you get a picture. <br /> <br /> The character build-up is actually pretty good, you know most of the dead people, some of whom you “recognize”. <br /> In the film, an unpleasant scene unfolds, it is also well done. There are secrets that are revealed in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, James, is very believable - the story of how an impatient student begins to work is good in this setting. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie: * Stupid special effects - the modern version of "Plan 9 from space" (bad) (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad game (or perhaps very few duplicates when shooting ) - The main characters sometimes act poorly and sometimes well. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I continued to think: “I could have made such a film with a home video camera.”
