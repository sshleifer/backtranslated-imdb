After watching the 2004 Canadian / Icelandic / British production Beowulf & Grendel, which I consider brilliant and terrific, I approached this â€” the first of 3 new Beowulf films to be released this year with trepidation. As soon as I heard the Viking and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were the migration eras, the Swedes and the Danes, and not the Vikings (they appeared later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns allow your enemy to easily knock off your helmet and then hit you with brains). Then there is the Hrolfgarh Palace, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, and not about the 6th century Denmark. Swords and armor look like props, left in earlier films, shot in different historical periods. I noticed a weapon that could be used by the crusaders in Kingdom of Heaven, and one of the heroes even held a sword in the movie Beowulf and Grendel with a reproduction of the movie Winch! In addition to the main plot of the original epic poem, the work was grim, and the action is completely wooden and unconvincing. The biggest bow was a crossbow with a secret weapon, with an aiming sight and exploding shells, which looked like something bought from Iraqi rebels. A monster with special effects and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never tear his hand off, as he did in the poem. Thanks to the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I will not.
