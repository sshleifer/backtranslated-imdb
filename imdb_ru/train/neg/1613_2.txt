Now that Che (2008) has finished his relatively short Australian film screening (a very limited release: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can join the presenters of “Into the Cinema” without any guilt, taking Steven Soderbergh on a mission. <Br /> <br /> As a rule, it’s nice to watch the director change his style / theme, but in a recent mockery of Soderbergh, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), there was also a lack of history, so the narration (and editing?) Seems to be suddenly became a Soderberg affair. main problem Strange, after more than 20 years in business. He probably never was good at narration, he just hid it well in “sharp” projects. <br /> <br /> None of this justifies his current, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, "the two parts of Che do not (even) form a single whole." <br /> <br /> An epic biopic in name only, Che (2008) can hardly be called a feature film! This, of course, has no legs, because, with the exception of its uncharacteristic final resolution, imposed on it by history, the 4.5-hour drift of Soderbergh simply does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more condescending Australian company The The Movies. the duo, commented on the recurring waste of Soderberg (HD digital storage): "you are in the forest ... you are in the forest ... you are in the forest ...". I am also surprised that Soderberg did not give us 2.5 more hours of IT somewhere between his two existing parts, because he still did not take into account huge chunks of the “revolutionary” life of Che! <br /> <br /> For a biographical portrait of an important but notorious historical figure, Soderberg recklessly pushes away, if not intentionally insults, his audience. <br /> <br /> 1. Never tell most of Che's story; <br /> <br /> 2. the imposition of unreasonable lengths of a film with simple blunt repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. ignoring both the true view of the past and the narration of events; <br /> <br /> 4. barely developing an idea or character; <br /> <br /> 5. the rest of the claustrophobia is episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. ignoring the proper context for the scenes - everything we get falls into destructive time shifts; <br /> <br /> 7. linguistically shifts all audiences (even Spanish speakers will be embarrassed by inappropriate expositions in English); and <br /> <br /> 8. it is meaningless to bleach its main subject in one dimension. Why, at this late stage? The franchise t-shirt was a success! <br /> <br /> Our sense of claustrophobia is certainly due to the fact that Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen base their scenario solely on Guevara's memoirs. Thus, like a poor student who read only ONE of his selected texts for his assignment, Soderberg's product is extremely limited in perspective. <br /> <br /> The audience is captured in the same limited knowledge, circumstances and circumstances of the “revolutionaries”, but this does not cause us sympathy. On the contrary, it comes to us that "Ah, Soderberg is trying to fake his audience in the same way as Latin American peasants at that time." But these are the same illiterate Latin American peasants who sold a good doctor to their enemies. Why does Soderberg feel the need to equate us to them and keep us equally mentally captive? Such humility in the audience should have a goal. <br /> <br /> Part2 is more chronological than Part1, but it literally stuns you with its repeated beating of bushes, the sufferings of worldview and the lack of diversity or character arcs. Che Deltoro does not have the capacity to grow as a person while he struggles to train his own poorly disciplined troops. The only disappointment is humor, since Che has to deal with his sometimes deeply ignorant "revolutionaries", some of whom lack self-control around local peasants or food. We, of course, do not understand what caused the conditions, and do not conduct any strategic analysis of their partisan insurgency, as it was. <br /> <br /> The painful countdown of Part2 remains scary episodic: again, nothing is wired or connected to the context. Thus, even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demian Bichir) are unexpected and confusing. Any selected events are depicted minimally and Latin-centric, with the replacement of the interviews of part 1 with the meetings of the corrupt Bolivian President (Joaquim de Almeida) and US government officials promising CIA intervention (!). <br /> <br /> The rest of the “forest” parts and the blue cyan filter of part 2 simply annoy the audience until they look at the exits. <br /> <br /> DelToro may have overreacted the frustration of many non-American Hispanics because they never get the true, untwisted story of Che's exploits in their own countries. When foreign governments still don’t provide a free press to their people — for whatever reason — then you can see how a popular American indie producer can be made tempted by not reading so well (“I can't be able to read or write, but NOT illiterate! "- Wed The Inspector General (1949) goes to his local cinemas. Obvious disregard for the film and gross oversimplification greatly hint that it is aimed only at understanding the less informed WHO STILL SAYS A LITTLE ENGLISH If they had done this, they would have already read volumes on this topic and criticized the corresponding social problems among themselves - by studying the lessons of history as they should. <br /> <br /> Such an understanding is just what society is still what is needed - and not only the remaining illiterate Latin Americans of Central and South America - but this is what Che (2008) is happily unable to provide. Soderberg hides his leadership because he speaks poorly. I am stunned why Benicio Deltoro deliberately chose Soderberg for this project if he knew it. It has been 44 years, and I really wanted to remember about Guevara: this is what I went to see this film for, but the director devilishly takes it away from us. <br /> <br /> David Stratton, writing in the Australian language (October 3, 2009) noted that while part 1 was “uneven,” part 2 actually “quickly goes down”, “describing in detail Che’s last campaign Bolivia ", which" ... seems almost unbearably slow and tight. " <br /> <br /> Che: “Partisan”, aka Part2, is certainly not a journey for Bolivia, painting it with a picture of unhappiness and atavism. The entire second half is redeemed only by the aforementioned humor, and dramatic - but tragic - by the capture and execution of the subject of the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of this infinite cinematic faith is just confusing, annoying suffering. Fortunately for the film Soderberga, which should be avoided at all costs. This should break the hearts of all who know at least a little about the subject. (2/10)
