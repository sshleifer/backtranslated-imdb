I'm 17 years old, and I still love most of Scooby-Doo movies and old episodes. I like the films of the 1990s, and recently we enjoyed one of Scooby Doo’s best direct DVD performances of this decade, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which I didn’t expect to be as good as they were. In any case, go back to get the key! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw, it didn’t impress me at all. First of all, I hated animation. It was flat, flat and very Saturday morning - a caricature - standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows that I really hate had a little better animation. Worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes when Scooby-Doo was positively good. I also hated character changes, because it seemed that instead of solving the mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superheroes, which they would never have done in the movie or in “Scooby-Doo, where are you?”. show. The thematic melody was also not very good, I don’t even remember it, and the jokes were flimsy and far-fetched. However, I admit that there is a very talented cast if they had the best material, and they didn’t say that it would sound as original as humanly possible, which I could add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was terrible, and I am not trying to discredit it, this is what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
