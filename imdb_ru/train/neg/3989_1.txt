Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song, while at the same time portraying an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his offended wife in the locker room, the song performed with lyrical content is as loud as the dialogue, so no one hears, weakening any emotional impact that the scene could have. The scenes when Annabella beat her father with fists, a lamp, and then a belt were so caricatured that they seemed absurd. This entire film is a cartoon, impetuous prejudice against whites is literally amazing. The discussion of black women after Flipper's wife finds out that he was cheating on her with a white woman — as if it was a discussion in the Oxford discussion group, is ridiculous. Unrestrained racism could endure, but the soundtrack and sound mixing during this “movie” is too much. It was a technically poorly made film. There is no understanding of the main craft of filmmaking, the sound track, the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this film afloat. I really felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he accepted the role in this film - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first film that I saw with this director, and he will be my last.
