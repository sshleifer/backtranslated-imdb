This film really has no beginning or end. And this is really VERY incredible. Mary-K and Ashley should be interns working in the post office of an Italian fashion company. But for some reason they are located in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Colosseum), and all the other interns with whom they work look just as abnormal as they are. One thing that I found apparent in this film is the way one of the twins does not end up with a guy. I guess they tried to change their usual plot a bit. Nice try.
