Well, where should I start my story ?? Tonight I went to this film with several friends who did not know more than the actors who were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I realized during the first 20 minutes, What a bad decision I made when I saw this movie. The plot was crap, like the script. The lines were terrible to such an extent that people in the audience were laughing hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could not be more plastic. Even some scenes seemed such that they should have been done much faster ... as if they were dragged in for no particular reason. Very bad editing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
