This movie seems to have sent the wrong message. There may be morality without the use of Christ. I think that people from other religions can go to heaven. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week, but I disagree with such Christian arrogance. This is the worst time travel movie I've ever seen, and I saw Timeline.
