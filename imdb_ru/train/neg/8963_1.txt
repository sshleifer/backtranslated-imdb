The killings in this movie are not so scary, but the movie is for sure. It is even worse than that. Itâ€™s not even worth the wear and tear that can occur when you insert it into a DVD player. <br /> <br /> Even the wear it causes on your shoulders is carried away from the DVD store, not to mention the money and time you spend renting and watching. Awful. <br /> <br /> It is not clear how anyone can say something positive about this film. It was only my masochistic tendency, because of which I did not stop watching, adding to this the pressure from my partners. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is terrible, the direction is even worse, and the action is just despicable. <br /> <br /> I hope you do not regard this as something that spoils your fun, I would rather consider it a fair warning: do not waste time watching this garbage!
