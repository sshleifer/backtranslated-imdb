Oh my god, what's going on? movie uwe boll and positive reviews? Wow <br /> <br /> It is pleasant to note that the majority of positive reviews come from newcomers to Boll's work. I myself, as I said in previous reviews by Uwe Boll, watch his films only in the hope that one day he will really do something good. I mean ... THIS MUST BE ONE DAY! <br /> <br /> Alas, the Seed is not that day. I don’t really know where to start the unsuccessful attempt of the horror film “Seed”. People need to remember that all the patients in the world are due to watching various acts of the disease on video or online ... or, according to Mr. Ball. I still can not understand why in the first 10 minutes of this film materials about the cruel treatment of animals and murders were shot. I understand the concept that Seed (the murderer) is sick and loves to watch such things ... but I cannot understand why Mr. Ball thought that inserting REAL frames into a film would work. Can shock us? Hmmm ... well, I, for one, am not squeamish and can handle when I see something on the tape. I do NOT, however, find the use of real animal cruelty videos funny in the least. If you tried to shock me, it didn't work. It just reminded me of how the world got confused, because such things happen, and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making films. This kind of context may have worked for films in the 70/80s (Cannibal Holocaust), but not for today's market. <br /> <br /> After that, we can move on to the fact that Uwe managed to make the film very cheap, like that of BloodRayne 2. You can simply say that there wasn’t a lot of money floating around for production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Boll doesn’t really care to make a decent story, as we are treated to boring shots of policemen watching various videos of the Seed victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends with an accelerated decomposition of the victim. This is all very boring and tedious. I will not comment on the scene for kids, as it is funny and just another cheap “shock” factor. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit through the first 25 minutes, you will be seen by police officers walking through a very dark house to catch the Seed. The lighting here is terrible, and Uwe has the old fiasco “I don’t use a steady camera” that he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch the police die when everyone grows stupid, until the Seed is caught. This scene is so damn stupid that you have to see it to believe it. In fact, the policeman tells Semyon that he could have shot him. For some unknown reason, the policeman does not shoot him. Given that the Seed is a patient who kills both children and adults, at this point in the scenario you might think that the meaning will prevail. <br /> <br /> From here we turn to the stupid scene of execution, and then the police bury the Seed alive (and they know that he is alive ... why not shoot him in the head ????), after which the Seed comes out from the ground, and then kills some random woman with a hammer, and then kidnaps him from a policeman’s family. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to convey to you all that is just stupid! This is not even a Hollywood horror dull .... just stupid. Uwe Boll can not send ****. Anyone who has a taste will agree with this statement. Anyone who watches this movie and finds it interesting in one form or another should take a serious look at himself as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again we turn to the poorly operating, directed, lighted, produced, scripted fragment of UB shit.
