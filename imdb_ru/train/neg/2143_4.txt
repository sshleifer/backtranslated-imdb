I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and I always loved her so much that the tape was a bit worn out. <br /> <br /> Accordingly, I was glad to see that Cinderella 2 was on TV and I would be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This film joins the club of sequels that should be left alone. It contains absolutely nothing of the original super charm! It seems to me that this is rather crude and almost brutal, starting with “not singing out” and ending with a characteristic. <br /> <br /> Although I remember how a character tells a story through a song, the soundtrack of this film was laid on top, and seemed not to fit. Jacques’s transformation into a person is a prime example: when he walked, ate an apple and added a few small pointed remarks, he had to dance around and sing about how great it was to be tall! And in the ballroom there is old country music. As if the authors have forgotten where and when this story was made. Optimistic violins, of course, did not fit. <br /> <br /> Even artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 does not quite match the original. The work in this film seems rather crude and less detailed. And we see part of the Cinderella's hoop skirt, which seems wrong. <br /> <br /> The film itself could have been its own story, I think it should be so. I would not say that I hate it, but I believe that he had many shortcomings. It seems that much lower than that of the beloved original Cinderella.
