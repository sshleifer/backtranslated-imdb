The world's biggest joke. The largest in the world, the most exclusive joke in the world. <br /> <br /> Emulating the bold and humorous humor of office space, this film makes you think about this film, making the humor so that it is only properly assessed by legal secretaries, I write books. The audience is asked to take on the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary, and then empathize with a painfully stupid protagonist. <br /> <br /> The whole film is dedicated to ensuring that the legal secretary finds free time, listen to music and write a novel while it works. These are his goals. You can't imagine a slap in the face of an audience when (about halfway through) they find out that he had a job that met all three criteria, but then they left her! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornblut and Josh Kornbljut) completely eliminate the motivation of the audience to empathize or even find an entertaining protagonist who previously threw out that he complains about his absence. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main stumbling block, the legal adviser to the humor secretary fails, because they must be explained to the audience every time they happen. Without this, the audience would not notice anything particularly strange. Humor is effective only if it does not need to be carefully explained to the audience, which is ridiculous.
