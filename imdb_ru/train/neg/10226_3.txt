“Don't watch this movie” is the best advice if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. It was a huge disappointment, given the great cast, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was just nothing, of course, quite different from the one described on the VHS box, of course. There simply was no waiting, precious little excitement and too many dull spots, most of them trying to show why Nellie (Monroe) was so spoiled. It was a bad role for Monroe, although I did not need to see this character in order to understand that she could act. One "Some Like It Hot" was good enough proof for me. But this role simply did not suit her, and it is not surprising that this was not one of her most popular films. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is a pity that the film lost the talents of such actors as Richard Widmark, Ann Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Gene Cagney, Donna Cochran and others. <br /> <br /> Short description: this is not an entertainment program, but the name of the game is entertainment.
