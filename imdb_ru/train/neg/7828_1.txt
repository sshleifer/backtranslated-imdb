Along with 2 days in the Valley, I think this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Just another long line of Tarantino robberies that appeared after "Pulp Fiction." The atmosphere created by the film is fun for the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make an unforgivable mistake by allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to raise the coefficient of the hip. You better skip this one.
