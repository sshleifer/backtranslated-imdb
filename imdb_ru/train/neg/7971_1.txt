I'm not sure who writes these brilliant reviews of this film, but believe me, STKINKS. I saw hundreds of horror films and slashers, and this film is LAME, it lasted only 80 minutes, and believe me, that’s all I could take. The plot is terrible, acting is even worse. And there is no development at all. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau’s films are better than this. Run away from JIGSAW. I expected to hate acting, which can be forgiven right in the video, if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> This is not a scarecrow, very little Horus, <br /> <br /> and a really unattractive cast. <br /> <br /> I watched this with three other friends <br /> <br /> who I hope are still talking to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to throw the disc out the window. I cannot believe that someone could <br /> <br /> give this deception a good overview.
