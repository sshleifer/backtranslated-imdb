This is probably one of the worst French films I have ever seen, among the more than 100 French films I have ever seen. A terrible script and a very media / unprofessional acting game force an impotent director. nor does it matter how pleasant the western French scene and unusual music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the key weaknesses of this film is that these two characters DO NOT attract people, like Audience I do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was struck by how this film won the Cannes Jury Prize, man, I love almost all the films awarded at Cannes but not this one A big disappointment for me.
