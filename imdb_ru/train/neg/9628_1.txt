It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The DVD was provided to me for free with an order I placed on the Internet for non-DVD related items. <br /> <br /> No wonder that they were given away, of course, no one could part with the money for this nonsense. <br /> As some reviewers may say that they found it with the cheerful conviction of beggars, a person who includes it in the worst five films that have ever received it. <br /> <br /> How talented is the actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman? may be involved in this garbage incredibly. Basically toilet humor and bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to have fun should avoid it at all costs.
