I thank God that I did not go to the movies for this movie. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I could not believe my eyes. I wonder if any movie could be worse than that. they spent millions of dollars on this film for nothing. terrible game and terrible script. I think that other people who wrote comments are people working in this film company;) This is a very big fiasco! in 2000 they can still laugh at this movie? ... embarrassing
