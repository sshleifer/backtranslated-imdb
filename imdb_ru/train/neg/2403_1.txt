Whack !!! I got this film because it was Elizabeth Hartman. I was disappointed to learn that she was in two short scenes at the end. In addition, all the time I pressed the fast forward button. Some teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his father, he is bitten by a wolf, and he turns into a werewolf if the full moon comes. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years ago, but he does not age a bit and enters high school. There he meets a shy teacher, whom he bites, and then has children. This film sucks, and I do not recommend it to anyone. Instead, read War and Peace. Only Miss Hartman did a great job. Check out very young Bob Saghet in this!
