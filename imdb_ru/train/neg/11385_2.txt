Before I begin, let me say that my perception of this film could have been affected by duplication, which, as I understand from other comments, was original, which some consider to be incomplete. Thus, it is possible that the subtitles or obviously the new version of the DVD will matter. I also did not read the relevant book; I know only one other Japanese manga, and perhaps I lack the cultural context. <br /> <br /> Potential secondary spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I usually like science fiction stories with a dark undertone (for example, Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), But I didn’t like this film at all. While it started out slightly intriguing, it became tedious by the time it was only half finished. There are all kinds of problems; let's start with what is probably the most serious: dialogue. Characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they don’t shout each other’s names for the nth time, they usually grunt like monosyllables (“Kanedaaa!”, “Tetsuoooo!”, “A?”, “Grrr”, etc.). This leaves most characters completely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It does not help at all that many of them get only a few minutes of screen time, and at the same time they will not say anything interesting that could develop them away from the stereotypes offered by visual effects. <br /> <br /> The grumble is complemented by some random pseudo-philosophical inscription that sounds vague and does not inspire even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems random, randomly assembled from different pieces and pieces of standard science fiction ideas without any coherence. <br /> <br /> What is not enough of an understandable plot? no more than an excuse to start a too long final sequence, which consists of an escalation of scenes of destruction and destruction. Of course, it’s not that something is wrong with good chaos and destruction; but in this case you will find yourself asking "what is the meaning of all this and how long until it ends." Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of a little more than turning Tetsuo into Pizza Hatta for some strange reason. <br /> <br /> The ending resembles the end of 2001 - a bizarre series of images that are far from solving or explaining something, leave the viewer feeling that he is simply looking at the kaleidoscope for two hours. I’m sure some will argue that such things are art; but for me it was just a lot of imaginary use of colors and shapes. (Some of the music was also quite interesting). Unfortunately, this is all style and does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated films that intellectually address “adult” topics? I am sad to say that you will most likely find such things in South Park.
