This film, no correction, this is THING, this terrible abomination from the burning pits of hell had to be killed before it even left the writer's head. I could not come up with enough adjectives to describe this film. But let's try anyway. Awful, bad, nauseous, tasteless, crap, causing vomiting, terribly bad gut, disgusting, nasty, putrid, words are simply not enough in English! The “plot” includes a serial killer who becomes a snow man. Do not ask how it does not matter. Killer snowman runs, killing people. How, you ask, can a snowman kill someone? Tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes, at least so that you no longer have to endure this foam snowman. Thus, you will want to fill your ears with hot wax, so that you no longer have to endure his snow quibbles. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it on the spot! For the sake of your very soul do not look!
