I entered this film, thinking it would be a neat football drama (in the same vein as Remember the Titans); however, I left, feeling that I had just attended Ted Haggard's sermon on the rapture. The only thing missing was a request for tithing at the end of the film. In fact, it would be possible to get more from the preaching of a television browser than this is a bad excuse for entertainment. At least, with the televangelista preaching, there are quotes from Scripture, not quotes from the popular self-help mass. The plot was too predictable to such an extent that anyone with a sufficiently long period of attention could lay out the entire plot during the first 15 minutes of the film.
