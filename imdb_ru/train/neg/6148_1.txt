Firstly, the film is not true. I only saw a documentary a few days earlier, and the film was not something like that. First of all, Nash was a genius in mathematics, and this is what the film should have been, not a story about a man who was healed, who found love at the end, and so on. There are also many scenes that were simply wrong — the scene where he rode a bicycle on campus occurred in his early years at university, not after him. In my opinion, Russell Crowe didn’t fit this role at all, as he doesn’t look like an intelligent / individualistic type, so he really couldn’t play one. It would be great if he focused more on mathematics (like Pi), and not on the overly dramatized love life. At this level, ABM was too Hollywood and too superficial to be great. Personally, I think that he was not insane and not paranoid, and he was on something, as people of this level, as a rule, know more than we, "lesser mortals." 5/10
