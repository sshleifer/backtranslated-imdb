I can't believe that in the 34 previous comments no one mentioned that this film is the blatant robbery of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring a supposedly stupid blonde to the demands of a gangster. Hired pistol and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster remained in trouble. But Born yesterday was a sensible treatment, whereas this is just fluff. Transferring technicol to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Calmus rolls over in the grave. Check out the newsboy. Recognize him? But it is historically interesting to see the roots of rock and roll. It is also interesting acquaintance Ewell with CinemaScope, a new format at that time.
