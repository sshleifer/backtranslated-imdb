Who am I? No, I'm not joking. This is what actually says video case. short version: a beautiful woman is standing around smiling. For some reason, it makes all men kill each other. <br /> <br /> “Find Ariel ... Where is Ariel ... I can't find Ariel ...” She's right behind you, idiot ... <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this terrible little Cosmic Opera has already been said, it seems. <br /> <br /> A bunch of banal actors, playing mostly convicted, comes after the first selection of actors gets off very quickly. Then they get off in the same way. Each scene is broadcast in approximately fifteen minutes. Perhaps it was a drawing of a straw to see which actors have the most screen time and salary. The alien virus / hologram / VR witch / crash seems to be physically impotent and does nothing. Why can't she just stay at the computer instead of doing the vampire teleportation routine? (Actually, it would be more interesting if she was a vampire or did more than just stand looking at people, and that’s all she ever did. That's enough for all men to kill each other. Go figure. ..) <br /> <br /> This is not a space film. There are much more shots of the old western trail, the 1950s Easy Rider trail, Film noir nightclub scenes, even jogging on a beach in a fantasy country, none of which have any real depth or even no meaning. Of course, the nightclub scene is black and white. Worked with The Wizard of Oz. This is not very good. This is probably a good thing, as the few pictures they show from space are frustratingly stupid. At these moments, you are likely to cry, especially when you see this circling "spaceship", which looks about three inches long. <br /> <br /> None of the characters feel anything, not because they are convicted or have no personality, but because they seriously need acting classes, with the exception of Billy Dee Williams, who really looks depressed and confused probably in this work ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that, when viewed with friends, will cause some kind of extremely “loud” silence, especially when the nerd throws off his attempt at funny lines (including about a french kiss to a meteor ...? i heard it? ver but? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original girls of virtual reality are “killed”, which means nothing, because they are not even real from the very beginning. Well, there are no other "characters" either, but that's not the point. Haha <br /> <br /> What is funny is that the scene that adorns the video is something like an alien horror-skull (a green filter has been added on top of it to make it more attractive. ... e uh ... green look), which is actually an android after it was killed, and ultimately has nothing to do with something else. <br /> <br /> Another weird deal I noticed. Whenever an explosion occurs (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes heavily pixelated. I do not mean SMALL pixelated, I mean HUGE blocks of about 1/16 of the screen size. Wow.
