Anemic comedy-drama, unhappy, seemingly hurried story in which Cher plays like a housewife-sorrow who slowly made friends with the killer hired to kill her from her husband. Chazz Palminteri, being a talkative hired gun, adapted the script from his own play with staged settings and a back-and-forth dialogue that quickly tires eyes and hearing. The air of darkness looms over the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky cannot pull Cher out of her eternal funk (she is sluggish). Despite all the major talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), “Faithful” is fraudulent, with no plot or characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 of ****
