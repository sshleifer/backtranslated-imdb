These reviews, which claim that this film is so bad that it is good, go too far with that. This movie is nothing bad that Leonard had Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli. These films were interesting for their horror, but this pile of dinosaur manure is so bad it hurts. It hasn't hurt so much to watch a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I begin the review, let me tell you a story. Theodore Rex went bankrupt by $ 35 million. Cinema "New Line" refused to shoot in cinemas. They cut losses by sending it straight into the video, making it the most expensive movie for the video in decades. Whoopie surrendered to be in this catastrophe after a huge salary. <br /> <br /> Plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so that he can launch rockets into the sun that will kill humanity and start a new ice age. A policewoman named Cathy Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly come together to stop him after the death of a dinosaur playmate. <br /> <br /> The plot is given to you at the beginning of the film, which robs the film of all its secrets. Then you have to deal with the fact that this film is actually quite terrible. Whoopi looks worried and tries to succeed, but to no avail. Theodore Rex is simply annoying, and his awkward behavior is exhausted after five minutes on the screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him, threatening to bite people and hit people with a tail (by accident or on purpose). I thought the Robber was bad, but he was taking a back seat for Theodore Rex: the worst movie in Whoopiâ€™s career. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you that this monster is bad enough to be fun. I did not see this when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people who must have experienced some kind of painful admiration for the film Howard Duck. Humor is on this level, and Theodore Rex looks like Barbie's inbred cousin. Absolutely painful from start to finish.
