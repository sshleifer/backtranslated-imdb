Tony Scott directs a sports thriller that should attract not even a sports fan. And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too slow. Cheer up well! From the outside, he looks like a disgruntled salesman (Robert De Niro), and on the inside he is a psychotic San Francisco Giants fan. Along comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and an appointed savior from depression. Our salesman carries a deadly obsession, when the bangs of all the stars fall into the worst decline in his career, and the Giants are afraid to collapse with him. De Niro personifies terror. Snipes looks very natural, like a baseball player. Other celebrities in the cast are: still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent ... so enjoy. Violence and a very strong language should be expected, and you will get your money.
