I have to admit, I don’t remember much about characters or stories, although I’m not sure what it was, I was so annoyed with this film that it was difficult for me to focus on it. How can you name the movie “Keys of Tulsa” and then shoot it in Texas? The flat desert country around Arlington (I think it was so) is in no way like the green hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa will have a much more pleasant life in the area. Tulsa, otherwise they would understand how nothing in the film even looks like it. Has anyone ever seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know this sounds meticulously, but I can't help it. I watched it because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not revive this winding story and the vile story of self-appointed people who are NOT IN TULSE !! Sorry, shooting in Oklahoma could not be more expensive. What if Living and Dying in Los Angeles was filmed in Toronto? Does it suck? Well, so is this.
