The old axiom that boring people are boring people is well demonstrated in "Women in Love". The script, taken from the novel by D.H. Lawrence, contains an endless stream of concepts that are, at best, sofomorian. <br /> <br /> What a pity that so much effort was spent on such a meaningless exercise; which empty character array is given such attention. Despite its high production value, this film seems as tedious as its staff. <br /> <br /> The 2001 revision only confirms the impression of the juvenile mind of 1969 on adult bodies, lounging and staggering the way at every stage.
