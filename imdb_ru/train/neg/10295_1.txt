There are many pretentious people who will pretend that this is endowed with some wonderful meaning, and that such ignorant fools like me do not understand this. Obviously, this means that we must stick to the Hollywood dross. <br /> <br /> It contains all the artistic clichés - I think it’s good that the director is one of the few chosen ones. Almost self parody, drowned in its own pretense. <br /> <br /> The director of the (almost equally embarrassing) film “Ratcatcher” returns with another piece buried in artistic nonsense; it is difficult to understand, and, obviously, this study of alienation. The best way to describe this film is alienation for its viewers.
