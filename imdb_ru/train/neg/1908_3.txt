Another insult and a slap in the face to gays everywhere. This unsuccessful comedy attempt has nothing to recommend it. Once again, we have an attractive “direct” hero who, presumably, cannot make any woman interested in him. Yes, right! And we are also presented with a "sympathetic, attractive" gay friend, who is actually a fat, balding, ugly old man, whom the leadership must find attractive. Even I did not find him attractive, and I am a fat, ugly old man (but, fortunately, not balding)! Whatever acting talent was here, he was thrown back in a bad scenario and a truly awful direction. Mr. Snedeker should be removed from the cinema, but then he is no different from the countless other hacks working in Hollywood.
