I was skeptical when I first saw an advertisement for Calvin Kline-esque, but I thought that I would give her a chance. So, I watched it, and all I can say is bluff. This film was very bad. Rarely do I hate a movie so much. Watching this movie reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman's Player, when the writers tell the producers their weird ideas. I would like to know which MTV producer decided that adapting the Bronte music video for one and a half hours (but this time Hitcliffe is called Hit, and he is a rock star, and Hindley is called Hendrix) would be a good idea. /> <br /> Even if it weren’t so bad, if they hadn’t understood all the other aspects of the film so horribly wrong. It must have been the direction “you are alone, blow me.” I laughed out loud during all the "serious" scenes and I was bored throughout the rest. The camera work was uneven and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie, trying to be harsh. My theory is that the engineer was bored and he went to the beach to drink beer with his boom - all I could hear in half of the scenes were the waves. And in other scenes, I would like it to be all that I could hear. And speaking of sound, what they did with the Sisters of Mercy song “More” is absolutely unforgivable, but again, it’s unforgivable what they did with Bronte. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was one entertaining scene — in particular, at the moment when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl’s face — and if you can tell me that this scene was related to the rest of the story, more strength for you.
