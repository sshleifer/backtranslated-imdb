Breaking this film apart is like shooting a barrel. It's too easy. Therefore, I am going to challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of the Little Man. First, I am impressed with the special effects. It really looked like Marlon Wayans head was attached to the body of a little man. I have not doubted it for a minute. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I liked some unexpected cameos. David Alan Greer played an annoying singer in a restaurant, and his performances of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Father Greer in Boomerang in 1992 (if you remember, he “coordinated” a mushroom belt with a mushroom jacket), now plays Vanessa's father in “Little Man”. So it was fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is about as believable as White Chicks. How stupid is it when even a doctor cannot say that this is a 40-year-old man and not a child? He has a full set of teeth !!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that this is not a child? Little Man is so bad that there is Rob Schneider's cameo. And please, if you are stupid enough to spend $ 8 on this film, at least do me a favor and don’t bring your children. This film is too sexy for small children (a lot of jokes and misunderstandings about sex, leaving the house, eating out, etc.), and I was ashamed of the parents who brought their children to view, which I had to endure. If you insist on watching an idiotic movie, at least save your children from pain and suffering.
