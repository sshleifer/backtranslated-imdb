I'm trying to decide whether jumping into a woodcutter is more enjoyable than this thing. This ends the destruction of what was once a classic pair of films. With the Jedi, the threats, the clowns and the Siths, we end Lucas's career. He wants us to swallow Annakin, is this Vader's nonsense? I never believed that to be true. This film confirms these feelings. The story hasn't worked since the days of the Ghost Moron, and each new film just saved up shit until all that was left was a toy parade. I have to go. I know where there are a few new stones. Do you want spoilers? Here they go. Luke and Leia are NOT affiliated. Vader is not their father. Duke Contu had to go to the other side while he still could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice was never useful to anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke in the first two films. Annakin did not collect C3P0. He found him in the wilderness and lied to his mother that he had collected him from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed for this stupid Amma-Lamma-Din-Dong. If she had brains, she wouldn't have come in a light year from Annie, but she said to do what George Lucas wrote for her. What a dope!
