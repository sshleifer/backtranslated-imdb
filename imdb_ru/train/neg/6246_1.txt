It touches on some interesting points .. But! - It does not show evidence of all shown "exclusive" research. Who are the “friends” and “small groups of scientists” who collected this data? - What is it with the whole biography of Al Gore? For example, how did he like to play with cows on a ranch or that his child was hit by a car ... too bad, but ... what does this have to do with the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> I have seen Much better, in much less time, on the Discovery Channel. I really don't understand why IMDb has such a high score. If you did not live under a rock, this “documentary” should not be news to you ... all this is old news ... And all that Al Gore is trying to do is to score popularity points. PS I am not an American, so do not even try to say that I am a fan of shrubs: p
