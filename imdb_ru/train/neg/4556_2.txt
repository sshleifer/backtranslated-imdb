I don't know what the other guy was thinking. The fact that this film was made independently makes it equally terrible. You can be as big a believer as you want ... most of this movie is nonsense nonsense. I feel offended by seeing the first 40 minutes. And this one was a great feat. Not only is the acting game awful, but the plot is never even close developed. There are countless holes in history, to such an extent that you can hardly even call it history. I have never read a book, so I cannot criticize it, but this is the first review I wrote here, and its goal is to save all your viewers in an hour and a half of your life. I can't remember the last time I couldnâ€™t even finish watching a movie. This one really takes the cake.
