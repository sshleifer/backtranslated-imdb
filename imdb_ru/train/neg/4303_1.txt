A previous comment made me write this. This suggests that Muslims are blondes and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment simply says that such an opinion can make a racist. Look, race is nothing. I am color blind. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. So what? I can add that I am not 100% Serbian, that I have some Austrian and Croatian blood, but what is the point. Am I dark, half-breed? This is true? Anyone who uses racial prejudices with such evil intentions as Lantos (the producer and director is racist for me. Karadzic, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, Tujman - they are all monsters, and I blame them for ruining my life, my family, my I hope that they will all be in hell, but this will not bring our dead relatives back. I am proud that I am a Serb, and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes, I from Serbia and I have a multinational family.) This film does not show the suffering Serians or Croats in Sarajevo, terrible terrorism of street gangs, Muslim extremism. I add: I bow my knees and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers, Muslims, Catholics or Orthodox, who died in this war. That doesn't help at all. It helps Lantos fill his pockets with more doe, okay!
