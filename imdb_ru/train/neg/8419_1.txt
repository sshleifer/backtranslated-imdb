I have been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite some time ... with all its enthusiastic reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the film went well! It really depicted a black music scene then. However, as the film continued, I and my whole family were bored with our mind. The singing just went on, one by one. I mean seriously, just another musical number, and he would have caught up with RENT. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I hardly noticed any character development in any of the characters; I just didnâ€™t care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died from a drug overdose, I knew that I should be sad, but I just could not feel any emotion to this character. The characters were given a weak background about how they sang in childhood and whatnot, but there were not enough personalities to attract me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer worry, which is accompanied by a lack of character development. This film reminded me of a film about imitation, based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (in my opinion, Ray and Chicago were great movies). In general, I think that this film is best suited to someone who does not care about the general story, but at the same time he will enjoy two hours of fun and funny performances.
