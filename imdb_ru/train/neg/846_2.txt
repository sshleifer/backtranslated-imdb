This is by far the worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it, I thought that the film could not be too bad, because he starred in some pretty decent films and he was a fairly honest actor. WRONG! No one should waste their time on this film. I quickly went through 80 percent, and I do not feel like I missed something.
