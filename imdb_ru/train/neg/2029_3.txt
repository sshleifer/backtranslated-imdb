I do not see enough TV game shows to understand the appeal of SHOW ME THE MONEY, but I believe that this attracts an unpretentious audience. Allegedly a quiz, she offers participants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions. However, his quiz elements play only a small role in the process, which I find painfully complex. For example, before answering a question, the participant chooses which question to ask, choosing from random “A”, “B” or “C”. Does it serve any purpose other than slowing down the game? It would be much faster just to start with “A.” Participants can submit questions, but must answer one of three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering the question, the participant is asked to “fix” the answer - another delay tactic. The participant’s next task is to indicate which woman in a dozen go-go dancers in the cages should open a map that shows how much the question is worth. The correct answer adds the dollar amount to the total amount of the participant; incorrect answer subtracts the same amount. This time-consuming step actually has a certain entertainment value, as it allows viewers to take a close look at the meagerly dressed and equally gorgeous dancers. In the meantime, the participant is reminded that an unsuccessful selection of the "killer card" will immediately end the game. This, of course, causes the participant to sweat and further delays, as the nervous participant ponders the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. I suspect that the likelihood of a sudden catastrophe is the main attraction for viewers of the show. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process is even more slowed down due to the large number of empty jokes between the presenter William Shatner and the participant, as well as random procedures by dancers in the cage. All these delays burn so much time that viewers can forget what the initial question is, by the time the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute episode of JEOPARDY often goes through as many as 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM, which I watched, passed only six questions (many of which related to other television shows). No one in their right mind will watch this show, because it is fun to play by answering questions at home. This leaves three possible reasons for viewing the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a participant responds to the fact that he is on the verge of winning up to one million dollars, he will lose everything in one stroke. <br /> <br /> B. Look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dance exercises. <br /> <br /> C. Enjoy William Shatner's sparkling banter. <br /> <br /> My choice is “B”, but women are not taken long enough in front of the camera to justify the suffering during the hour of this show.
