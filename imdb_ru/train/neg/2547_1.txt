I have not seen this for more than twenty years. OJ was a bus driver, Arte Johnson was a guide, Lorenzo was a kidnapper. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lorenzo looked very much at home like a villain, naturalka. I think I watched it then most of all for OJ, whom I saw at Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also for Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious. <Br /> <br /> And yes, these are offset areas. Reading other posts, I remember that it was some kind of conspiracy, that they were going to kidnap some rich girl, but then this invaluable business with brands was out of the blue. <br /> <br /> I was going to mark? If he appeared as a late film, I probably would have recorded it to check it out again, but I will not be nostalgic about it. Anyway, bye. <br /> <br /> There are the best films of the seventies, which can be viewed.
