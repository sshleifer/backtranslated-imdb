It seems that everything goes against the form, any film with Dolph Lundgren in the title role is bad! I don't know if this is because the storyline is full of holes, or that Dolph is such a bad actor. There is no spoiler, it seems he was late in this movie pushing, pushing, grabbing and touching. In my opinion, it is surprising that some of these projects find venture capital in a bank and in a theater.
