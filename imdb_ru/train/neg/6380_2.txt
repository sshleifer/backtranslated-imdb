Well, what can I say about this movie. I have no words. I could go on about how stupid this film was forever, although the only thing that REALLY had an effect on me was music. And to top it off, someone commented on how much they liked them. For them, all I have to say is that he was ripped off from one of the best martial arts films in the history of The Fury of the Fists, starring Bruce Lee. If he was still alive and had ever come across this film, he would have been terrified. the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say the tape, because such a film could not be filmed. Now I feel more stupid, having spent 30 minutes of my life watching. The only reason I even saw it was because my roommate loaded him out of painful curiosity. What this world is coming to.
