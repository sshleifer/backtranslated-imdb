This film is a confusion about recent movie clichés. There are some promising ideas there, but while the director clearly intended to end up with a haunting ambiguous film, he ended up with a confusing mess. Leading actor Daniel Wu does the job, but without a central theme, it seems that he has nothing to work with. In addition, the film is largely devoid of panic (although, frankly, among the hard work there are some terrible moments). <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> We have the mysterious death of a strange twin, devilish librarians, ghostly love interests, confusion in identity, death from wild monkeys, oedipal conflict, desperate insults, sublimated homosexuality and connections gangs. The only real community that these elements share is that they force the main character to express a vague feeling of confusion and discontent. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is that, despite the brother’s death caused by the monkeys on the DVD cover, the act itself is never depicted directly. Instead, director Julian Lee seems to use video with monkeys - not very scary. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror story, see the Korean film “A Tale of Two Sisters” (2003).
