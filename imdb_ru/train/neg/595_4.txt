Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, yes, that's all for this film. <br /> <br /> No real story, no storyline. There are no cute characters, well, the “characters” are not correct, given that you have no idea who anyone really is. I mean, they are being chased by some strange-looking "things" in the sewers (who is this thing? Why is he there?), I think it's pretty scary, but I care? No, I do not know. Why not me? Because I have no idea who these people are and I don’t know if I want them to live or die. It is one-dimensional and is based on bloody and sound effects to frighten you, which it rarely does. <br /> <br /> This film has no meaning, no goal. It feels like I fell asleep and missed 45 minutes of building up. He jumps right into action. In fact, some women and her friends are locked in the London Underground, a strange creature is chasing them, and then they eventually run away from him. <br /> <br /> Creep has moments that make you jump, art is good, the location is great, and the sounds are fine, but it’s not something that makes a decent horror movie, so unfortunately it’s all disappears. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new. Another predictable modern “horror” in which Kate (the leading “character”) constantly does the stupid “hey, I know you sit at home a lot and think that I should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, ohhh, no! I'm going to do the opposite, because I'm stupid and blond. "I wish they didn't do it so many times, boring and predictable. In fact, I am very unhappy that a stupid woman did not get hit by, well, well, a gray, alien-like creature. <br /> <br /> “Your journey ends here" is the theme of the film. Well, the journey of Creeps ends quite briefly in the film. If you drank a few bottles of beer, you returned a couple of your comrades see for yourself, but if you want something original and clever wow, avoid.
