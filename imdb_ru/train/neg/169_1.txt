I saw this film recently, because his friend brought from New York. After 30 minutes, I told him: “You must be joking. Is this some kind of joke? ”He thought it was good. I told him that I think this is probably one of the most stupid films ever made. "What was that supposed to be?" I asked. "Promotional film for children?" The plot is stupid. The acting game is the worst in the whole history for most directors and outright people who look at these kinds of pranks and think that this is somehow connected with life, love or even the afterlife, because of which it offers an incredibly idiotic look ... need a little psychiatrist Help. Please, if someone tries to force you to insert this into your DVD or video player, think as if you have injected a virus into your computer ... it will not destroy your player, but will destroy your evening. If they made the Razzies in the 40s, it would win in every category. (PS. It also goes under the dubious nickname of "Stairs to Heaven".)
