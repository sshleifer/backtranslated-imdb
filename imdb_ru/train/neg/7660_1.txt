0 * Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank S. Turner, Matthew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on the video game, the director Uwe Boll is trying to recreate the game, turning it into a keen nail, unfortunately, he fails. Instead, he makes one of the worst films ever made! Even though he gains insignificant fame, such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film lacks the necessary fundamentals that are needed for a good movie, such as the plot line, and some basic relativity of what happens in dark and light. The film bounces, and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad computer graphics used to create monsters. Despite the fact that they looked cool, and the feeding was good, a bit lame. Honestly, this is one of the worst films in history. My final rating is 0/10.
