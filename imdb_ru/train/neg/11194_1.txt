The approaching sights to the “Order” make it look like a decent horror mystery / thriller, but we get a plot that can be excellent if combined into a pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> First, the entire film consists of terrible dialogue and terrible special effects. Acting, too, had nothing to be proud of, but Keith Ledger (I think I wrote correctly) saved the film in this category. <br /> <br /> For heaven's sake: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
