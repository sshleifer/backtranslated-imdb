As in the past year, the WWE 2006 New Year Revolution was called the dismissal match. However, the difference between the past years and the matches of this year was entertaining. In fact, only three people had a chance to get out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York, for the WWE Championship. These men were reigning champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shaun Michaels. There was no way that Vinnie Mack would put a belt on any of the novices; Carlito or Chris Masters. And kane? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and it was only for one night. It was obvious that he, too, would not. The match of the past years was an exciting event with six of the best WWE. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing event, but, nevertheless, the night match was far away. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the evening came after the bell rang at the main event. Vince McMahon himself went out and demanded that they raise the room. Then it was announced that Edge immediately cashed his money in the match for the bank championship. John Cena had no time to prepare, and he just won the match in the Liquidation Chamber. He had no chance, and he threw the title after a spear on one of the most spectacular heels in WWE. It was the only fascinating action that took place all night. <br /> <br /> The undercard, like last year, was really cruel. Triple H and The Big Show started a snoring festival, because of which I tried my best to stay away. XXX won, but there was never any doubt about that? Any pay-per-view in which Jerry Lawler and Viszer fight on the same card will never have a chance of success. King pinned Helms (who orders it?), And Big Vis felt defeated by the lost Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> WWE women also had a busy night. There was Diva's usual rubbish with the Bra and Panties match, which Ashley won, and there was the women's championship on the line. In the match, I thought I would have to cook until WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the contest, but it was obvious that this would continue for the foreseeable future. <br /> <br /> At the opening of the competition, which will be held shortly, there will soon be a WWE final against Intercontinental champion Rick Flair. It could have been better, but it was a battered and bloody Flair, which survived after the finish of the disqualification. Obviously, Edge had more fish to fry. <br /> <br /> So, the New Year Revolution failed the pay-per-view calendar for 2006 in a disastrous way. The only good thing about this is knowing that the only way for WWE is up. They are not much worse than that.
