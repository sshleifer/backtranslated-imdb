Poor Robert Englund makes another failure at the expense of Tob Hooper, who usually shoots pretty good horror films, but in this he failed. Englund plays the famous Marc de Sade, who was imprisoned in the 17th century for his obsession with pain and the pleasure of hurting himself, as well as watching others feel pain. This story is so confused that the slap from one century to another, and I am confused about what is happening and what is the purpose of this film. All I saw was a young woman who fell into the trap of a strange lesbian who decides to keep her to herself, and the young woman became interested in this Arab with a lot of money and finds out that he is going to kill her, and then Englund enters one century to others, claiming to be a descendant of de Sade, and trying to kill her, because she reminded him of Mme. Momosel (it is written wrong) or of anyone in the picture above de Sades's wall. The film was terrible, I am surprised that Hooper hired Englund in this film, and the special effects were so fake and ridiculous, especially the part about the eyes. Englund is trying to return after his hit "Nightmare on Elm Street" using these pulling needles to pull people's eyes. Awful, absolutely awful.
