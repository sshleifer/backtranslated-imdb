Previously, I did not know that in the early 1990s, DeVry University (or was it ITT Tech?) I added the film to my wonderful repertoire of technical degrees programs. Well, this film must have been a valedictorian class product. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix, and this film was on the flip side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this film. Awful awful awful. <br /> <br /> The cinematographer adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman had dreams about the Bogeyman and his victim from the first film. More than 50% of this film is from the original film. The rest of the film is the main character, who has bad dreams, while her therapist chatters with the narrator. These scenes are filmed through a filter so thick that the characters glow. They make Angela Lansbury look like 25 years. So, we summarize, terribly. Do not watch this movie.
