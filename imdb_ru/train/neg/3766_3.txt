I watched this movie, knowing that it would not be great. but what I testified was terrible for words. I don't want to be harsh, just the movie was terrible. In general, it was bad, I mean HORRIBLE special effects, acting was not too bad, but not very good, and Sasquatch himself was like ... well, not Sasquatch. In my opinion, the best sasquatch film is Harry and Henderson. it's not violence or horror, but it has a better description of sasquatch. at least it's a suit, not some kind of pompous plagiarism. Watch this movie only if you are desperate or really appreciate anyone in this movie. or go watch a bunch of saints, it's much better.
