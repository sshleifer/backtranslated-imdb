As a person who was amazed by the incredible visual effects of “Hero”, I really wanted to see this film, which was announced in the same spirit, but better. It also featured an actress I love: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed on both points. I bought a DVD of this movie invisible, and it was a mistake. It was no better. <br /> <br /> I understand that these martial arts films are flying through the air - just a fantasy, but this story has stretched so far from everything that one would assume that I just shook my head in disappointing disbelief, Blind woman wins hundreds of opponents? Sorry, this is a bit far. In addition, the main male character “Jin” (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoyed with his dialogue, stupid facial expression and stupid laugh, that he also ruined the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the beautiful colors and amazing action films, this story - for me - there was simply no attraction to make a film worth seeing, this film is not my “Hero”!
