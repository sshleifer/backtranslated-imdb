I should have trusted my instincts better: no expectations - no disappointments. However, instead, I expected to see the same masterpiece as Koyaanisqatsi (1983), and was severely disappointed. In my humble opinion, Powaqqatsi is nothing more than a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - fail miserably. It seems that some producer collected the remnants of material from Koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw them together, put everything in slow motion and forced the pop artist under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hastily collect some banal background music that is continuously repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with smart, fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of worldly images in slow motion (if you watch them on a VCR in quick preview mode, youâ€™ll understand what I mean). Most of all I was disappointed by the soundtrack of Philip Glass. I could not - and still cannot - believe that these commercially sounding drones like New Age, which could have been easily arranged one day by any 14-year-old Casio calculator, were from the same composer who had so brilliantly composed emotional and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. In general, a big waste of time! My advice: forget about commercialization! See Koyaanisqatsi again instead!
