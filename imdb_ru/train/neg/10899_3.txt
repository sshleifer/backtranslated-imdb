Cheap and breathtakingly boring story and acting. Not a single good line, not a single line, bad enough to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the reel included in the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little they had fun. The esoteric and occult basis was indifferently unreliable, and the antagonists were not creepy or believable. The “homoerotic” overtones were senselessly tame and unsatisfactory and were limited to the fact that young boys were caressing their breasts, while sluggish ones in boxers. I'm not cheerful enough to appreciate it, but a little action might at least prevent me and my friend from waking up.
