Who wrote it? Some guy named John Cohen. I think it was the first script he worked on. Someone should have told him that you should write a dialogue similar to what someone can really say. <br /> <br /> And who sent it? Scott Marshall? Son of Jerry Marshall. My nut fell far from the tree. Someone might want to tell him that you can actually shoot a scene in a taxi in New York, and it will look real, and you donâ€™t have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Perhaps he also wanted to tell him that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but I hope he already learned this lesson. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... naturally, she can't act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audrey Hepburn, and yet she stars in this film. Oh wait, it was produced by her father. Well, that's why she got the part. This is really the only reason I can think about. <br /> <br /> So, should I be surprised that this is bad? Not. Should I be surprised at how bad it is? I think many people will see as much as I do. I mean, you expect a starring movie with Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this ... this is not just bad, this is the exact opposite of the classic movie. Think of the big Woody Allen movie, this movie is as bad as this movie is. This is Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that I did not pay to see it, I stopped looking ten minutes because I could not continue. Without a doubt, I would have left the theater earlier. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw him in the theater actually stayed and watched it all. The film starts out ridiculously bad, and then comes to the point that it becomes so bad that it becomes a kind of torture for water from China. And then, when the first act ends, you understand that it will only get worse, and then you need to either leave or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film falls under the category due to the fact that it is so bad, it should be used instead of water equipment in Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer water sports.
