what ultimately kills this film is, among other things, its self-awareness. Here is a short list: 1. Disrespectful behavior. when the Beatles approached and introduced their “strange, disrespectful” behavior / humor, they were greeted as fresh. it was over 4 decades ago. overcome it. <br /> <br /> 2. false refinement. Quitting the base, quasi-socio-political views are difficult ground for comic work. ask woody allen. <br /> <br /> 3. postmodern “I'm cruel in this fake world, and yes, I recognize it in myself,” the snake eats itself - used as an illustration with another animal in the movie itself! - this is a recovery. <br /> <br /> 4. clever, self-satisfied stupidity. <br /> <br /> 5. amateur writing, acting, directing ... have you ever seen student films? the sacrifice itself, the only thing I can say positive is that it, at least, has a sense of itself, and now, I have caught myself on a self-reflective thing, which it considers worthy, value. br /> <br /> but to ... what? ultimately, it sounds as empty as any other pretentious thing - hey, ever seen Woody Allen Bergman, that is: "Interiors" ??? well, it just makes it more amateur.
