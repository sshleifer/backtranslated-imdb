After the catastrophic revolution, this film was largely the final nail in the coffin of Goldcrest and, thus, the British film industry. The film is absolute pants, it is full of music from the attempt to revive the jazz of the mid-80s and is based on the book and the author, which was short-lived at the time and deservedly drowned in obscurity. Temple had been searching for eternity, trying to find Suzette, and invented Patsy Kensett, the 8th Wonder, another person who was certainly popular at the time. By the time the film came out of postproduction, the jazz revival was over, as was Kensettâ€™s career, and the film met a completely unbiased audience. <br /> <br /> Mediocrity would be an exaggeration for some of the worst / campuses / The most frivolous game that ever decorated the British silver screen, which he watched almost 20 years ago, and the film really deserves attention.
