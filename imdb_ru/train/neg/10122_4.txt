Another early film from Alfred Hitchcock, which seems to have been made from a contractual commitment. As with Juno and Peikok, you can say that Hitchcock was not very interested in this film. It has almost no style or craft. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple who come for money and go on a cruise that turns out to be a check on their marriage. Emily is given a chance for a new life with a kind-hearted, rich man who falls in love with her, but decides to go on the big road and stay with her husband. This may seem more plausible if Fred was not a completely unfeeling, pompous donkey, who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. The couple ends up staying together, but there is no real reconciliation scene in the film. The third act goes in a completely different direction, the couple was stuck on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry is very active in the role of faithful husband's faithful wife. That's all you can say about this.
