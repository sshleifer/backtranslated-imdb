Despite the fact that many people thought about the first film, I really liked it. This one, however. How to sum up in one word?: This film (and here is the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's look at it in parts: Here is the plot: Finally, the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has a different kind of problem: the court jester, the father of her son, got off the way, since super, Spliss, goes to the extreme, battling with his gray hair and sells royal offspring for some light and full hair. In her desperation, Snow White appeals for help to Bubi (Otto Walkis), who must first find the other six of his companions-gnomes, and then try to find a royal descendant, or at least try to find the name of Rumpelshtiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written over the weekend, when the writers were very drunk, but the studio was simply pressured to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any other actor, it's really not worth buying a DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least saves the film from oblivion is the performances of some actors. That's why I made the 3/10 move. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all together can make up for a bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at some point they even intersect in our reality, and, unfortunately, they do not do anything funny while being here. <br /> <br /> However, there are many great actors in this film: Otto Waalks, Ralph Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Siva Hagen, (especially funny): Rüdiger Hoffmann as a mirror, Helge Schneider and many others . Moreover, but, unfortunately, all these comedians are not able to realize this really bad scenario. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is a treat for some fans, but for ordinary moviegoers, and now for DVD renters or buyers, it’s not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I even regret renting a movie.
