What is it with the Americans and their obsession with a religious gangster? To think that this is a bestseller is unbelievable, but to make it as a film you really need a good game and a script that will help. In this case, all the good actors went to heaven, and we stayed with Kirk Cameron as a CNN journalist (!), Trying to figure out why many people simply disappeared. Oh yeah, there is a plot about evil world, conspiracy and famine, or something like that. The good news is that it is done so cheaply and with such meaningless dialogue that in all its unintended laughter it has a huge entertainment value. Not recommended for those who have a 3-digit IQ.
