“Omen 4: The Awakening” is a continuation of the television sequel of the original film “Omen”. Instead of Satan having the body of a little boy, he has the body of a little girl, adopted by rich parents, who is bullied at school and who ultimately takes revenge on those who do her wrong. The film seems to be struggling with any horror factor, and many of the events taking place are just stupid, and not particularly frightening, and it’s hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround him. I just did not find this film very disturbing or frightening, especially compared to the original.
