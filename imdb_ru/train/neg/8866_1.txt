Theoretically, “Director's Comment” should have worked. Talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director, telling about his experience behind the camera. Among the programs he has worked on are “Bonanza”, “Flambard”, “Duchess Herzog Street” and “Bounder”. His comments are no less informative because of his habit of deviating from the topic. <br /> <br /> But in practice it failed. This is a joke show, and the joke is not particularly funny. Scenarios are completely lacking in intelligence, and Bryden cannot convince himself as an old man. Whenever he got stuck on something funny, like every five seconds, he let out a hissing laugh. Instead of being pleased with DeLane, you want to shoot him. If senile old people seem to you fun, then this is for you. <br /> <br /> It didn’t help that the mocking shows were, with the exception of “Mr. , “OTT”, “The Tally addicts”, “Neighbors” and “New Faces”. <br /> <br /> The show has been a great time success, so, fortunately, we are spared from the horror of future releases. Wouldn’t it be delightfully ironic if the “Director's Comment” would ever be the subject of deception?
