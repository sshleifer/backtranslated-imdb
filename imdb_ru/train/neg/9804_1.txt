"Rangers of power", the moronic children's television show of the 1990s, devoted to merchandising, should be the most senseless and ridiculous television show ever created. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of this show besides selling a second one? Rate plastic nonsense for children? In any case, in this show there is nothing even distant, interesting or interesting. <br /> <br /> Look at costumes that look like broken spandex. <br /> <br /> Hair, earrings and pendant in the style of mullet Fashion of the early 90s looks completely ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
