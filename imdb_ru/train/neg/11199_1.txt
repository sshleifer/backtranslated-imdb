The rapid pace of this film stuns us from any shocks it can cause. There was no real expectation. Most of the characters were tasteless. The busty Irish priest was as lame as love interest. Interest is misleading. The girl they chose to ensure the sensuality of the film could be better. The central conflict of the protagonist was not involved. This film is completely devoid of positive. It seems like a tedious exercise for someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but did it anyway.
