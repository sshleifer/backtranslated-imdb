The final song of Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately, this is all I can say about this western film. I have to write another 8 lines for my comments, but there are more than 8 horrible lines on this western one. I'm not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along or just a fake. The hero and the villain in this film were too plastic. Not really at all. Many supporting actors in this film looked genuine, but the filming scenes were a joke. The previous commentator thought this film was great and made a cheap shot at President Bush in the comments. It was not a democratic or republican western. It was just a bad western movie that was sold for commercial purposes. I wonder if he made money? Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by college students. If so, it was a great movie.
