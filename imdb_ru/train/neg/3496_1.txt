I remember how my parents did not understand Saturday night live when I was 15 years old. They also did not understand rock and roll and more. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember, and I understand that I understand many things that my children love. But it is a pity. I cannot say that I have seen Sarah, except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see anything special about it. But this show is far below what I expected from her. IMDb burn made it sound like a potential. So, just for this, I started watching the first episode. I turned it off halfway. Everything else is better than that. Jokes intended for a 5-year-old child, presented in the proposed program for adults. Well, Sarah, this grown man is internally moved to turn you off. I just can not believe that someone actually financed this insult comedy. The only thing I can say is that there are a lot of bad jokes here that save other shows from such embarrassment.
