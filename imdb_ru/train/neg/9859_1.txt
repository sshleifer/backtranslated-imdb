This movie is just lame. A complete waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are such cliches, and the way they talk about RPG gamers is not funny either. The problem is that the writers do not seem to know how the RPG game works, and, most importantly, how to joke about this game. Of course, there are a bunch of losers who play role-playing games, like crazy retarders and complete losers. But for me this is not the funniest way to make fun of this game. History makes no sense at all. Who cares how long the game is played? The biggest problem in this film is that the writers and actors did not even try to find out what the RPG is going to make a joke about this. I was ashamed to watch this lame movie.
