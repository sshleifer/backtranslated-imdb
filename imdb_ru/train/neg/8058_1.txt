After seeing hot Eliza Dushku in a rather good “Wrong Turn”, I decided to take this film instead of “The Return of the Living Dead” from all films. I have not seen this yet, but considering that this is one of the most popular horror films, it is safe to say that I made the wrong choice. There is nothing to recommend this film, and I'm talking about the supposedly excellent murder. He didn't even have youthful sex appeal of mediocre films for the poor, such as “I know what you did last summer”, “Valentine” or “Urban Legend”. It simply did not make sense, did not cause excitement, had very few interesting acting skills or irresistible writing. The release date appears to have been postponed many times throughout the year, and the reason is obvious. The whole film is a bunch of meaningless scenes, randomly and uselessly connected together. Get the wrong turn instead if you want to see Dushka. I would love to watch a movie with her and super-hot Elizabeth Harnoy - but I don't think that even this would make this movie watchable. Casey Affleck, so promising in “The Hunt for Goodwill”, is terrible here - he seems to lack intelligence and courage. That's enough on that.
