*** Comments contain spoilers. *** I barely held on to the show as a television date when they started annoying music in EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps averaged almost shooting in each case when the nasal Dian Farr herself was obviously pregnant (but we shouldnâ€™t have noticed) when Colby was an agent of TRIPLE. But now, in today's episode, David is trapped with a paranoid, crazy man who IS A HUGE lover with a gun, in an elevator and ... HE CANNOT SEND IT. A trained, experienced field agent who has been the 1st outside the door many times and has hand-to-hand combat experience, CAN'T SELECT ANYTHING WORK. Not when this nut blinks, looks away, lowers its head, closes its eyes; even when he looks at a fiber-optic wire, squirming around the ceiling, like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the scene came, which made me realize that I also like to learn from the plump, rude but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy girlfriend / lover Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent in another case. Don gives David the "word of distress", which is the code "S ** t is about to fall"; David is ready, they put out the lights, dropped the elevator, startled from work and ... <br /> <br /> David CAN'T disarm / kill / hit to surrender the task. Bad guy ends up with BOTH WEAPONS, David ends the CASE. <br /> <br /> I finished. Hope NUMB3RS is fun.
