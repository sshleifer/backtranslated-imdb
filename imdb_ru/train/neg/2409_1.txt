It was a painful experience, the whole story is actually there, so I won't go into details, but the acting was awful, this part was at the very beginning, when the scientist brother goes to work, he actually wears a white robe at home before leave to work, I thought that working with biohazard material means that you have to wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment, and the lab itself looks like a school lab. This monitor is located on the top of the file, which has nothing to do with the whole scene. that this place looks technical, and the scientist actually has breakfast in the laboratory, and next to him is a bank with biological danger, and his boss comes in and doesnâ€™t even tell him anything about it ... not to mention the bad game is very bad, not there can be nothing worse than what my advice does not look, and I thought that nothing could be worse than the house of the dead, apparently, Uwe Boll's films look like a classic Shakespeare in comparison with this!
