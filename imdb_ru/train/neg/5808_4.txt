Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a mercurial, hot-tempered, powerful Hollywood couple, they filmed this (almost) remake of the scene behind the scenes of action movie Steve McQueen-Ali McGraw of 1972 about the running two. It almost worked the first time because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen — even a silent and weary stone, you could feel his watch ticking, his clever magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his charm and, probably, a more versatile actor - if so, this is not a showcase for his qualities. Basinger succeeds and, of course, looks good, but James Woods is artificially tuned to the role of a stupid tycoon. The story of another pair taken hostage by Baldwin’s former partner was unbearable in the 72-year film and plays even worse here. As for the action scenes, they are quite old, which makes one wonder: why even redo the original? ** from ****
