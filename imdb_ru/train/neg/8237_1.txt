How, in the name of all holy, did this movie spread? It looks like it was taken on someone's mobile phone, and the “screaming girl victim” script goes to a whole new level. They literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the film. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no characters, and not a lot of acting skills. Just scream and scream even more. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and quickly ran through it to see if anything had happened. It is not - except for the cry, of course. It is rather strange that passing through fast-forwarding brings to the fore another problem — there’s no point in talking about camera work. Each shot looks like any other - the average distance, one corner, dim, dim, dull. <br /> <br /> This is not so bad, this is good. This is just bad.
