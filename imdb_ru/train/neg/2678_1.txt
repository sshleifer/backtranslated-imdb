I can't say anything positive. Perverted nonsense, chug and chug with the "message". New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (I remember Cuckoo), but many have a bouquet of cardboard and an asbestos aftertaste (a good example is “Night Watch”). This is a “watchman” type of emptiness. It would be terrible to act if it were not for the saving grace of a completely unattractive direction and incompetent editing, which is sometimes so terrible that it distracts the actors from impotence. A special reward for the cameraman for each shot is wobbly (someone please understand that Blair Witch had 15 seconds of undeserved fame?), And the shots are aimed at attention-deficient teenagers who sleep in CounterStrike and masturbation Lead woman poses and trying to look seductive too often, the antihero man needs a diction trainer (although the genetics are not bad: rather expressive eyes). One (middle) finger for this irrelevant stack of blundering. Anyone who responds positively is better to be a (long-distance) cousin of the "Authors".
