This film is deeply disappointing. Not only does Wenders show only a very limited musical spectrum of blues, his subjective and personal interest in those parts of the music he brings to the film makes watching and listening absolutely boring. The only highlight of the film is an interview with a Swedish couple, who made friends with Jean-Louis Lenoir, shows her personal videos and tells stories. Wendersâ€™s presentation of the cinematic theme begins quite interestingly - hinting that world culture (or American culture in general) travels in space, but his limited view on this topic, as well as neither funny nor completely exciting reproduction of 30s stories This movie is just a sleeping pill. Yon I expected more from him.
