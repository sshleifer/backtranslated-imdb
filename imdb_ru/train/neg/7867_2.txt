Well, I tried, and I tried, but I still won't get this Guy Maddin thing. Fairy tales from the Gimli hospital left me cold, this film about Austrian residents and the Ice Nymph film was good, but it was not in the storyline section ... and this film about naked abortions and hockey is just boring. I'm glad that Maddin appreciates silent films, but I don’t like his films for the same reason that I don’t like Quentin Tarantino’s films: they are empty homage to better, more creative films — films that have developed an artistic form or broke New the land is all style, not content. No jump cuts and strange camera angles can hide the fact that Maddin is David Lynch’s non-original imitator, although he has one advantage over Tarantino: he usually doesn’t write an embarrassing dialogue because most of his films are intertitled. The bottom line is that Maddin's nonsense is a smart and clever movie for novice directors.
