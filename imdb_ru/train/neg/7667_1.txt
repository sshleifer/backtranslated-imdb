The definition of abomination, as defined in the Webster dictionary, is "the cause of aversion or aversion." If someone can come up with a better word or definition for Alone in the Dark than this, please let me know, because this is the best I can come up with. However, I do not feel that in any case, this word describes how truly awful this film is. <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie with my two roommates. One of them has very similar tastes, the other has an action / adventure guru. This last guy usually does not care about the size of the holes in the plot, while in the film a lot of explosions, he leaves happy. <br /> <br /> As they say, we entered the theater to watch on Friday. Alone in the dark. To my surprise, we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I immediately understood why. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately, I have to admit that it only gets worse. The initial scene is a 5-minute scrolling text that is narrated. However, I understand why this was narrated. The director must have realized that only illiterate people could even think about paying for watching this movie. However, this scene is not only the longest scrolling text in the history of the movie, but it does not make sense. It seems that in the same sequence we hear about completely separating the films. One is about an ancient civilization and its portal, the other is about a mad scientist and his experiments with orphans. If you read this and get confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then the terrible storyline, action, effects and camera work begins. Tara Reid is terrible as an actress. She does nothing to make you think for a second that she is the curator of the museum. Slater is just bad, unconvincing and has no chemistry with Raid. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man. All the time, I and a roommate with similar tastes ask questions such as: What is it? And what happens? In addition to this scrollable garbage, we have several narrated episodes of Slater himself. They are good? NO. Do they explain anything? NO. Do we as an audience have even the slightest idea of ​​why we should be worried about what is happening? Once again, no. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reed are together, but they never act as if they even care about something else. But then BAM ... sex scene. Once again, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Good, oh, I don't know, 30 seconds after this horrible scene ends, we have a shootout with about 20 armed forces and a similar amount of alien things. He is tuned to a heavy metal track and causes more brain hemorrhage than it ever seemed possible. <br /> <br /> And if that wasn't enough ... <br /> <br /> villain. There is a scientist and there are "alien" things. At some point, the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill, ordering them to attack a military outpost. What for? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Slater and Reed walking in the evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Alien things broke through? The military told them? Who knows ... and by this moment, who cares? I did not know, and you will not. <br /> <br /> But to top it off, Slater and Reed are attacking aliens. Even though it was stated that alien things would be killed by exposure to sunlight. And this is true, as you may have guessed, this is the middle of the working day, and this is as bright as can be. Maybe an alien bought sunglasses, I don't know, and I don't care. <br /> <br /> Now that the movie is over, I ran out of the cinema, all 6 feet 6 inches from me, waving my hands and shaking my afro, telling everyone not to go to this movie. Even my crazy roommate in the action / adventure genre (who would consider a movie that just cut and put 2 hours of explosion into one movie, the greatest film ever created), admitted that there were very obvious holes in the plot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Summing up this CRAP-FEST, I give it 0.0 / 10 and, if I can, I would lower it. <br /> <br /> Definitely, the worst movie ever created. I would not want this film on my worst enemy.
