This film was terrible and offensive to the viewer. Stupid script, bad cast, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual Hollywood tradition, the US government is shown as always evil. Communist sympathizers are crazy in Hollywood, most of whom are as stupid as a chest of stones, love to take lonely psycho Eugene McCarthy and portray him as the leader of a huge movement. The truth is that at that time he was considered a minor character who used the legitimate care of Soviet communists for political gain. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, and the United States brought all these evil Nazis. Like Werner Fonbrown, without which we would not have a space program. He really loved being American and became a great asset for the country. <br /> <br /> Yet the irony is that fools in Hollywood, uneducated people who live in fantastic existence, still believe that the government should rule EVERYTHING and give us everything we want. And yet, this is the same government, which they constantly portray as the perfect evil in such films.
