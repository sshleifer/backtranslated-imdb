You just had to write this liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre, and this is the weakest record I've seen in recent years. I praise everyone who is involved in most aspects except the most important scenario. This is a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of quality or black and white films can compensate for the complete absence of the substance. I love Kevin Spacey and hear that he is going to make another film about the general. My advice is not to waste your time.
