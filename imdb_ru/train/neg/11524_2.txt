A rather incoherent film about a man who belonged and left a superficial religious cult of the hippies of the 1960s who fights with them sixteen years later. The man has a child from one of the other cultists, who during the raid by the police is hidden and taken by another man named Hawk, who lives in a small hut by the river. A cult kills some of its followers or people in the city. It is difficult to track who the characters are or at what time period the scenes should occur. The leader gets parole sixteen years later (I got it out of the box - I missed the amount of time in the film). In any case, no one looks older, unremarkable. <br /> <br /> One kill is committed with a large circular saw, others with knives or a crossbow. I have never heard the name of the title character mentioned in the film, but he is the one who replays the most, screams and shouts. <br /> <br /> The film is corrected quite poorly, with voice support (not much) to explain what is happening. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man is beaten with a fist, and we hear the crack of a whip. A woman shoots a pistol, and we do not hear his shot, but instead we hear a ricochet! It seems that this was not done for a comic effect.
