I caught it yesterday at the IFC and I can not believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought that these "ladies" were anything other than? Kate tells Jed that she can be fired because she needs to be the backbone of society, but gives out for him! Then they suddenly decide that they are in love? And she is SO devastated because of his death, she does not go to his funeral, let alone tell his family "good news"! By the way, how did an American become the director of a very correct British school? Janine should have been expelled because of her unpardonable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she ends up teasing the fraudster she brought for interrogation! And the less said about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> Regarding guilt, then Janine and Molly feel because of Jed, please! This is his own damn punk wine that he turned into a murder! Where is the blame for poor Gerald who is being torn? If only I could do the same with the boso behind this “movie”!
