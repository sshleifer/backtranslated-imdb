When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS, which were twin bodybuilders like Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be too bad because the film was shot by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for creating dirty films, but good made dirty films. Well, THE BARBARIANS is an amazingly dirty action / adventure film that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN and fails at all levels. The film is not like that. Some scenes were well filmed, but the tone and bold, sticky “disco” type of clothes and hair that people are decorated with, simply does not make any sense, even for such a modest film. <br /> <Richard Lynch looks like an elderly woman with such a ridiculous hairstyle and costume. He must be menacing, but he looks like a jester. And it's fun to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, appear in her first film, walking in a lean fur bikini. I am sure that she wants this dirt to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbaric twins are good as muscular heroes, but it’s almost impossible to make proper criticisms of their actions, because their roles, like everything else in this mess, are really ill-conceived. The only way the film tries to distinguish one twin from another is to have one twin wearing a loincloth that covers his ass, while the other loincloth barely covers his muscular ass. I am not kidding! Do not ask me who is who. <br /> <br /> Deodato must have really desperately tried to agree to make this film. And his despair is beautifully reflected in this crappy click. This is just bad.
