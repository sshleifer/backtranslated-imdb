The worst kind of movie. In fact, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced by a plasma screen, and this deceived the museumâ€™s security for several days. Eh? <br /> <br /> A plasma screen that theoretically would work for less than 2 seconds from a clock battery, assuming that it has a sufficiently low internal resistance to supply the necessary current, which will not be. <Br /> <br /> It would have been possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but this system would not fit into the case. Sorry for the anal, but it is even close to being believable. The rest of the film was not much better, and I wonder why the budget could not be donated to charity or to me.
