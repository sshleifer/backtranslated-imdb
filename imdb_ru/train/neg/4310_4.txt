This film tells about a very sexy Olympic star on the track, who was hired to train a basketball team for schoolchildren. Like WILDCATS Goldie Hawn, she plays the lead role in the lead role of Katie Crosby, and she does as the script allows. I think Raquel Welch would be the best choice, but given the obvious budget of the film on TV, they probably could not afford it. Katy Lee looks great in every frame, but we will never see her completely naked. The story is quite predictable, to put it mildly, without giving surprises. The young and happy Michael Bean has a male lead role. He is a star in the team, as well as a love interest for Katie Lee. Keenan Wynne has some funny scenes in the role of a rich old man who runs a sports program and does not think that a woman should play sports. This moment rises throughout the film and, of course, outdated. Ironically, Kathy Lee does not conduct her team through any unorthodox workouts; she doesn't do anything that a male trainer wouldn't do. There is a funny story involving a high and not very bright player who undergoes hypnosis to go through his classes and play as a professional basketball player Sidney Wicks. It seems like everyone had a good time making this film, but the only real reason to see this is for Katie Lee Crosby. She is not a very good actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair and a very tanned body.
