Well, I have to say that this film was so bad that I would go out if I didn't have to check it at work. And the worst part is that I wanted to see it so much that I drove around the city, paid $ 10 for parking twice, because the newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I saw him play someone else was in this movie with John Travolta. In any case, the plot has potential - it sounds great in the preview, but it is filled with absolutely ridiculous, predictable, weak plot turning points. And I hoped that it would be one Christmas movie, in which Christmas did not need to be rescued, and that Santa did not need to be replaced, but no. best character. I am sure that this film would be great for small children, but for adults it sucks so much that it is hard to survive.
