I have seen all four films in this series. Everyone deviates from the books. This is even worse. My problem is that he does not in any way follow the book in which he is named! The directors and producers had to call it something different than “Love, eternal joy.” The only thing that in this film resembles a book is the names of some of the characters (Willy, Missy, Henry, Clark, Scotty and Cookies). Names / age / gender of children are incorrect. The whole storyline is no where in the book. <br /> <br /> I think that Janette Oka, her books and her fans are very bad at making a film called her that is by no means correct. The music is too loud. Actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, this might work. Purely. Do not watch it, though, if you hope for a condensed version of the book. I hope this will be the last movie in this series, but I doubt it. If there were more films, I would like Michael Landon, Jr. and others to stick to closer stories and plots. Books are excellent and, if you follow closely, make great movies!
