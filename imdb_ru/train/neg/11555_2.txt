A great slasher film - itâ€™s a pity they were producers, not part of the script. A summary of the plot: a man with a red fetish invites such women to his apartment only to fall into some kind of freaky coma, and continues with varying degrees of success. Only the cutting team behind the scenes must have thought that the film was as much an advertising film as I did and knocked it out of the film. Nothing happens, you get lost on how red he is at this time (didn't he shoot him earlier ??), and most of the time it looks as if the operator turned off and resumed shooting when he woke up. Not that I could blame him, I lost consciousness 2-3 times, and I had to rewind and resume to try to restore the little conspiracy that exists. Warning when you see the ending. Do NOT try to connect it with what happens before - you just get an aneurysm. Not worth the time, effort, or God forbid money. The only reason to get 2 instead of 1 is a small chance that the hack occurred between the release of the film and the terrible version I was watching.
