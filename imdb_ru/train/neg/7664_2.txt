Spoilers ahead, but does it matter? Have you ever read a movie review consisting solely of questions? Could this be so? Why does an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the initial text incoherent? Why should a nun (she, of course, seemed cute!) To hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Was there always a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why one of the mines of the gold mine goes in the yard of the orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly appear in Christian Slaterâ€™s apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why did even a non-archeologist knock with a sledgehammer for an obviously valuable chest of pure gold? Why do modern computers still display the green outlines of objects related to the grid of the pretron era, with small "beeps"? And should all movies have digital displays? Why doesn't ANYTHING make any sense in this film?
