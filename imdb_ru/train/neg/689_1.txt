What is this ........... this? Without a doubt, this is the biggest waste of film, settings and camera. I know that you cannot set your expectations regarding the 1980s, but this is too stupid to be true. I bought this movie for $ 0.89 and still feel the urge to come back and get my money back. Can you imagine who this stinks hard? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this film and what are its motives ??? Well, in fact, you can not care less. Why do you need this? The creators of this piece of rubbish didn't exactly care. They did not try to create a little stress. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I think itâ€™s much easier to find money with that name) also made Sorodich (1986) a rather enjoyable task, and he recently made Survivors. Full of shit, but at least Eliza Dushku. This stuff has Daphni Zuniga debut !!! (Who ??) Yes, that's right, chick Melrose Place. Her very memorable character dies about 15 minutes. after opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies right in the first minute, but no one seems to mention or miss him, so who cares? The rest of the actors ... they really do not deserve the term actors, they are completely uninteresting. You hope that they will die a quick and painful death ... and not only by your characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
