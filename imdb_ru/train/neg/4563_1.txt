This film is perhaps the cheapest, most stupid and worst sequel ever made. <br /> <br /> Still, this is Disney’s funniest and most idiotic film, and it guarantees a laugh at crazy stories and bad plots from beginning to end. Is done. <br /> <br /> This is a group of short stories that seem like bad fan fiction. <br /> <br /> * WARNING SPOILER * The first is that Beast and Belle are petty because of a miserable dispute. Then three new loser characters decide to rectify the situation by forging a letter of forgiveness to give Bella. Partly in this little episode of Belle's wall eyes that made my brothers and sisters laugh so hard. Then she and the Beast fight more for the letter ... and later find out the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Of course, old enough to understand the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then everything is about Lumière, which is the biggest drug in the world when it comes to romance. It comes from a man who can make anything feminine. And they turn FiFi into a psychotic villain who tries to kill Belle and eventually goes unpunished. What message to send to children! <br /> <br /> Next, the thing is that Mrs. Potts is annoyed. And the next after it's all because of the Beast becoming overly possessive of the bird, to such an extent that it just seems completely stupid. <br /> <br /> Animation is so ugly, it kills. You can see at least 100 errors ... and the color is terrible. <br /> <br /> Belle is a lighter juice that grumbles when something goes wrong. Plus, it is small and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the side characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time. I know that they did this in the film, but this was exaggerated.) <br /> < br /> But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She is ruined in this. I can't even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give him 1/10 for juice, but I put him on a comedy.
