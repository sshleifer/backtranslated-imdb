Well, I really can't say too much about this movie except this one: I have seen more than 4000 films in my life, and more than 2300 of them were horror films. Although it’s hard for me to decide which one is the best (unlike my favorite, which I can say is George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead), I can say without any hesitation that Todd Sheets’s Zombie Bloodbath is worst horror movie i have ever seen <br /> <br /> I can't say anything about this movie. Acting, dialogue, directing, make-up, music ... Every aspect of this film is just so much below what's acceptable, and it amazes me that it was ever released. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a complete horror movie or zombie, listen to my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this trash. There is no pleasure to get from watching this. You will not even laugh because of the complete irrelevance of the display ... Believe me. You are welcome.
