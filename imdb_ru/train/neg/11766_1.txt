It is difficult to understand where this adaptation starts to go wrong, because I think the problem begins with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith found out that you read them not for detective stories, but for his deeply condescending and completely false vision of a non-existent Africa. He did for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan — not so successfully, but based on just as many facts. <br /> <br /> As soon as I realized this, I was no longer annoyed by the fact that the American singer / actress Jill Scott played the role of mother Ramotswe. If she wants to represent a non-African country, is it appropriate that she is a black woman? She is not the only American in the cast; Mma Makutsi plays Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far away, too young for the roles they play, and too charming. Both brutally kill local accents, and both are so focused on this cruelty that they cannot offer much in action. Ramtos Scott's mom is cheerful, sweet and soft. Mma Makutsi from Rose - annoying bitch with a motor mouth. <br /> <br /> The result is almost imperceptible. The main cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucien Msamati, who plays the role of Mr. JLB Matekoni. He comes out smarter and more intense than in the books, but I cannot blame Msamati for this — he is a shining light in the ocean of suction. The contradictions between his game and books clearly lie at the feet of the committee of butchers, who wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, McColl Smith’s work has always been very interesting, but, as you know, bad. He refuses to be edited. As a result, his book contains experiments on grammar, bordering on scientific, and characters that change the name in the middle of a sentence. Therefore, it is an achievement that the development team of this project actually aggravated the situation. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is now largely anglicized. Characters talk about "openness" and "sensitivity to needs." Mama Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni flirt openly. Mom Makutsi groans about the fact that she does not have a computer, but given her constantly updated hairstyles, makeup and jewelery, I’m surprised that she doesn’t have a MacBook and a Visa card in her bag. <br /> <br /> Well, so what if we stayed here? It’s hard to get upset about this shitty adaptation, because, to be honest, most of the things that I like about the original books are apocryphal in any case. McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana, populated by cute, non-threatening black people full of funny and tasty nuggets of wisdom. He reads well in spite of a linguistic parody, but this is a vision of how a certain type of white person wants blacks to be. This is simply not true. <br /> <br /> Given this, it is hardly surprising that this show sucks just like it. However, it remains to be seen whether European and American audiences will notice.
