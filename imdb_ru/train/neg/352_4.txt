It seems that the cast must provide at least an average film. And so I sat down for 102 minutes of disbelief. In addition to Ed Harris, it seems that no one owns acting skills. Even Sean Connery, whom I usually worship, had a day off throughout the filming of “Just a Cause” movie. Never for the whole movie did not convince me one actor. <br /> <br /> It made this movie cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> History is a little embellishing. This is exciting, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Conclusion Watch this movie only if you really have nothing more to do.
