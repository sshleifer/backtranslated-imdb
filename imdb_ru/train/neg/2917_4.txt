As it often happens, the impressive and explosive trailers of Asian films add up to nothing more than grim stories. Like Unleashed (it was great), Dog Bite Dog tells a story where people grow up like fierce wild dogs that follow their master's orders. The main characters, emotionally undeveloped, immoral killer, which is compared with the same unstable policeman, are far from the usual heroes and villains, which we often see. In fact, by the end you lose touch with the one whom you should empathize, not feeling the slightest emotion in any of the men? whether it was a director’s failure or perhaps an underscore message that he was trying to say, you decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability, half the way it went down to a ridiculous story of survival and revenge. The expectation, which was evident at first, soon disappeared because of the extremely mismatched musical accompaniment, which devalued the potentially effective story. And in the end, you still have the feeling that all this detailed background information and self-analysis of the main characters were somehow very unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the transition in the plot from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to American films ?? therefore, those who are not familiar with Asian films and are tired of the predictability of Hollywood should check it out. <br /> <br /> White balance seemed off for most of the film. It was like looking at a picture taken on a fluorescent lamp when it was supposed to be mounted on tungsten. Maybe I'm alone, but it strained my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie also liked to make fun of you ?? Interesting build-up gave me hope for a slow story, until it was redirected to a low-budget, low-speed chase. And only when you think that you will get an unrequited indie, ending with a mixture of Shakespeare's tragedy, do you understand that this is not the end at all, but rather a transition to a bizarre montage of country music about peace and tranquility. <Br /> <br /> Add a few horrible backstage scenes, the moment of redemption unexpectedly returned to the wildness and again in the other direction, Asian passion for bodily fluids and terrible music that did not match the film, and you get an average soft Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I just don’t understand why each fight scene was covered with clips of roaring lions? I thought they should symbolize dogs? In the end, we are reminded of the true killer who is still hiding among us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
