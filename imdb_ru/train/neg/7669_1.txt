This film has become one of the most unique films you have ever seen. However, this is due to the fact that you cannot make the heads or tails of this mess. It looks like a series of tasks designed to determine whether you want to leave the film and discard the money you just paid. If you don’t want to feel slighted, you’ll watch this horrible movie and have a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they all have seen better times, but then you realize that they really were paid a lot of money to do it, and you lose their pity as you have already done for the movie. I can't go on talking about this horrible movie, it’s almost what Ed Wood would have done, in which case he would surely become his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To begin with, you will have to go through opening a dialogue like you have never seen / heard, this thing should last five minutes. On top of that, this is told to suggest that you, the viewer, cannot read. Then we meet with Mr. Slater, and a flurry of horrible lines begins, as if he works solely to get the lines to the movie poster tag. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I usually like), and he does his best not to drown in it, but in the end he does. Then comes the final insult, Tara Reid plays a reasonable role, oh, help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress, and for some reason she constantly gets movie roles, in my opinion, although she should stick to films of the American type of pie. <br /> <br /> In general, you may want to see it yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I enjoyed it, I mean, let's all be honest, sometimes it's comforting to revel in the faults of others .
