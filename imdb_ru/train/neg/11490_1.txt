I have to agree with the majority of people that this performance was poorly prepared and also written. Acting was not much higher than lower production values, but I feel that an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and extract maximum benefit from it. In accordance with this thought, I feel that it is important to note that one actor has risen and stood far beyond this camp to tasteless production in order to become a respectable and rather talented performer. I mean Laura Harris, the Canadian-born actor, who etched her through many poorly prepared shows and films to find a place in the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair, and to her credit, she copes with this role effectively. on the young actress in this series, where she played Ashley, a quiet but smart seventh grader. I felt that if someone could “do it” in this series, Laura Harris would surely have been, and she was true to her nature, she is truly excellent in acting. Paul won the respect of many producers, who now recognize her for her talent. , as well as for the unique attractiveness of the northern blondes. If you ever have the opportunity to watch this series, I recommend that you watch something epic behind such people as The Godfather or, perhaps, Beaches, to remind yourself that in the end there is a big true integrity of production. and appreciate there, and that this series is just a low-budget reminder that Laura Harris can simply announce her time on the show, and I bet she quotes many words of protection for young actors, saying, “This is the beginning!”
