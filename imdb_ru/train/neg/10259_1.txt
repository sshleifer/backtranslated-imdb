I saw this film in the theater when I was a child, and I always remembered it as my first experience when a terrible movie with a good publicity hit me. The commercial was great, but later I found out that it had every explosion or “special effect” (about 4), and even some that were not in the film. There was a story about aliens, but as I recall, aliens have never appeared in the film. It was an obvious case in which someone earned money from a cheap film intended for fraud. I guess my world of innocence ended that day when I found out that there are bad people who make bad bad movies.
