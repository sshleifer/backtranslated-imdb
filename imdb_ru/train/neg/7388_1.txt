drss1942 really took the words out of my mouth. I loved Seagal's early films and I feel the only one who is still faithful to him. I just watched this movie (well, I fell asleep by about 90%, so I didn't see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I was no longer exposed to this film and did not dare to find out what happened at the end. There was something strange in the voice of Segal and others. Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max, where the voice was duplicated, but in the same language (Australian - English, right? :) In any case, if I had 10 fingers, they would all right now point out this injustice towards Seagalu.
