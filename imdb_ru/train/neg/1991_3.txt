So what's the fuss when Indiana Jones emulates when you have an actor who played the role of a fictional dude from adventure storybooks who doesn't want to go on an adventure ??? No matter who wrote the script for JAKE SPEED, he was probably fired, but for some possible reason this film lacks excitement! This does not mean that it does not work, but look at the dark side of the picture. It has nothing to do with INDIANA JONES or other action-packed adventures containing cliffs and narrow shoots, and JAKE SPEED advanced in this way, using clever propaganda to interest me and some others! Besides, I've never heard of a guy, so who needs his attention?
