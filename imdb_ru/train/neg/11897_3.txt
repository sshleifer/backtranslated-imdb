William Lustig's sequence in The Maniac convincingly proves that without the impressive effects of Tom Savini and the convincing performance of Spinella the Maniac would never have become a cult hit the way it was. Vigilante is badly directed, with a simple script that explains everything for you and is predictable at every turn, as well as mediocre actions of all the actors. Judging by the feeling of “deja vu” that this film gave me, Lustig watched “Deadly Desire” several times before doing it! (* 1/2)
