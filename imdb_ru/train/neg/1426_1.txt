One question: why? First, the premise is not funny or attractive. They use taped interviews, and take audio to liven up with the animals speaking parts. First, the interviews are not fun or interesting to begin with, and even if they were, I’m sure they would be much more interesting if you look at them the way they are, without turning into cartoons. How does it add fun to this? I turned on the CBS sitcom line on Monday evening (for me it became the usual way to relax after a busy day on Monday) and found it. Of course, the composition of the comedy series will still be repeated, as this summer, but the repetition of these episodes would be more exciting. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I really did. When it started, I thought, well, maybe it would be funny. Nope And then it went on. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there was any goal, if the interviews were shown in full, and if they had any indications. But no, these were just single-line clips cut and glued very quickly. It looked like a terrible, horrible version of Cartoon Network's “Robot Chicken”. I was not a fan of the canceled comedy series CBS "The Class". While this was happening, in half an hour I would fight. But if it depended on me, deciding the whole season of this or three more episodes of "Creatures" ... let's say, I would take "Class." Considering that several hours have passed since his broadcast, and I came here to see that I am the first to comment ... I think this is a good sign that no one has watched it and that it will not last much longer. Cartoon Roadkill.
