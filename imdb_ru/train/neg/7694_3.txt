If you're not twelve years old, this movie is really not worth it. This is obviously a low-budget film with BBC actors and a fantasy-like genre that sometimes requires intensive CGI work, which is not good. I knew it would be bad when I rent it. I like to laugh at bad movies. I did not know how bad though. It is bearable until after hour 2, then it really starts to burn. Combat styles go between ordinary combat, which obeys the laws of physics, and wire combat. There is no real explanation for the transitions. He has a plot, but again, this is clearly a children's film. It seems that the overt moral lessons of that day, like Sesame Street or something like that, are transmitted. It is tolerable. But it is much better if you are, say, nine years old.
