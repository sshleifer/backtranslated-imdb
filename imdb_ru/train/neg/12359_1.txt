I thought it was a really awful movie - I actually screamed at my TV a couple of times. One or both of the male gays were mistaken; there was no chemistry between them, and Richard Ruccolo looked as if he would like to kiss a dog. The film tells about their long and tormented wooing, emphasizing every decay and makeup, but without disclosing the reasons between them in detail. These reasons may lead to the appearance of some interesting characters, and not fights or scenes of makeup in bed (lame, even if you liked the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine their characters, but does not make the film worth rolling. Save your money.
