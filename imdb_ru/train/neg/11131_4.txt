First of all, I agree that he eludes Mr. Chomsky’s lips. His actual delivery of an interesting counterpoint is what makes a man a hit on the campus circus. He meets a pleasant, modest, pragmatic. He does not satisfy the current political style (unpleasant bipartisanship) and aims at the extreme left, as well as the extreme right, punishing both for good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film itself is stupid. In fact, I would not even call it a documentary, but rather just a collection of speeches. Watching “Rebel Without a Pause” is no different from watching a performance on a segment recorded at 3 am on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches. No story, no story. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, production is strictly amateur. The sound is terrible and contradictory; sometimes we cannot hear Noam speak, in other cases we cannot hear the questions asked by those present. When Noam speaks rarely, we are allowed to see the reaction of the audience, unless we are given a quick snapshot of his wife, who obviously attends all his speeches and rays with pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this film and say that you probably should read it on tape or CD to listen to them in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I have a generous mood today.
