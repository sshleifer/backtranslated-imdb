When my child pleads with me to leave the premiere of this film, I know that this is bad. I wanted to rip out my eyes. I wanted to stretch my hand across the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing his last piece of dignity. This is one of the few films in my life that I watched and immediately wanted to “see” if it were possible. Other movies are Troll 2 and Fast and Furious, both better than this crap hat. <br /> <br /> I can drink myself to sleep tonight, in a vain attempt to forget that I have ever seen this blasphemy in the good name of Suze. <br /> <br /> I say to Mike Myers: stay with Austin or even revive Waynes World. The fact that it worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Suze is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
