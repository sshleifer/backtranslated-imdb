This film is complete nonsense! Avoid this loss of celluloid at all costs, it is incoherent and incoherent. I am proud that in the 70s I entertain the cinema from Salo to Kitty Salon. I like to be shocked, but I need a consistent story. However, if you look at horses, buddy shoots you, this film is for you. The saddest thing was that a lame werewolf costume with a functional van. I mean, it's just hard to survive, not to mention that the game is terrible, and the soundtrack is poorly duplicated. Please, I know that the cover is interesting (it looks like gorilla hands reaching for a woman’s bare ass), but don’t waste your time and money because you won’t get back.
