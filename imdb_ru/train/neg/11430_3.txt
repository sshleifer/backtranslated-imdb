Well, let me add a new word here: polyphobia: fear of polyamoric relationships. This is another episode of a long series of films that start with what makes the audience talk about some trio, only to include a dime and preach everything about how it is so necessary and only morally to find a monogamous solution. Only one person in a thousand understands that he can love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bluff. <br /> <br /> Remember my words: in a few decades, polyphobia will become as deceptive as homophobia, but guess who was too close to figure it out? Right from the first time: the producers of this film. And many like it. Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned type of film like this one? Proud to be unbiased in relation to gays, he completely ignores the fact that we live in an era when monogamy turns into consistent monogamy, which, in turn, turns into hesitation and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing, mediocre chick. (But damn it, I have to say that Heather Graham is the sweetest thing of all living things.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
