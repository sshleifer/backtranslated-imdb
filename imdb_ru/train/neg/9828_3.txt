I rented it by mistake. After a quick inspection of the box, I thought it was a story about time travel / fantasy. Instead, it is a “Christian” story, and I suppose it is a fairly typical example. If you are sold by the message, you probably won't notice the awkwardness of the plot / action / etc., But I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I’m worried about rewriting the story in this story. He paints the 1890s as a kind of paradise of family values ​​and morality (the character is astounding that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But he overlooks the very unpleasant side of this “highly moral” society widespread, for example). And at some point, the hero complains to the clothing store owner about things that don't sound as strong as the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in the recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> In general, I thought, I suppose, this is what you like, if you like such things, and this is definitely useful ...
