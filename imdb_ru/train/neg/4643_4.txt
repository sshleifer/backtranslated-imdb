I shot this movie on DVD. I knew that the film would not correspond to what he had promised me on the other side of the matter, but as soon as I saw that he had a Leather face (Gunnar Hansen), I had to remove it. It starts out pretty well, with the premise that snuff films are transmitted by cable. However, the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her at all, and the end of the film really leaves you alone. There are too many unanswered questions. In the end there was a great scene, which completely caught me off guard, but overall it was a very low quality film, but I think it cost $ 3.99 for rent.
