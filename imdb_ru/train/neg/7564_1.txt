Wicker man. I am so angry that I can not write the correct comment about this film. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, subtly connected, and in general - just suck. Nicolas Cage ... shame on you! I assumed that, since you were in it, it would at least be decent. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> I felt that huge parts of the film remained on the floor of the cutting room, and even if it was completed - the film was just outlandish and stupid. <br /> <br /> In the end, you remain unresponsive, your mind is confused, and the taste is hurt. I have never heard so many people leave the theater on the opening day with such hatred. People complained about this in small groups in a shopping center, four floors from the theater near the entrance. This is so bad. <br /> <br /> I heard this compared to: Glitter, American werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so angry that he didnâ€™t even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
