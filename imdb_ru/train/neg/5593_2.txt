I love Dracula, but this film was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies when I was younger, and I thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I don’t know if my youth was deceiving me, forcing me to believe that Lee was the greatest Dracula, with style, appearance, appeal and evil under it. Or maybe this particular film disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula with a snobbish English accent and sign language to go along with him? Do you like it when the plot contains unrealistic choices of characters, is boring and devoid of any tension? Then this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I don’t see it! I gave him only 2, because somehow I managed to stay awake for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you liked this film, it means that you were deprived of sleep and were left alone at home in a dark room with a lot of unallocated space behind you. Maybe one in your parents' house or in a stranger's house. After all, even the characters of this film did not seem frightened, and I think this sums it up! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this film because of its place in the history of the cinema of Dracula, perhaps it was fascinated by how the History of Dracula turned from Nosferatu into what it is today. Because, like the film, it is not so attractive, it does not pull you to the mysterious secret, which for me makes the myth of vampires so exciting. <br /> <br /> And besides, there are so many strange 70s in it. The scenery looks like a cheap theater. And I do not say that I reject everything that was done in the 70s. Because I can love both the old film and the new one.
