If you plan to watch this movie, please reconsider. I usually do not publish my comments about what I saw on TV, but it was such a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get rid of this bad taste. Criticism of this film would take too much time, because there is so much bad in it. I'll just say, please, never watch this movie. It was a waste of my time, and it would be a waste of yours. Anyone who has written a positive review about this film is one of two things; totally inept or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee that you will really regret seeing this movie!
