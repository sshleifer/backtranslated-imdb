There is only one word for this movie. Terrifying. The director obviously has talent, but, like his character Robert Carmichael, he throws all this away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but, like Kray, he cannot be concerned about his use. Cray, seeing the British youth, is drawn into a petty crime, and then lowered into depravity. Like the British tabloids, this film portrays young people without aspirations and respect. Cray calls for attention, but does not deserve anything. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by the act of violence that Cray decided to push into the audience’s face. He assumes that viewers are not aware of the atrocities of the world. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on the wall of the toilet, it shows us male depravity with teenage glee. <br /> <br /> Some high quality actors have small roles in this film. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both appear briefly. The rest of the acting, the boys Joe and Ben are engaged in the hype. Daniel Spencer’s Carmichael spooky. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of famous chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); how she was able to subject herself to such a test is hard to believe. The film is never thin, and Monica is approached with the most merciless violence associated with hostilities. Military images are used to convey the idea that young people cannot help themselves, that acts of violence will take place even in "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and a symptom of our altered society, where men occupy an increasingly important position, but Cray falls to the level of barbaric men whom he seeks to reveal using such cruel and cruel images. The female characters in the film offer no relief. They are either victims or, in the case of Manville, the laundered mother. Community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Kray's first movie. I listened to what he said during the question and answer session in Edinburgh, and he is not indifferent, he simply lacks experience, and his film demonstrates his naivety. The film should be released later this year, but I hope the company will go bankrupt, because the public really doesn't need this spoiled material.
