it's just a terrible comedy - it's a really bad movie. No funny items. no funny jokes. I don’t know how some people may argue that this dark short film can be “the smartest” or “quality”. Perhaps if this is the only film that a person has seen, you can declare your brothers. but I have seen thousands of the best films: namely, Leonard, part six (now it's funny)! I don’t know how the brothers are even considered suitable for inclusion in the movie database on the Internet: it’s more like a home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Don't mind this, just skip this movie. The root canal is more pleasant than this unfunny stuff.
