Doris Day never lets a bad script let her down. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually goes unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by the real shock of New York in 1965, but actually adapted from Claude Manierâ€™s French play in the late 50s, gives Doris little, but she forges her own image of kindness in the second half, be comical sedative (that funny because the day turns the situation). There are a few funny lines here, but the entertainment of the material is clearly transferred from the play ... and instead of causing some funny incidents in the Big Apple, we are stuck in the suburbs. Colleagues Doris (Patrick O'Neill, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) are not very suitable for her, nor does she have a shapeless hairstyle that they wear on themselves. However, this is not scary, there are some loud laughter in it, and for daytime buffs it is absolutely necessary to see it. ** from ****
