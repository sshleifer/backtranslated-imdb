Unfortunately, I no longer remember the book, but I remember that I was fascinated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film represents the typical low-quality German production. This does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is simply poorly adapted. In the center of the misfortune are the characters, who are excessively simply exaggerated and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their actions. Even the famous and beloved German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddie Aren cannot save this poor sight. However, there is hope ... They told me that films are getting better and better after that. So in conclusion, I must say that this film does not deserve a cinematic screen, but may be enough for a lazy day.
