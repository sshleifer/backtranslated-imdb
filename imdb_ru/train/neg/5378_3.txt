I watched this film, not really expecting much, I got it in a bundle of 5 films, each of which was rather terrible in its own way, so what could I expect? and you know what I was right about, they were all terrible, there are several (and some stretching it) interesting points in this film, a random view of the video camera is a pleasant touch, the drummer is very similar to the drummer, that is, damn annoying and in fact, the problem is that it is so boring that I can only assume that it was an attempt to create tension, nothing happens, and when it happens it is extremely tiring (I had a big thumb on the quick button. Forward, ready to pressing for most of the f llama, but she was running), and seriously, the lead singer looks very good, because they don’t half mention how handsome he is, damn it, I thought he looked a bit merkat, all of this, and I didn’t even mention the killer , I will not even go into details, it is simply not worth explaining. In any case, as far as I understand, Star and London is the only reason to watch it, and with the exception of London (which was actually quite funny), it was not because of their acting talent, I, of course, saw much worse but I also saw much better. It is better to avoid if you are not bored to watch how the paint dries.
