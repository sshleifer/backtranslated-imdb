This film probably had some potential; My bewilderment is how these completely prosaic, unfunny themes continue to appear in theaters, as if ideas are being processed only because of generations. Truly, the cerebellar fists are like dogs in most movies, they come back to swallow their own vomit. Well, now they are 19 bucks richer because of me. It was not creative at all, there was no salutary moment, something remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and there was nothing funny in the trailer), the performances were tense (especially Molly, absolutely unconvincing). It was theoretically supposed that some comic relief was a homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films; none of his analogies failed, his small moral discourses were useless, I literally waited for them to say something meaningful, only to find out what he had finished. The so-called "hard-10" - the most tasteless plastic creature of all existing (except the horse face with a strange smile); Honestly, I discovered that her friend Patty (called “Hamburger”) looks much better than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, in any case, the whole premise is that society is superficial, and if love is true, it goes beyond all social fronts; as they showed, the man shaves someone else’s scrotum and the routine of premature ejaculation millions of times disfigured and beaten to death by a horse (with obvious hints of American pie and happiness - the last one in a disgusting denouement of a scene involving a family dog). I feel as though the film is similar to related jokes, which turn into an ignorant miserable tangle of untreated sewage. Goes to show that marketing can promote anything there, highlight any sinister mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). Made with a tirade.
