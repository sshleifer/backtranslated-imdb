Yes .. it is definitely there with some of the worst MSTifyed films, but I definitely saw the worst. Think Gremlins rated R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloan at some science fiction congress, which is amazing that he lectured! It was one of those deals with a very low budget, where everything goes, everyone contributes (if you wanted to see shit, you had to see what some of my friends and I brought). <br /> <br /> He seemed to be a very good guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments about Hobgoblinov, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said that he likes the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> In general, Rick Sloan knew what he was doing. And I think it is meant for the bad, like Mars Attack. So I think that I support this film and give it 5, and betray all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.
