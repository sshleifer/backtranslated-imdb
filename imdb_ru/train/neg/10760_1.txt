This “film” is the culmination of all the bad in modern cinema. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary switching / jumping / flips, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogues ... mostly unnecessary. (This word? Well, I just thought it up, robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened to the practicality? (i.e., garage, spray for skin). The only tool that demonstrates a combination of futuristic and realistic functions is brushing cards in a cafe. <br /> <br /> What happened to respect for women? (i.e., Smith's character does nothing except to humiliate the doctor in most of the film, and yet she still “wants” him. /> <br /> What happened to the detective who discovered? Smith did nothing, except sitting around and feeling sorry for himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something that caused the thought that it was turned off, this is such an unfortunate way to get the story from the bcd-etc item ... it was normal once, but not several times in a row. (speaking several times in a row, what is “I snore and do not listen to your joke? Twice in one scene?”) <br /> <br /> What happened to the small parts in the film, which were somewhat significant and not just a tool to promote the scenes of salvation? Shea LaBouf (child) in the film a total of two scenes, we know that he humiliates women and he knows Smith ....... so of course, we have to take care of him and whether he will bring harm, <br /> <br /> What happened to the heroes? Let's just forget that everywhere people, women and children attack robots and selfishly save the only person from whom I believed that I had an acquaintance, and why he had to disperse his bike through the air, showing off, while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the spectacle. But I'm also for the sake of all realism and meaning. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have never laughed so hard in the film for a long time. so thank you Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray that the social pendulum will return to simpler methods, simpler stories and simpler ones in films ... but mostly to simpler methods. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Militants: “You Must Die That Way”
