Calling the film “Thinner” bad is just the same as calling the Earth Round or Pauly Shore not talented. No news, but how they got this way is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> With regard to this film ... The book was good, even if it was a bit derived from other stories from the genre of "be careful what you want." Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills a gypsy daughter and is cursed by her father (Constantine from the TV Room 222) to a few pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it all starts well, but why involve a gangster (Mantegna)? Why shoot automatic weapons so much? Why turn it into something so dependent on FX? I thought it would be much more effective if he focused more on the subtle consequences of the insanity of weight loss, illness, death, Gypsy knowledge and the like. <br /> <br /> But no, it is not. Remember, this is Stephen King, we are talking about. <br /> <br /> And the ending ... is almost the same as in the book, but too talkative. In fact, the whole film speaks too much, feeling that he must explain every turn of the plot to us. Not that I was expecting a “Dead Zone”, but I could have done without another “Sematarium of Pets”, thanks anyway. <br /> <br /> One star, at least trying to do a decent half-way makeup job. However, the rest of the film remained ... say it with me ... Thinner.
