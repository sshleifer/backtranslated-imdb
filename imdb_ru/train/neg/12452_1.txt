This film is so bad that I can't even describe it. What's wrong with burning writers, producers and director? How the hell did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is ridiculous, acting is bad at best, history ... What story? The first fight in this film is fine, but then it repeats until you want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I lost the most if I didnâ€™t turn off this stupid movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING ABOUT THE SPEATER *** <br /> <br /> I saw this film only because it was Scott Adkins ... and he was in it ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 out of 10 because it is of the lowest quality IMDb. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: watch the movie of Uwe Boll instead ... twice ... it's more worthy of your time.
