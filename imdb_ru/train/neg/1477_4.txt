I saw Dolemite, as well as (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other great works of Canon Blaxploitation from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film “The Human Tornado” (aka Dolemite 2) will always hold a special place in my heart. A human tornado cannot surpass simply nonsense, lack of skills in filmmaking and absolute enthusiasm (to be honest, too much). <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old friend Dolemit shakes with a white woman when several racist local police raid the house for no good reason and you won’t find out! The woman in bed with Ol Dole is nothing else than the sheriff's wife. Her cry, when she sees him: “He made me do it!” Dolemit's cry: "& $ * @ $ are you really ???" Subtlety was never his forte. <br /> <br /> Highlights? Cameo of a very young Ernie Hudson (known from Ghostbusters), continuity mistakes (characters look one way to one side, and the other to another, Dolemite's costume changes colors in each frame of his nightclub act) and the demonic Queen Bee’s eyes in her first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Man really thought he looked cool in this movie? I certainly don’t know why, but you should admire his enthusiasm. Whether it's jumping completely naked from a cliff or rhyming the orders of his gang (for example: Quickly! To the cave! I have a plan to allow this mother $ * @ (% to dig his own grave!), Which a person commits Of course. He goes overboard , never more than ever, when he does kung fu. The climate battle is shot at high speed, but sometimes it slows down to allow Rudi to pose and grit his teeth. I'm not sure that they wanted it to look too much like sped up the movie like effect or if they really want We believe that it was so fast. In any case, The Matrix is ​​not like that. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, very similar to the original Dolemite This is an incompetent movie of enormous size, but at least At least it's fun, and, of course, you should pay tribute to these people for their efforts. Just not so much. Enjoy my heart recommendations.
