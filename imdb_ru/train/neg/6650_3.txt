I think this film would be much better if the Cajuns were portrayed in a more believable light. My family is from the southeastern region of Louisiana, and I live in southeastern Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard that the people around whom I grew up spoke like these people. Cajuns were portrayed as backward bulls. Most of the Kajuns I know are well-educated, proud people and do not seem at all uneducated when they speak the way these people did. In general, it was a good film with great landscapes and music. I understand that the authors were from Lake Charles, and they have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all Kajun, please ask the actors to learn the language, live among the people you represent, and get a full understanding of how they are before go trying to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe that they are this person, this is a much more pleasant movie!
