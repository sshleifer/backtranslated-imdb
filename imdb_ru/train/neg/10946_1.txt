"This Malcom show on FOX really does murder ... can't we make our own version?" Of course, I think and paraphrase, but in our hearts we all know that this is true, and that NBC added only sex to the Malcom metric. And boy, they added sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker pulls out a standpipe and covers it with a skateboard. Tucker accidentally comes to his aunt in the shower, and she accuses him of watching and beating her. He is spying on a cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window, and she knows that he wants to see her topless, but she teases him, smiling and closing the window. And this is all in the pilot version. <br /> <br /> Take it from an adult male - the boy's puberty is so sexually insane and due to the testicles that it is impossible to make him ridiculous for the main audience. The only time anyone ever approached was in a movie, and you can count it on one side. It is therefore not surprising that Tucker has the warmth and attractiveness of a bathroom in a strip club. Did the network really think that we would like to watch children struggle with puberty? Isn't that what people go to prison for? If in doubt about the depravity of the series, think about it: 13 episodes were shot, but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes were released; Then they made an unprecedented “burn-in” of the remaining episodes, airing them in midnight so that the children would not see them. Ironically, since the children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to general lightheadedness, Tucker has a voice-over off-screen from the main character to flesh out a crappy letter. Even in 2000, it was terribly outdated, with its unusual music and super-sarcasm. I didn’t like any of the characters to laugh at jokes, and the jokes just didn’t last a mile a minute ... NBC's shame for this dirty robbery ... they are better than that. <br /> <br /> Variety: C-
