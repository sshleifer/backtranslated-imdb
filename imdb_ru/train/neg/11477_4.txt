Sorry, my neighbors are from Nevada, but this is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian had too many Botox because he had very few facial expressions during the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Alice looked as if she had a blackboard on her back. She was tough throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I looked at Alice and Brian and was surprised to see an extensive biography of the work. I would have guessed that they were freshmen. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason frankly carried the film with their banter and ease in every line. Ed, of course, did not lose his charisma. I wish I could meet him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I like the snow scenes and the scenes in the shops and the church, because I was there. I am making Nevada City my home and was looking forward to the premiere. I was sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
