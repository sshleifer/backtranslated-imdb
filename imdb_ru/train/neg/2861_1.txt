I can't believe that I wasted my money to rent this film. I thought it was a porn movie when it started, and it is never better. Acting, music drown out the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie to the end, because they knew that music would drown out conversational lines. I was never able to tell about the slaughter or the need to continue to show how cows and pigs are killed. What does this have to do with the "real" killer of the BTK? I understand why there were no famous actors / actresses in this film. The script would turn me off on the first page of reading. You'd better have the paint dry.
