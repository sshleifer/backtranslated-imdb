I recently saw on Broadway a renaissance of the Giddy Spirit with Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christina Eberzol and Jane Atkinson in the lead roles. This is an amazing production that shows that good actors can do with a play that is not perfect. Angela Lansbury is very funny, like Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> It was probably a mistake to check the lead version of the movie with Rex Harrison. There is no energy or laughter from good stage production in the film. <br /> <br /> “Blithe Spirit” is probably one of those plays that works best with a live composition in an audience full of people who have a good laugh. Actors can improvise, add touches and nuances to their performances and storylines, and also attract an audience on a personal level that is not in the cinema, or on a DVD, where the audience is separated from the story at the Fourth Wall. History: Charles Condominium (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in a house in the English countryside. In search of information for his next book, a book about the supernatural, Charles invites Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, repeating her role from the original London production of 1941), a local spiritual mediator, to her house to conduct a session. Charles believes that spiritualism is a deception, but he hopes to catch the "tricks of the trade." But then Madame Arkati returns the ghost of Elvira (Kay Hammond), Charles's first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave and develops the rivalry between Ruth and Charles (complicated by the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira). <br /> <br /> On stage, actors can give performances that cause laughter in this situation. But on the screen, the actors from the Spirit of the Frivolous “break the lines, as if they do not know that someone is listening to them. They mutter the lines that were designed to laugh on the stage. The performances of Harrison, Cummings and even Kay Hammond are flat and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor in the role of Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> The Oscar-winning visual effects in the film are not impressive - not only by today's standards, but also by 1946 standards! They consist mainly of the fact that Kay Hammond walks in fluorescent green clothes and make-up, and she is photographed with special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost. <br /> <br /> The cinematographer deserves credit for creative lighting. But compare the boring visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" with truly innovative effects in Disney's "Song of the South", which won the award for the same year. In the "South", people and animated characters divide the screen smoothly within a few minutes. Compared with the "South", Oscar, which "Spirit of Bliss" received for special effects, was completely undeserved. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can only encourage you to catch the Broadway revival of this play with Angela Lansbury before it closes. As for the movie with Rex Harrison, skip it.
