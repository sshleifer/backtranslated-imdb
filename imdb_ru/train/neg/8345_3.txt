This film could be much better, especially considering the talent. Larenz Tate portrayed Frankie Lymon is not very good, especially in musical performances. He doesn’t sync well, and his stage manners are Larenz Tate, when he was supposed to be Frankie Lymon. Hollywood is written on the image of women as a group of gold miners. A force that clearly pushed him, but it only made the characters more unreal. The image of Miguel Núñez in the role of Little Richard and Richard’s cameo became the positive part of the film. Lela Rochon, as usual, is an amateur even in a conservative role. It is a pity that the talents of Halle Berry and Viviki A. Fox were wasted. The whole saga of Frankie Lymon was exciting in real life. It is a pity that this film was a missed opportunity.
