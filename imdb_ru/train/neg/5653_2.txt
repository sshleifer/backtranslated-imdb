So to speak. I actually get this movie. I understand what the writer / director was trying to do. I understand that the dialogue was supposed to be dry and unemotional. I understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climatic and stale. That was what the writer / director was going to. Very, very, very dry humor / comedy. With all this understanding, I still think the film sucks. It seemed that the screenwriter / director was trying to recreate Napoleon's Dynamite with this film. It had all the same features. Even the main character behaved like Napoleon. But Napoleonic dynamite was really funny. His script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Well, let me rephrase that. His only goal is to disrupt the Napoleonic dynamite and try to capture this appearance. It is a pity that it did not work.
