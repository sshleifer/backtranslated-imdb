It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas, thereâ€™s not a drop of truth in this film. As if they took the name of the BTK and made up the rest. On top of that, it seemed that someone looked like I only have $ 20 here, take it and make a film, and oh, yes, do not worry about researching BTK, you just make up something. seriously pure dope, no one should ever watch this movie. The scenes of killing cows and forcing his victims to eat food and the description of killing animals BTK did not do any of this, but the film does it for the love of God, never see this horrible film of God. Made for television much better and more accurate.
