I saw about four other Japanese horror films, and they weren't too impressive. However, I felt that there was a reasonable scenario. <br /> <br /> Not here, by any means. We are talking about a detective who is trying to link the similar murders that occurred. When he finds a suspect for interrogation, he goes mad because he continues to see a ghost. Then the ghost begins to follow the detective story, because the reason, which is never explained, and raises more than half the film. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh no. The film is constantly changing the views on different characters who have nothing to do with the story. I have seen it before in other films, where it shows a different point of view. That's not the point. <br /> <br /> In addition, everything that happens on the screen, which is actually tolerable, quickly ends. For example, there are several scenes with a small instrumental score that accumulates and ... then it just interrupts another scene. I know this can have a dramatic effect. This is definitely not the intention here. This is just a bad edit. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a “ghost” who just screams is not scary or unintentionally funny. It is annoying, and it often happens throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All the panic attacks were made earlier in the best possible way so that you can see them all ahead. Then, after one of them, the movie is over. At that moment, a wave of confusion engulfed the audience, and I felt that we all felt that we had wasted our time. Someone scoffed and laughter followed. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, AVOID.
