These are, without a doubt, the worst films of Rajnikant. The first part takes place with the use of the comedy Gundamani, but gradually it becomes worse and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also digs in the Saints with the same name (Baba) through a banal and completely lame one-line. In the first half, Rajni says his usual set of martial arts and styles, and in the second half becomes quasi-holy after a beggar leads him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (and not the famous Saints, whom he dug earlier) gives him special power for no apparent reason (except karma). It really starts to get interesting, right? <br /> <br /> The rest of the film talks about how he spends his magical goods and powers, fights with politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable nonsense with a fun implementation. Yes, and black magic never acted on our hero, because he just had Param Vir ... uh ... Shakti Chakra with him. Bad guys and ordinary villains-politicians are political, overloaded with work and, in the end, completely irrelevant to the plot, which in itself is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> But, despite all the flaws, it was fun to kill time with and yell Baba associated with one line during public events. It is also interesting to watch others curse this film. They say that A. R. Rehman recorded the tracks for his film through a mobile phone. That's how he considered it important. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan, and he included two characters in this film (one of them is Keiko ... why not Samsung?) Of Japanese origin only for the sake of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and processed is absolutely pitiful. The Japanese can stop watching Rajni films when they see this. This film was probably a promotional material for Rajni, who entered politics, but the results of the film itself would have destroyed any of his political dreams. <br /> <br /> It's funny if you turn off your brain.
