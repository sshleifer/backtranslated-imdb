<br /> <br /> According to the reviewers, this is 1955, and the players are 20-year-olds from college who are going to go to graduate school. Fun joke! <br /> <br /> 1955? The keyboard of the synthesizer has not yet been invented, but there it is on the stage. The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet, but old music plays there. The synthesizer has been a model since the mid-1970s. Pony car at best since the mid 1960s. <br /> <br /> 20-year-olds from college? Josh Brolin saw 32 birthdays when this film was made for television. <br /> <br /> The plot is so predictable that viewers have enough free time to think about all the mistakes that appear on their televisions.
