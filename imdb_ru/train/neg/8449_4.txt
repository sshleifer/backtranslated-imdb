what a ridiculous story, blackmailing murder, accusations of sexual abuse of children, gays and the catholic church ... an absolute deception. As it turns out that most British television dramas, sit-coms, etc. Must include a mandatory "gay", now it becomes really tedious. Everyone acknowledges that there are gay people in society, but there are other minorities, but we don’t want it to put pressure on our throats (I’ll dwell on this) in every single show. In addition to the above, the drama has evolved from pantomime, which could be an interesting little story, the priest was a pedophile, and gay everywhere, oh yeah, just to be completely PC, one of the gay pairs was black. I am surprised at how he even thought about it when he read the script.
