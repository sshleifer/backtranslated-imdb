It’s hard to describe this film, and you want to try not to shoot it too quickly, because you have a feeling that it might just be the perfect film for a girl of 12 years ... <br /> <br /> This film has a good concept - modern version of "Sleeping Beauty with a twist." There are some pretty dreamy pictures and some good sketches of a young boy's relationship with his lonely working mother and his classmate ... you can say that this is a good start, but then it became a little greedy, very greedy, it tries to become science fiction, drama , thriller, possible romantic love story, fairy tale, comedy and everything under the sun. The result just left the audience feeling inadequate. For example, the scene when a girl (played by Risa Goto) finally woke him up with a kiss (Yuki Kohara), instead of being romantic, she tries to be scary, so that we can make you laugh ... it's a cheap trick because he destroys all the expectations and emotions that he tried to create for the better half of the film. <br /> <br /> I did not read the original story on which the film is based (this is a famous work. Comic artist Osamu Tezuka is known for his intriguing and confusing stories.) I wonder if all the problems exist in the original story or did it happen in adaptation? This is quite illogical even for those who are accustomed to the “fussy logic” of these Japanese comics. For example, how did Yuki Kohara's character manage to get to the hospital in an instant (when it's supposed to be a long bus ride) to escape from Risa Goto's character in front of the cameras right after he saw her live interview on TV? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are directly copied (not very creative!) from other films, and they all seem rather pointless, i.e. the famous scene "The Lion pours his mouth" from the "Roman Holiday". <br /> <br /> The film tries to be everything, but in the end it turns out to be nothing ... it cannot be a fairy tale, and it was not enough jokes to be a comedy ... and it’s strange that there are some scenes that even seem to be unintended ghost movies. Nevertheless, one should pay tribute to the fact that he managed to overcome some of the feelings of the Japanese teenager. . <br /> <br /> When I watch this film, I have a feeling that there may appear films with an inscription with a warning: “This film can be suitable only for people under 18 years old”. , it would definitely be on the poster of this film. <br /> <br />
