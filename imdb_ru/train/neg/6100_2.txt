Efforts aside (this is not a review of good intentions, but about the final product), this film is poorly written, replayed and poorly directed. The story obviously had potential, but this story is not present anywhere in this film. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a man. She had passions, desires, love, pain, confusion, weakness and lack of self-confidence, like all of us. You will never know this from the movie about the role of the main actress. In fact, apply this to every character in the film, but in the case of Burton: every sentence is a speech. The epic of the main speech, as if from an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well in one of the meetings of the board of directors, and I understood that because she gives a speech! Each of her ideas is incredible in her context, and she comes up with ideas that sound like they’re taking a soul search in place. For example, when she sees a wounded man, she will start talking about the needs on the battlefield, about protecting soldiers, setting white flags, etc. A well thought out idea in seconds. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film deprives Clara Barton of her struggle. It takes humanity away from her and, in fact, reduces the price of everything she did, because the script is written in a cliché. The author does not know Clara Barton and seems to base her script on the article of the British Encyclopedia. (yes, they had those then) But hey, good Technicolor! (what's the difference)
