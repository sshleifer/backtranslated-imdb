Recently, they tried to shoot this film late at night in a cable television commercial. Do not believe deception. I was one of those unlucky to see this filth in cinemas. This is, in my opinion, the 3rd Worst Movie of all time, right behind Mac & Me (# 1 Worst) and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I must admit that they are all close and terrible! In fact, in this film there is nothing ridiculous, disturbing, or anything else that he talks about, so do not waste your money. The only thing for which it is good is to give the worst enemy. I'm not lying about that. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be the main candidate for this film. It's so awful. If you do not believe me, then you deserve suffering because of the suffering from watching it, which I doubt you can finish. Two thumbs enthusiastically down.
