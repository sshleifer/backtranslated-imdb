This film was almost unbearable to look through. I can go beyond the fact that it looks like he was filmed on a home video camera, and that this film should last several weeks, but the characters don't change their clothes, but the acting game broke the 4th wall into pieces for me, I saw how best to play a 4th grade play. In addition, the plot is unreal. If a man suspected a guy, he would have passed it. I was also very disappointed that all the killings were committed using weapons, what kind of blood. This is not an imitator that the Zodiac did not kill, using only a weapon that the authorities would know that it was not him. Another thing that really bothered me was what they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4, when itâ€™s the name of a book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, and not the name of the disorder. In general, I think that this film is not a film that could be made with a small budget, at least not as low as theirs, or they could make sure that they have better actors or more blood. A lot of people went on a low-cost route, without resorting to the terrible acting views on the Easy Rider, which included Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson, as well as a low budget.
