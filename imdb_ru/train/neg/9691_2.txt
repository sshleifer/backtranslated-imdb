This is a shallow hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic story about a jealous idea of ​​a young woman to separate her father and his bride. Is it incest or just a glance of a daughter with the Electra complex? What's the difference? All characters, except for Anna (Deborah Kerr), are empty and vile. Seberg is poor (I agree with the comment "boys with breasts" from the previous review). The plot worked out. This predictable material lasted about 30 minutes of the film, which, unfortunately, lasted for an hour and a half! If you want to see great dresses and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend “Catch a Thief”, in which you will get additional bonuses from the fascinating story and cute characters. <br /> <br /> I like it when movies entertain me. I personally do not care where to shoot the film. Anytime, anywhere, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some nice characters. It does not hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr, as a rule, plays well, and David Niven plays a disgusting role. <br /> <br /> Rating "2" is intended exclusively for Kerr and Niven, as well as for cinematography - rich color scenes and muddy, anticipating black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography in the world can not save a bad story with unpleasant characters. The ear of the sow is the ear of the sow. Therefore, watching this mess was a waste of my time.
