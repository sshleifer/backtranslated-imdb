It was one of the most ridiculous and poorly filmed films I've seen in a very long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I would try: a bad mistake. The film is supposed to show how the real killings of Son Sam impacted the area in the summer of 1977; what he really did was centered around the most boring characters who, I doubt, someone cared about their drug problems, marriage problems, and so on, etc. The scenes that portray the murders are only this, and nothing more; shooting, and then again on Saturday night fever! What is even more ridiculous is the choice of Spike Lee as a reporter in the movie: Spike, believe me, you are not Hitchcock, stay away from movies, it makes them worse. The stupidest scene had to be a dog speaking in a silly voice that was depicted on the stage in front of her, where she was supposed to be shot dead ??? Spike, what were you thinking about when you made this movie? I don't think at all what I think. People who think they will see a crime drama will heed my advice and donâ€™t waste their time or money on this loser. In this case, you better watch Jerry Springer! Waste film, I gave him 1 out of 10: a terrible deception.
