I only watched the first 30 minutes of this, and what I saw was complete shit. The scenes I saw were as bad as Ed Wood's movie. No, it was a hundred times worse. Ed Wood has the reputation of the worst director ever, but that’s not true; The idiot who directed this junk is the GOOD director in history. <br /> <br /> The American police officer has a German accent! The "police station" was a table in stock with a sign "Police station" hanging on the wall. There is a fistfight where the punches obviously miss about ten feet. <br /> <br /> This cop draws women, handcuffs them and leads them to the warehouse. He tells his cop partner to wait in the car. He then leaves the warehouse with a duffle bag. A police partner thinks that maybe something is wrong, that his partner may be a bad cop who kills these women, but he is not sure that this happens because he is an idiot! The dialogue is completely stupid, the game is terrible, and the characters act in the stupidest way I've ever seen on the screen. For a police officer’s partner, it’s quite obvious that he illegally kidnaps these women, he slaps them and takes them to the warehouse and returns to the car with a duffel bag with the body in it, and yet, a partner who doesn’t know what is happening there all the time! <br /> <br /> The director of this film is a cracker. I stopped the film after 30 minutes because I could no longer shoot it. This is supposed to be one of the worst films I've ever started to watch, and I will not spend any more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely useless.
