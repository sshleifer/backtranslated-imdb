Someone must tell Goldie Hawn that her teen career ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films released in recent years, an unequivocal disaster in which the two leading indulge in frantic exposure of their proprietary ticks, trying to make up for the bad script and the bad direction. This thing should be strangled at birth. <br /> <br /> I hope that John Cleese was paid a lot for the fact that his name was associated with this disaster. He is the only performer who has gone through this smelly mess more or less unscathed, his only mistake is the inability to understand that the rest of the cast will sink the picture.
