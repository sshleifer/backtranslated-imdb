Listen, I'm sorry if half the world is offended by this, but life is quite complicated. I don't need to look this way. I'm digging Anthony Hopkins, great time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew it would be Quentin's smoking pile. But this thing is not very successful and not daring, even if it is fussy. Well-prepared films have reasons for cuts and quick edits, and not an excuse for “oh, but this is a realistic interpretation.” This thing will make your head ache. This is the fastest moving picture, which generally will not lead you anywhere. I still love AH, and I will always give him another chance, but if you don’t have time to see bad ideas on the screen, skip it.
