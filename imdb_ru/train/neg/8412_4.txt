I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was really unhappy. Despite all the buzz of Oscar, this is nothing special. Anyone who was truly impressed with this film never bothered to see any of the real classic musical films. With the exception of Eddie Murphy’s wonderful musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is simply a glorified television film with no style or style. Just a group of fans to sing at each other! <br /> <br /> The first half hour was good, but I was annoyed at how Eddie Murphy’s stunning performances were cut off and interrupted by the installations. It was just the best songs and the best performances in the film. And the part of the movie “Rise to the Top” was the only part of the movie that had a consistent point of view or some kind of impulse. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a shapeless, disorderly mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually boring and included too many sound-like melodies. <br /> <br /> Condon did not try to turn any tunes into big shows, as I expected. Each number in the 2nd half was just one close-up after the other of people singing at each other. And the way they shot Hudson's big “love me” number was criminal! Condon just shot her, stamping the stage - no drama! God, it sucks! <br /> <br /> And pay attention to all the participants - this “singing dialogue” material can work on the stage, but it DOES NOT WORK IN THE FILM (see Embarrassing failures of Evita and Ghost). All that "I will show something, Efff-ieeee!" shit should have been left on the floor of the editing room. This is not a "song." <br /> <br /> Again, the film - with the exception of Eddie Murphy’s stunning performance - was nothing more than a glorified television movie. The megabucks must have been behind the PR work of this film! I wonder how much money was spent to give this one-to-one pre-release to beat Oscar buzz? In general, this film was, except for Eddie, nowhere near the Oscar movie! (with the exception of Eddie) I would rate it right there with Grease 2. GREAT disappointment, especially after all (very dear to me) hype!
