OK I understood. We must be terrified. The idea has been planted. A girl makes her dad and takes photos of it. Call me the shock rock genre, but I call for a clear detail of the act before I can fall in love with it. But do not expect me to watch soft-porn and became horrified that she “makes her father” ... I mean, it does not mean that the agreement will become a bit abused in the film industry for adults already infiltrating “rape and molestation” porn The horror is not what your mind can make you believe. This is what actually exists in the film. It is here that Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes soft when it becomes your own adventure.
