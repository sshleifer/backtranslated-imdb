It was a new record level among westerns. The letter is terribly bad, the characters cannot be emphasized, and they are disgusting or tasteless, the violence is terribly and technically not very convincingly performed. And Tobey Maguire shows us the other side of his talent, sleepwalking, passing through his part with these inexpressive eyes and his hoarse voice, which here only gives out mannerism. "The trip with the devil" is among the top five of my worst films in all of history, a western one that cannot be surpassed in a negative way.
