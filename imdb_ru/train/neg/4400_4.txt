One of the earliest films of Francis Farmer; at 22 she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby has a great voice, but the songs are not the best. Martha Ray and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy is probably great in its time, today is really banal. Roy Rogers also appears as a singer. In my opinion, it is worth looking, only if you are a fan of Francis Farmer and, possibly, a fan of Bing Crosby.
