I can not objectively consider this film. Not that I haven't tried, mind you, but I sit down and I look into VHS at the age, and I watch the discovery ... and suddenly I’m five years old again, and I squeeze my own Care Bear and watch the movie with open eyes and passionate heart. <br /> <br /> I can objectively see that this film is a bizarre combination of attractive talisman merchandisers and creepy pre-puberty children with evil abilities, who have a fine story and uninteresting animation. But my inner five-year-old says, “Wow! every time I think about it. So - I would only (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this film to those who saw it in early childhood and can cause an amazing power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) OR those cute cynical Gen-X / Y-ers who purposely look for surprisingly bad / strange (the category to which this film ... definitely belongs). For those who are really looking for an exciting movie or rewarding family entertainment: you can keep looking.
