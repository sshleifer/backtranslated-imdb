This movie is terrible. Give me a dentist anytime! Can you believe that one of the main television stations here in Arabia shot it like a Christmas movie! I can only assume that they expected to entertain the crowd with Dudley Moore, not this one. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle, she had more action, better plot, more drama, and much more interest than this loss of celluloid. Don't even look if you're drunk!
