The most awkward moment in this film is when Brady Corbet says “You bloomed,” near the end of the film. I practically died. I'm still not quite sure why the writers put this line there. Did this have to create romance? Because it almost got sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but the Thunderbirds film could do a lot. This film is not If he didn’t have a big Thunderbirds ’brand card, he’d be sent directly to the TV or preserved in post-production. Maybe even earlier. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing in the film is when the credits are rolled up and they play the Basted Thunderbirds song. I can't believe I wasted $ 7 by looking at it through pay-per-view.
