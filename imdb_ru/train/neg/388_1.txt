I hate most reality shows, and this is worse than Paris Hilton, and, of course, this is his company. But "you are fired" or "you were hired," how many seasons are there now? After watching the show, I wouldnâ€™t like to work for a guy with his ego and all that, and I think that watching the paint dry out has more entertainment valve. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear that only one person stood up and say "Donald, I am leaving, take some of my money and buy a decent haircut." I see he is even trying to buy fame in WWE wrestling. I hope it hurts him, so I no longer need to see his miserable face. It must be sad to want fame so badly, not to have talent and make yourself ass, trying to buy it. I would give this show a negative rating if I could, but it gets 1, and it does not deserve it.
