Where to begin? What is the best way to describe how awful this movie is ??? <br /> <br /> Let's start with humor. This is not very funny. Add a group of musicians posing as actors - Meat Loaf is terrible, and Deborah Harry is even worse. Sorry for poor Art Carney, who should have known better than he did in this film. <br /> <br /> And there is a plot. Roadie, whose life goal is to run an Alice Cooper show, meets a girl whose life goal is to be an Alice Cooper fan. At the very least, they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, when the film should end, they can't come up with a more believable last scene than ... well, I won't spoil it for you if you really want to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> There are certain actors who tell you that this is going to be movie “B” or perhaps worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me, and he plays a more prominent role. This is a sure sign that the film is likely to be not very good. If nothing else, the film justifies low expectations - even surpasses them, being worse than poor. <br /> <br /> Let's just say so. This is a movie with which all bad movies are compared. And no one is worse than Rowdy.
