Just as “This is madness, madness, madness, crazy world” is on the top of my list of all the greatest comedies of all time ever created, this film is at the bottom. (Of course, I could be wrong without seeing SAVING SILVERMAN) In other words, this is a lame, lame, lame, lame comedy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of ** ***
