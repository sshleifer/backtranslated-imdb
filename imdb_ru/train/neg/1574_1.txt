There is no story! The plot is hopeless! Filmed on the basis of a car with a stuck accelerator, without brakes and stuck automatic transmission lever can not be good! I would stop this car for one minute, if I was in it or in a police car that was constantly watching it. I feel sorry for the actors who had to put up with such a meager scenario. Several scenes in which some similarity with the action was greatly overestimated, and as far as possible from reality. In addition, there were a lot of gross errors, for example, the hood of an escaped car, which jumped out at a speed of 100 miles per hour. At first, it just folded over the windshield, as in reality, but then it was blown away. Later in the film, the car was observed with a hood .... <br /> <br /> This film was just annoying, stay away from him!
