Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a dumb, horrible ninja film, don't make the mistake. But it is also incredibly pleasant. This is largely due to the amazing presence of one Chuck Connors, who starred in the film, but actually shines in only a few scenes. I guess he should be something like Obi Wan Kenobi (“Cool Ninja Buster,” a boxed copy exclaims), but his “wisdom” is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says that this is a sign of mental retardation, and not extreme concentration. <br /> <br /> But in fact his two assistants, Sonny and Dennis, lead such a terrible dialogue that “Brooklyn,” as we call the colonel, tends to shine by comparison. Especially follow the logic of Dennis regarding the “genetic splicing” with which Sakura is associated. If you know anything about cloning, you will die of laughter. And yes, this is the main story guys. <br /> <br /> Sakura Killers is a terribly funny movie that is hard to find. I also won’t spoil the ending of the “trick” for you, except that it is perfect for Sakura Killers 2. It’s a pity that Chuck Connors is dead. :-( Because he has the smoothest ways to destroy a ninja.
