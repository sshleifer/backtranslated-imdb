the author of the book with the same name should not have allowed her name to be used in this film. If you read a book, this film takes such a liberal interpretation of real events in the book and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have little in common, except for the name and some superficial details. the film adds nothing, in terms of artistic value, to the bookâ€™s own literary achievement. <br /> <br /> for those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. Not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it offers nothing more while it moves slowly (for example, character development). Some viewers can be entertained by some graphic scenes of lesbian love later in the film, but you can also watch a special show for what they show there, and Isabel is a pretty cool and not original presentation.
