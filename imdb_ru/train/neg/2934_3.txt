Simon Pegg is starring Sydney Young, the stereotypically clumsy idiot Brit working as a celebrity journalist in this American comedy. After a very happy break, he begins working at the highly respected Sharps magazine, run by reliable Jeff Bridges in New York. This is more the Devil wears Prada, than Shaun of the Dead. An incredible love interest was caused by Kirsten Dunst, who works well with Pegg for a laugh, but does not exactly set fire to the screen with her passion. <br /> <br /> Sydney is experiencing some emotional problems, trying to solve, he has to forget about his journalistic principles in order to get material in a magazine. Of course, he is eventually seduced by the glitter and glamor of the celebrity world, especially young starlet Sophie Maes (Megan Fox from Transformers). Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced fans will wonder if Pegg himself has ever had such feelings in real life with this film and to some extent Run Fat Boy Run as one of Britainâ€™s best comic talents being destroyed by the United States. /> <br /> In general, this is a forgettable comedy. Please come back to us, Simon, we can forgive and forget.
