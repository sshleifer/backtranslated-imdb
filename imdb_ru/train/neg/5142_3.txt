After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he starred in one of the worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in films, Chaplin directed about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of advertising, editing, jokes, shooting locations, etc. This happens at the racetrack, where Chaplin and his friend are trying to enter without payment. Mabel Normand is also there with his friend, and Chaplin manages to get rid of his friends and Mabel. He then seeks Mabel on the podium without visible consequences for his behavior. There is a lot of farce here, but there is little more to recommend this film to others, except to watch Chaplin develop. The imprint I saw was badly damaged, which could affect his pleasure. Charlie Chase can be seen. * of 4 stars.
