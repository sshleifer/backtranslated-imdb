There are some things that I can never understand. Like this movie. What if I had really created a very cheap and stupid model of the Dino test site and a crocodile in Maya, and then proceeded to cut and paste it into an amateur video clip in which people screamed and were eaten by the same thing? How can anyone believe that a completely unreal CGI dinococ, which looks completely inappropriate, will affect the events in this film? I know that his B-class, low-budget and everything except producers, could do better than make a piece of shit that no one has ever seen to see or sit. It just does not make sense. Are people so stupid that they would accept it? Apparently so. For laughs? No, you shouldn't even laugh at this thing.
