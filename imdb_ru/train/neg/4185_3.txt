I give this film 3, because it is worse than cult films that deserve proper 2. Does it make no sense to you? Well, it is not necessary. This is another film about vampires with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase that incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) fight off the space race of vampire morons. <br /> <br /> Is it really uglier than that? The only good thing about this film was Natassia Malta with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I would like Michael Ironside and the DeLouis brothers to stop playing stupid roles in silent films! I mean, at least SeaQuest was good! I know Mr. Ironside in many films, that day he starred in 164 films !! It is true that he was rarely in the lead, but still!
