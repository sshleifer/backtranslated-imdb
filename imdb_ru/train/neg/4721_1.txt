Before watching this film, please read the reviews available on the Internet regarding the falsification of events in the film, in particular, its preconceptions regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men were expelled from Srebrenica and shot by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentarian also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations. Please watch this movie critically and read the reviews in advance. Most of the reviews state that the documentalist goes too far in his arguments, even if he raises questions aimed at a generally accepted point of view regarding war. The NYTimes review by Stephen Holden states that it would be “wrong to label this document pro-Serbian,” but one needs to call into question both the presentation of facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and the omission of the facts that instil Serbian forces. I do not recommend watching this documentary, but I warn you to study it especially critically (as always in any case).
