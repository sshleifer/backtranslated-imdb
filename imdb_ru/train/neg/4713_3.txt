As you can guess from my rating and the title of this review, I don’t like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people will say: “How do you know how bad it is? Have you ever watched it? ”, I watched this show a couple of times, because I study film and animation, and it's just that I keep a candle in line with my standards. <br /> <br /> First, I want to talk about animation, because this is one of the most confusing things I've ever seen. As in the first two seasons, or only in the first season, hand-drawn animation was drawn. I thought it was a good show when he was painted by hand, but then it switched to flash animation, and the quality dropped dramatically. <br /> <br /> So this is one punch in my eyes, but let's look at the history of the show. He tries too hard to be like Dexter's lab, but there are differences, because instead of one red-haired scientist there are two, and they are both women. There is a talking dog (why?), And the attitude of the parents has changed somewhat. I have others, but I don't think I can write them here (I don't mean a curse, but I mean, I don't know if there is a limit to words.). Everything else, though, is in place, even the DeeDee character Johnny himself. He just tries so hard to be Dexter, but it seems like a soulless fake. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about jokes. Remember that in Dexter's lab there were jokes about screams? Yes, a yell may be good for a joke or two, but Dexter's lab also had tricky remarks that made me go back and check to get a joke. Johnny Test just forgets about all this and just screams 50% of the time and stops the music whenever a silly joke or one liner appears. This is not a comedy, this is a stupid comedy (I know what some people think. Is it not a stupid comedy with three puppets? See this and Johnny Test back to back, and you laugh more at the first option.). Sometimes jokes are based on strange situations that, like Chowder, make me crazy. I have a rule for comics and comedy films: for many strange comedies, this is not the same, it makes you wonder: “What am I watching?”. <br /> <br /> It amazes everyone. Do not watch this show if you have respect for comedy in any way, form or form.
