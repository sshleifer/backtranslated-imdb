Nightmare Weekend proves that some people so desperately want to be "in the movies" that they are ready to do almost everything. <br /> <br /> I do not mean countless women who seem quite happy when they appear completely. in this terrible piece of garbage (after all, nude female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to play along with a poorly made doll named George. Now it confuses !!! <br /> <br /> Bioelectron, created by brilliant scientist Edward Breikk (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a mad felt clown with green wool for hair) - an artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that controls a revolutionary device (silver sphere the size of a golf ball), which, if ingested, can reverse character disorders. <br /> <br /> Edward's personality change experiments were successful in an animal lab, but a cautious scientist reluctantly tests people for fear of side effects. His wicked assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such doubts and continues to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. All of them inevitably turn into disgusting killer mutants. <br /> <br /> With special special effects in the basement, actors completely devoid of talent, and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes when I watched the movie, and even then Iâ€™m not quite sure that my synopsis is accurate) , Nightmare Weekend is a complete and complete disaster, which can save even a few soft sex scenes and a touch of blood. <br /> <br /> This movie also has one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a Walkman dressed in an idiot who plays the 80s music that makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
