First of all, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all, we are not a Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> Then take amateur actors. It will be good for the hype of the festival. In the end, who needs people who have honed their skills for years? Then hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to spark. You see, if it is well lit, it will not look “real” and the people of the festival will not like it. In any case, who needs a photo professional level? Then hire a ten year old child who never held a camera to be your cameraman. This will give your film a completely amateur touch, which festival viewers will take for "reality", and ensures that even if you make room for real people, critics and a small piece of the audience that is too intellectualized, they will shout "genius" because they are not believe that it was a complete amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Once you do this, buy a ticket to the Bad Films Festival aka Sundance. <br /> <br /> What a sad waste.
