* Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> “Return to the Lake House” is a useless movie. The acting was not good, and the plot was not even remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> “Lake Hut” is a good TV movie. There was no continuation. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and put much more into his character than this one. It seemed that he was not even interested in continuing. His game was good, but it could be better. I really do not want to comment on the other actors, because, in my opinion, they are not even worth mentioning. But I will do it. Alison's character is even hardly shown in the first part of the film. Suddenly she becomes the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role did not make sense, and it should have come up a little better. Dalia Salem was absolutely terrible. Her game was far below decent, and the actors had to look for someone else, someone else. Director Mike was an embarrassing character. He seemed to have the goal of being there, but it did not seem like his death was necessary. The acting for this role was good, nothing good, but better than that of Salem. <br /> <br /> The plot was very bad if you think about it. Stanley, who is considered dead, falls on the set of the film "Lake Hut", based on his script. He stumbles upon a director, and soon the director is dead, and Stanley leads the show. Yes, from nowhere the crew will simply allow this stranger to enter the picture and finish the film without knowing anything about it. There are some murders, not many, and those that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set receives an electric shock during the filming of the scene. Another character is chewing on a motorboat. And someone gets entangled in the plant before drowning. These writers must have been impatient to be excited. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed by the shooting of the film. The way it was constantly changing from a low budget to a normal one became annoying very quickly. In addition, a new lake house was poorly created. We do not show it, but only in a few scenes, and all this with a chain in the basement was useless. In the first film, it worked only because we were shown a much larger room, but this did not work out. <br /> <br /> In this sequel there were too many characters. All but a few had no reason to be there. The scene from that little shown was really bad, and ... they just had no purpose in this film. <br /> <br /> In general, “Returning to the Lake House” is a sequel to the sequel. from where the first one stayed. "Lake Hut" I can take, but this is not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided it, just like you. This is not similar to the first, and everything went too slowly. Nothing happened in the first hour, and it lasted another second. Not to mention that the letter was terrible. Put it on only if you need help to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> So we see that Stanley is defying death and is still alive and well. From the way he speaks, it looks like a third part of the film is possible, which is good in itself. Stop quitting sequels and we can be fine! <br /> <br /> (Didn’t the filmmakers realize that they showed us how they shot scenes with the lake from the first film? They were all made in a tank. Never, never reveal the secrets of filming.) <br /> <br />
