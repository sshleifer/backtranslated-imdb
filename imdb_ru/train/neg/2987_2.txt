The rewrite / translation in this film is completely ridiculous and provides the only entertainment in this boring and derivative zombie film. I didn’t laugh as hard in my life as I just watched Zombi 3 (and I’ve seen some really bad duplications in my life, trust me). Seriously, the filmmakers could edit this film, release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. This is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But ... If you fall off the couch, laughing at dubbing in the film about the zombie Fulci, is not your cup of tea, then AVOID THIS ALL COST.
