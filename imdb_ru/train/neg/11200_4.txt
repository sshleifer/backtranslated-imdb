The good guys in Webster's dictionary define logophobia as "fear of words." I can be just a logoophobe. For no combination of words scares me more than when the credits at the beginning of the film contain the words "Made, written and directed:" followed by the name of one person. I'm thinking about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few all-rounders. Even the most experienced directors, such as Spailberg and Scorsese, rarely take such control over their films. But there I was sitting in my place in the theater with popcorn in my hand and was going to watch “Order” when he was thrown at me like Nolan Ryan's fastball, with the words “Made, written and directed by Brian Helgeland”. Wow <br /> <br /> As a movie buff, I knew about Brian Helgeland. As a writer, his filmography for the last 10 years will look like the price of the shares of the dotcom company in 1998. There were so many theatrical troubles (Killers, Postman, Conspiracy Theory) as there were critical and award-winning successes (LA Confidential, Mystic). River). Did they seem to alternate? one is good, the other is bad, so knowing that his last BloodWork film was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood’s career, I sighed and hoped for the best. Looking back, I should not have exhaled. <br /> <br /> The Order is removed in the role of Heath Ledger (Helgeland's “The Story of the Knights”) as Alex Bernier, a priest in the order known as the Carolingians, who are summoned to Rome when one of the priests is killed under circumstances when Arca Bishop considers "curious." Having met Father Thomas (also from the Order and wonderfully played by Mark Eddy from Still Standings), they decided to solve the riddle left after the untimely death of the priest. <br /> <br /> Complicated questions are a storyline involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shennin Sossamon) who escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings for Mar, and for some reason, without knowing the audience, they are going to Rome together. <br /> <br /> Nira does not sleep at night, and Alex is confronted by William Eden (Benno Fürmann), who claims that he is an age-old Eater of Sins. The sin eater, as we are told, are those who eat the sins of a dying person when the church does not, thereby allowing them to enter heaven. William, fortunately, is tired of the healing life and is looking for Alex, who will take on the role and free him from worldly duties. Alex reluctantly, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex resorts to the Sin Eater ritual to save her, and the transformation is complete. Alex then looks for answers to his many questions, while Father Thomas uncovers the Vatican conspiracy for the transfer of powers to his fellow investigator. <br /> <br /> The Order is not a scary film, but terribly boring. There were funny special effects and no connection with the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - when Alex enters the dying Maru - she is pale and joyless and leaves us with no emotional reaction to the difficult situation of the couple. It seems that everyone speaks so quietly and without emotion that it would be possible to assign smooth lines of film and smelling salt, so that I would not try to take a quick nap in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> So Mr. Helgeland I beg you not to try it again. Share your vision with others and allow those who are more experienced to help guide you in directions that are not so limited and self-serving. Until then, there is nothing that shows that you are capable of anything more than just an unsatisfactory assessment. Two stars. <br /> <br />
