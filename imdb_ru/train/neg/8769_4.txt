It was a movie that I hoped to offer my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie to the end, I realized that I could not even watch this damn thing to close it. You are almost certain that the real war did not last so long. Others will try to question my patriotism for criticizing such a film. But, whatever one may say, you cannot go from watching "Saving Private Ryan" to LOC. Forget about the difference in the budget of the film or the audience - they do not interfere with the director to make a smart film. The length of the film is not so bad, and the fact that it repeats itself - they continue to attack the same hill, but give it different names. I thought the LOC - terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard. The sequences of character development (postman memories that look back at the last moments before deployment) should have occurred throughout the entire film, and not just formed into one long memory. To this day, I still have to see the final. But there was a much better movie (not to mention o) entitled “The Border”.
