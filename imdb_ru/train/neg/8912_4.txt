Dark Rising is your typical bad, obviously fast horror / fantasy / fantasy film. He has a strange, inexplicable plot with such large openings that an elephant can be inserted through them. Most of the time I didn’t know what the hell was going on, but it really didn’t matter, it was a simple demon hunter who had returned from the dimension of hell to save the history of vacationers with confusing material about witches and a book of evil plot elements and characters that do not make sense or disappear completely without a reason. The game is bad, but, frankly, there is little that they can do with this scenario, I suppose. There are a couple of topless scenes that are probably the only reason why this bad movie was shot (like many other bad movies). Give it a pass if there is nothing else on TV.
