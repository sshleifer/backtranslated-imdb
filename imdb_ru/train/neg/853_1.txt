Well, to be honest, I don't understand why everyone thinks it's so great. This is really not the case. Two good things came out of this movie: 1. Jack's play, he was very good, I can give him a hat 2. Danny's performance, he was good. There is no other that it became rather stupid. And what did Stanley Kubrick think, calling Shelly Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she was scared. The problem with this film was the ending. I would relate more to this if Kubrick would end it differently. And the whole movie was just stupid. The problem with the film is that the book was much better. So do not watch the movie, read the book, and you will be much better. 3/10.
