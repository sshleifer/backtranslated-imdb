This film is so bad, it's funny. In fact, the Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this movie to ridicule. I suggest watching it (perhaps on YouTube) instead of actually watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch Hobgoblinov if you are not ready to stop at the first scene. Actually, don't watch this movie, period. You are welcome. At least not seriously. His jokes are not funny (to say the least), and it will be much more fun for you to parody or watch a parody of him than to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel nauseous when watching, so spare yourself. To read a book. Wash. Everything is more fun than watching Hobgoblinov.
