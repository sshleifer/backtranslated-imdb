The Dark Wolf (Overview) Let's get back to this: it's a disgusting piece of rotting road killing with cow shit on it. That film is an atrocity. This is a city film about werewolves, in which one of the worst actors you can imagine was filmed, and the story is as weak as that of any boring nerd from the school drama film of the 80s. Worst of all, poor Kane Hodder was deceived into playing a giant evil werewolf. Kane fucking hodder. Someone is trying to make Jason Voorhees play the pinnacle of his film career ... <br /> <br /> In any case, former partner Jaime Bergman also participates in the film, and in the end it also becomes a werewolf. It's kind of a shitty police drama with the worst werewolf in the world. But it has moments of almost unbridled nudity. But that's all. Want to know more? Okay, a werewolf, as a rule, looks like an ugly black spot, sweeping across the screen. And when we have enough privileges to see the sequence of transformations, we get something like a video in full motion from a video game made in the early stages of the Playstation. First Playstation. The CG animation is really so primitive. Good only for terrible fanatics who want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
