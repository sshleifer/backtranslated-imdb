This film receives both a 6/10 rating from me, as well as a 9/10. And here's why: as a standard horror movie for a standard horror crowd, where actions, blood and fears are taken into account, this movie will tire you out. In fact, this is a family drama, similar to the one you saw on Lifetime channel, but placed in a horror universe. The history and formula are outdated, reviewed hundreds of times. If you are looking for originality in the structure of the plot or minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take away the zombies, and you get something as melodramatic as "Beautiful Mind," stumbling over cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic overview and idea is rather original and superfluous. This is literally what you and your friends would joke about when you got drunk. but this joke really got a theatrical performance. The idea gets 9/10 from me. The only reason he is not perfect is that they could go even further, but they did not. <br /> <br /> The combination of the two is mixed. I thought it was funny, but like most comedies, it was NOT so funny. My mother and younger sister watched it with me, and the jokes that we did about it were funnier than the written jokes. There were moments of complete genius, but there were moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films will go for this kind of excessive risk and original ideas. I just can not say that he was perfect or even close to him due to the lack of originality of the plot. <br /> <br /> Great family movie. Great movie to watch with a group of guys (or girls). Great movie to watch with anyone. but, if you look it alone, it will be a little boring. Other people always make such a movie funnier and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
