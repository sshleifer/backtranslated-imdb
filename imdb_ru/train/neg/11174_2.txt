Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neill? Richard Schiff? My mouth watered. I dropped everything to watch this movie on Kabel. 30 minutes I had problems with wakefulness. After 60 minutes, I pressed the record button and fell asleep. Finished looking the next morning. Shouldn't have worried. What a waste of a great cast and ideas that could be an interesting story of "A Day in Life ...". Cure your insomnia, if you have one, and watch this movie. I guarantee you at least a half hour of uninterrupted sleep. The dialogue is terrible. Continuity does not exist. Working with the camera could have been done using the portable Super 8 and would have looked better. <br /> <br /> This film was a complete disaster.
