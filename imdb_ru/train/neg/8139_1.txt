Or maybe it is. In any case, “The Bat People” is about as flat as a carpet, as soft as a bag of flour, and as exciting as a stone ... and as smart as all three combined. <br /> <br /> Okay, the plot is in a nutshell (a suitable vessel is ...): the doctor (Moss) is bitten by a bat when he checks the cave with his wife (McAndrew), and subsequently turns into a bat - well, not exactly a bat, but a bat as a creature that looks more like a werewolf that kills its victims from the point of view of the camera from the first person ... <br /> <br /> But this is up to the sheriff (Pataki) which is about the worst kind of sheriff: hik kind. He harasses people, he looks at married women, he steals handkerchiefs from haberdashery (FEND!), He smokes with one of these mouthpieces in his mouth and at the same time speaks, making him look and sound like Buford T. Justice in Smokey and the Bandit and (this is the worst part) ... IT'S THE MOST PROBABLE CHARACTER IN A WHOLE FILM! <br /> <br /> Although the entire film is just a television film about weekly crap (in this case, guano). This is an AIP to cry out loud! What did you expect, Oscar things? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about the film, which even MST3K cannot save? <br /> <br /> How about ... without the stars "The Bat People", full version OR MST3K version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if the continuation of this film ever comes out, I bury my TV.
