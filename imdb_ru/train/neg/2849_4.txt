Some have compared this film to “Last Detail,” but “Hunters” are flatter than the interstate highway in western Texas. And, like the landscapes in the desert, there is nothing to be distinguished, even the fact that this time two prisoners of the Navy are transporting a female prisoner. Nobody in the cast is too good; with this settling scenario it is not surprising. I don’t think that director Dennis Hopper will not give much space to this if he ever writes a memoir.
