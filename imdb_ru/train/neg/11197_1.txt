What was the worst movie of 2003? "Cat in a hat?" “Gigli?” It's not like that! I believe it was this terrible little film from last year. Poorly written, poorly edited, and (if I can be so bold) badly acted, “Order” is the black hole of the film — a film so dense that even the slightest entertainment cannot escape the horizon of suction. It is not even accidentally funny, like, for example, “Showgirls”. <br /> <br /> You know that producers assume that their audience will not be very smart. They renamed the film, originally titled Sin Eaters, because they thought Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was, although they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the film. Instead, they depict a completely general headline, and the image of Heath Ledger, looking sullen, is more than enough to take you there. <br /> <br /> And hey, what do you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw a picture of Heath and pulled me in. Congratulations, producers, you met your target market. She also liked Grease II, so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Returning to the topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk according to a certain (you guessed it) order that his mentor is trying to investigate the murder. He has problems of celibacy, perhaps, because no one in his right mind would believe that he knew anything about religion, and even more so was not a celibate monk. The only other member of this order is the funny fat man-alcoholic. As much as I wanted to see the funny alcoholic returning to the big screen, his humor attempts reminded me of all the jerks in my school who imitated Monty Python, thinking that if they just said lines like Pythons made them automatically funny. You know what people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I say something else, I’m facing the generation of spoilers. Honestly, what spoiled this film for me was that it was created.
