The worst film of David Lin. Even "In which we serve" was not as bad as that. Usually a film with a really good reputation, such as this one, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes it possible to understand why it can be considered a classic. But after watching this, I just could not understand why this piece of shit was so liked back in 1945! I didnâ€™t like the acting style, tough British manners, the story, the script (which can sometimes be quite witty, but completely meaningless) and the soundtrack. The character of Elvira was supposed to be attractive and attractive, but in fact he was ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Just another movie that convinced me not to trust the reputation of the film. Another very overvalued "British classic".
