This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Not just a story, but a terribly bad game. The dialogue sounds like someone is reading the news. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy / drama / romance, this is not one of those things! This is a small action, that's all. There really is no comedy and drama at all. <br /> <br /> If you went to the movies to see this, I feel sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Virtually everything else you choose will be better. This is largely an action / crime scene. Scenes of action were lame, and part of the criminal history was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in a good story or a good game. And you just want to look at the "foreign" film to find out that he is a foreigner. Then it can be for you.
