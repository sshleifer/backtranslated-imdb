It was on the 30th anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, brilliantly in itself, but not this. Nowhere have I seen the name of Mel Brooke here, and I can guess why, he has much more sense not to get involved with this pilot. My goodness, who would find this funny. Of course, there may be problems with the race, but for me it’s just not funny, well, because it’s just not funny. As if the writers didn't even try to be funny, just to make money from the connection with Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? With all their might, they didn’t care. It was a fast cash cow, which, thank God, was not cashed. I think this is only useful for historical purposes or just to show how stupid and inconceivable Hollywood writers can be.
