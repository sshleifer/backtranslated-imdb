This film deserves praise for the original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic narration. Unfortunately, it falls on all levels. The biggest weakness of films is the unwillingness to do anything; there are camp, moralistic and epic elements that are never used for any of them. As for the story itself, Cretienne de Troy is spinning in his grave in this terrible adaptation that turns the attractive, unbearably innocent Percival into the most awkward and rude person. <br /> <br /> Two types of people will most likely see this frankophil or arturiofil. Speaking as one of the last, I found the film an invisible and incredibly battered, disrespectful attitude towards a beautiful story.
