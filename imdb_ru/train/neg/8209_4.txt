The game, despite other reviews, was remarkably well done. Brad Pitt is doing quite well with the role of an annoying, nasty Austrian climber. Other acting games are fine. The story could be exciting, but for some reason it is not enough - no one ever understands and does not care about the characters shown, and therefore a story that could be quite dramatic does not appeal to this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful landscapes and cinematography, a surprisingly dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world in which we live - but I could not, as I could, get myself involved in this story. As a shameless fan of Brad Pitt (I consider him one of the 5 best actors of my generation), I expected * to love this movie - and yet he left me cold. <br /> <br /> This may be a failure within itself, but I tend to point to the creative end of this film — the direction, the scriptwriting, the production, the editing — somehow they lost me. It's a shame, because it could be wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it was supposed to be great. It was probably worth a look, just to solve it, but do not expect too much, and perhaps you will not be disappointed as I am. Basically I'm sick of it.
