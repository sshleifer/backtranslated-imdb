when you get into scenes where Albert Brooks is shirtless ... try not to choke on the fur ball. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I saw most, if not all of his films, but I saw this one for the first time. Modern Romance - an interesting look at the theme of love. There are several films that cope with the despair of love as clearly as Modern Romance, although the 1979 Winter Cold Scenes are very close. In fact, they both deal with obsessed men who are too psychologically attractive / obsessed with their women. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, when “Cold Scenes of Winter” border on the subject's pursuit, this film has a more reasonable basis for the subject. love, because both people are already in a relationship ... and outside the relationship ... and again in them. <br /> <br /> And because this is a film that was released in 1981, its time in terms of styles and such. This is the main reason I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is: “If it sucks, at least it may have some historical significance,” you know what time capsules are. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the horrible scenes of shirtless Albert Brooks. <br /> <br /> A man is a hair. Very hair. As if he is wearing a black curly fur sweater with hairy hair. And even worse, he looks almost like a victim - hairy. This is not a pleasant sight, and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on. Back in the early 80s, hairy men were considered normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009, the sight of something like that is simply disgusting. Sorry, Albert! I would like someone to say at some point, "Hey, let's try this scene, but if you wear a simple T-shirt, I mean that you can scare people." It's really very bad, and I feel sorry for the poor pretty actress who dealt with Albert Brooks’s naked body on top of it. Probably after that, she pulled his hair out of her teeth for several days. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a normal movie. It would have been better if I hadn’t seen Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long uninterrupted minutes, because it would ruin my viewing of this film forever.
