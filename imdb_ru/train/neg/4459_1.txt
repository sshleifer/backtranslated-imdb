I say this not because production values ​​were so low, but because it was horribly removed. Does this snapshot of a girl wash her hair in a creek? Did we really need to sit there for a long time and see how she would do it for 5 minutes in the same place? It was awful, the lighting was just bad. You could barely see anything, and when the characters were talking, you could hardly hear what they were saying. I watched the whole movie? Of course, I didn’t miss most of this, and I don’t want to hear anyone say that I need to first look at it all to judge it. This film was so poorly made and executed that even by independent and low-budget standards it is simply terrible. A horrible movie ... don't waste time on it, unless you want to laugh, but even then it's not because of the "funny" lines of actors, but because of how painstakingly bad a movie is.
