After watching the preview, I felt that this film would be a good improvement compared to this fast and furious series. So, I already expected that he would not have a storyline, but at least this time he would not be loaded with a bunch of impotent civilian personnel with farting banks. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If only you could present the film “Fast and Furious” with a worse storyline than this film is definitely for you. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm very good - no, I wouldn't take a baseball bat to madness like what others said). Not only did the storyline not exist, but the action was crap too. I think the director thought they could just throw a bunch of women and exotic cars, and then call it a movie. For example, in the film there is a moment when a guy presses the nos button, and his Lamborghini takes off into the air and flies over McLaren's SLR to win. And after Eddie Griffin had a fight with one of his “girls” (in this case Imus's comment will work), the girl asks to pull over and leave the PLANE, and, of course, it happens in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene, I could no longer bear it. So, I only saw half of this monster. This is the first film I ever left. After that, I had to stop for a few drinks to kill all my damaged brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 because 0 is not an option. You'd better go to a local car show and stop at a striptease on the way home. I will keep all viewers in my prayers.
