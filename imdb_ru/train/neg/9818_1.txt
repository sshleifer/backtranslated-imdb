This film raises many hot questions for me. First, how did Jennifer Tilly manage to advance into the cinema as an actor in all these years thanks to this ridiculous squeaky voice and a very limited range of Hammy facial expressions that she uses? Secondly ... what were the people responsible for creating this offensive and deeply repulsive film? And thirdly ... considering that there were people who were perverted enough to decide to make it as if it were like that, shouldn’t there have been someone in the system - studios, distributors or anywhere else - enough sane, to prevent its completion and release, you really would have to find a very, very long way to find another film as terrible as this one ... and it is not even announced as a horror film - which, since it can be seen as owned by any legitimate film genre, it is of course. From beginning to end, the film turns into the most painful kind of madness, violence and cruel treatment, and, in fact, has no redemptive features at all. In fact, I don’t advocate censorship (which I don’t believe) ... but I really don’t understand how someone could get at least something positive from watching such a movie.
