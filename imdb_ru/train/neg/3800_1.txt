To call an absolutely ugly piece of crap in cinema history is not an easy task, there are so many candidates, but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite since I saw it. It was so funny that the next day we rented it again, and again I laughed so hard that I literally rolled on the floor. (Usually this only happens when I see Monty Python's Scott Antarctic.) <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, there is a stunning feeling that, damn it, firmly captures the viewer. I'm completely confused that this awkward home video has ever been at the production stage. It should be a sequel, but has no obvious connection with the first film. The hero has the same name, but this time “Alex” is a woman, although it took us halfway to the film to stop guessing that with all the muscles and clothing of nomadic barbarians! <br /> <br /> There really is no plot at all, it’s just a long chase scene, only it is so slow and meaningless that calling it a chase scene makes the sound more interesting than it actually is. There is almost no dialogue, which is no less important, given its quality, and then the film suddenly ends suddenly after a glaring action scene with a multitude of gasoline explosions, without even explaining what is being said. Fortunately, it is never boring, because all the time something stupid and fake is happening! <br /> <br /> Horrible movies are usually just tedious, but Nemesis 2 is the perfect blend of excessive seriousness and unintentional tomfoolery that it’s really interesting. Rent this movie or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
