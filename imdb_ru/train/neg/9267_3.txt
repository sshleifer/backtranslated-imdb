After the already disappointing "Final Conflict", the series reached the bottom with this very weak fourth record. At least the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while this one simply rephrases and copies the ideas from The Signs (animals fear the antichrist, the death of one person is very similar to the death of a photographer in the first film). But what looked exciting and creative looks just silly here. And the little girl looks just like a spoiled child.
