The life of the saints begins with the atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city with lively, quaint streets and sunshine. I hoped that it would keep this atmosphere, but she was bogged down in a story that is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Othello works for the big, fat Mr. Carrou, his stepfather, a criminal authority (at least I think this is what he should be, because he has never been defined, but he throws the kittens into deep thick pants, so trust me, he gives a shot), he performs dirty little errands, while his rough girlfriend gives dad manual work. One of his colleagues is the Runner, a black dude who always rushes from A to B. Until the day he meets an almost silent, homeless child who fulfills his desire to stop running. The runner throws the lost boy into Othello's apartment, where he quickly begins to give more desires. In an effort to fulfill some of his own desires, Karva kidnapped a boy. But he is not sure what will really bring him happiness. Is it innocence of being a child again or is it another handicraft? In any case, I do not want to see a little boy give him a second. <br /> <br /> To get started, we need whole centuries, and there are many repetitive scenes. The final is trying to be shocking, but since there is hardly any background to investing in any of these characters, it only serves a bored public. <br /> <br /> Writer Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to mingle with some kind of religious allegory, which ultimately turns out to be pretentious, like all hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible, or at least explained why the characters suddenly began to behave strangely, it would be a more pleasant movie. In fact, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying chatter that seem to miraculously develop intelligence when confronted with a mysterious boy. Who the origin is never revealed. It is just annoying! <br /> <br /> This film has nothing in common except occasional moments of atmosphere and capricious notes.
