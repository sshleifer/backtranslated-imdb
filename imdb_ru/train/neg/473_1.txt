That's what my friend Brian said about this movie in about an hour. He could not resist a nap. I rant about how feasible it was, and finally, I relented and played it, having finished adjectives for “boring”. <br /> <br /> Imagine, if you will, the top of the hack. Something so boring, so incredibly awful, that all you want to do after watching is sitting alone in the dark and not talking to anyone. Some people have the illusion that this film can be watched. No, not under any narcotic or brain damage. I ONLY would recommend it to someone to help them understand how unbearable it really is. You do not trust me? Gather around. <br /> <br /> Of course, we, as a nation, do not always portray the Middle Eastern peoples with taste. But what about a child wearing a sheikh bowing in salam style in a stack of bottles of Castrol motor oil? You will find it here. TAKE? ARAB WORSHIP OIL. I could not believe what I saw. If the child flew on a skyscraper, the planes would be more suitable. Who in their right mind would think that this is a funny joke? It is not even close to "cleverly offensive." It just sucks and makes you want to hit, whoever is paid to write it in person. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, a group of five singers called Land Mines goes to the officers ’ball. OK, are you ready? The joke that they sing terribly and out of sorts. Why did I also write it in capital letters? Because a joke is a PIST, PIP, BUILT IN YOUR HEAD with a marathon of HORRIBLE jokes. They start mediocre enough; cracks in the glasses, smashing punches ... and then, I'm 100% serious, the sequence of freeze-frame movements of two women comes out of the shoes. You read right - the music was so bad, in one frame on the legs of the woman were shoes. In the very next - shoes removed !!! Get it, because the music was so bad, her shoes came off! What the F ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless editing of video material to show that singing is bad. If someone actually suffered from this scene in the theater, not running like hell, I would be surprised. This film, frankly, looks like a joke about how quickly people run out of doors. Robert Downey Sr. directs the comedy as his son commands respect, while remaining drug-free. Poorly. Other things to pay attention to: <br /> <br /> 1. Popular music is laid wherever it is possible. Every time a Liceman appears, a really misplaced Iggy Pop song plays. In addition, all the actors are doing everything possible so that they act as if it has become very cold for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. Barbara Bach's criminal horrible accent. She seems to be trying to talk like a child while she rolls marble around her tongue. There are no nudes, and there are several scenes where the boys all groan and writhe from the glimpse of her split, as if they are in an acting class in a public school, and are ordered to act like excited backward people. <br /> <br /> 3. Litsman feeds his abominable dog with a condom. Remember; when this film came out in which "abortion" and "condom" were regarded as "sharp." <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a pedophile, small, hungry for a boy, when Hollywood considered that “pedophile” and “homosexual” are one and the same. Struggling awkwardly. <br /> <br /> 5. See the final. Your video recorder is fine. This is actually the end. Tell me that it doesn’t make you want to blow up everyone who has ever been in a movie. <br /> <br /> See this at your own risk. Up Academy, as you know, actually makes other films, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less funny by simply placing a videotape next to them.
