My sincere advice to everyone: do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't even go to the theater where this film is played !! even a glimpse of it is unhealthy. Seriously. no kidding. it's 3:30 in the morning. and I came back from this dirtiest film in this universe. FOUR HOURS OF HELL !!! I am proud to have survived after all this! If this is called survival. <br /> <br /> I am very upset. annoyed. disappointed. it was a waste of time! the money went down the drain! no plot. I hope I wake up tomorrow in my right mind and without memories of this night !! RUSSIAN MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day one and all :)
