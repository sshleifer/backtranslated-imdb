Parasomnia has interesting prerequisites, but the story is poorly written without any tension or even a logical approach. Even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played great roles in films such as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser, is unconvincing in the roles. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good), with the exception of Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West of the great Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play such roles in a dream (which he does little here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters do not make sense at all. The story is rather boring and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some bloody scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> It could have been a lot better, I donâ€™t get good reviews about it. It is actually below average.
