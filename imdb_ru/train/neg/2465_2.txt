It would be watchable Hollywood mediocre if he had good editing. He relies on a typical American thriller plot - "who is going to outwit everyone." The action is below average, but with the brilliant appearance of a detective who is the best actor in the film, and he is mainly responsible if the tension in the film rises. The film was completely strangled with blank videos and sound images, and most of it looks like raw film material. In general, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a movie that is worth watching. I think that would be enough to say about this film, everything else could really spoil the tension, which is probably quite low.
