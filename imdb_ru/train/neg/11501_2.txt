Romantic and completely false vision of unemployment from the “artist” of the middle class with a comfortable upbringing ... It is clear that the writer-director never suffered from unemployment directly and, of course, does not have personal experience of its occurrence. If you needed to believe in this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, do not experience anger, fear, disappointment, etc. All the characters live all day, playing jokes, jokes. They never look for work, almost never experience rejection or suffering, etc. Living on unemployment benefits seems like a summer vacation at school ... It's funny. Especially if you compare it with modern masterpieces from Ken Loach, etc.
