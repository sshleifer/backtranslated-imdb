Being a big fan of "other" films "PLANET APES", I rented this DVD, despite my disgust for all things by Tim Burton. Once again, he never ceases to disappoint his boring leadership. Even the monkey's makeup looks secondary, which is unforgivable, given the monstrous budget of this monster. Mark Wahlberg once and for all proves that he is not an actor (as if the BOOGIE NIGHTS did not have enough evidence). I was embarrassed for genuine talents, such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Without a doubt, their salaries motivated them, since this may not have been a clich√© play with the script. I rented this DVD on a special night for $ 1, and I still feel ripped off.
