Now I am not a film critic, but I really hated the 9/11. This film was, generally speaking, bad. With the exception of the Alejandro González Inarritu segment, which was the most effective and immediate on the topic, short films were boring at best and offensive at worst. The worst in my memory was the pretentious segment of Yusef Chane, in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers, even going so far as to suggest that suicide bombers fought for a more serious cause. The segment was completely off topic and, given Cheyne’s lack of propriety, wasting my time and patience. The idea that eleven different directors from different countries made a film with their views on the tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
