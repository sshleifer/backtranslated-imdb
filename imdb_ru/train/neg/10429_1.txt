The first half was fine, but the last one was really very disappointing. It's funny that the producers even admitted that they had no idea about the final, and it really showed. What is really sad is that I need to write at least ten lines of comments in order to be able to publish it. I really didnâ€™t want to include spoilers to clarify my comments, since the show is really not worth the effort. When Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited about the prospect of a better remake, it did not happen that the first season of the border for the time of porn space. In the end, they removed it a bit and actually did some pretty good drama, so I started watching again. But to finish the series with Kara, who is the angel of the god Cyclone, the same with Baltar and the six was pretty stupid.
