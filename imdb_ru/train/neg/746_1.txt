Save $ 8.97 at Walmart to buy this DVD and watch Steven Spielberg’s real movie. <br /> <br /> I’m a director, and as a HG Wells fan, I had to buy it hoping to sit down and see three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching, because I could not watch more than 10 minutes at a time. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a budget of $ 20 million for this production. Where the hell did it go? Did he use most of this to buy a new home? Finance his retirement? Or what? Let me start by saying what is really good in this film. This remains true to the book, and there are some good speeches in it. I can respect the actors who clearly tried to make this film a good one. But good performances were quickly overshadowed by terrible ... and I mean terrible special effects. Any freshman from a film school could handle CGI much better. In my opinion, most of them looked like cutouts on the “stop action” board that were used, and not as complex CGI software that the project should use for $ 20 million. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the amateur post-production that was applied to this film. My partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1,500, and during the day there were five minutes of the scene that looked better and more realistic than what Heins created. I have seen films with a budget of less than 2 million dollars that look better. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than the special effects of Hynes in this film. In fact, because of this film, I appreciate the Attack of Tomato Killers much better. With today's technology, there is no excuse for the film to look like a B-movie from the 50s, unless it was an intention that should not have been in this particular project. <br /> <br /> I had a problem with the DVD transfer; it was that the film was a jerky, another demonstration of amateur filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say that in 2003 I created a project worth $ 45,000, in which cinematography and special effects are better than this movie. /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone who appreciates good filmmaking or is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch the “50-foot Woman Attack” instead. It would be easier on the eyes.
