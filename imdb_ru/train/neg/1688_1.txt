Gee, what a shitty movie it was! I can't understand that people are so scared in "The Grudge". The director plays one trick (I have to admit that itâ€™s a very good one, which is very stylized), and then he repeats it to the end of the film over and over again. As a result, I started several times in the first quarter of the film, but as soon as I understood what an exercise was, I almost fell asleep, as The Grudge became more and more predictable with every minute. In conclusion, I can say that, to begin with, there are much better films in this genre, the so-called predecessor of The Ring was much worse, and that buying a ticket for The Grudge is a waste of money.
