This story is about the romantic triangle between the nth. An African prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who does not speak French and never seems to shave. <br /> <br /> Like a film, it is boring, dreary and depressing, shot either in foggy, overcast winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everyone basks in a strange blue glow. And yes, I know, this is because the white balance has been disturbed. All are pale and dull and look haggard, frayed and dirty. The bodies are bony and shot in such a close-up view that they look rather ugly and unattractive. Moles, greasy hair. Uk. The bad news is in a movie where people spend a lot of time, either naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, mother Stephanie is dying. All three characters return to Stephanie's home village, where, through a lot of memories of deserted countryside and, as expected, gloomy interiors, we see little of Stephanieâ€™s childhood when he was a boy named Pierre. Mother is dying. Well ... that's it, really. Character development is minimized, as is the denouement of the story. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the storyline is not linear (that would explain a lot of non-secretaries), but in fact, having paid my seven euros, I do not feel the need to build a film myself: this is what the director takes my money for. Expecting me to join the story-telling process and get my hands dirty, so to speak, is too much. <br /> <br /> This film is a bunch of pretentious garbage made primarily from the desire of the epater les bourgeois (i.e., it shocks the straight lines). I can see how it was participation in the Berlin Film Festival, and I understand why this did not lead to anything.
