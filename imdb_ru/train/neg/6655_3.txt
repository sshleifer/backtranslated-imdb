The only redeeming quality of this overly wrong melodrama is the landscapes of the south of France and the voice of Nana Maskouri singing a song. Stephanie Powers is mistaken and indulges in a fake accent. As already mentioned, is she too old to play at the age of 18, and she looks too young like a grandmother with a student granddaughter? Lee Remick is good, although in subsequent years she has no age. The talented Joanna Lumley is not busy enough, and she manages to look forever young when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries her grandmother Stephanie Powers. Stacey Kitch's unceasing arrogance makes one wonder what these women saw in him. Not sure how any viewer can relate to his excessive image? The most plausible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the actors look like lovers of the rank. It is credible that the beautiful male grooms in this epic will remain lonely, while they patiently wait for the subject of their affections to finally agree to accept them. Can anyone believe that the handsome Robert Urich will remain a bachelor for decades, waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposal? The war of the Second World War between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is ridiculous. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the French part of Provence until, at the end of the war, they were controlled by the puppet government of Vichy. We see how the French resistance arranges a daily raid on Mistralâ€™s villa to steal the sheets, after which they all lie under the bridge, waiting for the bulky Nazi-army truck to surprise and destroy them? If you want to see a well-played mini-series in a foreign country, do not watch Mistral's Daughter. A much better alternative is The Thorn Birds.
