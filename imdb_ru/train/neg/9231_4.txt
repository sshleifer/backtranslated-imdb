I entered this film, thinking it would be the next clerks, but left a sense of frustration. The humor was weak and the characters rather flat. This is not to say that all this was bad, the idea of ​​dating service at the grocery store seemed to be quite fertile material, but the director switched to a cliché that “would save the Mom-and-Pop store from an evil corporation guy. I felt that if he were just stuck on the storyline of the dating service, he would come out with a much more memorable film. Now, judging by the film, I'm from the Rochester area, and I liked the way he portrayed Webster. In fact, Kevin Smith (Clerks) best respect here is a prop to his hometown. Webster, NY, should check that the Red Bank, NJ, for clerks. The director wisely added a date to Nick Tahu. Believe me, as for the things that need to be done in Rochester, the garbage can is at the top of the list. I was lucky to see this film on Little in Rochester, so that everyone would know when the odes came and appreciate them.
