This respected production has its fans. But to paraphrase the classic Mary Reilly bad review, Moby Dick looks like a picture, only more slowly. <br /> <br /> This is because the philosophical basis for the “production” of a film never makes a good film. rather, instead of replacing the absence of a strong leadership idea (in this case, transferring books to a film) with a list of hopelessly fragmented, non-dynamic but dazzling conceit attempts to make viewers think that they have seen greatness. Because viewers and critics are prone to this, Oscar follows, feeding all the blunt equation. <br /> <br /> I do not share the pleasure that all these reviewers have found. Moby Dick is amazingly unattractive. Actors dutifully tell an essay about John, Moby-Dick, the ocean, Moby-Dick, Moby-Dick ... about all the things that cannot be answered, and none of which absorb the slightest. It is dramatically inert. It does not build. In terms of storytelling, Moby Dick (as a film) is nothing more than a predetermined conclusion in search of a real story. After half an hour I mumbled: “Oh, awesome ... another oath ... another 4-minute monologue!" <br /> <br /> An unsuccessful attempt to attract you is a rather quick demonstration. There is a lot of gray hair. Starbuck must be a golden god. (!) <br /> <br /> Someone knows that everyone looks at a great director when he makes his medium, and does not try to reproduce the feeling of other people’s pictures and palettes or respectfully embalms a classic like Houston here, pictures and books are good, but they are different environments. Such a film cannot understand that a really nice movie Shit (Village of the Damned) is in many ways better than an unbearable piece of culture. This is the cinema school “Eat Your Vegetables.” <br /> <br /> Someone appreciates the work that needed to be done to create the film, but not the story. Only a few segments reflecting marine research are interesting; registering huts as a means of structuring work and various marine efforts, and whaling technology. And this does not require a two-hour film.
