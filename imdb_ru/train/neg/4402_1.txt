I usually love lesbian films, even when they are not very good. I am biased, I think! <br /> <br /> But these are only pits. Yes, landscapes and buildings are beautiful, and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this film is just a waste of time. Annamarie alternates between sulking and getting high / clogged / unconscious by any drug or drink, and Ella inexplicably puts up with this disgusting behavior throughout the entire film. We have never got any idea why this is so, and even why Annamare is so depressed and closed. <br /> <br /> If there was at least some kind of closure in (potentially romantic? I don’t even know!) the relationship between the two, there might have been some satisfaction. But although Anna Maria at some point asks Ella, "Why do you love me?" Ella doesn't even recognize it. It is never clear whether this is more than a (lesser) lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interaction between two women and locals, whom they meet on a journey that could be lively and informative, is instead flat, tedious and mostly incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There is one good joke in the movie, although I’m sure it was unintended. Women travel in a Ford coupe with a medium-sized trunk. However, when they set up camp, they have a huge tent, cots, bedding and even a table, chair and typewriter! On top of that, when they get on the ferry, we see piles of luggage, supposedly of them, apparently also carried in the trunk of the little Ford! <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we never see a single gas station, nor anywhere else, which is similar to the fact that there really is a place where you can buy gasoline. Mostly they travel through the endless miles of desert desert. So where did they get the fuel from? <br /> <br /> There may not be too many lesbian films, good or bad, but there are many that are better than this and very few that are worse. Leave it in rack.
