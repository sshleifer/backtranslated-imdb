It makes no sense briefly about a handful of half-naked men who beat each other and beat each other. That's all. About 5 minutes we see it. This is shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around, clapping each other to the tune of terrible music. It looks interesting, but there is no plot, and in fact - the violence inherent in it has become alarming. Homo-erotism is also played out in this, but it was not a good idea to mix it with violence. Some people who love avant-garde stuff may like it, but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid, and (sometimes) disturbing. Indeed - what's the point in all this? I saw it as part of a gay shorts festival, and the public was sitting there in stunned silence. I really would like to go lower than 1.
