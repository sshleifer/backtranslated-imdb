Live! Yes, but don't kick. <br /> <br /> True story. Some time ago, the Dutch TV channel announced that it was going to show a new reality show. Competition soon. The main participant of this show will be a woman who dies from something terrible, and she will donate her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure. In fact. <br /> <br /> Country and international media were everywhere in this story, like flies on poop, saying that it is terrible, immoral, what this world means, and the like. In a sense, I had to agree . <br /> <br /> After a few months, tensions grew to such an extent that the government was mainly concerned with whether they should let this show go ahead or not, instead of running the country. <br /> <br /> The show was broadcast to the very last moment when they were moving. And until the last moment the country was in a rage, the Prime Minister delivered speeches, each newspaper wrote about it, everyone in the country held its breath. And the network pushed. On the way to the new frontier in television. And they definitely managed to do it. They parted the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show went on the air, and we all watched as the terminally ill woman chose the right candidate for kidney so that he or she could live, although she would soon die. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show, it turned out that it was a partial deception. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, which with ads, commercials and all discussions built up within a few months before the fantastic climax, was an advertising move to focus on the problem of a serious lack of organ donors. The person who founded this particular network died of a kidney disease himself. <br /> <br /> Now this is television. Leaving everyone in amazement far behind. <br /> <br /> Do not show me a poorly acting, poorly directed film about a woman who is trying to show Russian roulette on American television. <br /> <br /> Like if. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I'm going to believe that they will receive it through the FCC. As if I am going to believe that this will pass through the US Supreme Court on the basis of free speech. As if I would believe in a ridiculous ending, when this woman removed him and he had problems with her conscience, because some guy shot himself on the air. <br /> <br /> All this has been done before. See "Running Man" with Arnold. At least he had a good final. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a terribly bad piece of film along with a funny ending. So in the end she was shot, should that make us more attractive to the public after we leave the theater, because there was some kind of justice? Do not take my word for it, but I would say this: leave it alone and look at the test pattern instead, you will get more quality.
