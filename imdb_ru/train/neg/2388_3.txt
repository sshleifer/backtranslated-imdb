No one should try to adapt the book by Tom Robbins to the screen. While the movie is good and the performances are good, the dialogue that works well when reading it is crap when they say. Or, in other words, no one could have imagined that hearing someone’s name was similar to the way it was written on the pearl of Radium. <br /> <br /> In general, the film resembles ill-adapted rocks Notes to the book - most of the pieces were cracked up to one-fifth of their size in the book, in terms of background and current history, and the ending is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from the end of the book. Most of the plots from the book are lost, including the one in which everything makes sense at the end, and there are several references in the book that make the viewer say “Eh?” Unfortunately, this is not a worthy effort - the script needed to be read, compared with the book , burn, and send all the actors to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant immensely, but even someone from his level could not make a decent film from such a complicated book without creating a miniseries.
