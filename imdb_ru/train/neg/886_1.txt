A few years ago, the very same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Which was imperfect, but very pleasant (my rating was 7), created this piece of garbage about New York. <br /> <br /> In Paris, “I love you” (J'taime) created a sensation of Paris, and it was done in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this film I did not recognize New York, I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> In New York there are 5 districts, I have not seen any scenes in the Bronx or in Queens. In Brooklyn (Brighton Beach) I saw one scene, no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scenes of beautiful hotels or theaters. He has a really big cast, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest grade. <br /> <br /> Very few humorous moments are sexual in nature or offensive to many wonderful New Yorkers, whom we all know and love. <br /> <br /> Several films nominated for Razzie Awards were much better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> I think the name should have been <br /> <br / > NEW YORK, I HATE YOU.
