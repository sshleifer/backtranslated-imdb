The team of husband and wife Benny Fields and Sealy's Blossom were huge stars in vaudeville, but they made very few films. As in the case of some of the other performers of their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Bryce, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible part of the filming for Fields and Sealy is a biography about them, in which they are portrayed by other actors: “Someone loves me” starring Betty Hatton and this inimitable singer and dancer Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> At one time, Fields and Seely were so popular that another vaudeville - husband and wife - Jesse Block and Eva Sally - achieved almost the same fame by performing an almost identical act, actually becoming the “second team »Fields and Seely. Behind the scenes, however, there was a significant difference in the living conditions of couples. Fields and Seeley lived in a hotel apartment, paying the cost of room service for every meal they ate, and eventually ran out of money. Blok and Sally lived modestly and wisely investing their income, ending in a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this short “Vitafon” are occupied by two pianists wearing spars. Apparently, in 1930, these two had their own small name, although I had never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Sealy rush in and start speaking. They both have a lot of pep, and she's quite attractive. <br /> <br /> It annoyed me that both performers continue to make movements, as if they are going to start dancing, but they never do this until the third of the three songs they perform in this short film. When they finally begin to hoof, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was glad that I had the opportunity to see these two main performers who perform their brave deed. Now that I saw it, I understand why they never became stars in musicals. My estimate for this is: only 4 out of 10, and I will stick with Blok and Sally.
