I hated the way Mrs. Perez portrayed the Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghettos, and we speak Spanish, not Puerto Ricans! I can not speak for the uneducated people that you have encountered. But our language is not damaged, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is more cost effective than any other Caribbean island! I am glad that we are not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, free from American influence? Free in true poverty, not in the standard of poverty in the United States. We are not victims, we are cheerful, modest, honest and intelligent people. Our pedigree includes strong African roots, but not “black” roots - I have nothing to do with black Americans doing research). <br /> <br /> The analogy between Pedro Albiza, Che Guevarra, and Martin L. King is no longer inappropriate. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, a real revolutionary - an honest man who saw the day when we all would be free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevara helped Castro create Cuba, which is today - that is why full Cubans boat risk their lives to come to America - because Che made the best place for them? You had a great, amazing, bright idea, but you politicized too much of it. We have so many things that we can be proud of as people - do not dishonor our people, pursuing us. I am not a New Yorker, and perhaps that is why I cannot share my views. I am a Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim, and I was able to achieve many of my goals in America. If in the future there will be a second part - less politics, more history, more stories of triumph - there are many of them. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
