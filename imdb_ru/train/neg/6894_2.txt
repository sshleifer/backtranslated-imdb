It’s sad when you see what the film is trying to do, and it’s quite obvious that it’s far from the goal. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Will graduate have an idea. He wants total control. Thus, he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece himself. Usually his concept goes beyond his budget. He usually writes a bloated script full of every line of tag he can come up with. Usually he is more interested in the grandeur of the plot, rather than the smallest work with the actors on individual scenes. Usually he ends up being a weak film, trying to work wonders with a tiny budget. Usually he ends up with a series of meetings (we cannot pay tribute, calling them scenes) who feel that they were written by a 12-year-old. And usually he ends up with bad acting scenes that are not able to capture the viewer. When you look at the judges from this point of view, you can immediately say that this is just a regular rate.
