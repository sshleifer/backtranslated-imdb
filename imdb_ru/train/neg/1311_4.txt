Jerry notices Tom, who listens to a terrible story on the radio, and takes the opportunity to scare his sworn enemy. <br /> <br /> This episode did not seem so ridiculous to me: the humor seemed rather cramped, and the whole process was somewhat lame (Jerry, in fact, is the “bad guy” in this, tormenting poor Tom for no particular reason). <br /> <br /> Sometimes there is a flash of inspiration (for example, the literal experience of Tom “heart to mouth”) and the moment when his ninth life is drained from his body), but, in general, this effort lacks frantic rhythm, excellent the animation and sheer wit of most other T & J cartoons
