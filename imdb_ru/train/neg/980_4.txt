My first full Heston movie. The film, which everyone already knows the end. Sci-fi thriller. Camping factor. Everything related to this film was introduced into my head when I rented it, and in the morning when I watched it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood I was in (I donâ€™t want to move. Put the player, hide in blankets). And although I was trying to understand what was going on to lead to the finale, which would be forever destroyed by pop culture, he simply could not do it. Everything was everywhere, the relationship had no basis, the ending had no meaning. Everything was just bizarre, and the observer had no choice but to be partially dumbfounded at the end he came to, because even though we all know that these are people, these are quick answers to the question WHY people do. any serious attempt to enjoy the film for something other than stupidity thrown out of the window.
