We all know what happens when we have a bad day at the office, right? Well, this comedy with Neal Simon looks at what it looks like when you have the worst of all the days when you just try to get to the office. Sometimes it's just not worth it, you know what I mean? And sometimes, you just don't have to do something when it was already done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better. <br /> <br /> Not that Steve Martin was a lousy comedian or not so much on the role of a scared and tense advertising manager; on the contrary, on both counts. And the thing is not that Goldie Hawn is also inept; her work has consistently been good, if not great, since I first saw her in the television show Rowan and the March TV series of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that this is not about a poor couple. in fact: is it really New York, and why should everyone come to New York to live and love their lives in marriage happiness? like, like, something like ?? in the greatest city in the world. This is if you are a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Listen, the 1970 film is still a great comedy that realistically explores all the things that can go wrong when you go on a trip, and most situations and spectacles you can imagine are included, about what can happen to you in unfamiliar surroundings. This version of 1999, unfortunately, turns into useless touches especially for an audience that expects or wants to see surplus. For example, not content with the star attractiveness of the main players, there is a cameo (relatively long as well) from Rudi Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, as we all know. What kind ?? Does Giuliani scold the president even then? Worse ?? walking talk advertising the good faces of new york. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Cleese, who plays the role of Basil Falti ?? but this time, like a prancing cross-dresser too ?? once again intimidating the hotel staff, enthusiastically absorbing rich clients and generally making themselves look like an idiot in this role. And, in the process, it causes great damage to the memory of the Falti Towers, perhaps the best British comedy series, without exception ... <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 film made? In the 1970s, New York was in many ways a dying city. It was almost literally bankrupt. So, when it was made in 1970, it was a city that you saw: gloomy, gloomy, capricious, anxious, and not the place that the beaten couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as then, polluted and all that), By 1999, everything was better: the brilliance was back, New York was flourishing, it was the Big Apple, ready for you to bump into it if you had troubled ... <br /> <br /> So, naturally, the couple in this second coming discovers that the midge is in itself and finally joins the fabulous fight to continue live the American dream of life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. Consequently, this film is truly comic, but not for reasons that the producers might have foreseen. No matter how much I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in a comedy, this film is a parody of a much better film made by the great Jack Lemmon. If you've seen the latter, then definitely don't worry about it.
