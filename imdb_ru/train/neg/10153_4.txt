SLESHERS (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Not a very good film ... but I liked the idea ... and the filmmakers made it pretty good, considering the small budget they had to work with. This film is supposedly the “episode” of a live Japanese reality show, which sends several participants into a sealed “danger zone” and sends three costume creeps to kill them. A survivor, if he has one, wins fame and fortune ... all others simply end up dead. The main disadvantage of this film is that the acting is pretty bad. None of the "real" people seem real at all. The actors who play the killers are kind of funny ... because they portray gentle and incredible cartoons of popular modern types of horror films ... and this is exactly the way they would have done if it were a real show. The film claims to have it all done at once ... there is one operator who watches the participants around the "danger zone", and everything is visible from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights continue to flicker constantly (to hide the "cuts "From one take to another, I would imagine).
