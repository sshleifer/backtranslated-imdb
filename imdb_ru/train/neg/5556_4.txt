During the first 17 minutes of the film directed by Bradford May “Darkman III: Die Darkman Die”, we were already subjected to a silly debriefing and voice over in the first two films, with a cheerful overstrain, about three minutes of footage. from the second film and edited a bit to look like new shots, and a long advertisement that the scars and exhausted title character are watching about Universal Theme Parks - Universal, which is the company that distributed this film. Yes, Darkman III: Die Darkman Die is quite a handful when it comes to cheap payouts for the success of a previous film. <br /> <br /> This time the disfigured antihero Peyton Westlake (aka “The Dark Man”; he is portrayed by the Mummy actor Arnold Vosloo) locks the horns of an evil criminal lord and lousy husband Peter Rucker (in a brilliant performance by Jeff Feihla) and over the course of the 87-minute film, it grows to develop affection for Rucker's wife and daughter, to learn to take care of another person again. <br /> <br /> Blah. Blah Blah <br /> <br /> This film is just a stupid way for a studio to make some more money on Sam Rayme's original film, which I think is a great movie in the action movie genre. <br /> <Oh, yes, and there are also some stupid side stories, including meanness, which allegedly was one of the first doctors who saved Darkman after his scarring, and she seduced our hero, making him think that she was an ally before uncovering her vile plot to help Rooker create more powerful goons, such as Darkman. Apparently, she cannot simply do the same procedure with the thugs that she performed on the Dark Man. What for? I can not explain it, because the film, of course, does not. <br /> <br /> There is also a plot about the murder involving the district attorney who threatens to destroy the organization Ruker, and some other very stupid things. going on. <br /> <br /> But it really does not add up. This film feels like two or three episodes of a television show, edited together more than the actual film. The direction alternates between a rather good and frankly sloppy (the scene in which Darkman rides his train-like vehicle and dodges a rocket launcher is just silly), and editing is a mixed bag. The film is moving too fast for anyone to really care about what is happening. And without damage, the last 15 minutes of this film, and indeed, the entire series is just a kind ... I do not know ... Another 15 minutes of shooting in a mixed bag. <br /> <br /> In fact, when commenting on editing, one of my favorite things in this film is to watch frames reused from previous films, and then look for frames in this film that are repeated several times. Yes, it is so cheap. It’s one thing to re-cap at the beginning of the film, and maybe repeat one or two frames, but they do it in full (minute frames repeated from previous films), it’s just sloppy and unprofessional. <Br /> <br /> In addition, I must say that Darkman’s psychedelic montage of editing is a bit exaggerated in this film. They are so stylized and overdone that they work, but only in small doses and in the right context, as Raymi did in the original film. Here, at least four or five, and they feel very harsh and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The film is not without some good moments. Several action movies are well made. The cliché story that Darkman craves for real life is also suitable for direct burning to DVD. Some of the actors are good, especially from the wife of Rucker, who portrays the beautiful Roxana Dawson. In addition, although Danny Elfman does not play, composer Randy Miller composes pleasant music based on Elfman's original themes. <br /> <br /> But in general, the film is too fast, cheap and stupid to take it seriously. Arnold Vosluo seems to be alternately bored and violently moving from stage to stage, and Fahi, while happily watching the villain from the top, just doesn't quite fit into the series. <br /> <br /> Like "Darkman II", I would recommend it to fans of the original, who will surely laugh. Otherwise, you do not need to apply. Four out of ten.
