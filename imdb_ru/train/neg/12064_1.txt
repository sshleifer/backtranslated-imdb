This is one of the most boring horror films I've ever seen, as it is terribly awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see how the two turns at the end go many miles! Great surroundings and a creepy house would definitely help if it weren't so damn boring, and there wouldn’t be a single character that needs to hurt, plus I hope it will go down to 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally arrives at the end, it's a pretty good scene, but it's too late, and the only other time he had on the screen was in the memories, plus the only really horrible scene in the film — when the character gets its face tainted by the bees, as it was rather bloody. I got it in a Horror DVD set called Back From The Grave, and, in my opinion, everyone really replayed, fortunately, it was included in the set I bought, otherwise I would have thrown it out the window !. This is one of the most boring horror films I've ever seen, as it is terribly awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time, and I say, avoid it, like the plague! You do not want to be tortured. The direction is absolutely awful! Carl Monson is doing absolutely horrible! working here, making every thing look cheap, spending its potential to create an eerie atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly boring pace. Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good at his scene, but apart from the fact that he is hardly in the film, except for memories. (Carradine rules !!). Merry Anders replays here terribly, like Laura, since she did not convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is okay, and a bit creepy, but also excessive, she still had a creepy smile at the end. I didn’t pay enough attention to the other actors either, because it was very difficult for me to cope with this, but they were all really bad. In general, please avoid this, it is not worth the agony! BOMB of 5
