This film was really bad, do you perceive it as a sci-fi film, a horror film or even a comedy. All this is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film looks (and is) definitely cheap, the actors have no idea what is acting, and the script clearly shows that it was filmed along with the shooting. Obviously, the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not at all scary — it was even pretty — and they thought they needed something more impressive; and here they failed (the makeup is terrible even for the late 50s, rather amusing). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why the career of director Joseph Green as such, and also as a writer, did not take place; he was really bad at both. The same goes for the actors, the leading and the supporting. <br /> <br /> The best achievement "The brain that will not die" is a short time.
