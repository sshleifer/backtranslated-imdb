A young professor of genetics playing basketball studies the genetic sequence using human embryos. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He is under pressure to complete his research because he did not publish, so the university is having difficulty justifying its funding (I think). <br /> <br /> He gives a test injection to a monkey that quickly dies. Then he tries it on himself. He begins a relationship with a single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; it was she who demanded the results of the study. <br /> <br /> Initially, he seems to have no effect from the injection, except for some new strength. Then he realizes that he had a memory loss, and begins to remember what happened. In addition, he begins to seem very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Since the film is called metamorphosis, it eventually turns into something else. You will not believe your eyes â€” either what it has become, or the absolutely cheesy costume that the actor wears to portray what he has become. Incredibly, there is another change in the store - the end of the film is really, really absurd. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film has is that it has Laura Gemser in it, but it has a very small part. <br /> <br /> I once saw a video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the box. Perhaps at that time there was even some kind of electronics in it, perhaps luminous eyes (in the film, the eyes of the protagonist sometimes turn green). The copy I looked at had a box in which there were only traces of tears, where the glue was held on plastic, which was removed. The cover of the novelty, if it still was, would be the only reason I would keep this film; I definitely get rid of it.
