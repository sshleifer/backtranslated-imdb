“Three daring daughters” is a painfully-sweet pinkish look at divorce, remarriage and life with one parent. It is obvious that social problems and economic difficulties do not take place in the ideal life of a single mother, who feels exhausted, goes on a cruise, and then meets and marries a group conductor. Even when the phrase “it's just a movie” frees the script from solving real problems, “Daughters” suffer from too many disjointed songs with high notes, children whose personalities are not based on real children, and the leader of the group, José Iturbi, who plays himself. Is it not strange that some real person will be filmed in a film in which his supposed real person is getting married? <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this film was released in the 1940s. Only the love of the old style of the Hollywood novel and comedy could make The Daughters a tolerable film.
