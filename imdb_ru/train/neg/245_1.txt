No doubt, “The Mysterious Planet” is one of the worst films ever made, but in my heart it remains attached, because the poverty of its special effects and the amazingly terrible sound track in the first 15 minutes (and, frankly, that's all what you need to see) unite to create something fun, split aside. <br /> <br /> The first scene in “space” is almost as incomprehensible as in the cinema, as bottles of dishwashing liquid rush past your eyes to muffle the dialogue. Before you could find out if you were crazy, loans roll, and the action comes to life. <br /> <br /> And besides the two-headed giant clay snail, which terrorizes our heroes, you will also receive an additional double bonus for using both the original voices of the actors and the duplicate voices simultaneously. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> The sad thing for fans of this kind of tariff is that I saw only one copy, so the chances of seeing it yourself are extremely unlikely. Perhaps I own the only existing copy. <br /> <br />
