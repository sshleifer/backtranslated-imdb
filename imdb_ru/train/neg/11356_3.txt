This is not a good movie. Too preaching in parts, and the storyline was low. 3D was fine, but not superb. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story of three young flies who want adventure and watch them. Characters are not enough, I really do not care about these characters and I feel that the adult had nothing to interest. Pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more special 3D effects. In addition, I would like to see more jokes about flies than that mother constantly says: “Lord of the flies”. Pretty sexist, showing women as housewives and fainting.
