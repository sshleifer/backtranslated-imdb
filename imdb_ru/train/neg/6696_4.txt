(There are Spoilers) The killer-prostitute-nympho Mia, Kari Vuhrer, takes over the life and car of 18 virgins, although he is too embarrassed to admit it, a collage of Trent Colbert, freshmen, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the film, Mia will not only give up flowers, but also give the poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson on how to find dangerous crazy work and stay as far from him or her as possible so as not to turn into one. <br /> <br /> Hanging around the trucker Mia picked up Roy, Bert Young, for a hot and hard game, in the backseat of his buggy. Roy is too drunk or stupid to understand that Mia is not someone else, like her estranged daughter! Angered by the fact that Mia does not want to get involved with him, Roy nearly chokes her to death, only to be interrupted by a first-year student Trent Colbert, who is plowing in the direction of the recreation area, waving one of the truckers. <br /> <br /> Seeing her chance, Mia jumps into Trent's car, and the two of them leave, which turns out to be the strangest car chase ever filmed. Driving through the entire northeastern United States, they were eventually involved in a truck that killed and exchanged state soldiers, who then lead them to the house of Trent’s parents and were held hostage. It's there that there is another wild exchange of gunfire between crazy Miya with a whole team of special forces, reinforced by local police and state soldiers. <br /> <br /> You can expect a run-and-run movie to be deliberately or unintentionally funny, but it’s not. In fact, the film is very disturbed by the way Mia treats everyone in the film, with whom she comes in contact even with her perverted father who bothers her father Roy. Making Trent drive her all over the northeast, Mia gets drunk on a poor bib, keeping him in a motel room, along with handcuffs with whips and a lit candle. Mia also starts a relationship with the owner of the motel, excited by Mr. Foster, deceiving him to give her his weapon, as part of some strange sexual game. Raising Foster, she leaves with Trent, who has caught a cold in his motel room, in a purse with $ 400, but does not bother to drive away. <br /> <br /> In need of money to pay for gas, to get home to his parents for Thanksgiving, Trent receives a mobile phone call from Miii to pick her up at a local diner and get his money back. Like a jerk to be Trent, he takes Mia, who is currently hiding from the law, and then contacts her father Roy on the open highway when he tries to knock both Trent and Mia out of the way. <br /> <br /> The chase ends in this abandoned building, where Roy chases Mia, chasing him along the high-heeled dirt road to get him, as you know, where with a blast from his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take off his pants that he forgot that he left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> As a result of kidnapping and murder, as well as hitting and running, attack them, and both desperate people stop at the S & M / Tattoo boutique, where Trent pierces his ear and nose and puts on leather and chains from Myri, as well as a dog collar corresponding to him and her. This is to meet his straightforward and conservative parents for a thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> As a result of a shootout with state soldiers, as a result of which one of them was seriously wounded, two fugitives from the law end up with parents of Trent, Mr. and Mrs. Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martin, all local police at home, with special forces, waiting for them there. <br /> <br /> An unpleasant movie with a truly disturbing finale that made you wonder what the movie was trying to tell about its audience. At first, you felt great sympathy for Mia, but as the film drew closer to its sad finale, which evaporated as quickly as a tray of ice cubs in Death Valley. Despite the fact that Roy was the most unsightly man in the film, by the time the movie ended Mia had completely eclipsed him.
