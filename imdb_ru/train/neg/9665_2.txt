Interesting? Barely The “scientific evidence” referred to in the film (in essence, Jews are cancer) is so stupid and unconvincing that it is almost ridiculous (if we did not know what happened in that era). <br /> <br /> Important? Nope I can not imagine that the Germans (even at this terrible time) wanted or believed this film. Compare this with the Triumph of Willens Riefenstahl. Now it was a movie that impressed me. This is just stupid trash. <br /> <br /> The “best” part is a scene from M (one of my favorite ones), where (Jew, as the announcer eloquently reminds us), Lorre plays a child A bully and a murderer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, only a depraved mind can do that. Yeah. I did not know that M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> <br /> No, that's just stupid. Even for the Nazi propaganda genre. 2/10.
