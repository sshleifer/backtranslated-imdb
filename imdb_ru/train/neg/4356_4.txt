Since I am not a fan of blood and guts, I found that the bloody scenes are completely unnecessary (you spell it) and too real for my taste if you are the type of person who is crazy about beheading on the Internet or sniff movies, which I say, dare, can not believe what kind of person this sick nonsense dreams. <br /> <br /> In addition to having the potential to become an excellent film, the music was also top notch (thanks to the film and especially the final credits). Some parts were a bit unbelievable, as if you were just found by your girlfriend, expecting torture and death, and all you do is tell her what happened and how you got there (why didn't he ask her were there any napkins or even an air freshener or a piece of gum while he was with her?), come on now, most will probably just shout "hurry up and untie me, then let's get out of here FAST!". where there were flies, larvae, etc., and when the girl accidentally stumbled upon this place, surely the smell of rotten flesh would have sounded in several alarming calls! I would recommend this film only to friends of Dennis Nilsson and the like, I am sure that such a video would make such patients a very happy Christmas.
