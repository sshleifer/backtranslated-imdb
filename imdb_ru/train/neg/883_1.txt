There are many problems with this film, but I will try to mention the brightest and most annoying. First, although the topic involves a lot of vignettes about life in Manhattan, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and on television, was about something strange, usually of a sexual nature. Subject lines were thin or absent, and almost every scene, a snapshot of the camera, the line of dialogue and the expressed emotions were completely and completely fake. Finally, after an hour of such insane debris, when I came out, it reached a point (which is not uncommon for me in recent years.) I would suggest that the film was directed by some dismissed author from some third film study program. , but I think that the (once talented) director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting parody, so perhaps the director's talent in America massively sank into a cesspool.
