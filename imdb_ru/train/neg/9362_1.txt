The plot sounded like it promised. To be honest, I did not watch the whole movie. About an hour after the beginning of the film, I had to make a decision. Should I watch this movie before its completion? The answer was clearly NO! It is not a fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from another species without rejecting it. Neither the premise that the secret government authorities persecuted him for a human / wolf transplant. This was due to the fact that the film was poorly written, the acting game lacked emotion, and I did not understand several sequences of dreams with wolves and buffaloes. When he ran to the zoo with a pack of dogs and left them in front of the zoo gate, the saying “If you can't run with big dogs, don't leave the porch” sounded all the time in my bored consciousness. Save time and skip this movie. I can guarantee that if you dare to watch it, you will sit with a relaxed jaw, as I wondered why someone spends money, time, energy and effort to make this offensive indignation of American cinema.
