Rachel, Joe, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all in great shape. They deserve an Oscar nomination for their performances. I'm a big fan of the show. Their music is awesome and they are all so talented! I am also a great representative of sarcasm !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU ARE A FAN CLUB, DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible, and the jokes are not even properly implemented (Iâ€™m sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 small, passionate S Club fans did not laugh. They thought they could do it better. And they did. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat, ugly man who founded the scrotum group," must have thanked his lucky stars, which he left when he left. One of the worst movies ever made. BEWARE THIS FILM! DON'T GO AND SEE! YOU DON'T LAUGH! You will cry! 0/10 RJT
