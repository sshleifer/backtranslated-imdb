this is NOT one of those films, this is one of the biggest scenes I've ever been in, camera work is trying to sound bright, but in fact it's just crap, everything looks like red shoes, but without sex, the only reason I bought it, was that I wanted to try a DVD, and it was the cheapest option I could find, perhaps the worst purchase of my life, and it could save you forever from the DVD, the soundtrack is REALLY sticky and big part of the film composed of endless repetitions of clips from the first two films, why would anyone want to make a film as horrible as it doesn’t suit me, if they really tried to make an original film and failed, I’d be better off in this review, but they Didn’t get the rights to reproduce the first two, and then edit and repeat it in this film with perhaps less than 1 3 original frames, which roughly corresponds to the standards of film school students, DO NOT buy this film, the only entertainment this DVD has to offer is if you are live it in the microwave and look at the flashing lights! Utter utter utter incredible trash! 0/10, if only the voting system would allow it.
