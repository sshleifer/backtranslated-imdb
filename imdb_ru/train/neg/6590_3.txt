The reviews I read for this film were pretty decent, so I decided to check it out. BAD IDEA! This is another ghost movie that wants to get revenge on a group of friends. The story is stupid, mix the two parts of the Ring with one part of the prom, a drop of "I know what you did last summer" and add a tiny line "The Lonely White Woman" - now mix up to complete meaninglessness. In this story, there is nothing new, and the revision of the clichés that I loved so much, this time did not even take up. This film jumps too much into the past and from the past, and as soon as I understood everything, I realized that it still doesn’t make much sense. Characters are moving from sane psycho-killers in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites - a greedy, selfish lawyer, an egocentric actress, a former baseball star, a video voyeur, a bitter girl, a frightening quiet girl, a pretty girl, “sweeter than a pretty” Fucking cat ... and I didn't care . Perhaps the best writer could have made the film working, there were some decent scenes in it, but on the whole this film was erratic. I should also mention a certain “video cassette” that could not be removed. <br /> <br /> This film is far from the worst Asian horror he has to offer, but it is still pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud at some of the actors, or just want to shout “you're stupid!” On the movie screen, or just want another Asian horror to rip your sleeve off when someone then ask you how much you saw - this film is for you. <br /> <br /> Those who are looking for a decent site look elsewhere.
