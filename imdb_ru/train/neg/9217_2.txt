Yes, the only thing that was remembered by this film is that young Tom Hanks, who in a few years will become a Hollywood star, starred in it. Here, however, is not a film that will demonstrate his talents at all, and the only thing that may seem somewhat amusing in this film is the scene where he thinks he sees monsters and chases the guy away. Yes, this film is about the evil of a game in a game that makes a group of people use their imagination and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, the after-school type, special about the evil of the Dungeons and Dragons game, is slyly named here as Mazes and Monsters. Obviously, the creators of this film thought that nerds should not get any pleasure, unless they were going to go out and engage in underage drinking, drugs, more unprotected sex and stalking other weaker children, like all popular children. No, these bad people were playing a game that actually required them to use the brain, damn it, no! Not that if they had a brain, they could think for themselves and not brainwash certain groups. Yes, I think this film is completely stupid and a waste of time. Of course, this may be a film against drug addiction, but there are far fewer people who died, taking the Dungeons and Dragons far beyond their entire existence, than what they say about drunk driving for a month.
