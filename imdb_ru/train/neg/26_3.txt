Assuming that this does not end with the release of the video, I would have to discard this title at any cost. If you are not tired of good, well-executed films, that is. I saw it at AFI Dallas last night and left with the remaining 20 minutes simply because I didn’t care (about the plot, not about insulting the director ... it's embarrassing). When you can find nonsense just 5 minutes from the movie (shot, broken window before the shots start ... and then the window breaks with the first shot), everything goes bad. Let's just say this is just an indicator of upcoming events ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I will spare you all the details, but this is a sub-item in every respect, even a half-acting cast. Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect him to half play. And the rape scene ... Christ! “Shut up and take it” should never be used in a rape scene. EVER 3/10
