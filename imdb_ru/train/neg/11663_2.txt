White chicks. Wait, why couldn't they dress like Black chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anybody give me a Waiman film in which they are not dressed like ladies? “Don't be a threat” doesn't count, Jack White and the ghost of Michael Costanza wrote this (other Norton Trio members acted as directors). <br /> <br /> In “White tiptoe” there is never a joke. This is just Wyana, behaving like a girl for 2 hours. There are no installations, no raisins and no laughter. There are many "I think I'll play Time Crisis 3". At least for me it was (5 times, to be exact). <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kenan Kot, Damon, Marlon, Sean, Damien (the only talented one), Kim, Rakee, George W. and Osama bin Wayans stopped making films. This only damages the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * of ****
