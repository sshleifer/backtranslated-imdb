“Against All” is a very poorly made, sometimes very painful film. This is the first film by Michael Madsen, and he shows that he is not so good at it. Some people may find the story funny; the alcoholic understands that his life is falling apart, and his family is falling apart, so he calls the preacher as a last resort. After telling his story to the preacher, he takes Jesus Christ into his heart. <br /> <br /> I actually discovered many religious scenes, for example, when Cecil Mo (Madsen) goes to church, but leaves it, quite realistic. I also liked how Cecil knows that his life is falling apart, and is trying to get help, but realizes that only God can help him. In the end, he realizes that with the help of God he can live life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This film is not quite well made. The game is bad, the script can use some work and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, if you have become a Christian, this does not mean that you can automatically stop drug addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil understands this and works hard not to go astray. In general, if you are a Christian, you will appreciate how this film depicts Christianity, and if not, you can be encouraged to learn more about faith.
