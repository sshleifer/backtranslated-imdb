**** LITTLE SPOILERS *** As a connoisseur of bad cinema, I probably watched hundreds of bad movies, and yet “Hobgoblins” stand out among all in a unique way. Classic villains, such as "The Creeping Terror", "Mighty Gorga" and "Manos", are equally bad from beginning to end. Hobgoblins, on the other hand, are starting badly and getting worse and worse. During my first viewing of the infamous rake-boy, I thought it was a really bad movie. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best this film had to offer. The film takes its most massive blow to celluloid hell during the morbidly inept sequence of "Club Scum", which is a continuous sequence of one unfunny joke after another. With this one film, director Rick Sloan proves that he deserves to be mentioned along with people like Coleman Francis and Bill Rebein, as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? See "Hobgoblinov" and be surprised more.
