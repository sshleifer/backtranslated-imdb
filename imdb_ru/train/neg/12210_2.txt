This film is a joke, and it should be one of the worst films ever made by Stallone. This is a typical film of the 80s, where one person destroys the whole army himself. â€œFirst Blood Pt. 2 is very similar to Schwarzenegger's Commando, but there Arnold kills a terrorist, and here you have a special nation, shown as bad guys. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, it was the peak of the Cold War, but I was bored that the Communists or Nazis were always portrayed as enemies. There are so many American films that have one thing in common. Why can not there be a film that shows Americans as enemies? Who would believe that a single soldier would destroy an entire army? Do you really think something like that would really happen? Apparently, the average, brainwashed American audience will probably be.
