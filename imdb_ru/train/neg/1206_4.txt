This thought of a long-lost film sometimes appears online. So I bought me a copy. Well, of course, the game is terrible and the storyline is children's, but it has its own moments. I think that the people who searched for it also know the background of this. It was made by the owner of the cinema in Greenhouse for a very low budget. But for me, of course, he did not spoil the money for props, but for makeup. Makeup for this look is well done. Zombies are watchable, and the blood is whole. The only problem with such films is the quality of the granules. It's terrible, fortunately, not to fizz on the sound, but sometimes it's too dark. Therefore, you must look clearly to see the blood. Amusingly, they tried to sell this, as not really for the squeamish. A voice-over says at the beginning of the film that you need to beware of the signboard, and a man with green flashes appears who tells you that there is blood on the way. Of course, this did not work, it made me think about the cannibal girls who had this annoying call when the red color began to flow. They had an original idea, “Cannibal Girls” were created a year earlier. Do not go beyond the storyline, go after the zombies and notice the error of continuity. When the girl and the boy make love first, she takes her bra, then they make love, and suddenly her underwear is put on again ... try to do it, or I am a little off, ... eat it, ugly corpses
