Return of the Boogyman is a terrible film that does not play like a film, it plays like an episode of a television comedy series when they return to old episodes. "The Return of the Boogeyman" is just a clip show. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film - the constant and annoying memories from the first film. Again and again the same shots. How boring it is. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the psychic woman who sees the first film. <br /> <br /> I saw the first film that I don’t want to watch the same scenes over and over again, and I don’t know who it will be. The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to earn a few dollars, that's all.
