This film was the longest and record-breaking film, for sure there were 30 actors in it. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), I think no one had the courage to do something like that <br /> <br /> The film, as the name suggests, is based on the Kargil war, but the problem is that there are too many characters, and the romantic stories and songs of many characters are boring. <br /> <br /> Even too many cinematic freedoms, such as killing people with knives, I wonder what the Soldier does it? <br /> <br /> Directed by JP Dutta pales before BORDER. The music is fine. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan is among the great cast members, Saif is very good at his part, and also his first film with Karina, Abhishek is cute. Manoj Bajpai has moments when Sanju is wasted, Sunail is fine. Akshae Hannah performs her part well, rest is good, Rani is good, Ashe is fine, the rest are bearable
