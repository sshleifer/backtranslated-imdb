Where to start, this film started badly and ended badly! It consists of an extremely bad game and unrealistic effects that made me cringe in my place, seriously, my cat could act better than this game. <br /> <br /> Some of them were actually funny, because it would have been incredibly appreciated it is lower, but they have nothing more! So listen to my warning, and if you are so bored that you are close to suicide and do not want to find a good reason for continuing your suicide mission, do not worry about it. I am still shocked that this could actually be made public, it should be a crime, and everyone involved should be arrested. I suppose you have the essence by now, so I will leave it up to you.
