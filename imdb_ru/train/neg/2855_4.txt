"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy", whatever you call it ... just misses the mark. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just don’t like gangster comedies (as I thought Oscar, Johnny Danger and Mafia sucks too) This is probably more “witty sharp pun” than the whole comedy, just not so witty and sharp as (or other reviewers). <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Ting were old from the time that it was sometimes painful to make a gag out of them. <br /> <br /> There were not enough changes in location or sensation over the period in which they were supposed to be. Most of the film was either in the Dreyfus Club, or in various offices / dark rooms. .. (what happened with the fact that Sit Down Gun resisted the fact that Goldblum continued to win?) <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was ... fine on paper (it's great to see Silva and Drago), but the characters were killed before they had time to develop. and Richard Priors' cameo was a joke! The element of the film "Romance and Love" also embarrassed him. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I don’t think I’ll come back to him anytime soon.
