"I'm a cartoon!" "You're an illustration!" what does it mean ?! This plot could not be worse, because the boy who is afraid of everything becomes very brave at the very end of the film, because he went to the library. The sole purpose of this loss of celluloid was to encourage American children to read when a cheaper and more effective way to do this could be a series of commercials! Even the talents of Macaulay Calkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (so predictable that he is the Master of the Pages librarian) could save this meaningless film from a boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy or the Hollywood God of voices, Frank Welker, like cartoon characters, never save him. I can only describe it as the 1990s, equivalent to even the terrible adaptation of the Water Babies of 1978, because soft animation makes the film worse, and does not improve the dull plot!
