... so that I can tell everyone with a clear conscience how terrible this film is. I barely had time to do it in twenty minutes before I began to think to myself: “Wow, this is pretty bad.” And, to be honest, I would give this movie 1 star, if not for Esai Morales (although he had very little time on the screen). He is the only well-played role in the film, and it's a shame, because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought so. <br /> <br /> Watching this, I started to recall his role in “Shawshank Redemption” and realized that this is not as good as I thought. Problem: his actions in prison / tough guy seem just an act; his dialogue sounded as if he made a very bad impression. Has he ever met someone who speaks as if his character was SUGGESTED? I doubt it, but perhaps he should have. <br /> <br /> And, even worse, they managed to introduce a small philosophy for the prison and make it seem no more than far-fetched, especially considering that the rhetoric was cast out of “rasta”, whose emphasis was so strong that it seemed unnatural. <br /> <br /> I would not usually make such a film, but when I watched the film, there was a rather favorable review in it. I felt that I was deceived and deceived, and I thought that I should try to save someone from having to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I say “BOOOOOOOO”.
