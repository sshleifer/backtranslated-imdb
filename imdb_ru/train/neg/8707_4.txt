This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I took it off as a joke, expecting to laugh in the first few scenes, and let me say that I have never laughed so hard in my life. The first scene where the ninjas randomly jump out of the air and begin a huge and ridiculous shootout is one of the most incredibly funny silly moments of an action movie in my life. This is not a movie about dinosaurs, but rather a movie that entertains (and does not mean at all) an action genre. I have not seen the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think I missed a lot. If you want to watch a film that goes well with six packs or any herbal remedy, then I insist that you rent this film, sit back and see how the cinemaâ€™s 100-year development has been thrown into the trash can and falls on carnosaurs
