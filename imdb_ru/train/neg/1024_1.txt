I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival with quite respectable expectations. the film has a great cast, and it closed at the festival, so it must be good, right? how I was mistaken <br /> <br /> I knew that we had problems when the director spoke before the film about how when he was filming an episode with a sage, he met an unknown actor named Kevin Spacey (sage director / writer , making his role debut = blah) ... well, the director / screenwriter Edison should have some compromising pictures in which Kevin Spacey kills the homeless, because I can't understand how he (along with the other actors in the film) ever agree to be in this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> this movie is absolutely terrible! it's a mix of every hard-boiled cop. there is nothing new about Edison. the action was bad and the management was even worse. it looked like the aforementioned episode with a sage. it was the best casting I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Some examples of just bad stupid moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman is dancing around his apartment for no reason for rock and roll music ... Justin Timberlake receives creative criticism from his beauty while his apartment is surrounded by candlelight ... llcoolj driving an old-fashioned firebird ... 3 guys are shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> this film is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> STAY FROM EDISON!
