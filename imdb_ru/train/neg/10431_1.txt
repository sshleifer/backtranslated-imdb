I loved the first season. The quality declined slightly in the second season, which, however, had a great middle (Pegasus!). The third season was pretty new and original and was fine. The fourth season began to descend quickly, because they did not even give us any explanations when by the present moment we really began to need them. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What is the point of the Angel-Kara to bring the fleet to the devastated Earth-1? What was the past of the last five Cylons, and how did they survive or were reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. <br /> <br /> And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Okay. But destroy the fleet ?! Abandon technology, abandon any urban life and spread a few thousand people across the planet? It is not only against science, it is against reason and against life. And then the philosophy of the show, it seems, is that humanity is forever entangled in the cycle of transition from the romance of nature to a decadent capitalist society, inventing destructive A.I. it destroys everything. It is without a vision, without hope of a greater future for humanity, and this is the opposite of correct science fiction. And don't even get me angels! Religious delirium of the worst kind! Final disappointment !! <br /> <br /> Everything “all this happened before and will happen again” should have been related to the previous incarnation of the series, and not just to the Earth, as we know it. Creating a new show somehow compatible with the old one would be the final brilliant move. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
