I first read the novel "Jane Eyre" back in 1986. It was then that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zella Clark. It was a great version and really enjoyed the book. Years later, I saw this version and was horrified. William Hurt is not considered to be Mr. Rochester at all. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character, where William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. Great time guaranteed.
