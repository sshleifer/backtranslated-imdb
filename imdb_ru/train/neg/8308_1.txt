Entertainment Tonight went down the hill, but since last night (August 17, 2006) they have reached a new minimum. <br /> <br /> To try to unleash their broadcast, they decided last night to publish real photos of the body of JohnBenet Ramsey in their teasers ... with the words "Pictures from the case that you have never seen before." These two photographs were graphic and very disturbing. One was on the side of her face and head / neck, and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck, and the bruises on her face. It was terrible, terrible, I could not believe it. What does this have to do with ANYTHING remotely connected with Hollywood Entertainment ?? Nothing!! They lowered their level of dignity and value to a new minimum .... and it shows. Previously, it was the premiere show to watch ... and now it's just rubbish. <br /> <br /> Now Iâ€™ll watch Access Hollywood.
