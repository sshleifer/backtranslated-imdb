Be sure to ridiculous version of the film literary classic "Moby Dick." John Barrymore - Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is the rival of Miss Bennett's affection. When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He must kill the whale and bring Bennett back ... <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that may have stirred the audience of the 1930 theater; especially the scenes in which Barrymore is losing a leg. However, the film is not very well aged; there are much better films of that time, and the silence of the 1920s and the walkie-talkies of the 1930s. Two famous attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett, are not at their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (August 14, 30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
