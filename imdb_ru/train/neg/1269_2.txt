This series gets 2 stars solely because it makes a film with Dickens's “Dark House” and maybe someone will read the book. Contrary to what the opinion probably got, Diana Rigg was as poor as Lady Dedlock. She was clumsy and wooden. Lady D. is a discreet character, but not a martinette. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. Therefore, I will interrupt myself and answer all those who say: "I have not read the book, so I do not need to accept the opinion of this guy, because he bases his assessments on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because of a bad game, regardless of whether you read the book or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliott is a tolerable Zhardyns (albeit too old). The series fails not because it is unfair to compare it with a book, but because different storylines and characters simply do not unite to create coherent, dramatic, mysterious and irresistible entertainment. It is boring and flat. If you want to make an amazingly good Bleak House, you need to spend 20 hours of a movie on 10 two-hour episodes. But I suggest producers and so on. Leave Dickens alone (even “Christmas Carol”). Television kills the genius of Dickens, which is manifested in his brilliant plots and unforgettable characters.
