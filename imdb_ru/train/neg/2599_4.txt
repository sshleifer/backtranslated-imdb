I got a DVD very cheap, and I’m a complete Druby, and this is probably the only constellation where this film can interest anyone. <br /> <br /> Drew's early film, she looks great, and she gets quite a lot of her really cute scenes, such as a scene in the shower, a sex dance scene, a lot of sexy clothes, etc. She never shows the friendly charm we know from her later films. The film itself is quite average or sub-average, and much more like a film for television than a movie. There is no real horror or tension, and dialogues are often frank. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing is probably the end, because I honestly don’t understand it. But maybe there is nothing in it to understand about it. But at least you will not get the end you expect, and it will also come much sooner than you would expect. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this film is intended exclusively for Drewbies.
