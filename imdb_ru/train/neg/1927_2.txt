(possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someone once asked Dr. Suze if they could secure the rights to the film for his 1957 Christmas classic "How Grinch Stole Christmas." He abandoned them, insisting that no one could do better than the wonderful special television show of Chuck Jones, released in 1966 (perhaps also meant his bitter experience of writing the script for the movie “5000 Fingers of Dr. T” 1953 of the year). When a good doctor died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still stubbornly refused to sell the film rights. But with the usual use of CGI effects became a reality, Mrs Geisel changed her mind. Universal made her a generous offer, which she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the main character. Presumably, she was satisfied with the end result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes us one of them. <br /> <br /> The film was allocated a budget of $ 123,000,000 (which exceeds the cost even in the “Gate of Heaven”, including an adjustment for inflation), which obviously went to a complex make-up, decorations and special effects (which are somewhat undermined pretty nebulous cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of this money was allotted to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seeman (scribes from "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", Which did much better <br /> <br /> the use of a large budget), while a special film was a trimming of 26 minutes without an advertisement, this film tries to fill in 105 minutes of additional background information about Grinch. It turns out that in childhood he was the subject of ridicule, including the particularly humiliating experience of one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that worries our poor Mr. Grinch is directly related to someone else. The problem seems to be quite a long 105 minutes, with too much dead tree clogging up the story. This may not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a bit more ... well, the Grinch. The character, written by Dr. Seuss and Chuck Jones later revived, was a sly fox whose deft attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of his heart. Kerry Grinch is a loud, hyperactive jerk, and sometimes a thug who, when hosting the Chirmeister, is angry at the town square of Vivill in anger <br /> <br /> (I hope the landscape looked as good as it looked)) . This undermines the script's attempt to make Greench more sympathetic, since all those who are down in Vivilla do not sympathize so much (at least in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> Vervill Vision Dr. Suze was a small town inhabited by honest people who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The film's Whoville is a rather noisy and crowded place, populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic girls; An obvious attempt to comment on US consumption. This is insulting <br /> <br /> hypocritically, because the film industry has benefited greatly from American consumption and because this film has contributed to this thanks to a huge advertising campaign <br /> <br />. <br /> The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou, a small but important character in the original. The innocent two-year-old wifi, who came to this deceptive Santa, is now older and wiser, constantly questioning false values. Someone who tries to understand Grinch's point of view (one of her main scenes from the original is reproduced, making it seem to have no character). It seems that she <br /> <br /> is the only one who finds out that Christmas is more than just presents and decorations, which makes her a completely different and more annoying character. <br /> <br /> Those who celebrate Christmas should rather take a piece of coal in their stockings on the morning of December 25th, than a copy of this excessive, overly tedious, tedious, rough hand, rough attempt to turn the children of the Classic into a feature film. This proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, manipulation and rudeness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity and heart. The guys from Universal should go down on their knees and thank God for the fact that this truly gall-bomb for $ 12 million raised $ 260 million in the country, otherwise they would not be here today. Moreover, it allowed Mike Myers "The Cat in the Hat"!
