Spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can guarantee a horrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. The brain is perfect for these words. Horrible script, idiotic game and fun special effects make it a must for every fan of a bad movie. Horror cheerful. The post-production team looks like it gave up. What makes the brain delightful is in the second half, it is actually trying to be good! Can a little ingenuity and consistency keep what is already a joke? <br /> <br /> It's Christmas time. Mother and daughter are killed by one of the funniest villains in history. The next day, the rebel teenager has enough problems, and he is sent for psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If a policemanâ€™s head is cut off, and a stranger with blood on it and a bloody ax were told by some children, who would you believe? What begins as funny becomes boring and tedious by the end, when the Brain tries to be serious. The child can not be scared by terrible moments. The brain is too funny a concept to try to be tough. Institute of Psychological Research more large manufacturing enterprises! Our ugly villain and his companions are rewarded for pulling some of the worst actors I've ever seen. The viewer at discretion strongly advised.
