Only the most ardent DORIS DAY fan could find it, even tolerant to watching. When someone thinks about the wealth of material available to the story of the most famous eclipse in New York, a film that could deal with numerous real stories about what people had to cope with, it scrapes the bottom of the barrel due to lack of originality storytelling. <br /> <br /> Once again, Doris is outraged because she suspects that she could have been compromised on a blackout night when she returned to her home in Connecticut, took a potion to sleep and woke up in the morning with a man who did the same thing, getting lost in the house by mistake. <br /> <br /> No one can save this mess - neither Doris, nor ROBERT MORS, TERRI-THOMAS, PATRIK O'NIL or LOLA Albright. According to the instructions of Hee Averbek, this is the weakest machine in which “Day” turned out to be, making a commitment to make a film because of the frauds of her husband and is unable to get out of it. Very bad.
