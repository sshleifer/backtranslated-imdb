Even for a weary model of the film as a nature-man cycle, which prevailed in the 1970s, the ants are miserably behind being at least somewhat effective (although amusing themselves for reasons he did not intend to). This is sooooo ridiculous. Obviously, these ants, which were bulldozed near the hotel, have been feeding on toxic waste for decades and have now adapted, emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites are deadly. Watching the cast of some bad glory clumsily falling among tiny black spots is painfully not so good, but very bad. A lot of the scenes look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into the bin during an attack, Suzanne Sommers crying in horror while lying in bed, Robert Foxworth and Linda George breathe through pieces of wallpaper, Bernie Casey pretends that I have a drumstick, and the list can be continue and continue. The danger shown ranges from ants crawling from the drain to the black lines of ants across all the walls. The cast of the film is not bad, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy must sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope that she has found a good use of this money, since it is obvious that this was the ONLY reason why a woman would have her pedigree in this nonsense. Although itâ€™s a pretty bad movie, you can watch it - sometime for me, and it does have many of those bad qualities of the seventies movie - novice actors embarrass themselves, what they do for television, and the scary creatures of nature smelling of revenge on person This time, the person must push his hand into a pile of ants that will be affected. Really terrible.
