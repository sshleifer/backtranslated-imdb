This is possibly the worst version of the play I have seen - several times on stage, except for the movie. <br /> <br /> A very good idea for staging - the American South can provide a reliable background for extreme situations. The reaction around the alleged wrongdoing of the Hero. <br /> <br /> But penalty! Widdoes is a very well-educated Beatrice, who gives particularly poor performance. Waterston, a wonderful actor, is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The worst role in the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make a caricature out of this is modeled on the villain who links the maiden to the railway track, coinciding with the cornerstone of Dogberry and his people - but the action makes you want to cringe. <br /> <br /> Successful scenarios include a scene where they cheat Benedict, forcing him to believe that Beatrice loves him — if he were competent, it would be excellent. But the use of the river and the visual humor of approaching Benedict is well thought out. <br /> <br /> Overall, I had to force myself to keep looking, but it certainly did not catch my attention. <br /> Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> As for the last comments, I’m almost 40. I’ve been watching Shakespeare’s stage and screen productions for more than two decades. May I suggest, trying to protect your friends, you speak with a part, and not attack other reviewers when you are so insufficiently armed from the point of view of facts. However, based on your aversion to youth, I can assume that you have reached a sufficient age when the mannered game of days gone by is more to your taste. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite couple was Rilans and McTyr on the London stage. In contrast to Widdoes, McTeer, a skillful and charismatic performer, can act.
