Unlike the other two current US game shows (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), the pace in this show is too slow for what is happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away with with a slow pace, because games can change the pace or finish at any time. In each action taken by the player, there is a risk, the reward varies greatly, and it is difficult for players to get away with a significant amount of money. Suspension is usually used with benefits. <br /> <br /> Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is too slow. When a question is discovered, and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. It would be very useful for the tempo of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST, and THEN the player chose the dancer instead of wasting time talking about what would happen if the player gets the wrong answer when we all know they are right - This is a filler that actually feels like a filler. Too much time is wasted, and not enough is happening ... and the fact that players cannot leave the game earlier ensures that there WILL be a lot of time wasted. <br /> <br /> Yes, and I have no interest in Shat’s shaking up, especially after I had dinner. <br /> <br /> I’m a fan of game shows throughout my life, but even I had a lot of problems when I spent a whole hour. We need either major changes or early retirement.
