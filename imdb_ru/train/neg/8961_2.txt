This film was another waste of time ... Why do I continue to rent such nonsense? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * Oh, good. Back to the movie: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you REALLY enjoyed the first movie (like me) and just want to check what happens in the last (hopefully) movie copied together just to save poverty hired actors and screenwriters Then, of course, this is a movie for you. But if you are looking for a good movie with a good acting game and a fantastic plot ... * evil smile *, then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... Well, I lie ... In the best case, this film sucks, OK, I have to admit that some of the elements in it were cool ... well ... cool ... and I laughed more than once, not at all, but still I was surprised. :-) But just a few things that hardly make the category “good” are not enough for this film to be worth it at all ... If you don’t consider “Manos - Hand of Fate” to be one of the ten best films EVER!
