<br /> <br /> Having finished watching the film “Trance”, “Eternal” or what the producers call this film, I thought: “Of all the bad films that I could see, couldn’t I have seen at least one funny ? "Even if the film is not very well shot from the point of view of acting, directing, writing or something else, it can be at least amusing and therefore worth it. But this film is not only artistically bad, but incredibly boring. For a plot of such subtlety, it moves terribly slowly, with a little dramatic tension. At least, on a weak attempt to entertain itself, the death of the heroes could be steep and / or bloody, but the creators of this dragon also failed in this department. <br / > <br /> What does this movie have movement to this? Nothing special, unless you are having fun watching how Christopher Walken, able to be brilliant, puts so little effort into his game that he will fall into self-parity mode (WHY did he decide to act in this film? ). <br /> I give this movie 3/10, because, God help us, there were actually even worse films made before.
