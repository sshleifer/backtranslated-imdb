With MASSIVE advertising, it becomes known to Nickelodeon and Nick Jr., and the like, my son urged us to see it. I have already seen almost everything between DVDs and theaters: from outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) to really bad ones (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But it was just the worst movie I’ve ever seen, kids or non kids. It was "when will this nonsense end?" such an experience? Well, it is aimed at young children (or better - it offends the intellect of all who are older than 3 years), but I have never seen something so predictable, repetitive and slow. Then, when you are finally fed up, but you are relieved to understand that the film is over, at the end there is a strange thing that you consider a joke, but it isn’t - it’s serious, although it’s hard to say they are trying to achieve. 3-D effects ... yes, if you have never seen the Viewmaster, they are important, otherwise not (if you look at the screen without glasses, it looks like the same process). Even my son was bored to the end. My wife and I looked at each other and said “wow” at the end. Bad in every way.
