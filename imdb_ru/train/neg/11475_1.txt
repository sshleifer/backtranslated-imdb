The film, in which you want to throw a sword. I saw Schlok in my time, but after watching this terrible mess, I donâ€™t think I will ever be able to watch another movie again. May God pity the souls who did this. <br /> <br /> The room - a former silent stallion from the army, the character of the underwear model (actually well acting) goes in search of the girl who sent him a Christmas card while he served in the army. Lands with his cabin, living family of granola type, which are the right lumberjacks. The family takes him, and the chick needs 2 hours of our time to understand that he caught better than her liberal appearance, French drunkenness, driving a Porsche car, loudly talking on a cell phone, lazy, city stall, a bridegroom with a Jewish appearance. > <br /> The Bad - 1d characters, 1d themes. Beaten on the head with a pro-war theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good commercial breaks were long. Peter Jason. It is over.
