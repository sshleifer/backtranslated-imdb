This film stinks! You will need more than two hours to get through this. The sliding doors, with Gwint Paltrow and director Peter Hovit, did what Melinda and Melinda are trying to do MUCH better. This film was smart, witty and well-played. I cared about what happened to both Gwints — or rather, the characters she played — and the performances with the actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Where Melinda and Melinda are tiring, the dialogue was invented less concerned about any of these people - the least about Melinda. Melinda alone is so incapacitated - her first glass of wine at 10 am - and so melodramatic that she is funny, not in a comedy sense. The second Melinda is good, but it is easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's previous ensemble films worked because, I believe, he spent time on the script and the actors were talented. One of the trivialities of this film is that he wrote this script in two months: you can say. And although Chloe Sevigny is talented - there are no others, not enough to be a whole presence. As a result, the film becomes Chloe Sevigny and other people you know in other films, but you can't remember which ones. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
