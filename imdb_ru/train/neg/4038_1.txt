To understand how awful “The Shield” is, you have to write pages and pages, so suffice it to say that this is a monument to bad direction. <br /> <br /> “When directors go awry,” the name of this production. Indeed, filmmakers must fill their work with a sense of visual style and storytelling that propel the story forward. <br /> <br /> How to constantly shake the camera and play with the zoom lens as a “style”? How does this move the story forward? Of course, there is the nonsense of "editing by random numbers." Apparently, it became fashionable to simply cut out by chance. <br /> <br /> I believe that there is too much work for good editing. <br /> <br /> Well, it did too much work for most people to watch The Shield, which languished as one of the most bloated and light-hearted shows of all time.
