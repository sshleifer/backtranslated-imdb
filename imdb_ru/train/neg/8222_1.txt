Hmm ... Well, I think I have all the gorilla-style shooting techniques, but unfortunately, I think that the gorilla could have made a better film ... This thing was a complete mess from the very beginning. Bad game, bad direction, bad story and terrifying cinematography. As this piece of garbage was released, I will never know, but it happened, and, unfortunately, I watched it. Filmed on a film set in Tennessee by the directorial team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thyssen (Harry and Lloyd), Five Through the Eyes, I suppose it should resemble a Blair Witch movie, but doesnâ€™t make it ... its nose dives off a cliff. I was really embarrassed because of these young women who, I am sure, promised Hollywood glory, but ended up in this pile of manure. The dialogue is ridiculous and actually sharpens you when you listen to it. How this horror movie should be is another mystery, because there is nothing remotely frightening about it, except for the fact that I watched it ... Try this size: 5 of you and 1 of it, do the math and beat her ass ... "The End." Unfortunately, this continued (and continued) for another 95 minutes of stunning stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and wanted to get my money back.
