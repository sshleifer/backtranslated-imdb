This film was probably the worst film I've ever seen. This is what immediately catches the eye: 1. The forest looked more like hills in Los Angeles with a pair of trees and shrubs. Not scary at all. Flash news: if you are shooting in a Southern California area, the big bear is just an hour away. There are actually trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. The letter was absolutely no doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the film was unoriginal, cliché, or just plain silly. For example, the name of the camp is “camp blood” (lame), the name of the clown is “killer clown” (lame). What does a clown do in the forest? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. Last, but certainly the least actor. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. Virtual cornucopia with shitty lines and bad game. Worst of all, the accidental flash returned to this fat foreign girl, who undressed and took pictures. This is a really long scene, and I guess she should have been sexy, but she was NOT. In addition, and it was one of the few pleasant parts of the film for me, it was a tool that should be “sporty”. For example, when he is bored in a movie, he grabs a couple of stones and starts twisting them. Then he has to run for the clown, and with his run “like a girl” it immediately becomes clear that he is not athletic at all. Oh, and the girl who played Kate, Lord, stop singing. This song you sang for captions makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you watch this movie, I would at least recommend watching the special features. A group of donkeys who made this film talk about it, as if it were a truly original story. In fact, one of the girls actually says that she allowed some of her friends to read the script, and none of them could predict the end. Apparently she's hanging out with special kids.
