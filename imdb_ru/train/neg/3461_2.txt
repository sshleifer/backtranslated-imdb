Slasher movies are often viewed as derivatives, repetitive and frankly non-original. I was a horror film fan, but this film was so poor that the words let me down. The script is strongly absent, the plot is ridiculous, it acts incredibly badly. Just a round abomination, on which I spent the time of my life. It had all the entertainment value of the 15th sequel of the film, which was terrible in the first place. <br /> <br /> Who filled this mess? <br /> <br /> I liked only two things in this film. The first was the killer mask - which was nice. The second was Australian intimacy with humorous profanity. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this terrible mess
