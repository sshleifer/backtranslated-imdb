So it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can slightly believe that you are worried about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director is plotting to blow this doomed plane from the sky before it dooms the world of prophecy. That's all. This is a good thing. Acting ... honest. The plot ... stupid. "Twist" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not as if no one ever thought about what to do when the plane is polluted. Don't you think that bureaucrats have a guide on "epidemics" and how to contain them? Proper implementation of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. Do not send them to Iceland, and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why was the door of the plane open, and the "arrows" were standing there without protection? In fact, did it occur to anyone to shoot at her feet? That would stop her. But not so dramatic. I'm a sucker. I always watch a movie to see the end as soon as I started it. But it was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it with a recorder, so I did not have to watch all the ads, it was a plus. This is a good example of why I watch so little network TV.
