Spooks are nice junk with some well thought out episodes, funny stories and dialogs, and some third level actions. <br /> <br /> Many describe that this is the British version of "24", and you can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares weak idiotic plots, but the penalty is much nicer, sexier, and I suspect that it is expensive. <br /> <br /> Some people describe a weak comedy as a “gentle comedy”, <br /> <br /> This is a gentle hour of spy stories, the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carré. <br /> <br /> Give me a smiley any day.
