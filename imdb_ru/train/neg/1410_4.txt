Still a famous, but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not been filmed for four years. When he is invited to take part in a new project, he asks the director’s clumsy cousin to disembark him in a poor Latin district in Carlson to study the work of the manager of a small supermarket. He sees the magnificent Spanish box office Scarlet (Paz Vega), and he is attracted to her abilities. His driver never returns to catch him, and Scarlet drives up the actor. But first, she is interviewed for the post of secretary in a construction company, and the actor helps her prepare; then they spend the day together, having a pleasant time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the meaningless “10 items or less” is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget film does not seem to have a storyline and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, and in fact nothing happens for 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous: the character of Morgan Freeman returns to the world of silver spoons and tells the simple worker that they will never see again. Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his beautiful world with his family? Or was it a clash of classes, and he realizes that his bizarre neighborhood is not suitable for a simple worker from the lower classes? My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Um Astro Em Minya Vida” (“Star in my life”)
