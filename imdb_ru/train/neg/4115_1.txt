“Power Play” begins interestingly, but quickly goes down. The only good actor is Tobin Bell, and he has a very small role. Apart from Bella, Power Play has no redemptive value or interest. Power Play has more earthquakes in a few days than in California in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely incredible. And all the action scenes are like a bunch of third grade students putting on a play. This is terrible, just terrible. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if Power Play were shot in the 60s or 70s, it would have been considered a bad B movie. The fact that Power Play was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there such a thing as a movie class "D"? If so, “Power Play” throws the form.
