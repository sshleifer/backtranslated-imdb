I once recalled seeing a stupid comic from Nintendo Power, in which there was the same work of art as in this show ... and then there were rumors that this show came on television next to me! I was not thrilled, but I was curious ... I was curious how badly this show would suck. All my friends said that this show has no real meaning and is too stupid for ordinary people like me to enjoy (I'm really gay), so I decided to watch a show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First of all, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid, and I hate how so many fans drool at Tiff, that's sad. I also hate how they made chef Kalasaki (or, as he was not uniquely called) a good guy who had a restaurant. Bad traffic, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing more than a loser advisor to King Grandfather (who sucks on this show), and I hate the face of the only company that continues to supply Grandfather with these terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> Then I started to hate Kirby even more, as it was obvious that Nintendo was just eager to get Kirby some popularity. Kirby will never win Mario in the fight for composure, and Kirby will always be just a tiny cream ball of gays. NUF SAID !!!
