They really cannot become more stupid than this film about the three losers who are trying to capture the spirit of the college during the annual spring break in many of our institutions of higher education. The problem is that these losers are trying to do it 15 years after graduating from college, when he is assigned to look after the daughter of a female senator preparing to become the next vice-president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the daughter is not at all popular, but, of course, sheâ€™s coming out of it all. Girls are experiencing drunken rage, exotic dances and other nonsense. <br /> <br /> It really can't get much worse than this horrible movie.
