Well, I just ordered it on my pay-per-view home because I was bored and needed a laugh. I have to admit, I laughed several times, but I donâ€™t even remember in which parts they were. I do not understand why this film was made. It claims to be a comedy, but seriously, I do not find the singing penis or naked 70-year-old woman very funny. This film tried to fit into the "comedy" comedies of recent years, such as "American Pie" and "Autotravel", but failed miserably. It was the road to big turmoil, then it was a comedy. Besides, why should Cameron Diaz put her name on this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy, nice and well done. Also avoid this movie. 3/10
