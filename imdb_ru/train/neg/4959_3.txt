Remember the good old Batman animated show from the 90s? The one that people praised? One that people of all ages can all appreciate? The one who showed Batman as a real detective instead of Hulk in a bat costume? The one who had the villains to whom you could relate? The one who had the villains with real motives? <br /> <br /> Well, it's clear that Warner Bros. not. From here and this thing. Honestly, do these people know anything about Batman? Have they ever watched the Batman comic? Do they know that Batman should be a "detective"? Connecting 2 clues doesn't make you a detective! It makes you a little smart monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic scheme of the episode: <br /> <br /> The penguin is stealing something. "Opening credits". Batman finds a dead hand of where he is. Batman goes there and gets in trouble. A commercial. Batman finds an obvious / stupid way out of this. Penguin runs away. The penguin does something obvious again. Batman follows. They do kungfu (by the way, everything, and I mean that ALL know about kungfu for some reason). Batman punch penguin. he passed out. goes to archam (Note: usually in every episode the villain is different). <br /> <br /> As you may have noticed, Batman is not a very good detective story. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe he is in the old amusement park"! Yes, he may have been there the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I already mentioned this, but EVERYONE KNOWS KUN-FU! Even Penguin! what are they thinking about? (probably because it’s from the people who did the Jackie Chan animated series) <br /> <br /> What’s really upsetting is that the show is just an action. There is no smart. No one. If Batman needs to think, he will use technology, and then take up Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But let's not forget the villains. In the end, what would be Batman without his gallery of scammers? <br /> <br /> Well, first, I must say, glory for originality. I don’t think that other Batman’s media could have imagined a joker and a monkey locked up in horror, as strange as emo, and poison ivy as a minor (which is a little confusing when you think about whether the main force?) <br /> <br /> What's even shit is that every character is now a two-dimensional stereotypical cheat. <br /> <br /> EG <br /> <br /> Murderer Kroc wants to flood Gotham for no reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bath is a mad scientist, hungry for energy, who for some inexplicable reason is obsessed with bats. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. Without any reasons. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most offensive must be Mr. Freese. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy award? victory in the episode "Heart of Ice" from "Batman: the animated series"? The one who gave Mr. Vries a motive for his crimes? An episode that was so good that it was used in the comics on its original story (mad scientist)? The one that made him a victim, with a purpose? Hell, even Batman and Robin admitted that, using this as Mr. Frizz, the origin of this P.O.S. film. <br /> <br /> Well, in this series, “F # ck that” is written, and he makes Mr. Vries a jewelry burglar before his accident, having only wealth at his disposal, then freezes and gives him the opportunity to make things cool. Then he continues to steal the jewels for no reason, pronouncing such lines as “Have an icy day.” <br /> <br /> They may have watched Batman and Robin after all. <br /> <br /> But hey, look at the bright side. This series makes you feel nothing for the villains, so you are a good person. Lucky you.
