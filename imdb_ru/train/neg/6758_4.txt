Quite possibly the nicest woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie gives here another great performance. Although her work in “American Nightmare” was much better, she is still worth seeing in this film. <br /> <br /> The cast is filled with typical types of Melrose Place, chiseled features and curvaceous curves that I have never seen before. In addition to Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I’ve seen before, in similar Delta-Delta-D. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around a group of California arrogants who inject poor naive Debbie Rochon into their clique. They tell her that they have a murder club, and that she must kill someone in order to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more than to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group must decide what to do with it after falling in love with their joke. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ $$$$ (Abundant! Debbie Rochon from time to time splashes blood all over his face, and all the murder scenes take place on your face. The hounds of Gore will surely like it!) <br /> < br /> Nudity: $$$$$ (Also abundant! Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes, like many nameless actresses and actors. Pool party seems just an excuse to strip everyone on the floor; both men and women. Julie Strain also has a topless cameo, besides her. The character disappeared after the first five minutes). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (Could get a higher voice because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a placeholder between the nude scenes. I understand that B-Rate films often use nude bodies , but it is overly limited). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Action is a sub-standard, to say the least. Rochon is always true, the best B-Rate actress in business today, but her character in “American Nightmare” was better. Danny Volsk does an excellent job. with the role of Debbie's lust, but other actors had nothing to write).
