Why me? Why should I be subjected to such a slaughter, from which an interesting conspiracy could turn out ?! At least, if I can warn other people, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible film for a college course. Otherwise, I would look at the synopsis on the back of the thing and stand aside. The film was slow, with a RED little character development and was centered around the idea that a creepy white man could be cool if hanging out with a Los Angeles style token. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the stereotypical feeling of dizziness in Los Angeles - watch the movie. However, please note that this film DOESN'T DENYTHING what we used to consider the “LA lifestyle”, this is a great example of products that arise from it.
