He gets only the third billing (for Arthur Tracher and Virginia Field), but this was actually the first lead role of David Niven, and he is charmingly stupid, like the stunned PJ Woodhouse of Bertie Wooster, the master (by name only) Jeeves, this most imperturbable of valets. As an adaptation, it looks more like a diluted THE 39 STEPS than a real Wodehousian walk. And this is very bad, because the interaction between Treacher and Niven is not too far from the goal. Alas, the mysterious trails of the film 'B' and the forced comedy become tiresome even for a short 57 minutes. The following actions next year (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) were even more irrelevant, Bertie was not visible, and Jeeves (of all people!) Was forced to act out nonsense.
