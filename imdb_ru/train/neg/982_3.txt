The real star of this ridiculous story is a great technique. Visual pleasure for the eyes, the film does not stimulate the mind and heart. At first I was intrigued by the idea that Dietrich and Boyer left religion in order to “gain” their ability to love. This is followed by a huge disappointment. Boyer - the only real actor in the play, and everyone feels his torment. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe eclipses her performance - sometimes it is scary to look at her face - an unfeeling mask. As a monk, Boyer kept the formula for the convent liquor (which reminds me of the truth about Chartreuse) - when he leaves his “marriage with God”, the reaction of his fellow monks holds shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer feels that Boyer is well rid of his past. However, the subsequent journey is too predictable.
