R. Balki is trying to tell you the story Ram Gopal Verma had previously told in Nishabda in a sensual way. This time he is mixed with mature humor. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef who owns Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his work, like any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. Still can not do Hyderabadi Biryani properly. <br /> <br /> Enter the taboo, which sends her the correct Hyderabadi Biryani, which she did, and soon they begin to meet and, finally, fall in love with each other ?? Amitabha is 65 years old, and Taboo is 35 years old. No problems! But one snag! Father Taboo Paresh Raval !! Couples decide to meet with their father for the approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger than him. And begin complications ?? Performance wise, all three actors are great. The script of the film is very dense and interesting. Dialogues of the film are striking. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not filled properly. The comedy is sometimes misunderstood. In some parts of the film also goes a long time. <br /> <br /> Musically, thereâ€™s nothing to sing about except the title track. Camera work is good. Directed by R. Balki could give much better from this script. But in the second half, he himself looks confused. "Satyagrah" father's scene looked annoying. But the lines that Amitabh Bachchan talked about during this scene are worthy of cotton. <br /> <br /> Overall, Chini Kum needed more sugar!
