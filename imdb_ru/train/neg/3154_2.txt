Look, this movie is nothing particularly offensive, just boring. This is a typical rom-com with an ending that you can see before you see the trailer. The key difference is that the classical rum-comas are engaged in their stories wittily and without pretensions. There are no complaints in this film, but in reality there is no feeling of movement in it, you feel that you can stand up and leave at any moment. The production of the film also resembles a debut film, shot about fifteen years ago. I would recommend reviewing a classic film, for example, “When Harry Met Sally,” instead of this superficial role model. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you are used to seeing how Michael looks so cute, like Vaughn in Alias, you will be seriously disappointed with the way they made him look here.
