The film begins with the fact that people on Earth discover that their rocket to Mars was not lost, but simply flew in space next to the planet. When he is found, one of the crew members is sick, one is alive, and the other two are missing. About what happened to them, tells the surviving participant. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the team was apparently attacked by a whole host of very stupid monsters with eyes. Oddly enough, although the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the most stupid that I saw in the movie. Plus, in a strange attempt at realism, the production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this great innovation just made the film quite cheap when they were on the surface of Mars, and the intensity of the redness almost made my eyes bleed - it was THAT bad !! Despite all the cheese, the film did have a somewhat interesting plot, as well as a good message about space travel. For fans of the genre, it's worth a look. For others, you can just find it all pretty stupid - see for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> Although by today's standards it is not a particularly good sci-fi film compared to films that are shot. at the time, it stacks pretty well. <br /> <br /> PS - When you watch a movie, pay special attention to Dr. Tremaine. He looks like a poured Dr. Quest from the cartoon "Johnny Quest"! In addition, he sounds and behaves just like him.
