The great ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a bad film in all respects. The script, the dark pace, lack of depth in any character, meaningless background scenes, terrible game, unnecessary climax - all of this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not find anything pleasant, pleasant or intellectually stimulating in any way. <br /> <br /> I think that the filmmakers thought they were doing something clever and dark with its capricious lighting, long protracted silence and dimly pursuing classical soundtrack. If so, they completely failed. I'm just bored, and I wish I had ever watched it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
