Many of the themes or parts of the story are the same as in “Leone,” while the other parts looked like some other film, I don’t know which one, but there’s a familiar feeling in the whole film. It was nice to watch, but it would be great! if the story was more original. Themed little girl, bad assassin from Leon, just a little tweaked. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the movies :-) My biggest problem was to remember what roles were from Leon, Nikita, and if they were from the French or American version, If you have not seen Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best regards / Rick
