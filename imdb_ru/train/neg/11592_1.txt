I'm still trying to determine if the previous installment was worse than this or vice versa. The fact that almost fifteen years have passed since I saw this film, the fact that I remember so little about him does not bode well. Perhaps this is simply because I only watched it once or twice, but I doubt it. If anything was worth remembering about this film, you can be sure that I will remember it. <br /> <br /> By the time this film was released, the franchise was still in the dying stage, so a lot of media coverage was allocated to it. This is never a good sign when Teenie Pop magazines contain explanations of the plot. One such article should have explained that Freddie was too weak to direct dreams to adults, so he decides to follow Alice’s unborn son. So far so good, but it is the work of a writer or director to explain to the audience. This should not be left to any unrelated publication. <br /> <br /> Using the trifles cited in the third part about Freddie's concept, we could half expect scenes that would raise this joke from the “horror for babies” category. But, alas, this should not have been. This suggests the obvious idiocy of the American rating system that a piece of b'harni-style garbage like this one can get the same rating as a really frightening piece, similar to the original. <br /> <br /> By this time, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a coefficient of competent action. Or maybe she just looks competent compared to the rest of the cast. In any case, given that her last role was in a film called “All the New Adventures of the Blade of Allegiance”, I doubt that she really had something else for her. Even poor old Robert Englund worked better than in the last fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Considering that box office returns have declined steadily, and not only for this franchise, at the time I thought that the studios would understand that sterilizing their films does not make them more attractive. In fact, this particular film, like its immediate predecessor, was so neutered that it not only failed to attract a new audience, but also managed to alienate the main audience, which initially supported the franchise. Despite this, in the fifth part, I must pay tribute to the fact that I did not have a bright, glowing feeling that made the fourth part look so offensive. <br /> <br /> I gave the “Nightmare on Elm Street” part five one out of ten, Trying to appeal to everyone or to the MPAA idea about everyone, it does not attract anyone. Like the second and fourth parts, it was possible to completely erase it from continuity, and no one would notice the difference.
