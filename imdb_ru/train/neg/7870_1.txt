The original "les visiteurs" were original, fun, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 should be a candidate for "The worst first sequel to a really good movie." In LV2, everyone continues to scream when the gag does not work first, it repeats 5 more times with some vague hope that in time it will become ridiculous. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, except that the parody must be inventive. If you liked LV1, just donâ€™t watch this movie, just watch LV1 again !!
