I can't understand why so many people praised this show. Twin Peaks is one of the most boring games I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I saw all the episodes of the first season and the first episode of the second season. I just can’t participate in this show anymore . <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the proper induction in a criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In the first season, Agent Cooper threw stones at the bottle. Can you guess why he did it? He simply wants to identify the killer by making this "joke", mentioning the supernatural abilities given by Tibetan sleep. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this series. <br /> <br /> For example, the second season began with a “funny” scene that the dumb old man Cooper plays with a cup of milk, while Cooper lies down on the floor. (He already had a gun shot in the stomach). This old man does nothing, only utters a few silly comments. That's all. <br /> <br /> This scene is very boring and even long (3 min 30 sec .... It's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I would rather read a few comics than see this show more.
