If you can do this with “classic Meyer” titles / introductions, you can go through anything. But would you like it? I have not found there a lot of things to dig my teeth. I suppose if you go to this with low expectations, you will be delighted (angels a la Charlie). But for my money, I would like a little something more visual, more exciting. More. I feel that I am asking for porridge on the host's leg. Men received the goods. but he just won't share.
