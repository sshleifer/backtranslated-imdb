I know that I fall asleep during movies, but usually this is due to a combination of such things as, indeed, fatigue, warmth and comfort on the set and just ate a lot. However, on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish. The development of the plot was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but without explaining what caused them or why. I admit that maybe I missed part of the film, but I watched most of it, and everything seemed to go on its own without any real concern. I can not recommend this movie at all.
