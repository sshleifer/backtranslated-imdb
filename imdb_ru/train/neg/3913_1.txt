This film is a good example of how to spoil a book in 109 minutes. With the exception of character names, the film is very little like a book. The book is full of strong Latin American characters, and they, for the most part, are represented by non-Latin In the film, there is no character development, and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And to remove the full generation is unforgivable. Isabelle Allende has written a powerful book, and this book must be read!
