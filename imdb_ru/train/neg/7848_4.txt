this film was just stupid, I don't think it was scary at all, I went hoping to be shocked and scared, but mostly laughed, some scenes were simply falsified and gathered together, blood scenes were extremely due to cg of the mutants, it was funny, because it was terrible, because acting was just awful, you think they could get good actors and most of the characters I hated, just because they acted stupidly and sucks, even though that should have been in the army. I watched movies for free and saw how many people came out, I guess, because it was so stupid, sort of, I am glad that I did not have to pay for it in short. HOME Ass, movies, I do not see it ... but again, this is my opinion
