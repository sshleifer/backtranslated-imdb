This film was exactly what I expected, not great, but not so bad. In my opinion, PG13 movies are not terrible enough, so I already knew that I would be bored throughout the entire movie. Of course, terrible things were happening in the hotel room, but we have not seen anything like this before. I think I didn’t like it, because I thought that there were too many turns; it has become old and repetitive. I also did not understand whether all of Cusack’s experiences in the room were real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that have occurred. The film is only delayed, and when it finally comes to an end, you want it to continue, because you are still waiting for someone to tell you what the whole movie is about. What I liked was the special effects. Besides this there was not much pleasure from this. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was below average.
