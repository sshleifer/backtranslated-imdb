Every time a film is so short-sighted in its desire to present a definite end or point of view that he simply does not care about the real story, it is annoying. These are the types of films in which the final point of view or point of view is conceived first, and the story is simply linked. For this reason, we often talk about how a story “jumps through hoops” when it is spinning, trying in vain to logically move towards a predetermined ending. <br /> <br /> The story in “Comet over Broadway” is not easy to jump through hoops, these are three circus rings. This is so ridiculous, so ill-conceived, so dishonest, that if you tend to speak out loud to the screen, you will continue to rant before you finish. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this scenario is that the cesspool is the choice of a woman between family and profession. Since everything is so terribly confusing, it will turn out for people of any opinion. Thus, in the end, there is no point in the story, the topic becomes irrelevant, and, as often happens with bad scenarios, acting does not save anything.
