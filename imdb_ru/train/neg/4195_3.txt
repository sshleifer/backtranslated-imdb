Given the people involved, it’s hard to understand why this film should be so confusing and boring. The author, David Ward, wrote an amazing film with Capers Sting two years later, Jane Fonda just won an Oscar for Clute, and Donald Sutherland just did an excellent job in films such as Clute, Start a Revolution without Me. and “Kelly's Heroes.” In the story, the film is a fairy tale with capers, with a small gang of clumsy losers planning a big robbery. At the same time, the film wants to be hip-hop satire, a series of comedy sketches of the type that the NBC television series “Saturday Night Would do just as well two years later. The fucking result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem clumsy and forced, and the turned off comedy bits destroy any ambiguity that a robbery can have.This is literally a film that constantly crashes into itself, just like cars in cars on demolition scenes. face each other. <br /> <br /> The only real interest for me is to watch Jane Fonda. Her Iris Kane should be a frivolous version of her dramatic character prostitute Bree Daniels in Clute. However, they do not believe her for a second. Jane Fonda always pretends to be the prostitute we see. It’s just as terrible as her performance at Clute. For acting teachers it would be a good lesson to run two films together to show how the same actress in one role can be great or pathetic. This suggests that the actors are as good as their writers and directors.
