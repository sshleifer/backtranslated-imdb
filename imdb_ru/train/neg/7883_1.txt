Deceptive cover, title and a very small hidden imprint of the “Forces of Prayer” made me rent this film. <br /> <br /> He started very well and attracted me. I REALLY liked it. In the interval between 1/3 and 3/4 of the film, the film began to include things that were not created and had no meaning. My first thought was: "It is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story." I ended up reviewing parts of the film, thinking that I had missed something. <br /> <br /> By the time I got to the last 1/5 of the film, it all became boring, annoying, the religious dialogue made no sense, said nothing, and it was unpleasant to listen; I turned off the sound and rewind to the end. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch out for DVDs with Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions. . <br /> <br /> And I am a practicing Catholic.
