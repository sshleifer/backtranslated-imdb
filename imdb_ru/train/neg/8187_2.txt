I entered this movie, expecting it to be really awful. And it was. I really felt sorry for the star cast - Kathy Bates was a great actress ... before she starred in this film, Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were, as usual, disappointing, but Miranda Richardson could not play I know and love her for. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (among others, Vicar of Glory Dibley), had one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and ubiquitous, but the humor ... was not enough. (However, there was one part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family ... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) colliding with a train (in fact - maybe the train would be better .. .)
