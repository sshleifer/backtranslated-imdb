As for cinematography, this film was pretty good for the mid-50s. Several times the lighting was too hot, but the pictures were usually in the frame and remained in focus. The game was above average for low-cost smelly, but the direction was terrible. Several scenes were dragged on for too long in an attempt to pause, and there were no effects. The attack of the skull in the pond had to be completely removed from the final slice, and each attempt to revive the skull was evident with the help of beats and sticks. I also could not help but think that the budget did not allow them to equip the house, so they continued to refer to the movers and that all things in the warehouse should appear soon. Honestly ... it would be more interesting if it were the worst movie. It was not bad enough to be a "good-bad" movie, but it was not good enough to be "good." Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
