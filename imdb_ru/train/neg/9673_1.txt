“Plants are the most cunning and evil of all forms of life,” says one of the possible sluggish victims in Achenes, a stupid, listless remake of The Invasion of the Co-Agents, Triffid Day, and about a thousand udders. Why are the seeds more dangerous than plants, may I ask? Because, according to the same fool, "the seeds can haunt us." Yes, I can recall one horrific case when MooCow was just a calf, chasing all the way to school because of the predatory seed dandilion ... Yes, that's right. Unfortunately, the “monsters” in this sultry little turkey look like shaggy little dolls, some of which are circling like evil reed warblers, others are swimming on strings. There is not the slightest hint of horror or uncertainty. For inexplicable reasons, seed monsters are knocked out with 50-volt UV lamps, although they can walk in daylight, which is 1,000,000,000,000 times more ultraviolet energy. As you can see, not many thoughts were invested in this cow flop. MooCow says you should weed your garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
