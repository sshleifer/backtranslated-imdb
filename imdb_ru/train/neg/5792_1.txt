One more thing made for TV stuff! This is an insult to the military film (I use the word “film” in its freest form!) I thought that Telly Savalas’s career had reached the bottom when he voiced the video on Tarrant on TV during that visit to Birmingham regularly, but then I forgot that he was involved in this! I tried to insert it into my subconscious memory, but cable TV vomited memory and screams from memory !! <br /> <br /> I like a little bit (sarcastic laughs!) in the film, which claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the forties, but this is clearly a snapshot of the Zagreb cathedral in the late eighties. In addition, the locomotive that the commandos train on the JZ logo show (Yugoslavia Zheleznitsa, or Yugoslav State Railways) on the side of the locomotive is quite clear, although the manufacturers tried to darken them. Why not just a movie in the UK if this is where most of the movie is going? <br /> <br /> Cheap junk and celluloid waste!
