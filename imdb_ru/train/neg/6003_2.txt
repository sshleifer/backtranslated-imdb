The sunset - with the participation of the weakest, most stupid vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most inappropriate, pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane, a vampire who every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half the time and rolled the eyes of the others. <br /> <br /> Vampires do not seem to have any special abilities - except for the strength (sometimes), the ability to turn off the lamp with your mind (once) and ... that's it, really. Have you ever imagined how Count Dracula recoiled from the battle with dismay because he ran out of bullets? And me too. Virtually every other movie â€” Dracula would eat this movie for breakfast, cleaned up his followers and used their bones as toothpicks. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the film is that a human family of four was caught in a battle with vampires - Dracula against some old eccentric. It could have been good old B-flick fun, but the overly dramatic music was written by someone who took this film too seriously and ultimately destroys the rest of the film, not yet destroyed by clay bits, a mediocre game and a funny script. . <br /> <br /> In the end, it's too stupid to be funny. Of course, he has some funny moments, but they are few and far between.
