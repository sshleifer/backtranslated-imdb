I was interested in this film only two things: I was waiting for the death of Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. <br /> <br /> It was basically a one-woman show. Catherine Zeta-Jones was just there to give sweets. Liam Neeson was completely wasted in this film. Like Jones, he played no role. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one who really participated in this crap David Self scenario. Well, it was his first film, and he bought himself with Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I don’t know what was the problem of director Jan de Bont. He did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. he really fell to work here. Perhaps he was still recovering from the Speed ​​2: Cruise Control disaster. He should thank his lucky stars for the Wild Wild West, otherwise it will be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
