If this film were a comedy, I would give it 10. Oh God, where should I start? Let's just say: I have seen a lot of horrible horror films, but this one makes Troll 2 look like hellish rescue of ordinary Ryan. It's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror movie, changed their minds in midproduction and decided to make a comedy, and then returned to horror, and then decided that they should have just stuck with porn (erotic in this). Everything in this movie is just awful: a musical score (someone shoots a guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), script, direction, cinematography, acting. There are simply no words to describe it. Oh wait, yes, there is: Holy $ *%!.
