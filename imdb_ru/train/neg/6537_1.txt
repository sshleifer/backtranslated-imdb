First warn me that I saw this movie on TV and with dubbed English - which may have completely spoiled the atmosphere. However, I appreciate what I saw and hope that it will distract people from this version. I found this movie painfully boring. The whole atmosphere of the film is lost due to duplication, leaving a slow disappointment from the Stalker film. Sorry, but the worst sin in my book is being slow, except for a film about philosophy. I have not seen any deep philosophical significance in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to say it the way I see it. I appreciated this "1". What can I say, American tastes, maybe.
