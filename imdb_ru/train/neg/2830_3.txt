If Ashanti were a serious attempt to make a film about the institution of slavery, which is still common in third world countries, the film might have been better received. Instead, it turns into a star-strewn disaster from the film in which the stars came, said their lines and took a salary without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Kane and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and their humanitarian work in East Africa. Pyotr Ustinov comes, who can barely bring enough ham into him to play the role of a Muslim slave owner. Since Johnson is black, he still grabs her along with many children, as well as several adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kane does not refer to abduction with love, and the rest of the film is attempted to rescue. In the rest of the cast, people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif, and Indian movie star Kebir Bedi piece by piece look so incredibly boring. <br /> <br /> Usually something like this talented person like the ones mentioned above will be just outrageous and feasting on a diet set. But Ashanti doesn't even have this. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of tax writing permeates the air.
