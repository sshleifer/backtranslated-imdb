First of all, yes, animals have emotions. If you did not know this yet, then I think that you are an idiot. But let's assume that none of us are morons. We all know that animals have emotions, and now we want to see how these emotions manifest themselves in nature, right? <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that tries to show how animals are “human.” The filmmakers are looking for higher and lower shots of animals that behave like a person, and when this happens, they say: “This monkey is almost human!” (This is actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> It's all human. They spend time on theoretical speculations about what makes dogs “smile”, but never mention what a wagging tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even went so far that they showed chimpanzees dressed in human clothes and wearing a cowboy hat. <br /> <br /> I expected an insightful documentary about animals on their own terms. I wanted to know how animals show emotions in their OWN languages. But instead, researchers continue to resort to pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a soot soundtrack and images of chimpanzees "celebrating Christmas," and that was enough to turn the belly upside down. <br /> <br /> But that’s not the end of it. Half of this documentary is not filmed in the wild, but in laboratories and experimental sites. All the pictures of the chimpanzee from the camera pass through the steel rods, and we see how these monkeys crowd in sterile concrete cages. One particularly sober moment happens at the very beginning (although you must be quick to notice this) when a captive monkey speaks sign language: “I want to. Hurry, leave. <br /> <br /> Unclear references are made to "stress tests" and psychological experiments that I cannot imagine. Small monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and get frame dolls to prove that young monkeys crave the "mother figure". And after 40 years of experimentation, smug researchers pat their backs to come to their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> To this end, since 1966, in the concrete cage since 1966, there is one chimpanzee. to this day it remains so. We get a brief look (again through the bars) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather dull facial expression. Personally, I do not need any more experimental data. Washoe, I apologize for all our species.
