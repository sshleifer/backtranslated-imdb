I really would like me not to write this review. I am a Christian, so I was looking forward to see this movie. It seemed gorgeous - a Christian film with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing (not that I bought the Bible Code myself - you can make him say whatever you want. I do, but I believe everything inside the Bible). So I sit on the edge of my seat, enjoying watching, when the film begins, and I manage to ruin my mood in a matter of minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on the terrible letter and acting game while I was in the theater (I would have been torn to pieces by people who were encouraging rather clumsy, but mostly uplifting scenes and choking from insanely obvious and predictable scenes of tension, I am sure ). However, after the release of the final credits began, I could think. There were many parts of the film that I liked - some mostly unexpected plot twists, some effects that were really special (I don't consider Visions. They were made poorly), and some interesting technical works - fading, decorations that Type of thing . Unfortunately, I had the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation for a monkey and put the monkey in front of the typewriter for an hour, I could get a better script. And the music was beyond grand (even for a Bond fan who loves curious music in action and intrigue scenes). Therefore, I would like to be the same as everyone else in the theater — as people who cried and gasped because of how incredible it was — but I’m not someone who can be comforted by a writer who throws some words through the Bible shell and slaps Christian stamp on it. I need a good story and a plausible dialogue before I can enjoy most of the movies, but it just wasn't there. Sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And this is a tragedy. When will we see any reasonable Christian fiction? It must be somewhere in there ...
