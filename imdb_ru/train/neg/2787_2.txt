By the numbers is the story of Kid (the prince), the singer, on the path to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his father-beating wife (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of Prince, but I liked the three big songs from this movie - “Purple Rain”, “Let's Go Mad” and “When Doves Cry”. The concert scenes in this film are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, this is a VERY small part of the film. <br /> <br /> The story with flashy evidence was made many times before - and much better. Plots, to put it mildly, are poorly processed. The love triangle between Tiny, Apolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I was really offended. His story beating his father is needed for this story, but the scenes are so poorly processed (in action and directing) that I could not believe it. The scenario is terrible - a lousy dialogue and some really painful “comedy” routines. And here are tons of misogyny - the Baby's mother is beaten; The kid hitting Appolonius and (for no reason) Appolonius strips and is topless to swim in a muddy river. Also, Williams and Princes heroes constantly treat women horribly. <br /> <br /> In this film REALLY fails. Apolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And the Prince (easily) is the worst actor I've ever seen. His empty face and wooden conversation are so bad that I could not believe it. This film comes to life only during concert scenes, but in reality there are not so many of them. The "dramatic" scenes are so poorly played and processed that they make this film hard work. They should have made this concert film. I give it 2 - just for music.
