This painful comedy-drama received surprisingly good reviews after its release in 1979. I remember when I opened the movie section in the LA Times and watched a two-page ad for “Chapter 2,” filled with vivid inscriptions like, “Better than Farewell, girl! and "Neil Simon does it again!" What is Neal Simon doing? He takes an autobiographical situation (remarries too soon after the death of a beloved spouse) and makes it rusty, unpleasant and - worst of all - unfunny. James Caan plays Neil, that is, George, a writer who cannot return to life after losing his wife; enter the energetic March of Mason (the real Mrs. Simon ... will soon become the former Mrs. Simon), who is trying to love George, despite his mood and general melancholy. Mason is very attractive here and, perhaps, would have saved the day if it were not for Ken’s indifference (not to mention the story about the painfully thin blonde Valerie Harper, which caused the case to stop). I liked Mason's blast at the end (“I'm wonderful! I'm losing my mind!”), But I didn’t see a happy ending for these two people ... and time proved that I was right. ** from ****
