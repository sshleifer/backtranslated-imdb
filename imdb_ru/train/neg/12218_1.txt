Very bad. Very very bad. As a guy who seeks to make, to be or, at least, to sniff a table with food at the set, it is difficult for me to criticize the independents who really shot a film. However, this film ... oh, dear. <br /> <br /> Understanding that Frightworld is not seeking anything more than rough exploitation (a worthy thing in itself) and trying to bring it into line with more common standards is a mistake. And, frankly, it is more exciting than, say, the “Red Zone of Cuba” ... but not by much. So I will not try to criticize, just let me ask for some observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If there is blood in the film, can't you see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you have hired three sound engineers, make sure that at least one of them knows how to operate the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, your lead maniac should be worse than a smurf doll. , It’s hard, I know, but actually ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are many talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of whom can be hired very cheaply. Find someone who knows how to create a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) If you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other interesting programs, this does not mean that he should do it every two seconds. <Br /> <br /> 6) Kudos for the fact that the girls took off their tops, but next time, get the girls whose tops we want to see removed. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell a story or set a mood At least in this kind of editing films bloody jokes should be sold. The chainsaw that suddenly appears in the character’s belly is not terrible, it is careless. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all actions were bad. Jack was very good, and I liked Acid when she began to resist. There were some neat images, unfortunately, they were thrown onto the screen without rhyme or reason. “Acid Poptart” is a title that deserves a better movie. I also like the mohits from Frightworld. Next time, now that they have something like a film, I hope that they all will strive for something better than Coleman Francis. Update at least Ed Wood.
