Soon, Disney makes one of his films, which surprises everyone. One that makes you think until the very end. According to the tradition of "Pirates of the Caribbean", this film will surely turn into a ghost, as well as kill and rape your village. It's horrible. If you want a thoughtless, meaningless, predictable action movie, go ahead. I believe that these may like small children, as they like, when the good ALWAYS wins. But I like films that are challenged, who will win. This movie never lets the bad guys win. By the end, when the heroes are left in the “inevitable” pit, you simply KNOW that they can get out. Everything is perfect for Cage and his friends, he will never have to think about a riddle or a key for more than 10 seconds, no matter how difficult it is. Watch this movie if you want to see impressive scenery, not if you want to see a good game or a good movie. Go watch a movie about superman, it will be much shorter, and children will like it more. For example, the scene in which Cage runs away from armed militants, and the bullets all deviate from the fire rail. (And I'm not talking about a fence or something else, just ONE LITTLE POLE) This film shows the disintegration of films and the film industry into cheap jokes and boring, unrealistic actions that this film offers in large quantities.
