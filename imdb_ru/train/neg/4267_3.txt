I saw this film at the Rotterdam Festival, like all other voters. The director was present and seemed to work very hard and was committed to the project, which, I think, explains the above-mentioned average reception and noted it. This is more like an episode of the favorite movie Australian's child "Round the Twist", but he takes himself too seriously to even have this redemption function. The film itself may be worth seeing if you are trying to make a cinematic world tour with a visit to all UN member countries, since I cannot recall another Fijian film, but in general it was a common, poorly played (although the cast ) and the victim of a lower mentality. The moral of this story seems to have been that the native inhabitants of the island will try to deceive each other, but as long as a decent white governor comes into play, all problems can be solved (by leaving the island).
