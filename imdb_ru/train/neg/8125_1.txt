“The Bat People” is a really bad movie that deserves the appeal of MST3K just like the other movie “The Creeping Terror”. <br /> <br /> In it, we are in some mountainous area full of bats. We see a lot of things, such as flying bats, attackers and all that, chasing generalists, failures in the emergency room and much another! All this, plus the foolish mediocrity of the 1970s (hey, think “Mitchell” is here!), Which makes The Bat People actually one of the best of the latest episodes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 made in the series! Moviewise, this is terrible. This should be avoided like the plague, unless Tom Servo and Crowe are watching you. <br /> <br /> “People of bats” - more like “Bad people !!!!!” LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
