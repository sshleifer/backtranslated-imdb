It's hard to believe that David Duchovny was at the top of his fame in 1997, and The X-Files, one of the best science fiction series in history, was at the top of fame. Nine years later, he was almost forgotten, and his attempts to do it on the big screen failed miserably. I can't even explain why he is an honest actor, but probably his moment of glory has put him in an eternal role that requires great talent to break free. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less well known and she was very lucky that a movie like “Playing God” did not lead her career to a standstill. Fortunately for her, “The Collector” and “Girl, Interrupted” waited around the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career began. <br /> <br /> Not much can be said about this movie. This is Andy Wilson's only big movie, and there must be a reason. Everything is trite, and most of what is happening on the screen was expected in this story by a former doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim at a bar, only to find himself working for the crowd. The voiceover is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shade of filmmaking experience from the film. You probably won't see the movie, but in a DVD rental store or on TV. Try searching for something better.
