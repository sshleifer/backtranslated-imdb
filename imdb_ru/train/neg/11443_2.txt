Here is one of them that you can watch with an open face, with such a bad scenario that even Will Ferrell will not be in it. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. Punch dance. Rod "must go to his quiet place," and before anyone says to Kevin Bacon, he forges a passionate, frazzled bodybuilder because of the strain of the group that wants them to have big European artificial metal chops. <Br /> <br /> 2. John Farnham, You are the Voice. In one of those epic episodes where the star and his band perform “Walk along Slomo” along the main street, and the townspeople follow them on the heels of support, the soundtrack is a gag. How did the filmmakers meet this Australian musician? A major Australian vocalist (and a real talent), who gained fame in the early 70s and removed Raindrops Keep Fallin 'On My Head, and then disappeared until 1986 in John Farnham's Great Voice with You, so fascinating stupid. This leveled the mountains in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two bright moments in the film - both somehow destroyed with the inscription of deception - the rest of the film is like the choking of someone's vomit. <br /> <Andy Samberg is Rod, a loser jumper who never jumped. Maybe this is somehow related to the fact that he drives a moped into the very heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yes, someone really thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> Without a single jump under the star belt, he plans an extravaganza of 15 buses that will surely kill a less bad comedian such as Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and at the same time destroy cancer and all that. ... who even watches these films on the plot? Along the way (as usual for moronic roles in these comedies) he slaughters a healing chicken (Isla Fisher), which undoubtedly needs to be left behind in order to consider the possibility of sharing chromosomes with this loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (KERRI, 1976) had so little to do that she almost called in her speech - then she changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must have lost his bet to be here.
