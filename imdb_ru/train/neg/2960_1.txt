This is without doubt the worst movie ever made. There are no disputes. This is it. The end of the story. The history of juvenile and submoronic, it seems, it was created by a three year old boy, fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is just stupid. It's incredible how someone can think of something so stupid and think that it was funny. The jokes are also completely lame. If you have not seen this movie, consider yourself lucky. If you're curious how bad this film is, please don't make me describe it. Words cannot express how terrible this film is. This is not just bad as in a bad movie. Even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value. It. , , It. Fie! Think of the worst story ever told, and multiply its harmfulness by 5,000, and you have not come close to how terrible this film is. After Pokemon the Movie got one point, this one point seems like nothing but charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take movie lessons? Because it is a great example of how not to shoot a movie. It seems that some amateur with a high content of paint diluted this film. If you rented it, take it back and ask for a refund. And don't even think about renting again.
