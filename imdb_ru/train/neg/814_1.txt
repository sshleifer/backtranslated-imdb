This movie was just bad. Almost all the clichés of the movie about the cops are present and counted. Is the bad guy leaving? check. Partner? check. Stupid personality clash with a partner? check. Newbie something to prove? check. Rookie discovers a gray-haired veteran. check. The only ones he didn’t touch were idiots shooting themselves and retirons, but I guess they keep these old chestnuts for Dooley’s next walk. Add to the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old shows and banal choppers, such as Dooley's prize car, which is broken all the time, and you have a recipe for one really bad movie. Avoid this at all costs.
