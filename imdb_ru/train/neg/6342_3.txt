I took it in the video store because of Tarantino’s recommendation (“If you don’t like (it), go for yourself!”) On the box ... it seemed to me that I received approval ... I was expecting something more like “Proof death "... not too much actual violence in this, or plot, or character, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. It is all there. Tricks and rock. It goes back and forth. About a week later in the life of the Los Angeles group, which organizes a lousy magic show, at a level that you may see in one of the small casinos outside the Strip and the Australian stuntman who recently appeared in a city that discovers its feet ... They work, they meet girls, they celebrate. The end of the story. <br /> <br /> The band obviously needed all these things, because they, frankly, are of the second level and play in a style that is already dated 1978. I must say that the film has tricks. really spinning - this Australian guy is really something, and the film seems to be pretty much motivated by love and respect for “art.” I hung him there to see what a crazy thing he would do next. Just wanted him to find the best car.
