A model named Laura works in South America when a gang kidnaps her from a hotel room and plants her in the jungle. They demand a huge ransom for her release. Peter is hired to secure her house, and there is a bonus for him if he can return the money just like a girl. Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with a friend Jack. They are trying to give the kidnappers fake money in exchange for Laura, but the plan is terribly wrong, and they have to escape by helicopter. The helicopter was shot, and they also have to save it (not very well so far). To wander through the jungle is a kind of devil. In fact, this is just a naked black guy with a strange big eyes and breathing problems. He begins to kill several kidnappers, and Laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives. The rest of the film is actually a bit blurred. <br /> <br /> Now I’m not a big fan of Jess Franco, in fact, today it’s only his second film that I’ve seen, but even I can say that it’s really not one of his best efforts. Films stretch rather slowly, almost nothing happens. All this can be easily edited in a 25-minute TV show. There are a lot of too long shots of people walking through the jungle, which could just be picked straight up. <br /> <br /> The Devil Hunter is poorly lit (in fact, I don’t think it was lit at all), poorly duplicated, poorly functioning and slow, but for some reason I wasn’t tired of it. I think the main reason for this was some funny scenes. For example, the scene where Laura is walking down the street was obviously filmed on a real street, when crowds of people stopped to look directly at the camera while she was shooting. Another funny scene is one of the dead gangs, hanging on a tree with dripping blood, when one of his friends is standing right below him, screaming, it seems, for a minute. Then, for no reason at all, the person in the head of the trees just falls and hits the guy below him. This must be seen to be believed. Then, of course, there is a real devil. It's just some kind of naked Negro who, despite his massive eyes, has very blurred vision. <br /> <br /> The film was shot as part of a terrible video in the 80s here in the UK, and was banned. Now why this was, I have no idea. There is very little blood here, and this is hardly a shocking film. Less nude I would say that it can get away with almost PG. The only thing I can think about is that it was never viewed and was added to the original list because of the spoken words. <br /> <br /> There is no particular reason to watch this movie, unless you are a massive Jess Franco fan. There is a lot of nudity to keep you from falling asleep, as well as some scenes that are so bad that you can laugh at them, but otherwise I would say just pay for a ticket to South America and get lost in the jungle. It would probably be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
