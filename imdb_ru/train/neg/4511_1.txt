Instead of long dance episodes and close-ups of the characters, because of which the film was delayed - the film would have better explained the history and motives of the characters. <br /> <br /> The marginalization of Minister Nubo, Aunt, Mother - and the dulling of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between Hatsumo and Mameha, as well as Hatsumo and Sajuri, made the film lack real depth. If you didn’t read the book, you wouldn’t understand why Sayuri loved the Chair and why Mameha even became her mentor. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film was stunning - and all the actors did their best with the script they gave, but that's all that was good in this film.
