this film starts with a regular funeral ... and he insists on this usual funeral feeling so much that I lost interest 5 minutes after watching and started skipping scenes. it seems to me, whoever makes this film suffers to such an extent that it is trapped in a constant, painful trance, unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark children from Southpark, I want a film that in 10 minutes will help me in an interesting story, I will not sit and watch 10 minutes for nothing but preparation for the funeral ... my grandmother in her last years was fascinated a funeral, perhaps she might have liked this “movie.”
