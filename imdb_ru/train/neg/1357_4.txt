* may contain some kind of spoiler? * The mere mention of Crispine Glover is enough to send a few geek briefs to the heap. His outstanding appearance in the movie "Back to the Future" in the role of George McFly forever sealed him in the American conscience. Most recently, he tried to return to the subconscious of cults with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, Crispin directed the 76-minute cheap film Dada. From time to time it reminded me of a genius, while on the whole it almost insulted me, but not because of its content. Content? What is it? This is a film where in one half of the film all actors have Down syndrome, which gives it a strange impression. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfry and a guy with cerebral palsy. It was all similar to what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Life, and at the same time he felt more successful and unsuccessfully failing. <br /> <br /> Half of the actors with Down syndrome also have a lot of dead snails. We are talking about a guy who has a snail, and ends up by killing one. He is also tormented by a bunch of other people and a grasshopper. He falls in love with two girls, one of whom is having sex in the cemetery. He also quarreled with a friend who was teasing him. <br /> <br /> In a strange semi-interior, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. He's a kind of mind control guy, and a guy with cerebral palsy is something like sexuality. Well, he at least masturbates in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" images made with humor, for example, the Nazi Swaztik, crossed with Shirley Temple, and minstrels with a black face say they are Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the torturer still deals with his love of killing snails and beating other people. They beat him with stones and the like. They later beat the minstrel after they put him on trial. <br /> <br /> Returning to the inside, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set and tries to control everyone, but fails miserably. <br /> <What is this? makes less sense than Dr. Caligari, and he has stolen more than fleeting style. The claustrophobic mental space is very similar to how Dr. Caligari's wall decorations felt claustrophobic. They also had some dialogue that was absolute nonsense. And all this was shrouded in absurdist images for humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is that after about 20 minutes of the film ... maybe a little more ... What is it? ends figurativeness. Over the next 56 minutes, we continue to work with the same sets of images, presenting only new images in the form of an absurd puppet show. The film seems a little more than a film that tries to go beyond the offensive and forbidden images. He is trying to mock and confuse the audience. But the problem is that he has enough different images for a 40-minute film. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the cinema, set design and everything else seemed very cheap and almost unplanned. It seemed to me that "well, this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way." It was not interesting, and it was pretty ... boring. Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, had terrific cinematography and framing. The difference between them is quite striking. <br /> <br /> rating: C
