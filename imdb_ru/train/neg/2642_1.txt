Slowly, slowly, slowly ... There is no riddle or excitement in this film. If you do not understand who the “mole” is in the first ten minutes, it means that you have a dead brain. There must have been a secret service, because they needed the whole film to put it together. There are no convincing characters in the film (not the film). The pace of the film is slow, there is no tension. The bounty hunter is a great shot, if he doesn’t aim at Michael Douglas, than all he seems to be able to hit is big glass glasses. The funniest scene in the film is when the presidential wife utters the code word at the end of the anti-climatic end. This is ridiculous loudly ridiculous. At least six people got up and left the film early. I would have joined them if I had not been sitting in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this film to anyone.
