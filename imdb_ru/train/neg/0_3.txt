The story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. It begins with an introductory scene, which is a terrific example of an absurd comedy. The formal audience of the orchestra turns into a mad, brutal crowd with the help of the crazy singing of its singers. Unfortunately, this remains absurd ALL times without any general narration, which ultimately makes it too complicated. Even those of an era must be turned off. A mysterious dialogue would make Shakespeare easy for the third grade. On a technical level, this is better than you think with good cinematography of the future great Vilmos Siegmond. Briefly, you can see the future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederick Forrest.
