During the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps without underwear, wants to kill his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a newsstand, and longs for a brave young man whom he meets in railway railway station. And he is the hero of this meaningless film, which is all dressed (except for Crabb in at least one scene too much), but he has nowhere to go. The main plot is very simple, but drags on for almost two hours before reaching a meaningless conclusion. Verhoeven has good visual talent, but he resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, clear symbolism and useless blood when his ideas run out.
