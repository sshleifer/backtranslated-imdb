I read some positive reviews about this film and was really surprised at how terrible it was. Positioned as a cross between a story related to AIDS and something like Ghost / Spirit of Bliss, this film cannot always decide what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have “open” relationships - Simon can have anonymous (albeit safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark HIV +, and he and Simon seem to have no more sex life. When Mark dies, Simon, who made a habit of turning off his emotions after his father rejected many years ago, tries to erase his memory and just become a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was completely different. But Mark returns in ghost form and interferes with his various attempts, at the same time forcing Simon to open up and recognize his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish son of a bitch, it’s impossible to sympathize with him for most of the movie. By the time he needs to be more sympathetic, it's too late to take care. Mark, on the other hand, follows in the footsteps of Demi Moore from The Ghost, weeping profusely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> After Mark’s return, a strange change in tone occurs. Suddenly, we get several unsuccessful attempts at humor, as in the TV series "The Witch". But it does not last long. As soon as Simon's emotional health is threatened, everything becomes more and more gloomy, with amateur attempts to twitch your heart strings. The finale, with a gilded angel-muscular boy directing Mark’s tear to heaven, while punished, heartbroken Simon waving good-bye, is stunning, mainly because it is not intentionally ridiculous.
