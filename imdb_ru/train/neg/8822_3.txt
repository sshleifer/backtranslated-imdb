While watching the movie “Christmas Evil” can completely depend on your personal state of mind and can turn into an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR into one of the most pathetic and insanely slaughter slasher on the topic of holidays. Personally, I feel the desire to choose the latter, because I did not bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated the rude and unpretentious shirt of the early 80s with a nut in the costume of Santa Claus, who kills people. Wrong! The film is about a guy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a garbage toy factory and considers it his duty to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves gifts and who deserves punishment. Harry's problems all started when he witnessed Santa? is his dad in a suit clearly ?? caress his mother's bare legs at a gentle young age. After that, he just turned into a social outcast, much to the annoyance of his younger brother, who has to do one day (Holi). I fully understand why some fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie, but was it really that boring? There are several long and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the scarcity of blood and outrageous bloodshed, but this film does not even benefit from the alarming atmosphere or the unexpectedly crazy plot twists (I have to admit, with the exception of the final). In addition, I would take this concept more seriously if the crazy protagonist focused on the death punishment of naughty children! He does not and exclusively kills misbehaves adults. How should you take a wannabe's controversial and original Christmas thriller serious when Sant doesn't even commit one unfortunate child murder? This would make “Christmas evil” a classic, whereas now it’s just a forgotten and pitiful piece of trash.
