It's like the 6th movie. The film is really bad. Nothing is offered in the death department. One-liners are bad and should not be in the film NOES. Freddie looks like a happy kid in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing worth it. Characters are extremely underdeveloped. In general, better than the 6th, but still one of the worst films of the series. My rating is 2/10
