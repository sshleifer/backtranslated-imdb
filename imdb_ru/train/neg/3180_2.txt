What a boring movie! Summarizing, we can say that Nana Patekar beat her daughter-in-law Carisma Kapoor while she tried to escape from the village with her son. Can someone say boring ??? The concept was not too bad, but it was poorly executed. Canadian venues and some village scenes were well filmed. However, in general, cinematography has not justified itself. The story could have been great, but the film seems to have lasted. Stupidity can only endure a man, not to mention the three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie is “Ishk Kamina”, and it lasted only five minutes. Other than that, this movie was crap.
