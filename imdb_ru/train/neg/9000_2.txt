When I rented it, I hoped that the “Kingdom of Fire” did not bring: a clash between modern technology and mythical animals. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got the standard click "Monster hunts for stupid people in a remote building," with a bad script, bad music, bad effects, a bad storyline, a bad game. Bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> The only reason I put 2 was that theoretically there could be worse films. In theory.....
