SPOILERS HERE <br /> <br /> My high school did everything possible to motivate us for exams. But the most memorable method that they used to bring us to the right state of mind was a guest speaker who was none other than the beloved son of Australian kickboxing, Stan “The Man” Longinidis. The first mistake they made gave the guy a microphone, because he shouted half the time, even though we were not more than 3-4 feet away. Now, his speech was full of the usual “if you are not preparing, then you are preparing for failure”, but there were different cases when I really worked. The guy stood before us and preached that throughout his life he did everything for himself and for no one else. In the past, he was offered many deals to give up kickboxing, but he was never distracted from the prize of becoming Australia’s greatest kickboxer. He said that he was not sold out, he was happy and retired, he had never participated in any other activity except Kickboxing ?? Then he hooked up his movie. Yes, you heard it right, he turned on his new film. When he talked about this, he asked a woman to come and hold a poster advertising him, and then he showed this crappy 4-minute clip of this nasty movie called The Trojan Warrior. (This is all before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his last battle for a career (for now)) <br /> <br /> Stan plays Ajax, a former kickboxing special forces agent who is being dragged into the ominous underworld of Melbourne. Ajax's cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel), recently sold (well, at least Stan was not too far away from EVERYTHING) to the feds, and as a result he runs away from all organized crime groups. Ajax and Theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations, ranging from a fight in a kebab shop and ending with fiction as playboys at a captive party. This is all rather ridiculous, but if Silverstein really intended to make a trustworthy film here, this person should never give the camera again. <br /> <br /> I admit, I really wanted to see it. I love action movies, even if they are trite, especially if they are installed in my backyard. But what I was presented with was an acting film that was terrible from the word “go” and continued to do it after the words “for the love of God, please stop it!” The plots were introduced and were not even touched. again after they took to the streets, the characters were simply added for absolutely NO ANY reason, and the most dramatic fight scenes that did not even remotely reflect Stan's real talent in kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless episodic episodes made by almost everyone who was REMOTELY known (Dermot Brereton, Mark Chopper Reed and Greg Matthews). All the time you sit and play guessing game, just standing in the background. It is a pity that the film largely depends on the appearance of former celebrities in a split second. Remember those plot holes that I told you about? At one time, Ajax was apparently locked up, mistakenly accused of killing his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in the special forces through one sentence in the film ALL, and then left it for mistakes. Then comes another sentence that convinces Ajax to help the same people who mistakenly locked him. Then, in the end, Ajax is told that his wife is not really dead, but sold into prostitution. Do we see her? Not. Ajax leaves to find her as soon as he hears this? No, now it's a marriage! <br /> <br /> Amidst all this annoyingly childish crap, some website describes this film as “a cross between Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie”. Has this man ever sat and watched a Jackie Chan movie ?! Chen demonstrates greater dexterity by taking a dump than Stan did, well, NOTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the crime movie “Messiah”, and you compare him with Salik Silvershtein!? This film is more like a mix between Pizza and Enter The Ninja. <br /> <br /> Now, where did you get the whole title of "Trojan Warrior"? Vibrant fighting skills of Ajax, like an ancient Greek warrior? Not. Combining gangsters to find Theo, as in the Trojan Empire? No, is it because waiting for him ?? Theo carries a condom. Yes, exactly, because the feasibility study is ALWAYS PREPARED with a Trojan RUBBER in his pocket, he is a TROJAN WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> I was displeased to see the “Trojan Warrior” on DVD, as well as its “special” functions: <br /> <br /> ?? Video clip "Chop Chop", Mark's rap song "Chopper". Read: Chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that ANY can rap. The funny thing is that Chopper just knocked for 30 seconds and then threw it to these two albino teenagers from Doncaster, using words such as dis, doping, etc. In their Australian accents. Face it, rap was developed in the States, leave it there! The video was similar to the fact that the 31 channel operator shot in ecstasy. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no real difference between this and the actual movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: It wasn't so bad, considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights, shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall about 15 times in 3 minutes editing) /> <br /> I don’t want to say that this film contributes to the fact that this country is going to hell when it comes to a movie, but ... oh wait, I just did. Anyone who reads this, I advise you to go and buy 4-5 copies of The Trojan Warrior, write them together and use it for a paperweight, because this film is damn bad.
