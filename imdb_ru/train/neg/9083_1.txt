It was so terrible. Watch was not fun at all. Even the scene where the girl uses a vibrator, even it is not interesting to watch in this film. I say again, the scene where a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even interesting to watch. Or maybe it was the only part of the film that you watched, just a girl on the couch with a vibrator. Perhaps they should have just released this one scene in cinemas, maybe then the film would be enjoyable at a certain level. My advice, go to this moment, watch it, rewind the film, watch it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours this way. This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
