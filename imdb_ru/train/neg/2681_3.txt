A very good story for the film, which, if done correctly, would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the end of this film? <br /> <br /> In fact, what's the point? <br /> The scenes penetrate so quickly that you feel that you were not emotionally part of the film, and a sense of detachment from understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> The performances are questionable, if not believable. <br /> <br /> I missed the conclusion somewhere in the film? I think we need to wait for the continuation. <br /> <br />
