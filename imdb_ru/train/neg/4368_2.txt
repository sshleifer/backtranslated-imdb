Alpha released it to the DVD market and is intended only for Boris Karloff fans (for example, moi). This is not a horror film, but a drama in which Boris fights for a scientist, agreeing to kill a rich womanâ€™s husband in order to get the fortune he needs to continue his work. But as soon as the dying victim changes his will and leaves nothing for his spouse, all hell falls apart. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see Karloff as another selfish, sinister type, and some actions are unintentionally ridiculous (especially from leading lady Mona Goya, who is a violent laugh like a double wife). <br /> <br /> But proceed with great care.
