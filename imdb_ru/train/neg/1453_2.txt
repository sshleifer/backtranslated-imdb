I'm not sure if it was a language or a bad acting game, but everything in this film looks and looks cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After watching Der Untergang this is a huge disappointment. There is no connection between the different scenes, and the game is so incredibly poor that I could not even believe that people can create such a mess of something that has great potential. <br /> <br /> And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English, Big mistake. German has a certain sound, and especially Hitler himself sounds like Hitler, only when he speaks / shouts in German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me believe that it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty, and the film seems to be a collection of random events that could happen. <br /> <br /> Whether an Englishman or the fact that I saw Der Untergang, everything in this film was fake and funny.
