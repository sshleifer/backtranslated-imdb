(it may be a little on the spoiler side) I would like to begin by saying that I did not watch the whole movie and could not, because from the first hour it was obvious that I would be incredibly disappointed. This, of course, is a problem with taking, which many consider to be an amazing book, and turning it into a Disney Made for TV movie. <br /> <br /> “The wrinkle in time” was supposed to be an amazing film a long time ago. He has a great storyline that can catch children and adults. Plus, built-in high-quality prequels. But Disney-Fing was not the right way. The problem with the film is that everything they changed to turn it into a visual story was stunned by what was so great in the book. This is a difficult and emotional story for children. There was no reason for making Charles Wallace just a “psychic” because it was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W. As added tension, there is enough tension in history without it. There was no reason to take out Meg points ... which deprived us of what could be a very nice scene between Kelvin and Meg, what happens in the book. <br /> <br /> I could find fault with trifles for a few days, but I also think that big things, such as artistic direction, were turned off. Take, for example, the way they made the Kamazotz look with a strangely darkened sky. The creepiness that occurs in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like the earth. There are people like him. The sky is blue, the grass is green, and children play there. But something a bit wrong. The directors decided to make Camazotz completely different, instead of taking a lesson in the book and applying it to the general direction of the film. The lesson, of course, is that Kamazotts may well be Earth, that is, if we forget how to love. It would be much more scary to have a wonderful day when they were walking down the street, when the children were jumping up and down in the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> I, unfortunately, did not see the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney also messed up the end. <br /> <br /> Overall artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
