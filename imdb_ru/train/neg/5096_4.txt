Kurt Russell (as Stephen Post) works as a postman on UBC (this is United Broadcasting Corporation); he does not go to work, offering ridiculous projects, such as "Dr. Abraham Lincoln's Dog," to studio managers, because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Programming Director Joe Flynn (like Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr. Russell’s suggestions, but does not know how to choose a popular TV show. His secretary, Heather North (Jennifer Scott), who performs the double duties of Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who fucks off of Russell when he wants to watch TV. It turns out that the monkey is watching all the popular shows and can easily choose hits. Russell discovers chimp talent and uses it to promote his own career. It is clear that for Russell and the actors, everything becomes DIRECTIVE! <br /> <br /> Playing chimpanzees (run by Frank Lamping), he plays well; Raffles looks boring and / or distracted during several scenes when the chimpanzee should look interested; this could be corrected by repeating or editing. There is a soft satirical edge - imagine how a monkey chooses TV shows! And this is the monkey that gets BEER during commercials (by drinking in a Disney movie)! Viewing the cast will show a bunch of funny TV actors you can find out and try to shoot. You could make a drinking game in honor of Raffles' greed, guessing the actors, and where you saw them before. Here's the beginning - Hey, isn't this “Dr. Bellows” from “I Dream of Ginny”? Down the hatch! <br /> <br /> **** Barefoot Head (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
