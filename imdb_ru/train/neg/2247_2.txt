Chris Kristofferson, who reached a drug addiction peak in the mid-70s, finds himself barely able to squeeze into the screen next to La Streisand's huge ego and feminism in a discount store. <br /> <br /> None of the characters is really cute; I was very happy when the Ferrari of Christopherson overcame this hill and collapsed. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie about rock and roll, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (made a total of about one and a half years after this duck).
