I have 2 home entertainment stores, and I saw a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one was so bad that it made me register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for her role in “The Godfather III” compared to the role of Jada Colragrand in this film. <br /> <br /> It was a robot and boring. Her lover had just died a month before her arrival at the Rubber House, which he gave her. Once there, she discovers that he has cheated on her throughout her relationship, but none of this seems to have been registered with her. A day later, she begins a relationship with Leslie, (Dafo), the caretaker of the house. Even though she was married to Defoe behind the scenes, her scenes with him were cold and unemotional. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Even Willem Defoe could not save this film from the amateur cinematic train wreck.
