It was nice to see all the familiar characters again, but the story bothered me. In the first film, we loved Ariel, so why is the second film centered around her daughter? The new characters were annoying, and I didn't like the plot of it. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop redoing classic movies with these cheesy imitations.
