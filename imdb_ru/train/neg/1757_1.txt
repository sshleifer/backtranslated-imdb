Don't get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great skater. If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics, then it was Dan. <br /> <br /> But how can it be that Bill Corcoran made such a bad film about the incredible story of Dan Jansen, because the real story of Dan Jansen is really incredible! Especially when you look at this film through the eyes of an athlete, everything is wrong, the way Matt Kislar and other actors skate, their technique, the size of the oval for speed skating is all wrong! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves the best, much the best! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
