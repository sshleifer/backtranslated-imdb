Junk / bad movies are usually not bad, because I find them enjoyable. It is so bad that I cannot describe it - below is "bad." At the beginning of the movie there is an instruction that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instruction and a dozen beers could not help me get through the whole movie. One tagliner compares this with KILLBILL, which of course is unthinkable and offends our intellectuals. Obviously. This tagliner had a plan to entice you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are planning to rent this DVD, put it off! If you are thinking of buying, do not think! If you are not lucky with this DVD, do not play it, immediately throw it in the trash.
