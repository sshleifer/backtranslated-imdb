A less subtle insult to the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humor plays the role of an intermediary, through which several commonly heard rhetorical questions are asked, especially “If God is so kind, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?” <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton is excellent in his role as exaggerated versions (although some may not agree) that they are stereotyping a religious teacher who spews the “company line” and condemns half the world in burning in hell. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of her school, she invites her first students to return and perform their Christmas contest. <br /> <br /> However, when the quartet “renews” its play in order to parody the “erroneous” teachings of sister Maria, the nun pushed over the edge, sending the story into a chain of unfortunate events. The ending finally leaves the audience with a sore feeling in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Go watch the game instead.
