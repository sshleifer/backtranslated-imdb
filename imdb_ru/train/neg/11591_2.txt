This film is so incredibly bad that I almost felt bad when I watched it. Up until this point, the other parties had at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was tense and bloody. Part 2 was unusual and interesting. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. In the fourth part there was great music, good special effects and a new interesting Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen. Alice, a much prettier blonde from the fourth part, returned with her boyfriend Dan. In some places, this estimated contribution on Elm Street turns into day soap. New characters seem harsh, and even this cute Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddie seems to be completely out of this. He looks tired and not so terrible. His one-liners seem out of place and different, where, as in the fourth part, they can be quite funny. The story of Leslie Bohemia will never get off the ground, and Stephen Hopkinsâ€™s direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good! The whole plot of this movie is funny and unreal. It is also confusing and rather silly. Avoid Part 5 at any cost!
