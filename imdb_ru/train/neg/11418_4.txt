Joel Schumaker co-wrote the script, which he co-authored, and has a group of Georgetown graduates facing adult life situations. The storyline is a mess, but some scenes are really nice. There is a lot of lost talent and time. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Among them are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Shedi and Mare Winningham. The most visible were McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is pretty nasty. Reaching age is not easy.
