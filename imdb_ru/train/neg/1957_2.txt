I enjoyed this movie most of the time, but I always had the feeling that I was watching a children's movie. Honestly, I think that someone wrote the script for pg, and then during the shooting I decided to add some blood, nudity and language. It was a big disappointment. there are those who believe in childish magic that exists in films such as “baby” (pig) or “angels in the outfield” who defeat the evil tooth fairy parents end up believing their daughter in her ability to see a ghost and use this skill is to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be the b-movie's answer to terrible darkness; somehow I manage to make the best movie with 1/4 of the money, but they don’t. they made the worst movie and are likely to lose the same amount of money lost when the darkness fell.
