Sorry, but every time I see a film in which a woman sucks a man and a man does nothing, except that he cringes, the film loses all credibility. Thus, the new (female) Starbuck immediately spoiled the story before it left the ground (the pun was not intended). Dirk Benedict was far more believable than a sensitive hero than the newly-fledged Katie Sackhoff, whose surplus is likely to be regarded now as a “convincing, exciting, must-read, innovative presentation” of politically correct news about today's review editors; but in fact, it's just a tired, old woman with a chip on a shoulder the size of a townhouse: the biggest cliché on the screens today. I can take another shot of this series, but human cartoons alone will not keep me informed. As James Hilton once said: "History, please, just give me a story."
