From digitized video to acting, which makes Keanu "I'm so wooden, I could be a board." Reeves looks like an Oscar winner, this film bites (pun is not intended). The best thing about this is the eRATicate box in the 2nd segment (which of the three seemed to be the strongest in terms of plot and “turning”). It’s a pity that I spent £ 3.99, it cost me something else, for example ... Natural killers: the director. If you buy it, you are really disappointed, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you are looking for something amateur and with actors that are more wooden than 2x4, then continue. However, if you want some quality action with a werewolf, look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: Hunt of the werewolf.
