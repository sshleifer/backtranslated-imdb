Ladies and gentlemen, please do not be fooled by the tag to the film "Stanley Kubrick." This is a very bad film, which, unfortunately, was named one of the most deadly horror films ever created. Horrible movies should cause such fear that at night people should tremble in their hearts, thinking about a true horror movie. There is no real horror in “Shining”, but instead we find just a naive, stupid attempt to make a terrible horror. Everyone knows how good these attempts are. if they are different from reality. All that is good in the film is the view of the ice valley. The hotel, where most of the actors lived, also looks good. A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost, lazy soul that never knows what to do. About bald spot say nothing special. A color actor who is busy most of the time to pamper a child. No need to blame bad weather for the tragedy. This cannot be avoided, since the film was shot, and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
