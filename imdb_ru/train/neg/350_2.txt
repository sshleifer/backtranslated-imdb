The performances of Fishbourne (which seems oddly strange) and (short) Ed Harris are wonderful, unlike the role of Connery, who seems to find no meaning in his role and ultimately finds himself in the motor behavior of an 80-year old man. In fact, the script does not make sense; imagine 60 min. happy ending plot plus application of an unexpected turn without any argument structure in relation to the characters. This is more a coincidence than a script, and can be useful for examinations in scriptwriter schools. The more you recall the details, the stronger the impression. The death penalty is not a problem here, although it is a subject from the very beginning; seems to disappear without further comment. The subject and environment could be good.
