“Black Angel” is a minor figure, and June Vincent is a woman who tries to save her husband from an electric chair after he is found guilty of murdering an old acquaintance. Dan Durya (husband of a murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre plays one ungrateful role as a suspect. This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never achieving anything special. It's nice enough, but then, at some point, it ceases to make sense, and the clue to the mystery triggers one of these big “give me a break” reactions. This ending alone could completely sink the film, but what precedes the conclusion is also not very good. Vincent is a weak heroine, and Durya never knew how to play good guys. I love moviegoers, but it was a real disappointment.
