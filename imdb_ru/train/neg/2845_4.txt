This film switches from the 4th to the 1st without worrying about the 3rd or 2nd, grinding to the most juicy, finishing line of the b-film. The rogue at the beginning is the best and smartest part of the movie. It is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathroom happens so fast that you can skip it. Definitely not worth the jokes that Robert Osborne presented in his entry into TCM for this mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this supposed frontier society turn out to be holy - especially the incredible character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
