If you first experience the wonders of cinema, if you have never seen “Moving Picture” before, you will think that this film is a child of the gods. BUT, if you saw the movie, TV show, even Barney Dinosaur, then this movie will not impress you. Hell, Barney's dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinosaurs in this film. <br /> <br /> Now I like the films of V. I just watched “The Giant Monster Gilu” right before I saw this slop, and I liked this film much more. It works like a B movie. He has a dialogue lamer, a hockey game, more pleasant effects and honest, damn it, a real Gila Monster as a monster! Carno 3 is simply not very popular. He has a bit of dried blood, and this guy Polchek several times looked like funny, but this film is not thrilled, almost ... sluggish. This is a Small Engine That Couldn’t Dino. I am not saying that you should not watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can watch gum drying on the sidewalk and feel entertained. If you are one of those people, then give this film a chance.
