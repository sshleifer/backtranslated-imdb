First let me have a foreword to this post, saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars. I do not read books, do not play games, do not wear underwear and do not eat porridge (if any). I'm just a fan of movies. <br /> <br /> With that said, it's hard for me to understand how people appreciate this movie. Taking this film by itself, and not comparing it with its terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say that this is an amazing film. For all the terrible flaws in the scripts - silly dialogue, flimsy scenes (that is, R2 suddenly becomes a bully, and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch), HORRIBLE play and marked holes in the plot ... how good is it? There was no real internal dilemma inside Anakin; it just seemed like the switch clicked and he suddenly became angry. I was not interested in the film until the last 20 minutes or so (which, by the way, was destroyed by the scene of Frankenstein's “NOOOO!”). When you bombard a screen with extremely awesome CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely horrible one-liners, when you could and should have said more, this is NOT A GREAT FILM. For a film with such a “dark” tone, there was too much levity in the speech of ALL characters. <br /> <br /> I end with a question: was the film really from beginning to end? sense of urgency and importance of what was really going to happen?
