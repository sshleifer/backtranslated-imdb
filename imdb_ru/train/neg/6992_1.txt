The story of a female nurse named Anna, caught in the midst of global chaos, when zombies that feed on flesh begin to rise, take over the world and attack the living. She runs off into the street and was saved by a black policeman. So far, so good! I usually like horror movies, but this piece of film does not deserve to be called horror. It's not even exciting, just ridiculous. Even the "Flintstones" or "Doll, Fran and Ollie" give you more pleasure. It's like watching bloodthirsty drinkers who can't get to the mall for a lot of alcohol. Heroes who locked themselves in the mall, so as not to be eaten by the ruffians outside, are no better either. Although they do not seem to be drunk, they give the impression of being mentally retarded. Save your money instead of spending it on it!
