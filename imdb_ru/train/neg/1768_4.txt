This is another one of those films that could be great. The basic premise is good — immortal cat people who kill to live, and so on. D. is a kind of variation on the concept of the vampire. <br /> <br /> What makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. , Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile, if you want to survive - look at how long it took to catch Unibomber, and this happened because a family member realized this. <br /> <br /> By contrast, the child (and to a lesser extent the mother) behaves as if he were untouchable. A child kills without thinking that he left no evidence, trace or living witness. How these people managed to stay alive and remain unknown for a month is incredible, not to mention decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> This is really a shame - it could have been much more if it were written believably, that is, to give the main characters the level of common sense that they would need to do for so long. <br /> <br /> Also, a nice show. I really liked the episode at the end, when every cat in town converges in the house — every time I decompose food on the porch and see our cats rush suddenly to where they were before, I think about this scene.
