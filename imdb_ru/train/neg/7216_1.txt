I love westerns. I could watch them all day. “Good, bad and ugly” is my favorite for all time. I watched “Silverado”, probably the 8th time the other day, because it was shown at CMT. However, this Shiloh Falls film is without a doubt the worst western movie I have ever seen. The game was terrible everywhere. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious view of the compass. The only good part I can think about is a pretty cantina girl. The very noticeable long pauses between the dialogues seemed intentional only to give the film an acceptable duration. This film was not even worth the new rent I paid at our local movie rental store. I felt like I was robbed and deserved rent if there was such a thing. The only reason I did this was because I hate not watching the movie to the end. I turned it off halfway because it was so bad. Director, please do a better job if you decide to do another. This is a film that can distract people from westerns.
