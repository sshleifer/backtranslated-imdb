I am a BIG fan of the horror genre! I love horror movies / slasher / blood of all kinds. Some of my favorites are really “good” bad horror movies. But this movie does not guarantee anything that watching it !! I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that is wrong with this. <br /> <br /> The script is terrible. The game is terrible. FX is not even worth discussing. "Set" - an absolute joke! Sadly, I think that some actors may have real potential, but this car did not leave them ANYTHING to work !!! <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that I saw it "for free" and I feel that I was robbed !! The time you spend watching is better spent on your cat's dental floss.
