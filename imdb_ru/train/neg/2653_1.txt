I could not believe how terrible this film was; I rarely watch commercial television, but I thought, “Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching.” I'm standing fixed. All involved must bow their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I understand that for women of a certain age there are not too many great roles, but this scenario was so inept, cliché and confusing, that I was surprised that it ever evolved or that Miss Keaton thought she could make a silk bag from this pig's ear. None of the characters possessed the slightest plausibility and was incredibly incredible. Acting looked like an exercise at the BEGINNING of the class — I looked in horror with my mouth open for much of this surprise “What did they think?”. Very, very sad that came to this. Do not waste your time.
