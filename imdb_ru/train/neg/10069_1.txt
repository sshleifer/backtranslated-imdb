This is a terrible movie. Yes, the girls are beautiful, but this is not very good. The plot with the participation of a cowboy with an Indian girl would be interesting if sex did not interfere. Well, okay, it may be interesting, but it is not, because it is so terrible and only partially. I can only imagine how the close-ups of the dancing tanks looked on the big screen, probably more funny than on television. (I’m not even going to mention a battle with knives without top between two women who are tied together and spend it all on the chest. Never read about it in the old west) This is a film that demands the liberal use of fast-forward. /> <br /> I like shlock movies, but this is ridiculous. There is a reason why I don’t go to such films, and they, as a rule, are not very good, the plot pushes the chest into the background. Initially, nudist cuties, as they were called, were originally nudist films or films in which there was no touch, but as the adult industry began to grow, the filmmakers either tried to be smart, or tried to use something else to deliver stubs on the ground. There were very few smart people who left only hacks with limited talent. Comedies often came out best with humor, approaching the first class, with infantile but harmless fun. Something that could rarely be said about any other cross-country genre, dressed like a nudi. <br /> <br /> Ramrodder looks good and has some good figures, but this is not done like any western or sex film. <Br /> <br /> I don't need to watch this again. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, probably, to no one, the rapist and murderer in the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family, who was arrested for killing a school teacher shortly after the shooting. <br /> <br /> Obviously, such things will ruin the lives of some people.
