At the end of the film, I just asked myself: “Is this the worst movie I've ever seen, or is this the worst movie I've ever seen?” And the answer is ... In fact, after you watched this film and thought a little about its meaning, you simply cannot find any meaning, and you can only recall two scenes of rape that are incredibly cruel and useless. It seems to me that the director tried to push this question into the head of the crowd: “What are such crimes compared to the horror of war and extermination?” Because I noticed that two terrible scenes are directly related to the war and its horrors (during the first scene you can hear the cry of a raped girl, and at the same time you hear one of President Bush’s speeches about the need to start a war with Iraq and in the second scene, photographs of three criminals sticking a sword into the woman’s vagina are directly followed by archival images of the Second m World War But in fact I really could not think of the relative seriousness of the theses of two different types of expression of human horror, when I finished, I was too shocked by what I just saw and felt (sorry for bad English)
