OK, maybe a 13 year old, like me, was a bit old for this movie. About this spoiled rat that lives in the palace. Then the sewer rat flushes him down the toilet! He gets into this rat city and meets this rat, which has a gem that the greedy frog wants. He will do something for this gem and send a whole army after these two rats. He plans to take the gem and flood the city of rats! The coolest part of this movie is slugs. They make all the sound effects. They sing, make sounds, it's awesome, and quite funny. OK, the bottom line is that it is designed for 7 years. In other words, a great movie to bring along a younger family member. I didnâ€™t think that animation was a real dream-making art, more like WAllace and Gromit. I think they relaxed a bit on that. The film was just decent, it was not worth spending $ 9.50, sorry.
