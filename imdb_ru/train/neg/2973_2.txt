I have two very serious complaints about this film. <br /> <br /> 1. This is my local store for rent for cloth, which is very clear soft core porn in the category of "suspense". (If I knew what it was, I would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place. And yes, this film is the soft core of porn). <br /> <br /> 2. The name has nothing to do with the film. No one in this film does anything deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of the two. <br /> <br /> Actually, make three main complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. That for some reason I watched a movie long enough to find item number two on this list. Boy, I'm sorry about that. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This film is useless at almost every level.
