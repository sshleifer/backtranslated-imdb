Really bad shot on the video, shot not by one, but not by two, but by three lovers of video. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least add some blood, blood and nudity. The Halloween store has some blood from latex props bought in your hand. There are lesbians and prostitutes, but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but only talk. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are no editing effects - disappears, wipes, etc. From time to time a bit of black appears in separate scenes. <Br /> <br /> The terrible music of bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up most of the end credits. Werewolves are represented by rubber masks attached only to the face of the “actors”. They did not even bother to apply brown makeup on their necks, hands or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10-year-old with a video camera will be able to collect the best film. There is no reason to buy, rent or watch this film, except for how not to make a low-budget video.
