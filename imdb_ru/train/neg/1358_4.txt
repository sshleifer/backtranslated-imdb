The words "Swedish" and "action" do not mix. This becomes more and more obvious with every attempt in the genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunnell (Shanti Roni) works at a military air base with top-secret computer systems. One day, foreign criminals threaten to harm his family if he does not do what he is told. They want secret equipment and will do everything to get it. <br /> <br /> This film has its ups and downs. And usually in the Swedish action films there are no “ups”, only “recessions”. So, I think, something in this film showed some quality. For a start, positive comments can be noted that the film is technically well made. Frames of airplanes and helicopters are well taken and look very beautiful. The game is very different quality. Shanti Roni does a good job, while Maria Bonnevie is, as usual, tough and unnatural (I wonder how long Swedish directors will continue to use her, even if she has the skills of a wooden board?). Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as a "cool" man from the special forces who arrives at the base for investigation. <br /> <br /> What about fighting scenes? Well, as I said above, the flight scenes of airplanes and helicopters are good. But besides this there is nothing to talk about. And this is a common problem with the Swedish militants. Just not enough action happens. Maybe this is a budget problem, maybe it's a filmmaking culture. I do not know, but it adversely affects the experience. Because, frankly, the story and acting is not good enough for this film to rely on it. <br /> <br /> I rate this 4/10 for the effort.
