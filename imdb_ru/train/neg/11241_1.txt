If you are looking for eye candy, you can enjoy the Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game with live performers. The visual effects are pleasant and interesting to watch during the entire film. Saying so, visual effects are the ONLY thing in the Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes later, I realized that I was watching one of the worst films of all time. I hoped that this film would be better, but it never reached any degree of interest. Thirty minutes later, the desire to leave everything grew and grew. Now I have more than 2000 films, and I looked, probably, five times more. However, this is just the second film in which I felt that I was leaving my whole life. <br /> <br /> Act - no one. The three main artists are pathetic. Jude Law (also in another film that I wanted to play on) is just awful in the lead role. I'd rather sit with Ben Affleck in Gigli than watch Lo again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow struggles to be polite, which causes her unpleasant consequences. The last article I read said that Paltrow was thinking of staying at home and being a mother, not acting. After this performance, I would welcome this decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- Soap operas are better written. The story of the "Captain of the Sky" begins poorly and every year it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Directing is not. Everything was embedded in the special effects, from which history, acting and directing suffer greatly. Even the "Phantom Menace" played better, and this does NOT say a lot. <br /> <br /> I would have to give this film "0" of "10". Avoid paid cinema and wait for the video.
