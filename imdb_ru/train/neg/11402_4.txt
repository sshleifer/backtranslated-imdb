Exactly what you expect from B-Movie. Derivative, unbiased nudity, boring parts, funny blood and cheese special effects. Of course, it could have been better, better acted (definitely), better written, directed, etc. But then I think it would not be a film by V. The actors are pretty much crap, in fact it was like an episode with Buffy, the vampire slayer, or something else, except for a lot of blood, profanity and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis should be highlighted. She is absolutely the queen of the cries of the new millennium. Not that acting was really important in these films, but it was better than any other actor. In addition, she is damn hot, in this plastic tracksuit, which she wore throughout the film - wow! Her ass is absolutely amazing in this outfit, I mean that every time she turns around, you can help, but check it out. And towards the end of the film, the viewer receives an award for seeing it completely nekkoy. <br /> <br /> So if you are a horror lover in a b-movie (like me), check it out. If not, you should avoid it at all costs.
