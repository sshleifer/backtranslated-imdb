This film is about two former footballers, Fred Williamson (Mac Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), who work with private eyes and meet all sorts of women and men with a bad past. Mac Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who has phone sex. Jennifer is threatened by one caller who wants to do terrible things to her, and she asks for his help along with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time in their hands and often travel to Miami, Florida. golf courses or hang out at the sports bar, where various city activities are held. There are many blows, killings and many words of double meaning, which lead this film completely to big ZERO. Do not waste your time, this film cost me only 50 cents, and it was too much.
