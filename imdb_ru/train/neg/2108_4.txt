Several brides were mysteriously killed at the altar, and then their bodies were abducted on the way to the morgue. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious murders. She discovers that before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (supposedly from the groom), which contained a potent medicine that struck them. Patricians say that the orchid was first grown by Dr. Lorenz, who lives on a secluded estate with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, placing the brides in a suspended state and using their iron liquid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on the medical secrets surrounding his wife), are trying to get Dr. Lorentz to arrange a fake wedding, which ultimately leads Patricia to the paws of a mad doctor. This movie had a very good starting movie, but it ended up with too many voice-overs and other weak scenes. The composition is decent, Walters and the Coffin deserved better, but this is life. Russell steals the show (even Hamming Lugosi, who does not give one of his most memorable performances, even considering his monograms) as Countess Lorenz, playing a role with many stereotypical characteristics of many modern Hollywood divas. Weak and contrived ending. Rating based on films B, 4.
