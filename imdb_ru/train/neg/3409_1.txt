It is rumored that when NASA technical advisers for this film were asked to retain a plausible picture, they laughed for hours. In the end, if you are not a politician or working / working in a shuttle, you will not get into the shuttle. In addition, the Space (Cadet) Camp is located in Alabama, and not in Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on earth will win lotteries with multi-billion prizes before the events described in this film become possible. This film was intended for children, and one had to write it, because they are not aware of the innumerable restrictions and requirements for access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless film of all time, and it was a well-deserved failure.
