This movie is very funny. Violence is bad, acting skills ... Well, Dani, keep singing or shouting, or whatever the hell you usually do. Random chicks who carry almost nothing, just to catch the sexually frustrated Gothic guys. Personally, I think this film really sucks. The plot and characters CAN be very good, if, say, direction, actors and other trivia were made better. But the film is just bad, the only reason why people like this piece of shit is because Danny is in it. This movie is arguably the worst B-Rate movie ever. And believe me, this is difficult to achieve, especially when you are competing with Def from Temptation and because of foolish excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a fan of CoF, and so I just see it as another trash movie ... Very bad. If Danny made it as a comedy, then good luck to him. Very well done. Moreover, I rate it low because it is crap. Watch it when you are in a happy, happy, joyful, joyful mode, so that you can laugh at everything or if you have many different types of drugs.
