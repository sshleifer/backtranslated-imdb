I may not have the longest attention span, but this is the second film that I refused to watch until the end, and I even bought it on DVD because of its “classic” status. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that the director was playing a big joke, so I kept on waiting for a decision, something to laugh at, something that interested me, but this decision never came. Rather, the script was ridiculously amateur, the film dragged on and felt incoherent, as if someone had filmed the show at full length. The Academy must have taken drugs when it nominated this film for at least eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> I repeat once again. This is the second film that I refused to watch until the end. The first was "Fighter." I hope this gives you an idea of ​​how bad it really is. 1/10
