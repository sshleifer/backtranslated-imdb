I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on reworking bad movies and leave the classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake was not a waste, I would still like to get back six bucks to go on a DVD with the original. Lots of violence and one of the worst ends I've ever seen. This version adds nothing new. It only repeats why Hollywood should leave good things alone.
