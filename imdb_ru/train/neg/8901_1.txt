I'll make it short and sweet .... this movie sucks !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the best films ever, gave it 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought that maybe parts 2 and 3 would be good sequels, I was wrong. I was sick of this film to death and so different from the first one that the plot went on and that was all. It looked like bad passages from the first part or something like that. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here. I was so happy that Glenn Danzig starred in this film, but don't blink, you miss him. There was a full cast, full of crap actors and people I don’t like, such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest people on earth. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you become a bit smaller first, so don’t watch it. because you feel that you owe yourself, being a fan of the first part. I'll wait a few days before I look at the third part, and I pray that this is better than this shit. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the movie with lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown in the movie. Go forward or go to this if you can not digest the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - it was awful!
