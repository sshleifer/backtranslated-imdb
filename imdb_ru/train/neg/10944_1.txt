I have seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I saw (and enjoyed) all the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme, including the one where he is his own clone, both where he plays twins, and all three where he is a cyborg. In fact, I own the one where he plays a fashion designer and fought in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, he has a great ass, and you can almost always see her. With a DVD, you can even stop and zoom!) That's why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad, does Plan 9 similar to Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything in Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The fights are bad. Tricks are bad. Forex bad. The acting is impressive, debilitatingly bad, and probably demonstrates the worst qualities of all the so-called actors in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and it really says something. And I would be willing to argue that everyone associated with this film is lousy in bed. ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> This can be unintentionally funny, so this is not a complete loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are a congenital idiot or very, very stoned. I was able to go through it myself, because I needed to look at something to distract me from rinsing cat urine from my underwear. <br /> <br /> It didn't help much, but it was better than nothing. One point for a cameo Ron Palillo as a gay arsonist.
