Oh my God. This film could be titled "When the authors strike!" What an abomination I had high hopes for it, mainly after reading the IMDb reviews, which makes me think about the entire IMDb rating system, but this is a separate question. I loved Steve Carrell in The Host, Bruce Almighty, The Office, and so on. So I was expecting great things. To say that I was disappointed means to downplay the year. In this film, there are so many bad things, but I will limit myself to the improbability of ANY family that behaves like these people (Mass aerobics training? Love killer? Please), and the fact that Dan’s character is so unattractive, you wondering what the girl saw in him so she fell in love with him? This film was filled with clumsy dialogue, creaky direction, ridiculous scenes, and it was slowly, slowly, slowly. We would leave in half an hour if we were not with my parents, who leave the house a little and don’t like to spend money. Unlike the creators of this film, who would be better to throw all the money spent, turning this film into a bonfire - it would be more exciting. If you like movies, avoid it like the plague.
