This movie is one of my favorites. It is not very good, but it is pleasant to laugh. The dialogue can become incredibly ridiculous and badly acting (for example, â€œManji, can we ask you some questions?" Be sure to watch Brock, the snow-white guy who attacks the main characters. He has only two lines, but he is one of the best guys in the movie!
