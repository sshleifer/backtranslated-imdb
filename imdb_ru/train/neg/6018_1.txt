I am sad that Christians (and I alone) feel that we should make films like “Left Behind”. We have much better stories to tell what should not be so preaching. I was very disappointed with this movie. As an aspiring director who believes in Christ, I see this film as a perfect example of what I am not going to do with my film career.
