In 1454 in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Nashi) was beheaded, and his mistress Mabil de Lancre (Helga Line) was tortured to death on charges of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. Nowadays (in the 70s) Hugo de Marnac (Paul Nashi) and Sylvia (Betsabe Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Christina Suriani) go to a session where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de marnac. They decide to go to the Villas de Sade, the real estate of the Hugo family in the countryside, to find a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head, and the villain takes possession of them, returning Mabel to life and killing the locals in bloody sacrifices. After the death of his father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that the Hammer of Thor is hidden in the well; together with Maurice they are trying to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabel. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a horror genre box with five Paul Our DVDs for $ 9.98; despite the lack of links, I decided to take a chance. The first DVD with an uncut and restored version of The Tomb of Horror Rising from the Tomb is a trash B (or C) movie that immediately made me remember Ed Wood. This ridiculous story is revealed through a horrible script, direction, performances, cinematography, scenery, special effects and publications, as well as with a lot of naked women. The result is just fun, and I can guarantee that Ed Woodâ€™s style is back. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): not available.
