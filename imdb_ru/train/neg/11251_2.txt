Sky Captain is probably the best awful movie I've seen in a long time. Rife with amazing computer graphics and special effects, staffed by the cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and infinitely cute Giovanni Ribisi) and racing along with Indiana Jones-Esquire's overly used storyline, it should have been a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Of course, the keyword here should be “must be”. <br /> <br /> Jude Law plays Joe Sky Captain with a bright accent and a lot of - heartbreaking, heartbreaking smirks, but you can not do anything out of anything, and even his frivolous supplies and boyish appearance cannot save the stone dialogue of the film. (If he slapped Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said, “Good boy, Dex,” just ONCE, I could quarrel with the whole guy in front of me. ”Gwyneth Paltrow, like Polly Perkins, is nothing but a nervous lattice. Her nasal whining and not quite sarcastic comments grow old in the first ten minutes of the film. Perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30s comic book hero - who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how a similar character played (and played well), can be seen in the film of the end of the 90s “The Ghost” with Christy St. Anson starring Billy Zane. Rent a movie and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the salutary gifts in the film. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in this blindfold I admit it.) In just a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and show a more exciting game than their two-dimensional dry colleagues. <br /> The plot and the consistent development of the plot were old, boring and represented a monotonous combination of every good her scene from an action movie in the last thirty years. In the first half of the film at a rapid pace, and in the second - by snails, which gives viewers enough time, not only to guess the final completion of the film, but also to find out who the main villain is. Mating is also pretty cliché: Polly Perkins and the Sky Captain seem to be reunited after several years of separation from a bitter romance, and their story is not so much charming and eclectic as annoying and not appropriate. When they finally came to terms with mutual feelings towards the end of the film, no one was surprised, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> I recommend the director to thank Bai Ling enough to put it on tightly fitting vinyl for the entire film, as well as the intriguing shades of sepia that served as coloring throughout. But Heavenly Captain, despite the fact that he has all the necessary elements to become a great film, does not make sense. Not even worth 2.75 dollars, which I paid to get to the theater.
