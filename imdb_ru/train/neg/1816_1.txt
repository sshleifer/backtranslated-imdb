This film is really brilliant. Because of platitudes, it shies away from the fact that shit is at such a speed that you don’t even see common sense, and the usual decency of humanity rushes past. But it does not stop there! This film hits the bottom of the barrel so badly that it comes back to the moment of the ridiculous comedy: when Coror with drunk Conan wants to kidnap him because of the abundance of hair on his neck, his things swing his sword, as if tomorrow doesn’t exist (and the way he waved by her, I'm really amazed what * was * tomorrow for him, or at least for his beer intuition). Do not miss this movie, this is fantastic vanity through idiocy and pure bloody mood! And as soon as you finish watching this movie, wipe the tears of joy (or the tears of frustration with such an inept storytelling attempt) out of your eyes, because some stupid fool gave these people another $ 5 to continue!
