It was a film about infidelity and revenge. A twin with a twin connection feels that something is wrong with her sister. This movie took forever to set the plot. A plot that has been made many times. The game was lousy for the most part. As soon as the plot is combined, the film ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with an abusive father. Father seems to approve of Ashley, so Laura blames everything. There is a promise that girls will never part, but as they grow up their lives will go in different directions. Ashley gets a job at a diner where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course, nothing good will come of it. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for tracking him down. I kept waiting for this film to get better, and there would be some kind of resolution somewhere, but this did not happen.
