As if the storyline was not depressing enough, this film shows how cows are graphically slaughtered in a slaughterhouse for all five minutes while the main character talks about his youth as a butcher. Strange things. Then there is the basic premise of the hero / heroine who goes and cuts off his dick, because from the age of ten he says he would go with him if he were a girl. Is this man crazy, masochist, just a doomed queen who goes too far? And what was his traumatic childhood? It was just that he was not adopted and had to live with nuns who first loved him and then hated him, because he was naughty. He tries to explain to us the reasons why he did what he did, but in fact it is very difficult to empathize. Such a sad and unusual self-destruction. Was that supposed to be funny? What was it really?
