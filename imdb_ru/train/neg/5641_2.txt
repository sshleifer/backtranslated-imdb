Predictable, told a thousand times the story with the usual drama between them, a couple of rather obscene sex scenes, mixed with some character paranoia, episodic horror music on the violin of the 70s, which is sometimes comical, I could not help but laugh at myself. <Br /> <br /> I usually like Defoe, and I must say that acting is not so bad, the “plot” develops at a reasonable pace and makes you guess from time to time. It's just that everything is too predictable, I felt that I was watching a new movie created for a television drama, and not a new one. Maybe this is the style that the directors wanted, but I must say that the review that I read about here before I saw the film could only be written by someone who participated in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much, and if I could turn back time, I would not go to watch it in the movies. I would wait until the boxes in your video store appear discounted, I'm sure it will not take long.
