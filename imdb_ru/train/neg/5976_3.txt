The rumor is true: girls love COYOTE UGLY more than guys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. The girl from Jersey goes to New York to become a songwriter. And after the initial disappointment associated with a lack of luck, he overhears some girls giving $ 300 parties that they earned last night. She gets an audition at the bar in which they work, and surprises! The institution is full of "two-year-olds" bursting at the sight of dancing kids. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad, and some characters are cute, especially Cammy (the role of “fashion coordinator” was cute) and a bouncer, but let's face it, the drama was terrible and ridiculous from the very beginning. Violet and her father looked too ridiculous as they talked throughout the film. And see how Violet is jamming this keyboard too much with a break dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time I can think, how can production be so awful? For a short moment, with this film, Hollywood could stand on two legs and show a new minimum without any serious public outrage, without saying: “You were warned!” Instead, it seems that COYOTE UGLY is deliberately trying to kiss all the major rear areas in the world. Advertise the little ones in the bar, but showing the thin paper story “Chase Your Dream” disappointed every teenager you aimed at! <br /> <br /> And finally, music. There was absolutely no music in this film, especially when it was necessary (hospital scene). Each scene was like a short music video that you would like to stop until the bar opens. But the culmination was a real laugh: the song of the 80s, which you expect Cindy Lauper to jump onto the stage and play with Violet. Hell, I personally thought that Bon Jovi was also going to jump out with long hair and jam! <br /> <br /> In addition to some really clever work with coyote girls during the dance (especially on the wet stage), and a couple of cute punches, COYOTE UGLY is something that just bothers you. Regardless of whether you looked at it or did it, it was like killing time. Or spend, depending on how you look at it.
