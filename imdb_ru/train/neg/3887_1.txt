I managed to get it watched with MST3K, and oh my god, even with the riff this movie was terribly bad. Imagine someone whose competence with the camera could be performed by a monkey. <br /> <br /> Highlights (which were few) were derived from special effects that were OK. Acting for the most part was also "good"; although nothing special, he was of a higher quality than the other B-films I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is darkly bad, camera work often looks as if they had just shot a roller skater and pushed it forward. The story (if you can call it that) is so full of holes that it is almost funny. She never explains why the hell he survived or even needs human flesh to survive. The script is poorly written, and the dialogue on the verge of a stupid plane. The climax of the film (if there is one) is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you cannot find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
