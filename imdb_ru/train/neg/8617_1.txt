After watching 10 minutes of this film, I was embarrassed to see that for 30 minutes my toes were bent - I just could not believe it: the film is really awful. In fact, it is so terrible that I had to watch it all to make sure (!). During this, I realized that it reminded me of a number of Danish comedies of the 60s and 70s. The template looks like this: take one extremely popular comedian, make a script that puts this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a few jokes (especially one-liners) and add a couple of beautiful young girls - take it down and you will succeed! I would not know whether this film was successful, but unlike the Danish tradition, which died quietly (with several great comedians), it seems that in the US there is a market for such a film.
