I'm a fan of previous Best of the Best movies. But this one was terrible. No wonder it was so hard for me to find him. I tried 4 video rental stores until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible, the plot was a joke and was also bad. <br /> <br /> I miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley, the original characters and the kickboxing theme that this film had with the first 2 films. <br /> <br /> john
