I noticed with some surprise that in the end, the Detroit police would like to thank for their participation. The police chief even has one talking line playing himself (and boy, can you say that he cannot act). The reason for the fun is that in this movie the police first shoot, and then ask questions. Not that PR, I think the police will want it. In addition, this is your standard film about the police and robbers, dressed in the 70s with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is given the ungrateful role of a policeman who cannot get ahead of him, and he is burdened with a mentally ill wife. He makes up for it by hanging out at a local brothel. Hari Rhodes is his pompous partner, who has a great wardrobe and he likes to chase the suspects, wearing a raincoat. The film moves to the penultimate firefight, which makes absolutely no sense (why people who are only guilty of robbery, take the whole police force?). Not only do we see one shootout, but since there are four bad guys, we see four. Then there is the ending of turns, which should leave a guessing game about what would really happen, but only made me think about how stupid it was. Seeing that director Arthur Marx was also behind the brainstorming death of Friday Foster and Baktown, I shouldnâ€™t have been surprised.
