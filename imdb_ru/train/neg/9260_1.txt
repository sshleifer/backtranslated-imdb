The only connection with this horror movie is that it is terribly uninteresting. I would prefer to stab my finger with a rusty nail than sit through it again. Even for a television movie it is flat. The cast is boring. The script is as exciting as a bowl of sand. How two directors agreed to create such an insignificant film will remain one of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene, even vaguely worthy of being included in the Omen franchise, and it was shot in slow motion and cut off at the expected return. If you want to see it, insert it, set the alarm for 90 minutes and feel comfortable. If you are lucky, you will quickly fall asleep and the alarm will wake you up when the worst is over. Namely this movie.
