Previously, he enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action movies, and I expected much more, even from 5.8 IMDb, the film does not entertain, and although the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is unfortunately more subtle and emulates the “worst scenario” of the game. strong feelings, accompanied by some bad actions ... Do not waste time on this film, not entertaining, if you want to cry, it can be enough, even if your tears will cry because of the vision of Wesley Snipes in the tragic action movie "Wannabe Comics" ... <br /> <br /> I give 2/10, this is action It was really awful if you want to watch a decent movie, go to see a shooter or rent it, it's all good for this movie.
