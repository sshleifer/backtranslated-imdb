Another example of the total spending of British lottery money. How commercial was this film? The Cinema Council, which financed this pathetic trash, should be at one of the abandoned London Underground stations, for allowing this clich√©d, dismal sample to be committed to the film, half mutant composed of all the horror films that the director saw. and felt fit to follow, especially Deathline. Among his many sins is an obvious inability to make the main character distantly sympathetic until the last minute. Then it's too late! Of course, all these heads of development at the British Film Council might have noticed this at the script stage. Add to this the horrible game and the ridiculous appearance of the creature, and you will get a vivid example of how not to scare.
