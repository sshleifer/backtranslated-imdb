The pack is not really a movie. This is a film about imitators with actors. Apart from Richard Gere, he performed well, but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character, the rest of the cast just plays ... the result is as miserable as this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are playing. What the hell is Claire Danes doing in this? She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film she looked extremely inappropriate, of all! The only thing she did was ask stupid questions, like “do you really think so?”, And made stupid faces. I was embarrassed by her play, seriously, and I used to like her ... She is a romantic type of film, I don't know who chose her among all the actresses there ... LOL, and see Avril Lavigne ?! it really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to feel nauseous, this film will do all the work for you !!! I would like to vote -5 ..
