I wonder who, how, and more importantly, why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most unusual sensation on Broadway in many years? He is an Oscar winner. Yes, he won for Gandhi, you moron! Jeremy Irons - the actor who won the Academy. Do you want him to play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Indeed? "Oh, what a beautiful war" you forgot? To answer your question, yes! The film is disappointing, clear and simple. Not an ounce of living energy experienced heavy hands. Each character danced beautifully, they were charming, but their projection was theatrical. I did not feel anything. But when I saw it on stage, I felt everything. The film was supposed to be shot with stars, unknowns, novices, but stars with compelling unforgettable faces, even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who can dance beautifully. Well, Michael Douglas was in it. True, I forgot that I am absolutely wrong, and you are absolutely right. Nothing like the Richard Attenborough musical by Michael Douglas.
