The main premise of the film is a slasher, 3 young ladies crash their car and end up in a creepy family. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Watching the 36 minutes of foreboding of the OJ car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco. Yawn. <br /> <br /> An old woman with hot and cold dementia controls her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes watching actors eat - YAWN Trying to determine what the hell they are eating ... Okay, there may be a game with a drink ... No - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... Ok, I got interested in a couple of seconds. <br /> <br /> Completely random and inadvertent killings ... A TIGHTNESS <br /> <br /> The ending ... dude! this psycho is crazy - why the rest of the movie can't be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately, that's all - my advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and see this, and then add something good to the player - for me i go to sleep
