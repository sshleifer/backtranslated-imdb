I had a feeling that after “Underwater” this one would not be better ... I was right. He must be looking for money for champagne, and not care about the final product ... his voice is repeatedly duplicated by a stranger who does not look like him at all; editing is good - just a class above amateur. This is nothing more than a B or C film with enough money to hire a couple of talented operators and a sound engineer called OK. <br /> <br /> As the previous author said, problems appear in the post. -production (... voice dubbing, etc.) Very bad, because the plot is actually suitable for the film SG. <br /> <br /> I will never take another SG movie unless he writes me a letter asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Very bad - I miss Kelly Lebrok ... <br /> <br /> --jimbo
