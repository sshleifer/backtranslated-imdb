"1408" is the newest way to cheap scare tactics. Those who can make date-movie fans of horror sometimes jump in their places and scream in your ear, but disappoint viewers looking for a little depth and direction. <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays a writer who has made a career writing books describing his haunted hotel experience according to rumors. Despite the assurances of patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls, there is little that can make him a true supporter of the paranormal. When he learns about the history of room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel - I mean, no, I mean the Dolphin Hotel in New York - he decides that he will be the perfect final chapter for his latest book. But Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the owner of the hotel, is resolutely trying to dissuade his guest from the story of the atrocities that have occurred in the theater hall since the opening of the hotel many years ago. The story is simple, and we, as possible skeptics, have to go through Jackson's long omen. <br /> <br /> In other words: be afraid! Be very afraid! <br /> <br /> Of course, it would have been easy to convince the viewers that they had just paid to see the thriller with sharp seats, if it hadn't taken a long time to create it. to this moment. And also, if what followed was much more than cheap mustaches that become so frequent and arbitrary that in the end you might soon expect them. The temperature in the room changes automatically. The walls are dripping with blood. Fearless writer can not open the door, etc. And after almost one and a half hours of delivery of these materials to the audience promised a great thrill, you can sit down and hope that at least you will be struck by the end. Suspecting episodes of dreams and other derivatives is a waste of time, even if it does not soothe our doubts that before the film ends, we may finally have something that will make the film a little less than completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Despite the grand performances (as always) of Cusack, who is essentially the whole film, most of the other notable characters (i.e. Samuel L. Jackson) are in minor minor roles. The real mystery here is how this film received such a high rating of the audience. Ghosts to vote?
