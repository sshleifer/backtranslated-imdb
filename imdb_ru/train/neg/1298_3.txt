Sogo Ishii may be an experienced director in the right conditions, but Gojo tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, the heir to the Genji clan. Filmmaking has the main distinguishing features of low-budget production, including vague battle scenes and clumsy montages (what you can find in an underdeveloped drama). Monk Benkey tells his spiritual master that his fate is to defeat the mysterious spirit that guards the Gojo Bridge at night, but he does not understand that this decision will lead him directly into conflict with almost all elements of society at that time - but which could would earn him enlightenment. <br /> <br /> However, in his description of the conflict between the holy and the profane, there is no lack of ambition. Arty thrives in some areas of photography and editing to compensate for the free style of filming. <br /> <br /> Disappointment.
