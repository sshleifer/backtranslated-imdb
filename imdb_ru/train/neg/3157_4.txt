Of course, there were some components of a good movie. The storyline is good if a little modest and the acting was good enough, although I did not understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a pronounced Australian accent if her character had to be enhanced in the USA. My biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. I know, as a rule, any self-respecting European believes that the average American is considered a sloppy chest of drawers, but this was beyond this. Anna's color combinations were just awful! And this sad, as a bag of potatoes, an apology for the coat, which she wore throughout the film, made me break out in a hive. I assume that the idea was as realistic as possible (how many school teachers walk in Prada?), But simple does not mean an absolute lack of taste. Clever to understand ...
