The main contender for the worst film ever made. The character of Joanna Pakula seems to have I.Q. of 3, which is only one less than the writer and director. The script would not pass in the high school writing class; "Jokes" minors; concept trite. These performers obviously desperately needed work. I stayed until the end to see if it gets worse. Did it. Life is too short to spend any part of it on this movie.
