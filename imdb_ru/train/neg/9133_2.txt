This is a strictly review of the pilot episode that appeared on DVD. <br /> <br /> Television went out of my life in 1981, so I never watched the show or any part of it - which means that I am immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting seems to have for most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (perhaps a warning about a spoiler) <br /> <br /> Moonlighting pilot - this is your main yarn "caveman meets fluff", where the "charming" red-skinned man manipulates a confused woman in understanding what she really wants and needs. The room on which the script's “wit” is based must have already seemed outdated around 1950. It also contains some blatantly bad records, like in the scene where Maddie destroys the situation instead of shooting the villain, strictly in order to prove that she is an inept woman who needs male help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts to what the chauvinist male conspiracy sees in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I’m still with her - in Moonlighting there is a BACKLASH stamp. <br /> <br /> However, in a sense, this DVD is a must-have for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains a screen test that brought Willis to work. Both features show the extent to which Willis’s acting abilities developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Rating (and I'm _am_ a fan of Bruce Willis): 2 out of 10
