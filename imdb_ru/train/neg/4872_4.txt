The production line of farting jokes pretending to be "babe" was never produced; The writers clearly hoped that the trick with watching the animals would be enough for the film to continue. Is not. Eddie Murphy is again being sold as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift to understand the incessant and meaningless chatter of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The cast is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Renee Santoni, John Leguizamo, Harry Schendling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Rubens, Brian Doyle-Murray), but the script is so inconceivable, not charming and depressingly unfunny, that all this dumps the tray pretty quickly.
