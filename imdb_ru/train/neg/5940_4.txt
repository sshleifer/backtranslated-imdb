Listen, I read and read these comments, and I want to say that there is a lot of this, but I will try to make it short but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, let's forget everything how bad it was done this movie ... As it did not show anything about the infamous, and I agree that most people here say it was Hollywood, I mean, what did you expect in real life? When people wake up and see that you will never know the truth about 2pac and Biggie ... All this is hidden and buried deep. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I don’t mind either 2pac or Biggie, I love them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim were REALLY embarrassed in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Next, for anyone who says that the movie is awesome and cannot see the truth, either you are too blind to see it because you think you know something about BIG, or you don’t know anything at all and you like these Hollywood teen movies. Use your mind and look, although the clouds ... You can say a lot when you get to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say, because this is a very broad topic, but for the film I can only say that it could have been a bit, I mean much better done. But in any case, I'm just a person who expresses his opinion .... No offense ... <br /> <br /> Listen, I love hip-hop, and I live for it, but after watching this movie, everyone a person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone should live. With all due respect to 2pac and BIG, like all other artists who make a living like this, you should turn another page because you are destroying young people .... A wrong message to children, and that is: not going to school, but living from the street, fussing and just grabbing a newspaper .... <br /> <br /> This hip-hop is love and mind, to be smart and everything else. <br /> <I know that many of you will think that I am crazy, but this is just my point of view. Listen, I’m wrong about something, and I’m not saying that this is a completely bad movie, because even if I'm in hip-hop for 17, 18, I still don't know anything about 2pac or Biggie, no matter how many articles I read or how much I support them and listen to their music ... Like most of you there. Only people who were very close to them, and the killers know the truth behind it all. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I just want to say to all Biggie and Tupac fans that these two were the greatest of all times, no matter how they lived their lives, but PLEASE BE A BETTER FOR THE FUTURE , LEARN AND LOVE EACH OTHER, READ GOOD EVEN FOR WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE YOU, BECAUSE THE END .. .ITS is not about how much money or fame you could get and how quickly you could climb to the top, that's about , to make you the most complete and to feed the soul, your body and mind ... because if you decide to do this, YOU WILL LIVE Ife EVEN AFTER DEATH !!!! WORLD AND LOVE TO YOU ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY AND OTHERS THAT CHANGE IN THIS WORLD !!!!
