I should have assumed that any movie with a Poltergeist woman would not be good. In fact, everything starts well, but during the first scene of the murder you find that the movie you are watching is a movie inside the movie. In the cinema there are people who watch this movie. One girl in the audience is so annoying that I would turn around and strangle her. A bit strange, but far from good.
