A scientist (unfortunately, John Carradine) is figuring out how to bring the dead back to life. However, they come back with marble faces. In the end, all this leads to a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> A boring, fully predictable walk of the 1940s. It scared me silly when I was a kid, but just fed up with me now. I had to fight to stay awake! With one exception, the game is terrible. Such inexpressive boring actors! Hopelessly. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things about this: despite the script, Carradine does give very good results. And there are some slightly creepy moments when the ghost of a great Dane sneaks through walls. There is also one of the worst-looking knockouts in film history. However, none of this is funny enough to survive it. Avoid.
