Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but "Niki Ardelean" comes too late. We already have enough of this, and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Major Directors should not have vision problems out of time, not behind. Why do people see Romania only as a post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We are just born, not reincarnated, and no one else thinks about old times. Most people do not remember or do not want to remember, and the new generation of film consumers does not understand a little. This should be the first day of a Romanian film, not the final song - priveghi! Maybe young directors should make a move.
