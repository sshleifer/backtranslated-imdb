The real scraper in the Bill Rebein film, which seemed to have deteriorated in his profession throughout the eighties. Three millionaire crazy players invite nine people to a remote hotel to take part in the latest contest, in which the final participant will receive $ 1 million if he or she comes to this. Some of the guests are satisfied with a series of unsuccessful jokes, while others are engaged in what most adults do in the circumstances, namely, are injured in the hotel bar. Most of the scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on various parts of the female body, including the opening dance number, which is the American Bandstand crossover and meets geriatric aerobics complete with prostitutes. If there was any doubt that white people could not dance, this scene clogs the last nail in this coffin. Pay special attention to the nipple slip. It lasts about forty-five minutes, until Bill Rebein starts throwing darts at various plot twists, and all he hits becomes inspiration for the next scene, creating this one disjointed mess. This is a game until it is a game. Three old cats are under complete control until they are. The hotel has supernatural power until it becomes just a prop. They are dead until they are gone. Even the narrator at the end replies that he does not know what the hell happened. I challenge anyone to reason where Rebein was going to this one. Acting skills - theatrical caliber minus dinner. Most of the actors probably returned to their jobs at Stuckey's local. I give him a few points for the stage, where yuppie opens the cabinet wide, and the skeleton is inside the skull, clinging to itself. Let's see Gone with the Wind, do it! This collection of Chilling Classics really becomes a curse for me. Bane, take it! Like Rebein! I hate myself.
