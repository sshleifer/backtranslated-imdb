This is a film that embodies the fear of the D & D of the 80s (and even today). The fear is that people who play D & D (or any other role-playing game in this regard) will be “drawn” and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue to kill fun, sacrifice of children, suicide, etc.) D.). An excellent film for those who like to blame the problems of society in inanimate objects, but anyone who played a role-playing game, a video game, or even played a play, would regard this as an insult to their intelligence. For D & D, what Wargames was for computers. Plus, like a movie, it just sucks.
