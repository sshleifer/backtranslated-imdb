This film had so many promises. I was very excited about this movie. In the end, at best, it was funny, and at worst, it hurt. The acting styles ran the gamut from really, really flat (angels, wife and daughter) to over-animated (Casper character). I felt that the dialogue was simply an attempt to convey information to the audience instead of real people trying to communicate with each other. Pay special attention to the scene concerning the "beetle". This is largely an insult to the audience’s ability to sort things out. In defense of this scene, however, she received the biggest laugh of the entire film. I read that they spent a lot of money traveling to different foreign places. It is a pity that they did not take advantage of this. I did not feel that I was transported to exotic places. Anyone could insert the footage of the Colosseum in Rome. However, to finish on a positive note, I thought the kits were pretty good. I really liked the graphics that were displayed on decoding computers. In my opinion (and that’s all there is), if the Schmalenz coefficient were much lower, and the ACTION coefficient was significantly increased, this film would be a good one.
