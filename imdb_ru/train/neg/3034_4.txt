There are many great adult stars in this film, but it cannot interest you the way an adult film should do. Among all the stars you could not get your blows from any scene. The film was shot in a dream, like a set of middle-aged, which is embarrassingly cheesy. Acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor's conversation about his child in college, and the dialogue is worse than what I saw in the film. The plot was also ten times worse. I would stick with the amateur route. The audio commentary was useless, as it is a sensation, but even then it was also bad. If you are not a fan of Jenna Jameson, there is little here. 4/10
