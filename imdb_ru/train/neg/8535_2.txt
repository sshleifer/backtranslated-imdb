As I said, the book was pretty good, and it could be a good movie if Melissa Gilbert were not so terrible and incredible in the lead role. What accent was this supposed to be? It sounded just like her terrible Russian accent in another movie in which I saw her. Every time she opened her mouth, I cringed. It took 3 attempts before I could watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was good as another leader. <br /> <br /> I really liked the scenes with the beaches. They added some necessary brightness to escape from the depressive image of Melissa Gilberts. I think they could use the views of San Francisco to their advantage, though. It looks like the night scenes were actually fantastic, but I could be wrong. I don't remember the character in the book being so depressing. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert away from any future films that require an accent!
