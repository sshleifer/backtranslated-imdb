This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was going to get up and go to tape 4, but I crawled out. Now I consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the billboards in Sanskrit? I thought that the main actor (George Kalil) was particularly inept. In addition to the bad game and excessive camera shake, I thought using the events of September 11 as the reason to make “Larson Lunatic explodes, all over the screen next to you” shameful and disrespectful to the victims of September 11. Talking on the phone with Larson's wife, Sarah, allegedly from one of the planes held by the terrorist that day was terrible. Shaking the camera didn't make me feel bad, this cold trick did.
