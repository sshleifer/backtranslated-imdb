This is the first horror movie I watched, and after I almost thought, I don’t need to watch anyone else. I was told that it was a “horror film for thinking men,” and I must say that if it makes me think, I shut up to think what the blood films will look like. Don't get me wrong, even the blood in this movie is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> The plot is very blurred, too much art for art's sake. The effects of the camera and music are in most cases irrelevant, and the characters are at least banal. Several characters and scenes seem useless at the end when they begin to reveal some of the Hamilton hooks. I found out who Lenny was about half an hour when I understood the movie. I was so visually confused and bewildered by the Lenny show that I felt disconnected. I expected what I received, but they could have gone much further, in fact, all the blood fell completely flat. With movies such as Hostel and Saw, you need a little better approach to a movie that is “considered graphic or too disturbing for a wide audience.”
