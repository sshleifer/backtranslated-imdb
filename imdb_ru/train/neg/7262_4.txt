In this cruel film there are some really amazing ideas that, if clearly executed, could turn it from flaccid spaghetti to something special. Unfortunately, AOW TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies! Scenes begin and end suddenly, characters go to long sections, performances (and accents) of actors are rather contradictory, and so on. Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) Revolutionary who, after participating in destroying a village, remains a priest (!) ... ten years later, the village is run by the "mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives in search of revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives in search of Shaw. They all shout at each other a lot, and they all shoot at each other a lot. Fernando Rey, too, in this (as a blind). The performances are not bad, but they are very uneven. Savalas sometimes has an accent, as does Landau (who really loses here). Shaw and Ray argue that they are not capable of truly embarrassing themselves, and Stevens looks rather strange (although a bit out of place among sweaty dirt).
