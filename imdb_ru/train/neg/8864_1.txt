After watching this, I lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (this passed with time). This film was a complete trash. At first they tried to recreate the final of the first “War” with an incredibly bad makeup. Then they try to turn him into the sad excuse of a werewolf porn movie! The plot sucks and the whole movie is just awful !!!! The werewolf victim's brother from the first film (apparently it was Dee Wallace Stone) teams up with Lee and another woman to destroy the werewolf group led by Sybil Dunning, who seems to be naked all the time. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth renting (unless you want to spend your time and money on watching a naked body.). Try to catch it on the cable instead. It would be so cut that it might make sense.
