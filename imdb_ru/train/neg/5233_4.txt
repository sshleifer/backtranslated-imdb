Pretty awful, but watchable and entertaining. This is the same old story (if you survived the 80s). Vietnamese vets fight together as friends against injustice in the States. My team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time passes, the soldiers go home, and after years a friend is in trouble. No, wait - in fact, a friend is dead, and this is his dad in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an extremely horrifying (super spicy) meat grinder when he tries to protect his father’s small shop from a local “protection” gang, despite the fact that he was in a wheelchair from the war. Desperate for help, father talks to Sarge, the leader of the old Joey unit from Vietnam, when Sarge appears at the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the squeaky wheel gets grease, and the old gang straddles the city. You can imagine most of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> One thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge continues to insist on his people about planning and how they are really good at what they do. when they plan ahead. But Joey wouldn’t get in a wheelchair because of a shot in Vietnam, first, if the device hadn’t been idle! Then, when things are going very well in the city, when they fight gangs, they do it again. For no reason at all, they completely ignore their plan and try to score a gang without the presence of everyone. FN !!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Stupidity! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment when all the members of the detachment present are sure to try heroin, which they have snatched from the gang, to make sure that this is real. Each of them. Hmmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Keep watching, probably. The film is not too terrible to watch, but it is a tease. There are all these climatic moments when nothing really happens. The most dramatic things happen at the beginning of the film - explosives in Vietnam, Joey's deadly battle and a gang cruelly kicking an innocent teddy bear to the side (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I Guess what my main problem with this film is that I feel disappointed. Even the intricate plots with “mysterious helpers” and their fancy side motives were not enough to save them at the end. But someday, perhaps, everything will be fine, and they will make a sequel. Ha ha ha ha !!!
