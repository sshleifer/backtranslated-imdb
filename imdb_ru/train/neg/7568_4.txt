Chan Vuk Park is nothing if not invention. I am KIBORG, BUT IT IS OK, full of funny little technical achievements with some brilliant ideas scattered between them. Trying to follow in the footsteps of Mark Caro and Gene (The City of Lost Children, a delicacy), Puck begins a bizarre frivolous story, which is a radical departure from his usual painful fare. One can hardly blame him for his ambitions or for his vision, then it is completely unexpected to see that all the efforts of the Park are reduced to such a small one. <br /> <br /> I am KIBORG, BUT IT IS OK, it seems surprising to deduct from himself how he goes along with the end result, which is part of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, the jokes are plentiful, and unusual humor abounds, but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute, bizarre and enjoy being played by actors, but no matter how hard you try, I could not bring myself to take care of them. <br /> <br /> Sympathy for the Lady of Vengeance was a mistake, which may indicate that Pak was a little indulgent with himself, but he still managed to demonstrate some of the director's unique flashes, and after an impressive filmography he was easily forgiven. None of the assured confidence commanded by AREA OF JOINT SECURITY or SYMPATIUM FOR MR. Revenge here is obvious. I am KIBORG, BUT IT IS OK, it left me so indifferent that I occasionally found myself fast rewinding (more regularly as the film progresses). I gave LADY 5/10, and according to this indicator it probably deserves no more than 3. For the sake of old I will be generous: 4/10
