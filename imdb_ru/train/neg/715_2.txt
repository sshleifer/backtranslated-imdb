It sounded like a really interesting movie from the movie. The Nazis, the occult, government conspiracies. I was expecting a low-budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or guys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something completely different, more psychological, more like David Lynch. It was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just awful. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is casting. Andrienne Barbeau's character begins to move, being somewhat timid and frightened. She simply does not cope, even at her age, although she, of course, tried. The actor played the role of a son, apparently thinking that this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to think that it was an obscene film, or at least acted like him, and not just cunning. It seemed to me that the only one who did a really good job was the daughter of Siri Baruk. <br /> <br /> Another important part is stimulation. It starts very slowly. So slowly you may want to turn it off. But then it becomes irresistible for a while, when you get to the suicide of your daughter and the consequences. But soon after, everything becomes a mess. Partly it was done on purpose, but a lot of it was just overly confusing, monotonous and badly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that itâ€™s just not a nice movie to watch. It's slow, boring, none of the characters are cute. Excessive use of images and sets. In some films, the characters are tortured. In this, it is the viewer who does. He has a few creepy moments, especially the creepy Nazi paintings and captions, but the rest of the film is mostly tedious.
