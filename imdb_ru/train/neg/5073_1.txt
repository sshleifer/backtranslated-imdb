The teasers for Palm Tree try to pass it off as a kind of allegory for a fairy tale with real meaning, and then immediately begin to rave about animation. I should have known what that meant. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of the whole filmâ€™s problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, and then a cruel psycho with an unhealthy attachment to a girl that he once cared about. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the film, Palme is poorly defined. You are not related to characters at all, although Shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls. It seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity that he could into this film than actually exploring the motives and character of his characters. <br /> <br /> In the last fifteen new useless storylines have been introduced. minutes of the movie. The writer seriously needed to simplify his story. Perhaps he was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not help but wonder whether the plot is suitable with so many dimensions and characters for the series or graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the film, I just could no longer tolerate an obvious lack of quality and began to laugh at how the characters, relationships and the whole plot were contrived. I touched my companion, and he, too, began to pop, just like the young man who sat behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but just could not accept the terrible quality of this film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the animation is incredible, and viewers will admire the lush background and charming character. designs. The animation almost leads you; when you don't care about characters, he tells you how to feel.
