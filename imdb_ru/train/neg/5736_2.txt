This is one of the worst films I've seen in recent years! You can accidentally rip 5 people off the streets, and they will act better than anyone in this film. An absolute waste of time on this. I gave him only 2, because I like bloody films, but this is just nonsense. The acting game (and I use this term VERY loosely) is terrible, someone, please tell me, what did 5 main actors shoot their first film? Do not waste your time watching this. The hostel was some better movie. I can not believe that someone has spent the money on it, I hope that for the sake of the producers it will cost only $ 50,000 - it looks like a school project created by children who have no idea. Does it even make it to the movies ??
