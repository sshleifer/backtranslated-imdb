This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The fact that he has a fragile storyline is bad enough that they hooked him with the theme of football violence, which makes him 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching, but I went into it fairly unbiasedly to accept what the authors found it necessary to introduce Elijah Wood's character Matt on the scene of a hooligan. <br /> <br /> But the film gives an inaccuracy after an inaccuracy to the fact that by the middle of the movie everyone makes you cringe more than the last time. <br /> <br /> Let's deal with several things: hooligans are not inclined to virtually break their own pub before jogging — a limit league game; they are not going to kill each other; They do not carry ONLY a stone island (and others in the crowd, bullies or not). They, of course, do not, when they object to a new member of the firm, run into the territory of their rival firms for pie and mashed potatoes. And I would gladly meet a hooligan who would go to bait the best guy of his company to a rival company. (Although you may not agree with what I said about the intention to kill each other, if one exists). <br /> <br /> Don't misunderstand me, I still have to watch a film on this subject, which doesn’t contain any fantasy whims, but it is on a par with the Firm for Ignorance. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me ironic that Wood’s American sworn enemy was morally convicted of his hero for using cocaine, when it was part of the British hooligan scene. The film decides not to challenge Wood’s morality, and instead stays away from any coke-based company. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think I made my point. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it’s quite inconceivable, and I’m sure that if I hadn’t spent the whole movie, mourning the moments, and even more, stated above, I would have guessed what happens before I do . And believe me, I was far ahead. <br /> <br /> I got the clear impression that this film is aimed at men, in the hope that women will enjoy the emotional problems that arise. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the creators have completely failed. It’s too unrealistic to enjoy anyone who knows about this scene, and I cannot believe that a woman who is looking for emotional films will give a damn about any of the characters, given their propensity for violence. <br /> <br /> Are there any good moments? Maybe the battle scenes are well put and shot, but I'm not very impressed with the slow motion, of course, not when it is a fight, because the point is that the noise is enough in any case. <br /> <br /> There are some funny, if unrealistic moments. Wood's trip to school made me smile. But a few soft funny moments hardly compensate for the two-hour collection of fully manufactured scale. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid the plague, unless you want to develop misconceptions about the scene, if you do not know. If you are American, you may like it, since it is clearly adapted to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is unconvincing, predictable and ultimately excessive.
