Carlos Mencia constantly, violently, with hatred shouts "B ** h!" on women it's like shouting "n ** ger!" in blacks, only worse. Remember, the word B, in contrast to the word N, is the only derogatory term that is still daily associated with violence. "B ** h!" the last thing women hear before being raped, beaten or killed. This guy perpetuates violence by viciously using the language of violence. Looks like he might be a gay guy trying to cover up the beating of women, so he will sound like hetero. And how about all the Nazi white guys from his audience giving out fascist greetings, while their stupid white idiotic women whimper hee hi on their side, clearly frightened to protest this tidal wave of hatred towards a woman. Ti hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe and does not support freedom of speech for THEIR! Come on, Carlos? Do you want women to have freedom of speech, to b ** o beat you as loudly, violently and loudly as you do, or do you think that “freedom of speech” is only for men to offend women ???
