As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I expected this movie to be great - and as for the effects of the gorillas, they were pretty good - this is the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story, but in reality it doesn't even come close to what actually happened to Buddy — which in real life was the famous Gargantua, sold by Ringling Bros. our supposed “heroic” Gertrude Linz, known to many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had the well-being of her animals in the best interest. Since Buddy was portrayed as aggressive, it was a complete fabrication, and in real life the gorilla never resorted to such behavior. In fact, a friend escaped from his wooden box (and not the room with plush cages, as shown in the film) during a storm to find shelter and solace in the house that scared Gertrude Linz to sell it. No, Buddy was not allowed into the family of gorillas, surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was left in a wooden box, deep in the back of the garage, for a while with only one light bulb for comfort, and then the circus was sold - where he really lived a better life. when peanuts were thrown at him until he died (by the way, historically the oldest living gorilla) before the show in Miami. Notice also, in the film, how Buddy gets older, but chimps never get old. (By the way, chimpanzees were not bred simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy, as shown in the film)
