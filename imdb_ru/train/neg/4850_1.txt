Some unrealistic movie spoilers are included. <br /> <br /> This film continued to disappoint from the very beginning. I am currently heading to Iraq for the second round as an infantryman. This film has nothing to do with what happens in real life. From the very beginning, to name a few: the bomb cart, the EOD elements unfold alone, unaccompanied, the EOD sergeant, sneaking out of the VBC, with rolled up sleeves all the time in ACU, where I had to call, goes on my copy of the $ 2 Haji sniper scene. The list will continue, but there is no need to list the wrong events that take place 2 minutes before other things become wrong; and point of view was made. <br /> <br /> This film is intended for viewing by people and critics who have no understanding or experience with regard to deployment or the military. <br /> <br /> People with military experience or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with inaccuracy.
