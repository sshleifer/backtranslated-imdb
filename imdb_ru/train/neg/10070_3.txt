Stars Roy Rogers in the role of Jesse James and his counterpart Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes - Mr. Rogers' ex-boyfriend, Sheriff Gabby. Gail Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a worthy team in which two reporters search for stories about the elusive criminal hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, an erroneous person / imitation is a conspiracy of development, since Rodgers writes a “double role”. Rogers is charming as usual; but in reality there is nothing that can raise its performance above normal - any potential for ensuring unforgettable performance of Jekyll / Hyde is realized due to poor material. The best couple to watch — Miss Storm and Miss Pey as reporters for the St. Louis Journal — they are the highlight of the film. The songs are fine, but poorly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James in the Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gail Storm
