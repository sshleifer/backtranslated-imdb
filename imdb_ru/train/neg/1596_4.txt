Not one of the best Pok√©mon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokemon make history. You can really see how strong Chelebi can be, although he is the first to turn evil. <br /> <br /> Suykun also appears, he did not seem so strong. <br /> <br /> Marauder do you have a lot of strong Pokemon besides a taraniter? Some battle scenes with his pokemon may have made it better. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet a much younger Professor Ouk, although they do not realize it. Misty, which I thought was at the end, but she did not come close. I saw it in the credits. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much here, the worst of the series so far.
