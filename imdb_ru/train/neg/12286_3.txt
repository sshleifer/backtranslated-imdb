The summary provided by my cable TV guide made it more interesting than it actually is. Slaughterhouse Rock is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen, a title previously owned by Urban Legends: Final Cut. In his opening scene I could say that it would be very bad, but I was so bored that I didn’t care. This film contains a ridiculous game, especially a guy who is suffering in his dreams, incredible, like in incredible plot twists, and some of the most trashy music I've heard, and I live in a period when Britney Spears Nsync dominates the air waves. The biggest problem with Slaughterhouse Rock is that it’s not funny. One of them would be boring and boring, but not scary, because he would try to liven up some funny story lines a little, but no. We have a selfish friend of Tormenting Boy trying to be funny, but instead he is annoying. (spoiler) And please tell me, who in this crazy world is so mad and hates himself to go to a terrible prison in the middle of the night? No one. No one! If you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it believable. This is something other than.
