It's funny. I’ve seen a bunch of Fassbinder movies, and I found some of them to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are disgusting and smug riots like this film. For me, it ranges from good to crap - without much in the middle. I know that he has a lot of fans among the "tempted", but I can't help but think that most of his attractiveness is just hype. From my point of view (and I know I’ll get a lot of negative ratings for it), he shot too many films too quickly and was too indulgent. His funny or gender movies (like this one) are usually very bad - carelessly made, sometimes quite boring (such as QUERELLE and BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just rough (like this movie). Is his message that a man accepted gender confusion cannot be handled better than by showing him being slapped or watching cows being killed horribly? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make your characters more human and sympathetic - then maybe I will take care of the films. <br /> <br /> Honestly, after I watched this film, I will no longer worry about Fassbinder films - the bad seems to outweigh the good.
