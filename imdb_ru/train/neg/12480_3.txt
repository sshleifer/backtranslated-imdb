... Or, more precisely, it is so bad that you will waste time laughing at your ass when you watch it! James Sbardellati's "Deadly Chaser" of 1983 is certainly one of the most horrific pieces brought in The Sword and Magic, but it's very funny. Acting is terrible, the plot is just crap, and the effects and photography can not be more amateur. But this is a bad game, silly effects and a lot of mistakes make this movie so fun. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> The Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and experienced warrior. Once a good sorcerer instructs him to unite the three forces of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a cup, in order to free the country from its brutal ruler, the evil king and the sorcerer Munkar. To get a sword is pretty easy, but the amulet and the bowl are in the possession of Munkar. Fortunately, the evil king organized a tournament in which the most experienced district warriors fight each other until they die. Then the winner must take the place of the king. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take his place, so he planned to kill the winner (instead of simply not organizing the tournament in the first place). The death pursuer is designed not only to gain the three powers of creation, but also to save the magnificent daughter of the good old king (Barbie Benton) from the evil claws of Munkar. Fortunately, he does not miss the road to the tournament, as he is allowed in the meantime to embrace the magnificent warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) ... <br /> <br /> There are many wonderful, incredible stupid and funny scenes in the film. Here are some of my favorite scenes: <br /> <br /> - A deadly hunter beheads a bad guy with his sword. A head that falls, however, is not that guy's head. A falling beard has a red beard, while the guy who decapitated Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard. <br /> <br /> - When the character of the female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) appears, she is first seen in black clothes hiding her face and body. Ogris (Richard Brooker), a wandering Death companion, fights with her, and during a sword fight her dressing gown (under which she, of course, topless) opens, exposing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see in Lana Clarkson, even in front of her face. <br /> <br /> - The last warrior pursuing death must fight in a tournament, this is a giant guy with a man’s body and a pig’s head. <br /> <br /> - In the chest of the evil Munkar sits a nasty little creature. He feeds this little creature with human eyeballs and fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other unintentionally funny, funny and wonderful scenes. The acting is terrible, but Barbie Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are very dainty, and although I described this film as “unintentionally funny,” I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were completely aware of how shoddy a film is. There is a lot of blood and feminine nudity to entertain the viewer. “The Deadly Persecutor” is an incredibly awful movie, but I still highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!
