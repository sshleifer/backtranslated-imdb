As many agree, Origin is a great anime artistically. The music, the graphics, and the created world are great, and they really stand above most other modern animation works. However, if you are looking for more than this, then I suggest looking else where. Beauty stops at its appearance, and when it really comes down to the plot and characters, there is nothing special about it. The action is slow and minimal, and people are flat, sometimes banal and do not behave realistically. Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there ... So, well, oh god, I have never seen an anime as beautiful as this; and oh my goodness, it's like ... -speak- people don't behave like that. It was a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime, but he also took a few steps back in times of poor performance, and, unfortunately, not even so many actions to make up for it ...
