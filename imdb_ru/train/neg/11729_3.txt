Virgo is chosen to be married to a rich guy. A rich guy urinates. A woman on a boat loves a sailor. Sailor urinates. Virgin Mary attends lunch in the community. A man urinates on the dinner table. A boatman makes a striptease for little boys. A man pretending to be a child urinates. There is a main topic here. Makaveev tries to say that he is being offended to the whole world. To say that this is a strange film is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene where Laura, who barely speaks ten lines of the entire film, is bathed in chocolate syrup. This is a really cute scene, but the rest of the film leaves a bad taste in your mouth if someone doesn’t share the director’s fetish.
