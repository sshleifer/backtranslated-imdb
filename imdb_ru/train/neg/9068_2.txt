Oscar nomination "The worst scenario ever" in my opinion. There is no decent story, funny acting, VERY lousy humor. By all means, if you have little self-esteem, do not waste time watching this movie. Although you can see that the actors CAN act, it leaves you dumber after watching. Watching this shit is killed by precious blisters ... <br /> <br /> I warned you, <br /> <br /> I DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE
