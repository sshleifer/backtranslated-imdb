<br /> <br /> Do I need to take into account any indictment. If in 2000 there were still disagreements between Georgia and African Americans in Georgia, similar to those shown in this film, then, obviously, there is a backward mentality among many people. This is rather hypocritical, to say the least, if everyone adores Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Beyonce, Naomi Campbell, Denzel Washington, Will Smith and others. al., while in the backs there are obvious racial differences. <br /> <br /> White grandmother suddenly attacks a black granddaughter, only to meet with a black grandfather in a very white social backwater. The story is sweet, without tragic overtones and highly predictable, as in most similar television films, although in the final scene you guessed it ............ it will be? is not it .......? <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands offers sincere rendering in her typical style, and Louis Gossett will do for her; Little Penny Bay, fortunately, does not steal the show. <br /> <br /> A “good” way to relax after a Sunday lunch without straining your mind, although you may just feel that you have a small siesta in the middle of it.
