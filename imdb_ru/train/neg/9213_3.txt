I caught this film in a small show held by members of my college gaming club. We were warned that this would be the “craze” of the games, and this film was more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who has resumed his college career after a “break” for the semester. What we, the viewer, will find out in the course of the film is that Robby was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called Labyrinths and Monsters, with which he meets again after the game group recruited him for the campaign. . <br /> <br /> This film is laughable on many levels. In one of the scenes, the “Candlestick Games” group is presented, which is perhaps the best way I can describe it. Although I am sure that this was somehow "cult", as most players know, this is terribly inaccurate. Most role-playing sessions are conducted in well-lit rooms, usually with a small amount of sweets and soda cans. <br /> <br /> The game, although not Oscar Caliber, is also not terribly awful. This is one of the first roles of Tom Hanks, and “Barefoot Friends” and “Bachelor Party” were another year or two over the horizon. The supporting cast, though not very memorable, still gives decent performances. <br /> <br /> The main disadvantage is the fact that it was a film created specifically for television, which shows “dangers to games”. See if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
