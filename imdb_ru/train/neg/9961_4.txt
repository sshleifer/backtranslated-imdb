Amelia and Michael are a married couple that cheats each other. Amelia has a longtime lover in the hospital, and Michael hires a prostitute who does not satisfy him. These two smolder with their infidelity, but in the end they manage to connect with each other. <br /> <br /> Not so much for this short circuit. The directing is straightforward and dramatic, which is good, the acting skills are sincere, but the story leaves much to be desired. Why exactly do we care about these two people? It is a little difficult to understand how this story differs from any other infidelity story, except that it is much more curtailed and does not look for meaning in it (welcoming a change in tempo, if anything). <br /> <br /> I don’t know, maybe I’m not related to these stories, because I have never experienced them. But I noticed that the blocking in these stories is usually the same, that is, the couple talk together, avoiding eye contact, pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. In short films there is also a pleasant thing that they provide a little more room to try something different, and I would like to see another double. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
