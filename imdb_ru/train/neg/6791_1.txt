This is a film about animal abuse. Under the guise of a marathon race, we see images of extreme animal bullying, including literally a running horse to death. SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this, spiritually cleansed his conscience of the flame from the burial / burning of the horse, which, of course, is still dead, tortured to death. This is one of the most painful and worst films I have ever experienced discontent with watching. Since Gene Hackman and James Coburn are near the finish line on their DYING animals, we must admire their spirit to complete the race. I would like to put the producers and director in the marathon race; I will decide when they finish, probably 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
