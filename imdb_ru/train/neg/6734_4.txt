I found this film a great idea that didn't bring. It seems that they have found a way to create uncertainty, but could not calculate their payments well. In one case, the police, while on the clock, find the hiding place of the kidnappers. They painstakingly go from the dentist to the dentist to fit the dental record. At the same time, the abducted man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After everything is built, the police arrive at the same time as he is released, which is very anti-climatic, to say the least. There are also large narrative scenes in which we “reflect” on the terrorized husband and wife, which distracts attention from expectation, and does not strengthen it. We are fully aware of their tension, and voice-over is an insult and deprives the viewer of chances for personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock has repeatedly argued, much more effective. The biggest disappointment is to sit through the whole movie and get a quick, rather soft end. I mean it just ... "ends" in snoring.
