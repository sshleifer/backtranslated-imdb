Awful, just awful. This proves my theory of "star power." This is supposed to be a great TV, because the guy who shot (Battlestar) Titanic, the same guy who made this joke about a joke about a chick. B O R I N G. <br /> <br /> Find something a thousand times more interesting - for example, to watch TV without picture and sound. 1/10 (I rated it so high because there are no negative ratings in the IMDb.com rating system.) PS / Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory about "star power" there is: the more "star power" is used in the show, the weaker the show. (This is called indirect proportionality: quality 1 / “star power”, less “sp” is better quality, etc. D. Another way to look at this is: “more is less”.) <br /> <br /> - Z
