!!!!! Of course, spoilers !!!!! I am sure that this project began as a scriptwriting workshop on how to avoid cliches in horror films: “The main character” - “Check”. Bad things happen to drug addicts - “Check”, Heroin knocks out a villain. the sequence, so that we see a recovered villain sneaking up on the heroine - check Unfortunately, it seems that someone sent this list of cliches to a movie studio instead of using it for a class. Expensive, if only the London carriages were as regular as the clichés that appear here. In fact, there are so many clichés that he saw before anyone ever thought of going into the details of what a creep of the same name is or how long he killed people in the underground. I am inclined to believe that this is the result of some kind of human experiment, and perhaps only that night he decided to take revenge on humanity, but all this is so vague that it is meaningless not to be completely negative I doubt if the producers thought that this year they will make a film that will cover an Oscar, and there is always a horror movie market. Similarly, I doubt that it was too expensive to produce and had one look at the DVD market, and not distribution in cinemas, and I would say that it was slightly better than in 1972 DEATH LINE, which also had a murderous cannibalistic shelter in the London Underground. just when you think that all the clichés were used in this film, another cliché appears to raise your ugly head
