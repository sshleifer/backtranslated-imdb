It's pretty surreal that these flies can do ... well ... it's a cartoon, so anything can happen in it. <br /> <br /> First I have to tell you that I love animated films. Unfortunately, the repertoire of this year is very weak. This cartoon is nothing more than a list of flaws: <br /> <br /> 1) I quoted this line. This suggests that this film has excellent 3D effects. Well, I have not seen anything, at least nothing special, which I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) The flies in this film are not like real flies. At the very least, they could make them black. And cyan flies, seriously? With giant heads and a slim torso? <br /> <br /> 3) History. I think it was written for 6 year old children. I can say that in two sentences this is too simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: “After all, these are American files!” Oh, give me a break.
