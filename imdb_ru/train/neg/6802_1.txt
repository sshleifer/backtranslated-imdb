Words cannot describe how bad this film is. I can't explain it just by writing. You too can see for yourself how horrible a movie can be. Not that I recommend you do this. There are so many clichés, mistakes (and all the other negative things you can imagine) that will make you cry. To start with the technical, there are a lot of mistakes regarding the aircraft. I will not list them here, but just mention the color of the aircraft. They were not even able to show the airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, instead they used the 747, painted in the original Boeing livery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and was made many times before, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I forgot about it very early. In addition, I was on the side of the bad guys all the time in the film, because the good guys were so stupid. “Executive Decision”, without a doubt, should be your choice, even “Turbulence” films are better. In fact, any other film in the world is better than this one.
