Whoever wrote a “good” post about it, he must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for fighting in the backyard. In fact, it’s not even a backyard fight, it’s a few guys who beat each other on the trampoline. Each guy weighs about 45 pounds, and there is not a single ounce of entertainment value. These are just a few bored children, who even give notoriety to yard words, if it is possible. If you want to see some entertaining fight in the backyard, take Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. It has 2 main names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Ban. These guys are nice. In fact, they have gone since they got it, and received professional training as “real” professional wrestlers. They became legal and recovered. I recommend checking out these 2 guys. MDogg is insane and off the hook. So do not waste your time and money on this crappy DVD, there is a "best" video in the backyard.
