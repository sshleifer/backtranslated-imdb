Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in his able hands. Even his occasional failure (Six days, seven nights) shows signs of life and humor that make him worthy of attention. Therefore, I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a rather original plot (a man throws a superhero, the superhero gets revenge fed by a superpower) and turn it into something pleasant. "Friend" - an exercise in meaninglessness. A single-dose pony site is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film cannot decide whether it will be a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is a film, slippers between both, none of the aspects of which are very well done. Uma Thurman, as usual, top, and Luke Wilson shoots his role, although his talentless tricks quickly get tired. What is even more crazy is that in certain scenes (for example, when a very excited Uma knocks the head through the wall), you feel Reitmanâ€™s witty, hoarse opus, almost screaming to get out. But after a few seconds, the magic is lost, and it happens as fast as a superheroine, whose films disappoint in almost every way.
