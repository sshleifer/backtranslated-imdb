Shame really - very rarely I watch a movie, and in the end I feel disappointed. I saw a lot of adaptations of Ira Levin - “Rosemary's Baby” and “Stepford's Wives” - and I liked both, but I just did not like it. <br /> <br /> When I read the plot sketch - the award-winning playwright (Michael Kane) decides to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and prepare his script for his own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Kane is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director, and Ira Levine’s work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I won’t spoil it to anyone who hasn’t seen it yet, but all I would say is that there is a LOADING turn. It is very difficult for many people to explain the plot line of the film in detail without giving it away. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes before the turns began to take place, and at that moment my interest and pleasure began to fade. Although I must pay tribute to Lumeta for a very funny finale that made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> The main cast - Michael Kane, Christopher Reeve, Diane Cannon and Irene Worth - were great in their roles, although Vorta’s obvious fake Russian accent struck me a bit (nothing personal, Irene, I think that fake the accent of any actor does not annoy me). Not sure if Cannon’s character was supposed to be annoyingly funny, but Diane was able to annoy and entertain - at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this, I do not want you to postpone watching this, because of my views - give a chance, you might like it, or maybe not. It's all about opinion.
