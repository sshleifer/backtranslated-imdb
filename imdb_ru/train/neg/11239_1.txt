Do not pay attention to the comments behind the scenes! Most people who give positive comments about this film should receive fees. This is a terrible movie in all respects. Imagine that schoolchildren, without money and without a sense of humor, make a slasher movie. They would get D for that. College kids got an F or asked to leave school. Since this monster was made by Professionals, I believe that there should be a prison sentence or at least a trial period in the cinema. I like to watch bad movies like Plan 9 from Space, but this thing doesn't even fall into this category. The script, the action, the sound and the direction are so bad that they are almost impossible to see. If you like to watch bad movies that funny stick to Ed Wood, Blaxploitation or horror movies from the 1970s. After watching this, you feel that you have spent an hour and a half of your life.
