So they criticized the violence, and it was labeled as sick. Well, I am afraid that violence is the best there is, but, unfortunately, the characters are not sufficiently developed to allow us to understand why they continue to rage (completely predictably). This movie has a really horrible script. We will never have the opportunity to meet Robert, and his actions at the end are simply pitiful. The game is not much better, the worst of them is a television chef and school teacher. The direction is awkward, the pace is enough to fall asleep. And what is the school film project about? Comment on the film itself is possible? Using newsreels during menopausal murder is ridiculous. These guys obviously think they are intellectuals, but hopelessly come out of the depths. How the hell did they make the great Yorgos Arvanitis illuminate him, I will never know. And how they got the money to do it in the first place is an even bigger mystery. Absolutely awful beyond comprehension.
