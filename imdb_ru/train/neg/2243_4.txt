It doesn't even deserve a review, except as a warning to potential viewers. This is a somewhat typical ghost story about an actress stalking a studio while filming a drama of the Second World War period. There is no fear, no expectation, no surprises. One shocking moment that looks too stupid to shock. The visual style is very flat and boring, although there is some really good editing from time to time. The story never meets, and the movies are really just a complete collapse. 4/10.
