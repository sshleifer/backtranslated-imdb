Ahh, this movie had so much potential! A good cast of quality actors "B", the hips of Jessica Simpson and ... that's it! <br /> <br /> I think some guy from some unnamed marketing department had an idea. In fact, let's do something like a movie about legally blonde, but let's do it in New York. This big bright city of chances, power and money, where every person is heartless, hungry for power and money. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, a little town, Owen Wilson's brother and Andy Dick for no apparent reason (only because of him you have to ignore this film). <br /> <br /> Main storyline: <br /> <br /> The boy sends the girl to New York, the girl follows, the boy cheats, the girl remains in New York with her cousin, gets a job under false pretenses , screwed up, caring for another boy (brother Wilson) and together saves the day and the kiss. <br /> <br /> When thinking about a film, a few words come to mind: terrible, terrible, intolerable, unbearable, and xenophobic. <br /> <br /> Just do not watch this movie, you will be happier One reviewer mentioned Guantanamo, and I definitely agree with him. This film is shocking. And I know what you're thinking ... at least at some point I will see Simpson naked or near. This will not happen, save time and leave her alone. You will have more sex time! <br /> <br /> Movie editing is unconvincing, acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens? <br /> <br /> In conclusion; This is cinematic betrayal, which should be punished to the maximum <br /> <br /> Another question is why Willy Nelson always plays a kind of fatherly figure in almost every Jessica Simpson film and why there are no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this the movie?
