I would like to say that this show was unusual in its banality, but it is normal in all respects. He has a stupid husband, his clever, but boring and ordinary wife, as well as an idiotic partner for “comic” relief - this is very necessary a drug to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep, more like induced to whom. But it can go on for a while, because it gives the average American character that they can truly identify. An “ordinary” guy, just like you and me. I live in the southern United States, so for me this show is just the opposite of escapism. It is known that this disgusting character is everywhere, in one form or another. Seeing him on TV is a cruel overkill.
