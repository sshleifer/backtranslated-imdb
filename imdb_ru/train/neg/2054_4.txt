“Cold Blood” was one of several films from the 60s that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote came up with the phrase “scientific novel” to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of this form was transferred to the script of the film, which he co-wrote. Despite the fact that we survived the era of color films, Richard Brooks decided to present this film in black and white to emphasize both the severity of the landscape and the darkness of the story. This is the first problem with the remake of the TV - the color changes the tone of the plot. In addition, the restriction of filming for television reduces the possibility of framing and focusing images. As a result, we lose the dramatic clash that makes the second part of the original film (police interrogations, trial, detention and execution) so claustrophobic. On a small screen, this is just another version of the Law and Order by-product. <br /> <br /> Searching for scenarios in Hollywood constantly brings us back to films that were successful at a different age. This is usually a mistake, and it is not an exception. <br /> <br /> All the actors are competent. The script is fine. The direction does not interfere. It’s just that the film doesn’t work as well as the original precision instrument. It does not hook the viewer with ambivalence towards Smith and Hikoku, which the original film provokes. At the end of the television version, we have the feeling: “Ho-ho, who cares?” <br /> <br /> First look at the original on as large a screen as possible, and then watch the television version. just to see why the first film was so important in 1967. <br /> <br /> It would not hurt to also go on the air and read a little about Capote and the original book. This will help you understand the extraordinary effort that he put into the material, as well as some of the contradictions associated with both the book and the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, I put only 4, because I kept the lower 3 ratings for real bombs - a look that pisses you off about being dragged out
