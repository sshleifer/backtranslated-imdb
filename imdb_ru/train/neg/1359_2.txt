A good cast is terribly wasted in this slower than molasses and casually whimsical comedy. Pyotr Ustinov is trying hard to bring something to life here, but the result is a tedious tediousness, in which all the right blows that could make it watchable are missed. Despite the positive comments, this film is terrible. Poorly directed. Badly edited. Poor entered. Bad written. You need to watch a hundred movies to see one so bad. <br /> <br /> The confused and painfully lagging plot concerns Ustinov, who is trying to break into the American insurance company in order to hack into their computer and take millions of pounds. , The way he does it goes beyond limping and likelihood (he apparently studies his computer skills overnight, reading several brochures, and deceives computer expert Robert Morley on a trip to South America and stealing his identity ). A side story, Ustinov is married to the lonely Maggie Smith, who accidentally becomes his secretary after receiving an apartment in her house. She ends up sharing sexually suggestive scenes with Bob Newhart, which do not lead to anything, while Ustinov begins to collect money a bit and is trying to get ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. He then marries Smith and flies off to Brazil, which has since become the main finale of almost every British caper comedy (“Nuns on the run? Fish called Wanda?”) <br /> <br /> The unexpected ending of the ending is funnier than all what was before. By the end, I thought that I must have really pulled away from my rocker to break out of this chatter. Not even Cesar Romero's cameo helped. One of the most unfriendly, low-quality "comedies" that I have ever seen, and, of course, the worst of all. Do not waste your time. If you like it, you need to watch the best movies.
