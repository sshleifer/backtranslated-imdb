Wow ... speechless about making this movie, I can't say much. On the cover of a local video store, you should say all this ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses who got lost on the set of “Cry” and decided to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Apparently, the acting was not in the budget, but they could afford nude and beautiful actors! The style above substance almost makes its mark here, except that most of these acting class mistakes continue to forget that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they read this script. Only after 4 or 5 murders by a so-called killer in a mask and an intricate plot about the murder club, which, as the dumb lead actress thinks, is a real club that she can join (only if she can beat the girl who faced her car) want to stab the nearest sharp object to remind yourself that you will never be too excited, perhaps with a good movie like this one. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because of the people who bought this film, and I can’t find anyone to take it off my hands. Another example of what is wrong with the growing number of horror releases right on the video, without thinking about the basics. Throw it away if you bought it.
