John Candy Need I say more? He is the main reason you should see this movie. Most people don't understand how gifted he is as an actor. Witness his change from badly slobbering to an excited jerk. Just a simple (subtle) change of face, and off you go. There are a lot of good moments in this film and a lot of really stupid ones. The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes, and also the wonderful moment when John (in a trance) steps on the stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - so much he and his genitals love their girlfriend. Iâ€™m sure that by reading this you might think that this sequence sounds very rough. This is true, but it is also very funny, mainly because John Candy does it. In general, the story is pretty lame, and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alumni from Candy) don't get enough to do in the film. Levi has his moments, especially the shooting of the film at the end (think of Rode Serling) and a great scene when he is on the phone with his mother. In general, a good movie, if you had a hard day, and you need to do something stupid. I give it 4 out of 10.
