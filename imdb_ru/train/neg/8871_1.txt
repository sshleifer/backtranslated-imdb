I probably watch 200 films a year, both in theaters and at home, and I can say with confidence that this film is the worst I've seen this year (if not ever, nevertheless, I actually did not see the "Quest of the Delta Knights"). still). This film is just a bad joke after a bad joke meant for a 13-year-old, and because he was dissatisfied with watching him on a bus ride, I couldn't get out. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental passage. Four dollars is better to spend on any movie on the figures produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
