Why am I constantly doing this for myself? I mean, really, this is right there in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man." What else to expect? I have to admit that I am a fan of everything that I encounter on the Monster HD channel, but the only feature of this picture is truly grotesque work with makeup from the legendary Rick Baker. As for the creepy, I will bow to this excited couple of old men, sucking on lemons just before the lights go out. Now they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something I could never understand in horror films was why the victims of the monsters simply would not run away when confronted with virtual destruction. Like a chicken in the cabin. You know, right in the kitchen there was a completely visible door from which she could run out at any moment. The incredible Steve-O couldn't put together much more than a quick walk, so why not just hit them right? I don't know, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> In this film there was something like an episode of “Tales from a Crypt”, but “Tales” usually had a sharp or grotesque turn, which was often not noticed. It was one picture that you could not understand when you come or go. For example, in the early scene you can clearly see that the eye of a melting person fell out of his head, as he managed to circumvent the rest of the story? I guess we should not ask. <br /> <br /> For eighty-four minutes this photo was an hour and a half longer. When it was over, I was ready to accept General Perry for his earlier offer - “I could really have a drink now.”
