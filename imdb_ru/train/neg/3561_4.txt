Adaptation of Stephen King (author of the King himself), in which a young family, new to the countryside of Maine, learns about a pet graveyard near their home. Then the father (Dale Midkiff) finds out about the Mikmak burial ground behind the pet cemetery, where there are resurrection powers - only, of course, everything that is buried there does not return quite correctly. <br /> <br /> Below average, the “terrible” picture begins awkwardly, offensively and ineptly, and lasts for some time in this way, with the worst element being Midkiff’s work. It gets a little better by the end, with a really worrisome ending. In fact, the whole film is really disturbing, so I can’t completely dismiss it - at least there is SOMETHING to make it memorable. The worthy supportive performances of Fred Gwynn, as a wise elderly neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, as the disfigured spirit of Victor Pascoe, are not enough to truly buy the film. <br /> <br /> King has an ordinary cameo in the role of minister. <br /> Following a sequel, also directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder that she hasn’t had a mainstream movie job since then?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
