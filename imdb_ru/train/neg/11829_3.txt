I wandered into this film after watching the 82-minute "Borat" tonight and was completely disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and I regularly attend animated films. However, I found myself nodding and at some point I almost came out, but I waited until this movie was better. It never happened. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are stunning and the top-level dubbing, especially in my opinion, is the work of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself several times that the villain with a bulging lizard head was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is that this is one of those animation functions for the ADD set. It is recorded after the fact as one routine routine after another, weighed down by a section filled with molasses, which pulls out each stop in an attempt to convey an “Important Message”. It looks like an Oscar lure for an animated category, and considering how critically assessed it is, I would not be surprised if the Academy makes a mistake and offers its equipment. But if you are looking for an interesting animated feature about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
