The formation of the Small Tree is simply not as good as it could be. Little Tree Education is such things as the circle of life and how you should look at the star to help you. What happened to the three R? Are you reading "Ritin" and "Rhythmetic"? When an idiot speaks to a teacher in a boarding school, he begins to cry and speak from heaven. Oh my gosh. Of course, this lady was a little harsh, but then the character of James Cromwell comes and takes him, leaving viewers who think that Little Tree is absolutely right. He must learn to adapt to the new discipline. These were the times! Talking with a star will not change anything! A small tree needs to understand that its adoring caretakers are not always right.
