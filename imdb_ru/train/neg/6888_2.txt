This film is ill thought out, poorly filmed and poorly written <br /> <br /> John Heder is terribly annoying and cannot avoid the same routine Napoleonic dynamite routine. Smug and ignorant. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same courageous, overly obsessed mother who cares a great deal about the lives of her children (but because I said so). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I generally like her, plays the idiot idiot in this film. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is bearable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this movie if you want to save your soul.
