A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go to the desert for a picnic during the honeymoon. He seems to be hearing a strange noise, and she is worried about the appearance of a bat crawling over a picnic blanket. He wants to go on a trip to the cave, which is associated with some work that he does, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She relents. They go on tour, but leave the group to sort it out. She falls down the slope where insects bother her. He follows her. He hears a strange noise again and seems to know that the bat is approaching; one does and gets into her hair. He fights with her, and she attacks him, biting his forehead. <br /> <br /> They leave the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts having attacks in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He gets angry when this happens. He cannot drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife is worried about rabies, and he begins a Pasteur treatment for this, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people die. We see parts of the transformation of man into a bat man. It seems it is not only in his mind. It is not known whether the bite of the bat is due to these transformations, as he already had some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> Although the name seems inappropriate, in the end it is understood that the same thing happens to another person. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of places in the desert, the caves and the ski slopes, as well as some strange scenes. I didn’t think it was as bad as other people, and I didn’t think that the 1999 Bats film was as bad as others think (I rated it as 5/10).
