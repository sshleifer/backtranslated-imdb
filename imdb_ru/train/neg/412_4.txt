In the field of science fiction, two specific topics invariably aroused interest, were initially explored in the literature of the pre-kinematic era, and since then periodically reviewed both by filmmakers and writers with varying degrees of success. The first topic dedicated to time travel aroused an indelible interest among movie fans, as well as the written word that most recently appeared on the screen along with another version of the HG Wells classic “Time Machine”. The second theme, which also keeps the audience captive, is the invisibility theme, which awakens the imagination with its seemingly endless and innumerable possibilities. And this theme again became the basis for the film, adapted from another classics by G. G. Wells, “The Invisible Man,” the realization of which is “Hollow Man,” directed by Paul Verhoeven, starring Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Kane (Bacon) and his colleagues for some time conducted experiments for the US government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they finally achieved in a number of primates, on which they tested their method. In fact, they have reached such a degree that the effect of invisibility is guaranteed; their only problem at the present time is to return the subject to the original “visual” state of being. However, the problem is that Kane, after diligent efforts and too many hours in the laboratory, decided - or so he thinks. And when the application of his theory on a living subject is successful, he decides to present the results on the board of directors, thus trying to save the funding necessary to continue the project. <br /> <br /> At the last minute, however, Kane objects, fearing that control of the project will be taken away from him before they can go to the next level - testing a person. And he undertakes to become such a subject, to enlist the support of his research team, telling them that the Board has received approval for this. But something goes wrong, and Kane is trapped in his invisibility cloak; and since he and his team are trying to find a solution to their significant dilemma, before it’s too late, it all begins to affect Kane’s mind. And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes irrelevant, as he faces the imminent danger of losing much more than that. Now there is a very real chance that he can lose everything - including himself. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven created the film, which was originally exciting and even thought-provoking; he sets a good pace and uses F / X at his disposal for great effect, although he usually allows amazing visual effects to inhibit character development. Anyone familiar with the “Invisible Man” or someone who can logically follow the development of the plot, sooner learns that Kane is not intended for happier times. Nonetheless, Verhoeven has a storytelling style that will definitely attract attention and attract his audience. But he seems eager to rush to the climax, and on the way he throws away all the nuances that made his film so successful, deciding to enter into the final sequence, which is nothing more than mindless bloody blood. a festival that betrays his audience and everything for which he worked earlier in the film. Instead of looking for a rational solution to Kane’s misery and using some ingenuity and imagination to bring the film to an inevitable end, Verhoeven takes a low road, and although he can succeed at a purely intuitive level, any meaning that can be learned from the story dissolves, like ash in the wind, along with everything that would make this film unforgettable. And this is a shame, because Verhoeven has him at a higher level than most of what is offered in this genre, and he allows him, without having to go down to a much lower level. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a character that would be believable, even on the surface, which would seem ideal for Verhoeven’s goals. There is some depth in the image of Bacon, but it is more connected with the program of his director than with his own acting abilities. Verhoeven simply does not give Bacon time to develop Cain to any degree; the character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and for this purpose it works. The film, however, would have been better presented if Verhoeven and Bacon worked more closely, at least in creating a connection between Kane and the audience, which would cause some emotional involvement from the audience, which might attract them a little bit. to leave them at the gate, as if just observers of the enchanting enchantment in F / X. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Shue plays the role of Linda McKay, Kane's willing partner in a good experiment, but mostly this ungrateful part that offers few problems oh Especially for an actor such as Shu. The same can be said about Kim Dickens (so great in the 2001 film Things Behind the Sun). Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support action and F / X. Both actors are capable of much more and deserve better than what they have been given to work here. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grünberg (Carter), Joey Slolotnik (Frank). ) Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer). Entertaining to some extent and even successful at a certain (low) level, “Hollow Man” is one of those films that leaves you thinking about what could be. Like the annual fireworks, it will give you a bit of thrill, but after a while it will begin to merge with all the others that you have seen, without anything special, to highlight it. And this is very bad, because considering the talent and abilities of those who participate here, it could be much more. I rate it 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
