Painful. “It hurts” is the only word that describes this terrible performance of such a fun and interesting Shakespearean play. I took a picture of him, but I was terribly disappointed and could not even finish watching. The person who wrote the novel about how wonderful this “Much Noise” twist is, I feel sorry for you and your bored brain. Let your claims about young viewers be withdrawn without retribution. Please do not even worry about this painful, disgusting excuse for the performance of the famous Shakespearean drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting, and you will need a chest of drawers next to the TV with which you decide to watch this nonsense, because an involuntary defecation will occur.
