Any film called “National Lampoon” in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It may be an institution in the United States, but it is practically unknown in Europe to a wide audience. The European Vacation of the National Lampon is unlikely to correct this situation. The terrible Griswalds are just awful. They are not funny. Obviously, Mr. Chevy Chase thinks he is funny, after all, Miss B. Di Angelo laughs a lot at his jokes, but she gets paid for it, and she didn’t have to buy back £ 2.50 for this privilege. The section in England is typical. The same old same old television performers, gentlemen Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M. Lippmann, track down the same old old tired cliches, Mr. Chase is lost in the corridor of the hotel ... yawn, yawn, yawn .. Palace, Big Ben ... I feel cheated because we have never seen tits on bikes two by two ......... red pink cheeks on a small child - Dren, should I go on? The British are jesters, the French are evil Yankee haters who speak the language. The Germans are pompous and pouting (not to mention the war, Clark), and the Italians are depraved bottom-talkers. Did I forget something? Every possible “comic” situation is worked out to death, Chase desperately rushes, Miss di Angelo is dimpled sweetly, children are terribly confused. The fact that this franchise has acted as long as before should comfort those who claim that you will never lose money by underestimating public taste.
