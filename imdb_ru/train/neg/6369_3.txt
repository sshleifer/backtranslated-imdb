The only reason I rented it was because of an article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this movie look interesting. Well, it is not. It was a very boring, amateurish and directorial film. All the actors in this movie are terrible, except Faye Dunaway, which is always a pleasure to watch. But too much time was spent on Jean Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with the crows and Duilio Marzio. Marcio has such a strong Argentine accent that you understand only every couple of words he says. Also on hand is Nicholas Pauls, who has an ultra-soft love interest in Jean Phillips. The bottom line: this film is not scary. There is only one good scene, and this is the last five to ten minutes of the film. I would give this one star, but I gave it three just because I really like Faye Dunaway. But even she was not so good at it.
