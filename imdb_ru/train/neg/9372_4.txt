This is a typical late film “The Horrors of Universal Horror”: technically acceptable, albeit by numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and a serious replay. The most interesting part of this film is the tricks of Rondo Hatton, a man with bone disease in the role of a movie monster. It's sad to see how this person is being exploited, but he probably made good use of the money that was paid to him. Hatton is less terrible than the studio hoped for, as I increasingly felt pity for fear or even hatred. Martin Koslak is a crazy film artist and he is very funny in this part. I like to see Koslak in almost everything; for some reason this person entertains me. The only other part of the film that entertained me was the absurd view of the art world. Here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists; it is side by side with the hero of the film who is the “artist” who paints ... get it ... pin up the girls. Somehow, the work of our hero is seen next to the absurd sculpture of Villan. Also funny is the main unpleasant critic of the film, who at some point claims that he despises the hero's art, because “there are no such women”, to which our heroine replies with confidence that the critic simply does not come out about the taming of the heroine (who herself is an art critic) the leading man ... an absolutely anti-feminist and ridiculous witness. In general, this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few funny elements.
