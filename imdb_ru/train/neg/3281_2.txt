I had suspicions that the film would be bad. I'm a fan of the duke since ancient times. There are three years of TV series on DVD. Well, I was right. Took the family to see it. I really wanted to see the general’s leap again, and some of the chase scenes were good. But to sum up, the film was a silly version of a targeted TV show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. Although I can honestly say that Daisy’s original outfits were just as revealing, Daisy Jessica Simpson’s interpretation was terrible. Sorrel Beech and Denver Pyle must also be rolling in graves. <br /> <br /> Don’t waste your money. If you are an old proven and true fan of the dukes, like me and my three children, you will be very disappointed.
