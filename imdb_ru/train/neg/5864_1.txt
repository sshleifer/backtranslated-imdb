I am quite sure that it was the worst movie ever made. If you can't make a 13-year-old boy laugh at silly humor, you should forever abandon comedy. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose otherwise. The film is full of predictable jokes (some of them are racist) and very unfunny jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit is dead and he is pregnant (as I write this, I cannot believe that this was actually a movie scene). A man rushes to the dead rabbit on the doctor's table and tries to give it to his mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The highlight that can tell you how bad things are in this movie: "I knew that I had to be on top." ha ha ha ha ha ........
