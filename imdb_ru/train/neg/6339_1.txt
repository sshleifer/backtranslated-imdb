All films of David Priora are terrible in all respects: bad writing, bad play, bad cinematography, lack of budget (the director’s brother usually plays the role of the main character). But they all have incredible recreational value because of their unintended cheerfulness. The plot of almost every “movie” of David Priora (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Brave American commandos team up to blow up communist villains. But unlike other Cold War era rubbish such as Red Dawn, Pryor’s films are actually fun because of their excessive background and acting skills. The best part of Jungle Storm is the scene in which Becker (or was there another dude?) Summoned by General Mitchell for a top-secret mission in South America. Then the funniest line in the film appears, something like “this is my roommate, I trained him well”. WHAT KIND. Did you train your roommate? And, obviously, it will be their decision to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems in the video, wherever they are used, BUY THEM. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K style experience. So far, my friends and I have managed to master Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But most of all, I recommend the “Final Sanction” with a strange-looking Robert Z'Dar.
