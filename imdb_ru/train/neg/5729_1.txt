It should be the MOST GOOD movie! The game is worse than the movie. Lots of blood, but I don’t know where it comes from, because they don’t even show cuts. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laughed, as if we were watching a comedy, not a horror film. It's a shame for horror movies !!! On the one hand, if they are in Asia, why is the white scavenger driving past the waste management garbage cans ?! There is so much other language that you don’t even know what happens half the time. Editing a movie is a joke, my teenager can do more. And if I went to the cinema, and this vile old man worked with the window, it would be the first clue. DO NOT LOOK THIS MOVIE !!! DON'T EVEN SEE HOW IT'S BAD, YOU WILL SORRY!
