Is the smallest possible score one star? it's a shame. Indeed, I am going to lobby IMDb for the “zero stars” option. to give this film even one star gives too much. Am I the only one who noticed microphones dangling above the bunker head at the station? and acting, or should I say the absence of it? Obviously, talent was not a factor when the casting director came to town. My younger sister’s primary school talent show provides a greater range and depth of emotion. and these fake Irish accents were like nails on the board. the only thing that could have made this movie worse would be ... oh, wait, no, no, it's already as bad as it can be
