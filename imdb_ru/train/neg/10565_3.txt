You can give JMS and the guys a pass, because they were at the beginning of their series and with a small budget, but the film still does not meet the requirements. Don't get me wrong, the B5 series is definitely the best series ever, but if I were a performer after seeing this movie, I would not have ordered the series. I don't like O'Hara as an actor, the costumes are stupid, and there are a lot of clich√©s. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of the Babylon Square and the survivors); Bruce immediately set fire to the series, and it was an amazing sight. If you are a B5 fan and have not seen this movie, watch it. If you're not a B5 fan, don't ... you don't want to watch the show.
