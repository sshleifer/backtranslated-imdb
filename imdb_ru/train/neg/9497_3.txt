you have a strong stomach. Holden was 55 years old on the set, but he was about 70, and he lived only 8 years. At some point, Holden said, "I am twice your age." Okay, try the triple grandpa! The theme “old enough to be your father” for which they were filming did not work. Rendered older people sometimes end up with legitimate teens. More power to them, but that does not mean that I want to watch it. This is not a matter of judgment, but of the digestive tract. I like my food where it belongs. It is interesting to watch Lenz, and cars, clothes, furniture, etc. of the 70s are worth it if they come by cable late at night and you want to see what can be rolled into a bed. It would be great to see a blonde friend Lenz, who beat her guitar, get more scenes. Pleasantly spacious ... Who was this chick? I'm going to try to find out.
