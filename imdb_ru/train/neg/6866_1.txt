This film has so few lessons compared to “Strangers on the train” or even “A chance meeting” that, despite the similarity of the plot, I will not feel right, comparing it with any of them. Yancy Butler's character seemed to me such a stupid jerk that I was too embarrassed for the screenwriter and director to continue watching. <br /> <br /> I don’t like many Lifetime movies, but I feel compelled to watch one movie from time to time. in the interest of promoting harmony at home. I often moan softly, but this film made me protest loudly, get out of the room and wander around the house, mumbling to myself, before I returned to my usually beloved chair to subject myself to more torture. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, New York
