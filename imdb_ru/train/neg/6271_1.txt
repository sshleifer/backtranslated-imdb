There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It is just beyond description. Something about a computer that can turn personal items into silver balls that fall into the victim's mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. Everything is so amazing that staggering. In her room there is also a girl with a personal computer, and the computer is talking through a hand doll !!!!!!!! I do not invent it. A computer also controls things like cars, although nothing connects a computer to a vehicle. <br /> <br /> “Film” is a complete trash. Surreal bad trash. Impressive, one-of-a-kind bad trash. There are many sex scenes here and there that are not very hot or erotic. There is even one scene where a woman seems to be making love or wants the French to kiss the tarantula that made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely, this is one of the worst films ever made. There with the same awful video right on the house BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!) At least it's fun to watch and try to understand what's going on.
