There is something disappointing in watching a movie like Killing by Numbers, because somewhere inside this Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to appear. However, by the time the loans roll, it is no longer there. All this is largely blown up by the “police side” of the story, where Sandra Bullock and the detective characters of Ben Chaplin get entangled in an awkward sex novel that is becoming more and more commonplace with the film’s continued sequel. Although Bullock is strong in his role, this is not enough to maintain a dim scenario and a lazy pace. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgotten role (he did much better at the beginning of the year in the undervalued 'Birthday Girl'), and also Chris Penn, who has a role so ungrateful that you feel sorry for the talent. in fact, it is not even a factor in this film. Two teen murderers performed by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Their talent and chemistry work quite well, and they play well with each other. It is a pity that they were not in the best multi-faceted film. Barbet Schroeder is too safe a path for such an experienced director. Bottom line: if you are a fan of the genre, then you should rent it, but everyone else will live a full life, even without seeing it, except perhaps on network television with convenient advertising pauses.
