This is a very soft and inert performance of one of the most brilliant plays of Shakespeare. I can only guess that the goal was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible for an audience that had not previously encountered Shakespeare. Having done this, nevertheless - by making every line understandable and every intention apparent - they devastated the game of life and turned it into a flat caricature. Somehow it’s actually boring - a very difficult feat, given such wonderful material. <br /> <br /> At best, the game is forgotten - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, are not so good. Hero April Seanham is a puffed-up, breathless air that often provokes wrinkles. Don John Jerry Mayer is a pointless cartoon character on the level of Snidley Whipples (although Snidley was much more pleasant). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (do you know the guy who killed Mozart?) Not in this version, unless he was disguised and his name was removed from the captions. <br /> <br /> Considering that the producer, Joseph Papp, In fact, this is a theatrical god, this production not only disappoints, but also scratches his head. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about it. Instead, see “Much Noise from Bran” - his version is replete with vitality and humor, not to mention the wonderful performances.
