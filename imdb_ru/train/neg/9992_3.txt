Yeah, the Sci Fi Channel is producing Yeti, another disgusting movie. I was particularly struck by the scene, immediately after the accident, when the survivors were desperately looking for matches, at least half a dozen fires burned down ?? for no apparent reason ?? at various points of the wreckage. Fire seemed to be the dominant theme everywhere. They looked for lighters and matches in the corpses, and finally found a box in which, apparently, the fire was set every day, apparently 12, but no one ever collected firewood. Then when vegan (ha) burned the bodies, what did she use as an accelerator? I mean, were these guys frozen ?? well maybe not. Despite the seemingly low temperature, everything you ate was bleeding. Maybe it's just me, but even in a completely incredible story (none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti or a disgusting snowman until the very end), if you take care of the little things, big deals will become more acceptable. Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the film? And the revolver, warm enough to hold it in his hand, froze and did not shoot. Let me rest. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another beautiful girl from Canada. And, with a little irony, Ed Marinaro as a coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I could also add that the rabbit they ate (despite the fact that it looked like a chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now, if it was a squirrel (or rat), it would be a rodent, but it still looked like a chicken. And the authors missed a real chance for someone to notice: “It tastes like ...”
