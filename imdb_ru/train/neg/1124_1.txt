The first frame was the best in this film, because it gave hope that you will see a passionate, well-designed independent film. Damn, this debut for giving me hope. As the “film” progressed slowly, exhaustingly, my thoughts changed regarding this “film”: did my popcorn have too much butter? Was it necessary for the actors to pay the director for taking part in this “film”? Did I get my ticket at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This will be the only exception that I will make to watch a movie at home in a movie theater, because at home you can turn it off. Were there any redemptive values? Peter Lmongelli had his moments as a standard college “nerd”, especially in a collar. In addition, this “film” has evolved from an attempt to become a comedy, into a family drama for spiritual exaltation. It failed on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girl was very bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
