At first I liked this movie. It seemed like a good comedy with some silly moments. Costume Designer Albert Volsky has done everything possible !!! Just like the wonderful scenery set designer Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste !!! But the writers have really disappointed me. The best final will be the scene on the stairs, but instead they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Do not like the final. The father becomes the boyfriend of his own daughter, and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it in order. It would be good if the writers, for example, would say that now there is another soul in the body, but they did not, they just deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Sibill Shepard was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny on the dance scene :))) ... But some moments spoil even the impression of a good acting game. For example, Korin Jeffries, played by Sibill Shepard after her husband’s death, waited for him for 23 years (it’s a long time!), She was faithful to him, she didn’t love anyone except him, and when she met him and was about making love to him, scenes with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neill), she very easily betrayed the person she had dreamed of for so many years !!! It would be a good film if it were not for the final, and some missed human psychology.
