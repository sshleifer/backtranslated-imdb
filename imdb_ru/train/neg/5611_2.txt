I personally thought that this film was terrible, at first it was hardly objective and provided one of the sides of the discussion. The only people who were represented as the party saying that he really existed were a group of people who had come from the Renaissance of Billy Graham. Secondly, he strongly deviated from his supposed theme of the existence of Jesus (Yeshua), telling about how cruel Christianity is, and showing scenes from Mel Gibson's book “Passion”. In the end, he gives an interview to his former director of a conservative private school and tries to trap him in order to teach children faith. Oh, and techno music just made it harder to watch the movie.
