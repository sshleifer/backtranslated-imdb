Working with the camera - Why is the work with the camera in this movie so nervous? It is annoying and distracting. Editing - still image flashes were too short. Many other scenes were too short. Just blinking. The sound - the background music was too loud and hid voices. No need to rewind and rewind to catch what is said. No one checks these things or forces them to do it again. Please turn down the volume of background music in the future. Is adjusting relative sound levels a job of editor Julia Wong? The conspiracy had too many loose ends. The main storyline had potential. I think the film needs more work. Was it rushed? Perhaps they ran out of money. As in many films, it all started great, but by the end it was over. I really don't understand this, you know that you have a storyboard before it is put into production, so why not take care of all the failures in the storyboard. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so critical
