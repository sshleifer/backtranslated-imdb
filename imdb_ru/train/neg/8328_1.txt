If you want to watch a film, made in a strange way, strangely lit, weird stories about these men (and one woman) who like to beat each other out of shit, if you want to enjoy a story that never tells about these two guys, one is a boxer and the other is gay, then you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this film, I almost felt so overwhelmed and cut as the director (film). Kill me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which you can not watch the plot or a great game, this is a movie in which horror and surprise. Very similar to watching a plane crash or train derailment. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, a movie “B” or even a mediocre movie, this movie is not the one. <br /> <br /> Warning to all who watch this movie, please do not eat in advance. You might want to tear by the end of the movie.
