This film is about a policeman (Ching Van Lau) trying to catch a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company headed by Kelly Lin. In principle, whatever plans the thief may have tortured, the thief somehow knows them in advance. This film, made by beautiful leading actors, beautiful main actress and good shots from Hong Kong, really does not make any sense. This is all a flash, and the flash also dims quickly. I lost all interests a third of the way to the film, and after that there is no quality of redemption, except cinematography, which looks good. Just think about watching this movie if you can do it for free. In addition, consider stopping watching a movie in 20 minutes, because itâ€™s still to the end: boring. 6/10
