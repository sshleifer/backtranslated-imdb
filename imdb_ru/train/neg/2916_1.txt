This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. The plot and the message are terrible. There are too many mistakes in this film that cannot be managed. I don’t even understand how this film can get any nomination, let alone 2. That is why: 1) Sam Lee portrays an evil / irrational detective caused by his father’s disappointment. Pros: he is angry, good. Cons: when it comes to the explanation scene, he cannot convey the sadness / disappointment he feels in his father. The weeping scene was too unreal, and it seems that he literally squeezes tears from the corner of his eyes. <br /> <br /> 2) To associate a film with a title, during a fight scene and a rape scene, which are completely irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand that it must be a metaphor or something else ... but it's just sooo stupid! 3) WHY DON'T GET THE DAMN THE KILLER? What the hell is wrong with this movie. When the killer started stabbing the officer, shoot him. He is already dead! What the heck? There were many opportunities to kill the killer, but I do not know why he did not! 4) During the scene where the girl's leg ached. In this scene it was very clear that the LEFT foot of the girls was damaged, because in the next scene she transfers all her weight on her left leg? And this is an actress, nominated as the best new performer? WTF? 5) The sound in the film is not synchronized. <br) 7) This film is too cruel without a goal. Cops beat CI half to death, and then, if they work together, do they give them marijuana and coke? This is generally the worst movie. I really feel that the person who wrote this film is a sadist and a sick person. I've never seen a more disgusting movie in my entire life. Worst movie ever!
