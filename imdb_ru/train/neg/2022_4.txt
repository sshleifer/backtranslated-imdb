Man, this gets a lot of good reviews in book reviews. Honestly, I found it too slow and unattractive from the very beginning. I kept waiting for him to pick up some steam, but this did not happen. This film is highly overrated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare with King James Inglish, in any case, never attracted me, so it can only be me. In the first half of the film there is a considerable share of the latter, since they show that Ronald Coleman plays the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> Good moments of the film include - thanks to the restored print - some decent cinema and the young, slim and attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> In general, it's just too boring, too many repetitions in some scenes to watch again. In addition, we all know that most of the actors are crazy anyway, but thank Hollywood for showing it here in this story.
