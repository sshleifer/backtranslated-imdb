Gadar is a really stupid movie because it tells a fake story. It is too unrealistic and is a typical film about the solar deola, aimed at hitting Pakistan. trying to hide your own flaws will fail. And all the songs and movie music are all bad. Most likely, Sikhs will love this film because it is misleading. Cinema sucks and sucks with force. I think only Amish Patel was good at the movie. If I could give 0 out of 10, I would, but the lowest is 1. Please save 3 hours of your life and donâ€™t watch this dull, boring movie. Disaster.
