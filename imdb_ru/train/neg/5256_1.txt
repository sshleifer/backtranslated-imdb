The film starts off great. Widow with a new girl and children. <br /> <br /> The film is full of stupid directorial choices. Like "let's separate." "I am going down to ..." What to do? Stupid Stupid Stupid. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time, hoping that it will get better ................ Not difficult.
