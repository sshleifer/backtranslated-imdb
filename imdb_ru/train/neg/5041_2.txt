E. Lou's film "Violet Butterfly" is a secret organization ("Violet Butterfly") against Japanese troops in war-torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film replaces the intricate, semi-historical conflict with the plot, not giving the audience a single reason to take care of the characters or their causes. A sudden shift in time does not help, as it seems completely unreasonable and meaningless. Usually I don’t mind dark movies, but the lack of light, terribly shaky footage from the camera and generally bad movie making methods really make this movie difficult to watch and take interest in. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film “has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography,” but I don’t think it helps the film. The background to the film is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I do not believe that you can do it right by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film. Overly melodramatic moments do not increase his observation. <br /> <br /> All the actors are respectively melancholic. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range, as she conducts the entire film, doing what she thinks is best in all of her films, thinking and looking generally irritated. However, at least she adds diversity to this role, clinging to and participating in the worst love scene since the time of Michael Bean and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> In general, a very disappointing film, especially seeing how it comes from director Suzhou Heh. 2/10
