I do not understand why people praised this garbage. It is wrong, stupid, unreal, terrible, and almost everything else. The film is a look at life, racial problems, prejudices and everything else that happens in a strange way in college. That's where it fails. It has no understanding of reality. Of the many dubious meaningless scenes in the film, such as, for example, <br /> <br />, a black man stalking a white man with a gun, a black man and stopped by guards is handcuffed and executed while the gunman passes by them. <br /> <br /> The same white man, shooting people from the rooftop theme, who was stopped and beaten by the same black man, then stops and gets beaten up like Rodney King, while the man with the gun runs after a while, only one of the four guards is following him. <br /> <br /> As one previous reviewer noted, several white men weighing 230 pounds beat several black men weighing about 160 pounds, including a bust of 105 pounds. Rhymes <br /> <br /> Another critical drawback of the film is the small, uninteresting main characters. From scared and confused white people and mean, evil and at the same time legitimate (?) Black people. It is almost like an insult to black and white people. I am a white man, and I know many black and Hispanic people who agree that in this film itâ€™s wrong to portray characters and give them these characteristics solely because of their race. <br /> <br /> The storyline, which I will explain, now rotates around three characters. One is a black athlete, the other is a confused, frightened white girl who questions her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared and then blames her problems for black people in whom he becomes a Nazi later in the film. They all have their own problems and adventures, including sex, rape, fighting, love, hate, prejudice, racial war, and, oh, yes, do not forget about education. Which all comes down at the end for a fatal shootout. After that, they return to their boring life and think that "being white is bad." Does this sound like your college years? I did not think so. I don't think the principal was in college, especially if he made this terrible mess. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a really bad, bad, ugly movie. If you want a more accurate picture of racial issues, go to the History of America X section. If you want to see a more accurate view of the Porkys College rental. Just avoid this mess.
