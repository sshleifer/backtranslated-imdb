This film is not very good. In fact, this is the worst Elvis film I've ever seen. He has very little plot, mostly parties, drinking beer and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez for nothing. I do not know why they starred in this film. We can say that Elvis was also wasted, he is much, much better in “Follow That Dream”.
