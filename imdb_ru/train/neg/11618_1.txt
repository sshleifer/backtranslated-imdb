Honestly, the acting in the film is really well done, but the film is so slow and boring, as soon as it becomes interesting, everything slows down. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did an excellent job, like the other actors, as I mentioned, other than me ... this is one of the worst long films I've ever seen. Now, maybe in a short film this film would be good, but other than that, avoid it. There is so much filler in this film that a jealous twink pie. <br /> <br /> I never walk in films, but after watching this film at home with my family, I left. Yes, it was so boring. Obviously, my comment does not have enough lines to publish, so here is some more filler. I think I was inspired by the movie that I just watched.
