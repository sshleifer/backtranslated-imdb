Naturally, I did not watch the “GI Jane” of my choice. I was more or less forced to watch this movie around my ex-girlfriend's house. <br /> <br /> GI Jane immediately loses her confidence in herself, trying to convince the viewer that this is a potentially real scenario, which of course not. The result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by restrictions that limit the amount of humor (which is not present) or entertaining scenes of action, and soon becomes too serious. Therefore, the film becomes extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> J.I. Jane fails when other action films succeed, mainly because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and others that are bigger than life, but never announce to be different. This escapism, and therefore entertaining. GI Jane tries to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott, with a very unreliable storyline, an unremarkable game, and the only reason I put it on 2/10 instead of 1/10 for some technical work.
