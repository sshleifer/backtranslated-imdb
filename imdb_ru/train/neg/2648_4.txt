I just finished reading a book about the work of Anita Loos, and the photo in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings), so I decided to watch this movie. I have never heard of a movie before, so I didn’t have any preconceived ideas about it at all. I thought it all started with Eddie as a playboy and Macdonald as a secretary he doesn’t know. The scene where she appears at a costume party in her simple angel outfit with a stunning halo and wings that will not remain was truly charming. I was even with the film when Eddie goes to bed and imagines her to be a real angel. But after a while it just started to fall apart for me. Eddie remains "asleep" throughout the film, so this is all a dream. Whatever happens from now on, it really doesn't matter, because he is just dreaming. Everything else was largely plot and meaningless. I had to force myself to stick with it. And the last number, in which MacDonald moves from a music number to a music number in some insane hallucination, was just bizarre. <br /> <br /> If Eddie “woke up” earlier, and the original story continued, or he really married an angel I think it would be much more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real character. <br /> <br /> In fact, there were not enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good, but the jitterbug number that MacDonald performs is like nails on the board. Totally wrong for her operatic voice. Despite this, Eddie and MacDonald still manage to shine, showing what they were real stars.
