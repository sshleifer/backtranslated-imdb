I wanted to see this for two reasons. Firstly, it was a remake of High Sierra with Bogart, and secondly, Jack Palance played the role of Bogart, who can play dramatic roles with some subtlety, like in the Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to make this remake. The film follows the same story as Hig Sierra; only here the actors do not care, the director is immersed in his thoughts, and who knows what the producer was thinking about. Jack Palance gets bored with Shelly Winters, and Shelly Winters asks herself what she does in this movie. I do not even want to compare it with Ida Lupino in the same role. And, of course, they again had to use a canine story! They certainly could come up with several different ideas. Perhaps because of the color, it is nice to see the same place where the High Sierra was filmed, but this definitely does not add to the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the High Sierra, it's a waste of time. before. Otherwise, why not watch a pseudo-film noir. As for me, I'd rather die than see it again ...
