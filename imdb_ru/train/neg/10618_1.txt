The film is terrible and will humiliate rape victims. At first glance, this may be a bold rape film, but if you dig under the surface, then a lie is not a very positive message about rape. Aishwarya, a rape victim, turns out to be a helpless victim who cannot cope with everyone because she is a WOMAN. She needs a MAN to help her. When society mocks her and throws comments at her, she does not intercede for herself. Ailu Kapur will have to say everything, but Aishwarya is crying. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kaushik) went the wrong way, portraying the rape victim as weak and submissive. What would be more effective is to portray a strong woman who boldly rebel against her enemies. The director is famous for chauvinism. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He needs to understand that just because this role is contradictory does not mean that the heroine herself is strong. <br /> <br /> The most humiliating scene in the film is when Aishwarya "cleans herself" after she was raped. She does this to please her father, who thinks she is dirty now. Although it is commendable that Shah demonstrates stigma against rape victims in such a bright light, he does not show us whether Ashâ€™s father was wrong forcing his daughter to do such things. So we are left with a confusing rape report. <br /> <br /> Comedy is also not needed in such a strong plot as this one. Moreover, the comedy is simply not funny. Ash is wooden in his role, while Anil Kapoor just screams. The music is mediocre, with the exception of the title track, which is beautifully depicted (the only bright point of this film). The role of Sonali Bendra is disappointing and meaningless. In general, what could have been a good movie to remember in the end turned out to be a terrible mess that would cause severe stomach upset in some viewers.
