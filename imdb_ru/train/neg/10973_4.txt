If you like Pulp Fiction and like hand-held cameras, you should like this movie. I liked the bizarre story (although I feel that Pulp Fiction was the most overrated film since the English Patient) and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It is not "On the Embankment" or "Citizen Kane" and is burdened with European pretentiousness. But the worst part of today is a handheld camera. It is so distracting and annoying that I'm desperately waiting for the end of the film. I donâ€™t know why new directors find this method of filming so wonderful. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away; a hand-held camera will cause nausea in about 10 minutes.
