As stated in the summary, you just made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard of an RPG. Did you seriously think they were gay? Are you retarded? If you went to save your best friend, and someone decided to help you voluntarily in your heart, then you have a serious duty to this person. Lavits was a good person, and every time they helped each other, it brought them together as friends. They were not gay lovers like your quarrel. And so you know that the game takes place in the medieval period of time. Then the women just cooked, and the men fought. Do you even know your story? Do you know how long it took for women to join the army today? This game contains a lot of realism, even if you are too damn slow to catch it, and you really need to put forth some solid evidence instead of ignorant assumptions based on your wrong actions to interpret the story.
