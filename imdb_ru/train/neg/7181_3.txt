don't get me wrong, i'm enjoying christmas movies. I love his wonderful life, and I really like the versions of the Christmas song with George s. Scott and Alistair Sim. but this particular movie is terrible. I think the song I Love Life, which the ghost of a Christmas present sings, is particularly painful. Albert Finney sings pretty well in Annie. I don't know what's wrong with him in this film, but it sounds like someone is trying to sing through the mouth of dead gerbils. The only thing that saved this film for us is to turn off the sound and watch dance numbers accompanied by a Christmas CD in South Park.
