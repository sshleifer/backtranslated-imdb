The form of the film is similar to the unknown shocker. There are surprises, turns, turns and excitement. From time to time, this is really the “last place” movie. But it is disappointing and greatly disappointing. <br /> <br /> The villain of this work is not credible; his character does not stick together. I refuse to “spoil” the film, but I will only say that the character with whom we meet at the beginning simply cannot be what we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The second major disappointment of the film is, “In the end, it becomes a little more than a bloody slasher.” There is a small qualitative difference between this and one of the films "Friday 13". It is not necessary that every film is always tasteful, but sometimes this film does drip blood. <br /> <br /> Although the film depicts the gorgeous Sean Connery, even he doesn’t meet his usual standard, and often just seems to be on pace.
