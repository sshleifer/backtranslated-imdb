What else can I say? Acting was almost without exception amateur. Direction and continuity were pitiful. The script was predictable up to the very last scene, and the dialogue was tedious. One of the features on the DVD was labeled Gag Reel, but this could be a description of the viewer's reaction to most of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things was in the directorâ€™s comments on the film. DVD. He said with an imperturbable face that he intended to make a film with high performance and title compound - and that he had succeeded. With such delusions, it is easy to understand how the film turned out the way it was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The costume of the dark wolf was a modified monkey costume (according to the function of "making" on DVD) and looked more like. The mask and claws were slightly better than the finished work in any store. The effects of cgi were painfully obvious and in quality they looked like an inexpensive video game.
