Well, friends, a serious movie buff, is expected to watch all kinds of movies, both bad and good, and this film put me to the test. I will not chop words. This film was bad. The story was bad. The game was bad. The always great Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. In fact, I asked myself, why did I even bother to watch this rotten, crappy film? Why did I spend my time and money on what I suspected would be bad? The answer, of course, is that I am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided. I will not waste your time explaining exactly what is wrong with this amateur film, except that I would say that the quality of acting was, to put it mildly, unsatisfactory. A serious movie lover may want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. stay home, do not waste time, read books, work around the house or try a good sandwich.
