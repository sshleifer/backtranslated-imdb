Vodka Lemon is a charming, but extremely uneven Arminian film that will please some and tire others. The film, although quite well thought out, is devoid of any real “zine,” relying instead on many scenes that seem common to an astute art-house viewer. The film contains several moments of pure cinematic brilliance, unfortunately they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be dark comedy and light to be serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many looks disoriented and ultimately angry. You may laugh, but these moments will be few between the sea of ​​blurry snow-covered landscapes and the endless series of bus walks. The noble effort ultimately accomplished by the lack of cohesion of the narrative.
