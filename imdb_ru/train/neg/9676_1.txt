Movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done it twice, so it took me three sessions to finish it. The dialogue was bad. Women talked nonsense, and men - caricatures. And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names and spoke with distinctly Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why Emmental men were sexually dressed with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 are equal to a difficult choice: I give this film a rating of one? or two? <br /> <br /> I didnâ€™t sleep because of the films, but no film did it twice, so it took me three sessions to finish it.
