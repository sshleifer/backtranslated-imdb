The main premise of this film is a political cartoon. I believe that for those who know nothing about military realities, this is probably a “pleasant to the touch” film about gender equality. Indeed, a recent commentator stated: “It allows women to know that they can do whatever they want.” What the hell! No one, man or woman, can do what they want, and, unfortunately, Demi Moore “prepares” for SEAL Hell Week at the beginning of the 27-week BUD / S program in several sessions at a local gym, and only she wants to be SEAL just not going to do it like this. Approximately 80% of deductions from school, which is perhaps the roughest of military training programs, are those who voluntarily drop out of school, cannot compete at the physical level, often suffer from physical injuries during exercises or cannot cope with psychological harassment. I never went beyond the surface of the contrived, supposedly the message of this film. In the real world, Demi will not last the first 24 hours in this tough and steady physical preparation. Desire alone will not do it. Skip this movie as wishful thinking, and better spend time reading Dick Couch's Elite Warriors (Crown, New York 2001) to get a better description of what is actually happening in this training. Ring the bell, Demi! <br /> <br />
