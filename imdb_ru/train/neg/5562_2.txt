This unpleasant film has little to recommend. Dolph Lundgren gives an idea that is better than this script or its other action films. And there are random fragments of dialogue, which suggest that the film could give some idea of ​​a strange subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. Motivations are either muddy or trite. Most of the action is sub-clause. Script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director's useless enthusiasm for focusing on blood distracts. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to imagine who is watching this movie.
