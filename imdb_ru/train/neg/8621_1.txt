The previous poster clearly worked on the film. This is a joke, as it is bad, and no one would have reviewed this film as he did. Mentioning the names of all the actors and what they were previously in is a sure sign that he is somehow related to him. <Br /> <br /> this is on Cinemax right now and I was sure it was some kind of movie where porn stars (one called Ava is gorgeous and well-to-do) were forced to do something else for some insane tax the reasons. <br /> <In addition, when I first saw him, I was sure that it was done around 1986, and I was born in 73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no. .. it was made in 1993 !! Incredible! <br /> <br /> Although I would call it one of those bad films, these are good films. How to look at a train wreck.
