I just watched the 30th anniversary of Blazing Saddles, one of my favorites for all time !! The television pilot for Black Bart is smelly. The plot did not exist, and the game was not good. Obviously, it was an attempt to capitalize on the success of Blazing Saddles, and there were television shows that succeeded in making great films, but this one would never have worked. Considering that for so many years, television did not reproduce even farting sounds when they were broadcasting the film on television, it is inconceivable that they thought they could put on a television show with the word "N" cast. On the other hand, I liked to see many familiar faces !!! There were quite a few actors / actresses that I learned from other shows over the years. I had to write down all the names and do a few searches. It was fun. I argued with my mother whether Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
