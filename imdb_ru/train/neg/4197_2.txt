Incredibly bad game, no good, unclear history and vivid images and slow movements where they are least needed: adrenaline is all that should not be in the movies. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verban (such and such) an actress from Dutch soap who did not attend English classes) plays a rich girl Freyja who has a habit of “looking for thrills”. Which basically does dangerous stunts, breaks things and annoys people. And not in a joking way. Then there is Draco (Rivas). He seems to be leading the group, but on the side other illegal actions. Then there is Freyja's dad (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And in the end, we got Jason (debutant Fjall), the Freya guy. <br /> <br /> Once Freya disappeared and everyone seemed to be involved, but we, the viewer, really don't care how any of the cast is either cute or believable, and the story makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Why was this done at all? 2/10.
