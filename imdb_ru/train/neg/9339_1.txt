I thought they should have called this movie "White" instead of "Heights." God, what movie makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed and think that their lives are so important ... let me rest. Such a purple-white cast that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in this film, this film required that someone real come and steal it ... and therefore they get it, the character is even whiter than the other cast. I thought he was an albino) which should be a Welshman! I'm still trying to decipher this accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this film is a film that can fool many people, forcing it to think that it is worth it, because there is something more ambitious in it. It is better to fill the theaters MI-5-10 than this pretentious shit ... It must have been the best play, because you can't fall off the floor.
