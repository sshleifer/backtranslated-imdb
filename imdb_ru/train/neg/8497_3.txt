My name should be enough. <br /> <br /> I am confused by the fact that a culture so rich in literary perfection (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would produce such a striving as a “new indefinite” cinematic movement. Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic clarity and intelligent philosophy. But the minute you give them a movie camera, they will start behaving like WOOOHOOO. LOOK HOW THE WAY I CAN BE! PLOT? THEME? Ugh! LET'S FILM, BUYING AMUMENTS PARK, ROUND ROUND! At least, this is not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of people's heads. Oh la la, quel artiste.). No, Truffaut supports a certain visual clarity. But just like a surveillance camera in a fast market. These two are indistinguishable. Haha, just like supporters of all the film school jerks: I bet the vein is protruding from the neck right now. But do not leave without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you like French literature, you hate it. People who like this film have probably never read any books other than Jack Kerouac’s rampage or maybe the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Or maybe they have read The Doors lyrics and think it is deeply touching. Whatever your boat floated. I find it ironic that this film introduces some (weak) hints at Balzac, one of the best and most significant authors who have ever lived. Nice try, truffles. But you are far from the stadium. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a syringe infected with AIDS. <br /> <br /> If you are the person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese masters of Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, enjoy Truffaut, Godard, and Andy Warhol. And for God's sake, stick this vein in your neck. You look like cabbage.
