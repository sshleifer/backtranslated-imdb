Being pleasantly surprised by the performance of Sandra Bullock in the film “Miss Congeniality”, I decided to try Murder By Numbers. Despite a decent role in brave, self-deprecating roles, the performance of Ms. Bullock in “serious” roles (see “Hope”, speed 2, 28 days) leaves much to be desired. Her character is at the same time all-knowing, confused and sexually maladjusted (Sandra’s past plot seems to be an unnecessary filler that does little to develop her already petty character). Two teenage boys gave decent results, although their expertise and “catch me if you can” is refuted by stupid mistakes that scream “We did it!” Chris Penn as an obvious suspect here is lost, as well as Ben's symbolic partner Chaplin / character love interest. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers ahead *** Mediocre suspension, the biggest flaws can be traced to the plot on television of the week, in which you never fully accept the motives for the murder, and, as already mentioned, stupid mistakes ( vomiting with rare food on the murder scene, too convenient and fake) school janitor, two boys dangling together in public, convenient love interest causing friction, etc., etc., make the presentation shift from intrigue to boredom and frustration the killers. The finale was strictly By Numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Using currently clicked tactics to almost show the climactic scene at the beginning of the film, and then fill the audience with how we arrived at this moment, the final scenes surprise no one and have no so-called intelligence, the film intended to come to its conclusion. A somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost all respects. * outside ****.
