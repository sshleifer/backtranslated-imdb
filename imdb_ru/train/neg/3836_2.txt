As one of the few commentators who have not seen the first film, I found it to be a very disappointing film. <br /> <br /> Yes, he has a ridiculous awkward type of humor, if you can put up with a (very) morally questionable premise. However, he fails in important areas. <br /> <br /> There is a thin and meaningless storyline that includes the generous friend of Gordon Sinclair, who may or may not be involved in a plot to deliver dangerous electronics to third world countries - perhaps in free computers ... or, probably no. Indefinite, verbose and inconclusive. The absence of any substantial ending is so enraging, and what is present is pompous and completely illogical. The film seems unfinished. <br /> <br /> Suspending disbelief is extremely difficult when a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) can be attracted to the inexpressive character of Gordon Sinclair, especially when he is fighting off her achievements. Ridiculous. Later in the film, it gets worse when he reaches his romantic ambitions, and then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Not many films leave me deceived, but I feel my time was stolen.
