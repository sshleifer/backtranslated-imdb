In the film, which follows a fighting actor, played, apparently, by a fighting actor, this does not favor Chris Klein. He struggles to bring something memorable to the role and wriggles through a small script that could show what could be described only as a weak leading person. The story exists, but that is all, and it cannot show any basic beginning, middle and end, and the viewer remains shrugging, feeling as if nothing had really happened in the past hour and three-quarters. <br /> <br /> One bright light in the midst of this is Fred Durst, who manages to stand out over his seemingly medium-talented fellow stars, and he does a decent job of putting the backward character Legde into life. Whether Fred can recreate this when working with actors of a higher level is still unknown, but I will follow him in the future.
