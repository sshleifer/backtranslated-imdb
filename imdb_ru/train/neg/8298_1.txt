This film was not very interesting, of course, WHERE is not original and not as good as “The Christmas Carol”. Characters (except the youngest) try to imitate previous actors, and they fail. Neighboring neighbors appeared out of nowhere, as they were not part of the first film. It really sucks, perhaps it would be good with the original composition, but again, maybe not because the story is so weak. Skip it.
