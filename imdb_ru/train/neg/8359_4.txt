Despite some moments in heavy rain, a meeting with a drunk, as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanatorium, this quiet comedy Rosco “Fat Man” Arbuckle is short with the support of Buster Keaton and Al Street. John is only amusingly funny, although there is a rather amusing sequence of Arbuckle in a dredge flirting with Buster, which is final in the “meet dear” scenes, especially since this is one of the few times when we see the Great Stone Face smile and laugh in movie! In addition, many scenes seem to have been edited abruptly, possibly due to excessive use of film stock. However, if you are a full Arbuckle or Keaton, good night, nurse! definitely worth a look.
