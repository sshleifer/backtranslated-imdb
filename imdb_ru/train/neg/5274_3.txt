If you like movies about creepy cities, hotels, houses, states (for example, “Eagles”, “Hotel California”), etc. In which there are people who “just pass”, read almost any Stephen King novel. If you like the “Fading” setting, start by reading King's “Despair”, and also see “Shining”, “Lot Salem” and “Essential Things”. <br /> <br /> The crow motive, the desert, the family, desperately trying to escape or avoid obsession, is tired. Why didn't they just make a film from the novel “Despair”? Maybe they came to the king and he bit off? It must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Day and Harry Hamlin look happy from the reunion, and they both have worn well over the years, but they are still actors on television and direct caliber on DVD.
