I watched this because I thought that there would be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gape. I think they lied to me. This film is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi), who sits near the Porsche car dealership and checks to see if he has a suitable car. When they confirm that this is correct, Kip gets a brick from the chest and throws it out the window, breaking it. He gets a Porsche, while his friend gets the keys. They start the car and take off into the night. They take him to the warehouse only after he is followed by the police. So, the whole crew ditched all the cars and sold. Then we will see Memphis Raines. He gives a small speech to a group of children on the go-kart track. Then he confronts Utley Jackson (Will Patton). Utley tells Memphis that his brother Kip took a deep breath. Memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis is sent to a landfill and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis doesn't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are several problems in this film: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: the first 48 hours of the movie take place when Cage and Duval are looking for a team and everyone is planning. The last 12 hours of the film - a waste of time! <br /> <br /> 2. Cars: You see, maybe 10 cars out of 50, as advertised in a movie. So where are the other 40 cars? Why don't we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. Chase: The chase at the end of the film was a joke. It was not at all stress. <br /> <br /> 4. Dog: somewhere in the film a dog eats hamburgers and swallows three keys. It's impossible. The keys were open. The keys seriously damaged the dog's esophagus, stomach, and large intestine. The guys offer to give the dog laxatives to help him with all his might. It will not work. The dog will have a lot of diarrhea, but no keys. This was stated in the Jackass after Ryan Dunn put a toy car in the rectum. Take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no car. The same with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. Police officer during the chase: When Eleanor crashes for a few minutes, Nicolas Cage desperately tries to start the car. You see a police cruiser behind him who does not look at his car at all. But when Nicolas Cage starts the engine again, the policeman jerks his head to the right, sees the car and immediately starts chasing him. This is stupid. So, when he heard the engine start and saw the car, he realized that this was the car he was looking for. How does he know that this is the right car? He sees only the reverse side. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The film is stupid. I have never seen the original, but plan. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. In exchange for "Fast and Violently."
