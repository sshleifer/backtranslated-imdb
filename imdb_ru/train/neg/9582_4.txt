This piece of feces stacked together puts so many ridiculous scenarios that in the end it is a riot of absolute gaiety. Too bad, since the premise is promising (as is often the case in Dullwood), but in the hands of this scriptwriter, it goes into la la land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in jail, serving time for drunk driving, which killed his mistress. We see that he has nightmares so that we know that he feels VERY BAD about this. Then his neighbor on the cell hangs himself. Or is he? Low has some suspicions, but they quickly disappear. His suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. So why then was he set up to kill? Ah, this is where this story can be interesting. This is where he falls off the rails, and as soon as he goes off the rails, he decides that he will be able to offend the attention of the audience in the next hour. <br /> <br /> ************* **** SPOILERS ************************* *** <br /> <br /> I will not be bored with the endless recalculation of the irrationality of what follows, but to contemplate this end. Lowe was trapped by the bad guys on the train. They want to have the tape that he has, because this tape will hurt their boss and them. So, 3 cops come to the train with weapons in their hands, ready to save Lowe. The bad guys kill the cops in front of half the passengers, and then ... continue to chase Lowe to get a record. HELLO!!!! a public killing of 3 policemen will lead you into deep confusion, to hell with the tape. However, they go through the mall, shooting at the place, as if the public does not exist as witnesses, and in the end, Lowe is captured, and the bad guy still wants the tape !!!
