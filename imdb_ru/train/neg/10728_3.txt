Worst movie I've seen lately. An interesting first half with some interesting, brief dialogue among dubious characters in a night bar. The film then degenerates into a shapeless sequence of scenes aimed at visual shock (read disgust), without any expiatory observations, lessons on humanity or anything else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to leave, but the director was present at this show and my politeness prevented me from showing disrespect to him. However, time is precious (as the director himself remarked in his introduction), and I really regret that I wasted my time on the second half of it. <br /> <br /> The saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the film, especially the female role.
