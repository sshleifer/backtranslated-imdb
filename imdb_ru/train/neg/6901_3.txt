The most positive thing I can say about this boring local comedy production is that it is harmless. In fact, it is so surprisingly boring that one wonders how many dozens of rewrites were made by the committee in order to achieve such a complete removal of the personality. It is not witty, it is not interesting, it is not insightful, and it is not charming. It’s just a balanced, without laughter, a progression of four losers who have to change their attitudes — and their attitude toward women — so that they are allowed to attend the wedding of their best friend. <br /> <br /> With acting, this would not be the same as for the local amateur dramatic society, the storyline was so tired that in the forty-third season of “Hello”, Hello looked fresh, and the jokes were as humorous as observation for decaying vegetables, but the Wedding of Zion received ten (yes 10) nominations in the film New Zealand Awards recently. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone saw the meaning, and he won nothing.
