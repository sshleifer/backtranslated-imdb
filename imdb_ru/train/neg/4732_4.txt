If I write a review about the film, maybe he will stay with me ... but overall, I expect to forget that I saw him only two weeks later. So why? Because I’m watching a low rated movie that was fun to watch. I did not expect to be able to stay in the room while it is on. <br /> <br /> It wasn’t great, but at least it wasn’t unbearable ... not a comedy of mistakes that always makes me cringe It’s just sweet fluff ... and if you can’t take it, stay in the locker room, guys. I agree with those who defend this film, because he will surely like his target audience and will not be tiresome for an adult. <br /> <br /> He offers some good chuckles here and there, but not a side splitter. Of course, this is stupid and only slightly entertaining, but at least it does not suck (as many have said). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to rate the bell curve, so 4.5 or 6 is a really good comprehensive rating in my book. Giving him 4 makes sense and will support his rating at the time of this writing. If you assign it 1 or 10, as it was already done by the majority, the rating does not make sense. I can not believe how strongly people somehow relate to this forgotten fluff (or that I even try to write about it). Did I miss something? <br /> <br /> In any case, it should be noted that Emma Roberts fulfills her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariel Kebbel, often recorded in the role of b * h, does not disappoint when her character gets his due. You can also find out how Bruce Spence plays Leonard, although his role is auxiliary. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can skip this role if you're already an adult. But, if you have a teenage girl in your life, take this film for her ... and be prepared NOT to hate him (you might even like it).
