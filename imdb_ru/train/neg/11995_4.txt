I was so excited and upset about watching this movie when the promo was first released in November! It looked cool and songs! I was very disappointed when I went to see it! This is a film that combines 6 pairs. This is a multi-caste of 12 people! A huge number of stars worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, didn’t cope well with the situation and shouldn’t have had a lot of people in this film, as that would make it easier. Compared to Nihil's Kal Ho Naa Ho directorial debut, Salaam-e-Ishq is far behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast. I think the best factors of this movie are songs! The songs are great and I think all the songs are great, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did a great job and did a great job over the years. I think that the rating of this film may increase due to great songs! One thing I was disappointed with was that the director should not have included nudity in this film, shot by Sohail Khan and Isha Kopcikar. I found it very rude to watch it with the family! Although some may find this naked comedy, this is not something you would like to see with your parents! I think the best acting was performed by Salman and Priyanka. Overall, I think this is a good movie!
