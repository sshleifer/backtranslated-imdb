The plot is not so original. If someone saw "L'ultimo Bacio", then nothing new. A rich family in Rome, living everyday life, boring and fake, everyone asks others what they think of them. In half an hour it is very boring, because it is easy to understand where the story ends. This is because it is easy to see Muccino’s moralistic view in this film, so even the most difficult moments seem normal. Summing up, we can say that in the first 2 minutes of the film this will be enough, and the purpose of the film is already indicated. I’ve seen my family since I was 30, I don’t like to watch movies that want to show reality, but in order to be consistent with his thoughts, you need to push more than normal situations. Really good, as Muccino put the camera in the right place, moving with his friends, and this is the only reason why I do not sleep in the cinema, although I always scream at the cinema from the very beginning. Perhaps it would be nice to see the family as they really are and not blame something on this. Morante, as usual, was tense and gorgeous, but, unfortunately, in a bad movie!
