You know that this will be a funny movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. This was done in the 50s 2. It is black and white. 3. He does not have the name of the actors! 4. Screams make up for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well, in order not to become obsolete - this film brilliantly included all four of the above elements in order to turn it into a real cinematic error. <br /> Good - shhh, but I'm going to discuss the special effects here - or lack thereof - <br /> <br /> Did you catch underwater scenes? It seems that he was badly shot through the aquarium - note that the cape sways in the wind. <br /> <br /> And repeated reuse of Stock videos (external shots of houses, scenes with bridges is great KRAF-Tiness of this film - not starting from “PLAN 9” - I saw such creative use of video footage. <br /> < br /> And hey, where there were not enough special effects - do not worry - a scream WILL NOT be a place for special effects in this film. Yes, this film even cleverly used this old hacker trick. <br /> <br /> Grab popcorn - make your brain stun (some fermented drinks definitely helps), sit down and wonder: why the hell did they take off again it on tape? <br /> <br /> Vaino <br /> <br />
