At first this film was not so bad. It was interesting ... at least for me, perhaps for all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original, so I can not compare them. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of Christopher Reeve’s weird village, The Village of the Damned. The two films have different plots, but both have a terrible feeling of disgust and an undesirable comedy. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that the braided man is a mystery / thriller / men, please do not make the film angry about women. I do not know this whole pagan thing, and the sacrifice was a bit out of place. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage, his glorious, evil person goes to a secluded island called Summers when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long-lost bride. which claims that her daughter was taken and hidden by other inhabitants of the island. <br /> <br /> Cage is a policeman, and, being a tired policeman, he goes to a half-open island, without telling his whereabouts to anyone in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The situation becomes weirder when large Amish women inhabiting the island roar at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His bride does not help, which seems elusive and weary all the time. Cage stays on the island when he finds out that the missing girl is his daughter, and he is a happy man, deceived to come to this island as a sacrificial sacrifice during the holiday of gathering the sick on the island. <br /> <br /> In this film, men are not so good. Sick twisted feminism show? <br /> <br /> I found the movie funny, especially when Cage beats some women and runs around in a bear suit. I think there were too many potholes in this movie. I find that the very idea of ​​evil women hiding on the island without caring for men is quite interesting, but the way it was portrayed in this film was just strange. While most women had some kind of sharp pain and anger, this is clearly a form of sexism. I would disgust the film if I switched roles. This movie is worth watching once or twice. This is NOT a thriller, it should be classified as strange.
