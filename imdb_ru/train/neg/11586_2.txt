Nightmare on Elm Street: Child of Dreams <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. This can not be avoided. I love the show, and I think Freddie is probably the best hero in horror movies. But even being a fan, I can't help but see that this film is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is not even effort to create an interesting story and strong characters. By now they have just surrendered. They don't even try. Of course, they are products, hoping to get a few more simple dollars. <br /> <br /> This story does not attract your attention. It is so simple that it is almost none. <br /> <br /> Alice, the survivor of the fourth part, is now pregnant. Freddie returns through the child’s dreams. First we learn that in order to stop him, Alice must find her mother. And it's all. <br /> <br /> The story progresses slowly, because the plot is so small that it becomes rather boring after a few minutes of bad dialogue and terrible play. In fact, this is the only scary thing, acting, because death is not even cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we don't give a damn about them. <br /> <br /> Girls are as unattractive as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I have seen the best actors in school plays. This is really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages to lead to this lesson. She is beautiful, sexy and talented. But the material just did not let it shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins’s work is far from the brilliant direction of Renny Harlin at Dream Master. He is trying to make some creative pictures closer to the end, but this tension, which Harlin and Craven created so well in previous films, is not where to find it. <br /> <br /> “Dream Child” is another unimaginable sequel. This is the type of movie that gives the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end of the once terrible Freddie. Too sad to see him now. Clown, this is not funny. Bad joke Goodbye Freddie.
