“Cement” is a bad film about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and bad temper, who has a bad guy in a bad mood before their Cajons in quick-drying concrete. While we wait for the cement to dry, and the film finds out what it is about, we periodically go back in time without rhyme and reason so that we can observe the events leading to the cement thing. The dull flick of trash in general, “Cement” suffers from a lack of history, an awkward execution, and this most ubiquitous of cinema flaws; no cause for concern. At best, the killer of needy onion potatoes. (D +)
