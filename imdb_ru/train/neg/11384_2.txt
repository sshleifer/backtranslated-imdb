From about the time when Europe began the fight against World War II, until the end of the war, Hollywood (with considerable support from the government) made tons of films designed to try to get young people to join the army, making life. The servicemen look "cool" . This is by far the most casual, implying that the life of a soldier is deprived of work, you get the best food, and you can sit back all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I am too young to participate in World War II, but I think it was more than that. The plot sounds the most daring cat tricks, as well as many musical numbers, which feature some of the main roles of the day. <br /> <br /> I think that by 1943 even the most naive civilians knew that there were still a lot of events ahead. abroad than the wacky jokes pictured in this movie. Although I am sure that this should have been regarded as escapist entertainment, I cannot help but wonder if the family and loved ones of the people who fought in the war were surprised or repelled by this trivialization of the victims of their loved ones.
