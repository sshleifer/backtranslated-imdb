- Newlyweds are moving to the house of the deceased ex-wife of her husband. Soon, the new wife gets the feeling that someone does not want her in the house. She sees the skull around the house. But when the husband investigates, he cannot find anything. Is someone trying to take her back to the shelter from which she was recently fired? Or is the ghost of a dead wife trying to pull a new wife out of her house? <br /> <br /> - For the first time, I watched Screaming Skull without the help of the MST3K team. And, in all likelihood, this will be the last time I look at it this way. Can you say boring? I say not just boring - I say, as the grass grows dull. There are large sections of the film where nothing happens. The screen could go out, and I would get so much entertainment from it. Characters constantly buzzing in the most monotonous conversations. "Screaming skull" can probably be sold as an assistant in a dream. <br /> <br /> - Actors are of little help. Most of them provide lines of conviction, usually reserved for playing in elementary school. I didn’t watch it, but I’d be shocked to find that anyone associated with this film has ever appeared in something cinematic. I will not even go into the script with which the actors have to work. Let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever spoken in the movie. <br /> <br /> - you have been warned! Either avoid it at all costs, or at least find the version of MST3K.
