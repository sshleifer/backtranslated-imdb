This movie is terrible! I do not even know where to start, I have no words, I can not even describe how terrible it is. Blood is primarily fluorescent, and the game is terrible! The only good part was the biker chick that saves the day. This film was funny, I do not see how he could get 1 vote, it's so bad. Looks like it was done by high school students.
