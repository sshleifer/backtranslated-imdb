I watched this movie because I noticed that Kari Ukhrer was in it. I have already had a theory about her for a long time that she is a talented actress, but it seems to me that I couldnâ€™t prove it because she always plays in a low-budget film. She is still beautiful, and she is still trying to deal with the unfortunate material in which I always see her. This is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but it does not help. George Wendt played against the type, and it was so unpleasant that he received recognition for his role. Another note about Ms. Vuhrer. It seems her breasts have visibly shrunk since I last saw her. Perhaps a reduction in surgery or (more likely) removal of implants. This is a good thing. She still looks great. I would like to see her in the best movie.
