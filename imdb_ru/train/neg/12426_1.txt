Whoever thought that OTHER film “Home Alone” would be a good idea, you need to study his head ... The same story, another child, more villains (which leads to MORE infinite nonsense in traps) The other two films were bad enough, and this is where it reached the limit. People can also watch other films for the plot, since they are all identical.
