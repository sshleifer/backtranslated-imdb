In the entire low-budget history. this film must be one of the worst. True, there are some humorous sides of the film, but on the whole it was just awful. I just can not understand what kind of person could not run a bunch of slugs. I mean, they must be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only role in this film is the attempt of the slugs to bite the finger of a man. That was pretty funny.
