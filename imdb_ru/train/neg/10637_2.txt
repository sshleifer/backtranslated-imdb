Sorry I bought this series. I expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. It’s just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm or romanticism, it’s just boredom itself. I think that the actors work rather poorly. O'Donnell may seem as charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this photo he lacks charm. Probably, when he gets older, he loses his childish charm, but does not acquire the charm of an adult. Not surprisingly, it was not shown in many countries and is sold in the UK at 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.
