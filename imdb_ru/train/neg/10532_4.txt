Madison is not so bad - if you like the simplified, not offensive, “family” fare and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited seaplane races. If, like me, you grew up in sports, and your heroes had such names as Monsoon, Mansi, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., Get ready for disappointment. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics commented in detail on the characteristic character of the film and its tendency to use every punched sports cliche in the book. I don't need to repeat what they said. Unfortunately, I felt that I lacked some kind of sensation from the real excitement of endless hydro racing in the “glory years” (as many claim that they had already passed in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was great to see old classic boats thundering down the course of six in a row, although it was clear that the restored versions (hats for volunteers at the Hydroplane Museum and racing boats) swept through scenes with reduced speed. But where was the sound? Much of the thrill of old hydraulic systems was the stunning roar of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, wound on revolutions that their designers never anticipated, hitting the starting line right in front of you. You did not hear it, you felt it. Real hydrophobic people know exactly what I'm talking about. In Madison, this is nothing. Instead, each racing scene is buried under what should be a “heroic” musical accompaniment. <br /> <br /> And then there are close-up shots of drivers who ride in the cabs smoothly and comfortably, as if they were resting in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases taking time to smile wickedly, thinking about how best to prevent the poor the hero of his native city. Or, in one particularly ridiculous frame, take the time to see Jake Lloyd giving the Rocky a salute from the pier of the bridge. In fact, some unlimited drivers wore body armor to minimize the bumps they experienced when boats hit rocky water at speeds above 150 miles per hour. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer said aptly: “Sport deserves better than this. "<br /> <br /> Finally, as another user raised anachronisms, I’ll add one: the Kingdom and Safeco Field are shown when taking a Seattle snapshot. None existed in 1971
