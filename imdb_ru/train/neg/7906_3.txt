Not a knock at Korman, since he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show. He also played well minor characters in Mel Brooks films (“High Anxiety” is remembered). He is, however, not the same person who can carry the film in dueling roles no less. In fact, this is a fake "Gremlinov", following the tradition of such films as "Critters" and "Guli". This is not a very good fake, on par with "Ghoulies", but with a much lighter tone, since it is not as close as dark as this film received. In fact, it is too light and frothy, and, unfortunately, many jokes end in failure. Although I gave her 3 points, this is only because there is a film that is even worse than Gremlin. If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know the one I'm talking about ... the infamous Hobgoblins. This one has a guy who finds a small animal in some underground place (I saw this movie only once, so I don’t remember everything to the end), and it starts quite friendly. However, this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and, of course, more appears, and this is a film. There are more blunders than hits in the joke department, and it's also very bad to see Corman playing the role of an evil brother. You better skip this one, but then you can check it only for strikes.
