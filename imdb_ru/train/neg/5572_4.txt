Another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to fight each other. This time, time travelers from the future arrive in 1992 and recruit several people to return with them in 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thereby saving future Japan from destruction. But having completed this task, the time travelers turned out to be a group of double crossovers, whose own being goes into a rage, and without Godzilla to stop it ?? Ik! It all sounds very stupid, and perhaps it is, but the plot is surprisingly decent, and the final battle also looks good. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just rubbish, not nice rubbish, and the film is just as boring as its predecessors. Pay attention to the shaky Spielberg joke.
