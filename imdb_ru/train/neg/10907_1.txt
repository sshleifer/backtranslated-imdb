I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I liked. However, this dirt seemed to last forever. This is one of those films in which the sad arrangement of PG-13 is not suitable for children. Jokes are not just obscene or joking jokes, they are rude, obscene, and many actions cross borders not only with bad taste, but also with legal and moral decentness. Many scenes seem to have been split to get a PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it could get a bigger splash, like a movie with an R rating if the funny movie stayed. (Oversize? Probably.) I do not recommend this film. It's a waste of time ... and I'm a movie buff and ready to do anything. At the 45th minute it seemed like the film was supposed to end ... and we were ready for it. The end is strange, but it does not save the rest of this chatter / tourist rental trap. 1/2 stars (glad that I took it as a freebie ... it would be disgusting to pay hard-earned dollars for this scar)
