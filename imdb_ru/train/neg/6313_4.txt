Well, it's not often that we have a film in the UK about life in the city center from the point of view of the Afro-Caribbean community. The last example I can remember is the underestimated Babylon back in the 1980s. So I had great expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a film that was advertised as the British version of La Haine! Well, La Hein is not like that! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives authenticity to this film, which has been missed in other British films lately, but Iâ€™m concerned that this film predictably ends sadly. <br /> <br /> The film reasonably considers the escalation of the problem of violence against blacks on a black background, unfortunately, is widespread in London, but I am concerned that filmmakers now use casting in the plot, and not characters who cause the same harm. Saul Dibba had a great opportunity to make a film that could be interesting and inspiring for all of us, but unfortunately missed and created a film that only confirms the idea that for a young black man in London the only future is violence and tragedy.
