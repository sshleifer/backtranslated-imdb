What can I say? I think I should write “Spoiler Alert” and then “reveal” that they used the F-word MANY in this film - as in every two sentences. I did not like this film at all - too many hints of sexual perversions, detours and fraud. And this curse was completely outside the window. I gave this film "3", and two of these points are for the sexual movements of Mira Sorvino on the dance floor.
