An exceptionally unfunny musical comedy that artificially tries to combine an ultramodern rock and roll blast with a sense of middle class suburban comedy. The result is a terribly outdated mish-month, which will not satisfy any of the audience who went to music, but at least will not leave parents indifferent. <br /> <br /> A quick look at the promotional article on the back of the video release should give some insight into the content. Tom Ewell is a drunken agent, replayed with such a small comic ability that you almost expect him to say: “Hello, dear, I'm home!” In the video, it sounds like this: “So funny in 7 year old itch”. It almost sounds like an excuse. What other movie will sell itself on the fact that the lead player was good at something else? It sounds like this: "So funny in the" 7-year-old itch "... but in this he is rubbish." <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a beautiful girl with 50-inch hearing assets, unfortunately, is a profitable Monroe basement with all the acting skills and a ridiculous time of rotting haddock. Her delivery of wood in combination with double doubles Ewell make comedy partnership from hell. For his part, the sale gives us: “[Jane Mansfield], whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the film’s greatest laughter!” As you can see, a movie sold on the idea that his lead has a big chest is not the most difficult thing. Most of this “humor” is made up of men who literally fall on themselves, their glasses are cracking at the site of Mansfield, etc. Only the Freudian nightmare of a crowded bottle of milk questions her “U” certificate. <br /> <br /> For the musical side, most adenine players are selected. Would you really like to see Eddie Fontaine's proposal: “I love your eyes, I love your lips, they taste even better than potato chips” in a song called “Cool It, Baby”? Only the fiery Little Richard breaks free of the MOR, although he has to sing some of his more father-friendly songs in a four-minute sequence. And why do all acts sing without a single microphone? Attempts of satire in the industry are broad and childish in their concept. <br /> <br /> Technically, the picture was fairly advanced, with special effects (including ghostly Julie London) and gorgeous color (which now looks flat and artificial. In fact, with its red colors that bleed and look like artificial skin tones, it resembles colored film). The direction, however, is not outstanding, and the sound quality is also rather poor. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fact is that he is so old. At a time when men were still smoking on the screen, sickeningly cute child actors were making remarks for adults, and black servants could only cook and dance. (All that is happening here). However, “Some like it hotter”, “The African Queen”, “Ben Hur” and many, many others are examples of films from that period that can be enjoyed today, so the “good at that time” argument doesn't really stand up to criticism . In essence, “The Girl Cannot Help” This is a cynical and patronizing enterprise that is not subject to close scrutiny. 4/10. <br /> <br />
