I don't know what Margaret Atwood thought, so that this film had the same name as her book. I have always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn that there is a film in the film. I know that translating a book into a movie is not perfect, but this film was the worst. The names of women are true, and some pre-histories are true, but that is all. I feel that I have lost much of my time trying to get through this movie. It really should have been a mini-series telling the story the way it was written. <br /> <br /> Actors for Rose, Tony, Haris and Zenia were well chosen, although at first I was skeptical of Mary Louise Parker. I just wish they had the best script for the job, because it really had nothing to do with the book.
