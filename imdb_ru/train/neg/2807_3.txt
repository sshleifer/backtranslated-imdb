Michael Callan plays a smart photographer, who, nevertheless, considers the ideal "booty" of any woman who encounters him; Could this have anything to do with the fact that he is also co-producing the film? He is a “hero” with whom it is very difficult to empathize, therefore the film has problems from the very beginning. However, the problems do not end there. He has the production values ​​of a television film (note that the head is made of clay or something else, near the end), and the final cheats, which I cannot reveal if someone wants to watch the film hardly). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we are allowed to know that he knows. (* 1/2)
