I don't know ... maybe because I'm Brazilian, but it was all too much. Too much love for music, too many parties, too much contrast between the sweet life of the main characters (well, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything seems too unreal to me: family, relationships, music, "happiness." It just sells a little taste of fake Latin American culture. I have to be honest: it seduced me a little, but who would not be seduced by these fake lives made of good music, sex and parties? I'm not so stupid: what is this world in which people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness and STDs? I liked the scene with my mother's call Caridad and the discussion of the contract with all the musicians and the Spaniards.
