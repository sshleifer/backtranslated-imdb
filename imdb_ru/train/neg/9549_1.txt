I wondered why John Wood did not play Dr. Falken until he watched the movie. Bad story, bad science, bad game, and generally a bad movie. Please do not watch this movie. Rent the original “War Games” if you are nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I also didn’t like the twist of the plot to defeat the idea of ​​the threat of terrorism. In the first film, W.O.P.R was built because in Russia thousands of American warheads were aimed at the United States. In this film, the idea of ​​a computer was to kill the terrorists in training before they became a threat. In addition to politics, one of the merits of the first film was that even a stupid computer could eventually understand the idea of ​​the senselessness of war. There is no such understanding in this film.
