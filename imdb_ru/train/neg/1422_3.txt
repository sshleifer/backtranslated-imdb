The original series of novels by Lensman is a classic of the genre. This is pure adventure fiction with some substance (here and there), and I always wondered why Hollywood didn't shoot it literally, because it's just what they love: massive explosions, super weapons, super heroics, the hero gets girl, aliens (big CGI potential), good against evil in its purest form, etc., etc. Instead (and keep in mind that I am a fan of Japan and anime) we get this terrible film about children that tears up the guts of history are mixed in Star Wars (ironically, when the latter from time to time disrupts from a book) smoothes and dulls it all to the level of "Thundercats". Seeing Kimball Kinnison, the incarnation of the officer of the Galactic Patrol and Lancemann second stage, depicted as a little boy, is a pity (and so on). I just can not understand why the creators did this, because they obviously had the rights to the story and could earn much more money (FAR!) By telling it directly. It makes no sense.
