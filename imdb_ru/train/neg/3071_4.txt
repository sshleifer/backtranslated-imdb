I found the characters mediocre, and the story is uninteresting. I never had to read this book (fortunately), otherwise it would have been a painful experience. I got the preview tickets for free, but it still didn't cost either my time or my friend's time. I think this story is not worth telling. It is the same as saying that old people have a past to old age (no joking). It was painful to watch the lives of the main characters, one generation is no better than the other, avoiding silly mistakes. However, I think the actors did their best with a bad story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to counter the positive feedback I received, which unfortunately convinced me to try this movie.
