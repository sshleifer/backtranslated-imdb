The competition for the worst movie Warner Bros Kay Francis is very tough. I have only seen eight of them, but “Comet over Broadway” is still the worst. The best thing about it is that it is short. Yes, and Orry-Kelly dresses (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis looks fat everywhere and much less attractive than usual. Minna Gombell, whom I don’t know otherwise, is good as a semi-rigid burlesque dancer (more like a fashion show than a burlesque). The final shot - Kay Francis and her child (when the child found out that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I doze off?), Walking along the muddy path to the prison, painted in hazy outlines on a sound fall, is incredibly funny. The whole movie is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by sour cynicism from everyone who made it: Warner Bros throws up rubbish delirium that doesn't know, according to a cynical assessment of Warner Bros, that they get what they get, it's rubbish.
