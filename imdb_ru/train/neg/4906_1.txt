Well, I do not know where to start. Obviously, this was done for a television film, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but everything that happened before or after that looked like a picture in movies with numbers. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry between amateur detectives. .. <br /> <br /> I would go deeper, but this film does not deserve it. Rating: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
