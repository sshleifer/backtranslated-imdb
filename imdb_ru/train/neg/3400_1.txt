This film is smug trash. Watch this movie if you just want to hear conversational Gaelic or enjoy a pleasant soundtrack. See for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming, but not so - it is just annoying. It's hard to take care of the characters, but the game is bad. The stories in the film are also harmless and sinister. I was expecting a heartbreaking family film, but it also did not attract my fourteen-year-old daughter. Rarely can I not see the film before it is completed, but this film overpowered us both. <br /> <br /> Although the film is currently unfolding, it looks like a cheap East European film shot during the Cold War. Even the beautiful Scottish landscapes and cinematography are not enough to buy them back. A real shame, because like a movie itâ€™s an embarrassment for Scotland.
