The name must be a walker. The guy spends 90% of the movie for a walk. He does not know what he wants or who he is. Go through life, stealing people's identity for nothing. He gets no benefit, no money, nothing, pretending to be another person. <br /> <br /> No one could understand why he pretended to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing in this film was that he loved his father and was a good son. But the rest was crap. <br /> <br /> Maybe the director is a loser who would like to be someone else. But what he really needs to do is get a real job, because after his film I donâ€™t think he has a chance to become a film director.
