“The Trigger Man” is by far the most boring and most stupid film I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are more exciting. <br /> <br /> Actors seem to be recruited on uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act convincingly. <br /> <br /> They walk, walk and walk through the forest. There are more walks here than in all three parts of The Lord of the Rings together. After the first hour, I started reading the Porsche brochure, watching the "Trigger Man" along the way. Awful. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of time and money. I would give this film 0 stars out of 10, since this is impossible, I have to give 1 star.
