I begin to see a sample in the films I give 1. These are almost all the films my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop believing in her taste in the movie. In any case, this is typical nonsense, aimed at teenage girls, but done even worse than usual. Once again, the writer has broken the basic rule of any film. He / she made the protagonist unattractive. First, she becomes a complete friend for a friend, and then, when she turns 30, she finds out that she is basically a stupid person (has affairs, etc.). Why f we will feel to this person? Well, let's say we can get through this. Jennifer Garner is as attractive as possible without any deformities. I do not know whether she is guilty or the writer, but her character goes beyond my threshold of irritation. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are NOT entertaining, they are annoying. Far and away the most embarrassing moment in the film came when they danced in “Thriller”. Holy crap, it hurt. This showed that she practiced this dance in the beginning. This explains why she knows this, but a whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! Macarena would be more believable! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job, and no one notices? At the very least, Tom Hanks character in the “Big” had a job that made sense for the child. These films about body changes / how a child becomes an adult overnight, really get out of control, and this is still the worst option.
