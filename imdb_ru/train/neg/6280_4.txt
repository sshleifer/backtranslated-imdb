Have you ever thought that it would be a good idea to make a film: how to watch a detective watching cracks in a broken fence of an abandoned house? Or see a woman walking down a street that looks cold, tense and terribly vigilant? Yeah. Imagine that you are stretching this image to the whole film, you have the idea of ​​"Broken", although there are no detectives in this film, I just use it as a good example. But the woman has an intense look here, and she took up almost 99% of the screen time. I have nothing to complain about this woman, she is the perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very open-minded person who can enjoy all kinds of artistic expression, and I can really enjoy some really naughty stuff. It would be great if I could shoot one of the scenes from this film and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest, the acting is great. Some of the expression on the face of the actors - that is what makes me look. <br /> <br /> Now about the problem of this film. In addition to the mood, there is nothing more. The director basically took the idea of ​​the obsession and gave her much more than it cost. I do not think this is a spoiler, if I say that obsession is a "mirror". Let's face it, this unusual idea is everywhere in a bloody place, and that’s all that the director has to work with. Of course, there are several turns here and there. If you noticed, in the end, nothing will surprise you, except for the obvious holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Now I don’t collect bones with this style of art, since I enjoyed them most of the time. I still believe that we must judge the basis of art, which it uses to express what artists want to express. A film is not a piece of music, not a picture, not a picture, not even a poem, and, of course, not just a cool image in your mind. That's all, plus a good story and character development. I consider the lynching style a lynch fraud. It is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of medium. We gave the movie 2 hours in a row for cinematic time for a good reason. Therefore, we have to judge it differently than to judge one frame of image, such as a photograph or a picture. <br /> <br /> This film is not quite in the style of Lynch, thank God. He has a linear development and eventually came to the conclusion. He has no particular history or character development. He quite seriously showed himself with characters made up of ordinary people, thus distancing himself from other fantasy things, at least from the surface. He does not offer any explanation for the element of fantasy and never tried to build a holistic world around him. Strangeness arose from nowhere and seems rather isolated and random. Perhaps the consistency remains in the director's head, but, as far as I can see, he did not put much effort into putting it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Where did he put his efforts then? He seems to have spent a lot of effort on creating a mood and improving it with music. Music often created tension that eventually turned into a tease. Only in the later part of the film did panic and tension materialize. <br /> <br /> In the end, I felt that: “Well, I know what you are trying to say here, but is that what you are trying to do by spending two hours creating all this tension? It has nothing to do with who the characters are and what their life is like. And we are told very little about who the characters are. All that we have is a circumstance that just happened. It is disappointing, but I think that the director did not have a lot of material to work with, and it shows.
