I like the time period, I like the attempt, but watching a movie that looks like Iâ€™m watching it through a bottle of Coke makes me a headache. If I played computer games that were so blurry and out of focus, I would update my computer. Maybe it was a look like the one after the director, but not so much that it hurt the eyes, and you want to leave in 10 minutes. If I hadn't taken someone with me to this film, I would be from there. Despite the fact that it was a series, not a film, let's say, a group of brothers achieved this. They made it look like the frames of the Second World War, with a slight hint of grain, but it was still nice to look at it. Movies are needed by real people, with real sets and real locations; Use CGI when appropriate, not for the entire movie.
