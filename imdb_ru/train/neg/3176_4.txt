The lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her up to "I'm doing" with the bride Henry (Paul Rudd) Two years later, Henry had not left, and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloan) is very concerned. Chloe agrees with Henry to speak with attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley should get in touch with Kate's spirit, hoping to help Henry continue his life. When the psychic begins to attract to Henry, the ghost of Kate appears to nip the romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you saw the trailers, you saw the essence of the movie. Also in the cast: Stephen Ruth, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendy McLendon-Covey. I personally thought that Bell stole the show from Parker. And Biggs has his ass as usual. Nevertheless, this film was over-promoted.
