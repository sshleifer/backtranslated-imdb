I wonder why someone is trying to rephrase the successful plots of films that have already been seen, as is the case with this film? “Wedding Date” is one of the best examples of why not even try to remake under the guise of a new story what should be left alone. If such a project is approved by a big studio hongcho, then do your best with big stars and brilliant production values, so that people will come for the stars. <br /> <br /> Alas, this is not what happens in this mistaken comedy attempt. It seems that the problem lies in how the scriptwriters transferred this story to London, when, in fact, this is a typical American situation that even the setting cannot fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since Kat and Nick do not conflict from the very beginning, the viewer does not get involved in the film as its creators thought. It is clear that Kat will fall in love with Nick, and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in Junbag, looks like a shallow girl who wants to continue her lies and will not be pure to a man who loves her and is going to marry her. <br /> For those who are interested, loans at the end of the film work for almost seven minutes!
