I may have missed the meeting when they explained the meaning of the B-movie, but what I just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good synopsis of this film? Take the aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove all that was good, and that is all. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes of the film “V-SAN squad” (this is the dumbest abbreviation I've ever heard) checks the “base” that the vampires killed, and then they go down (DOWN? What?) clearly attached to a billboard with an obvious modern train in the background. When should this happen? 2210. Well ... (wait, I'll come back to this) <br /> <br /> Yes. characters Wow, well, these are iconic Asian lesbians, a mean cowboy-imitator, a weathered captain, a goth vampire / cashier in combination with the Hot Topic and a second-best newcomer to the team. They all play their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. It was almost painful to see Michael Ironside in this film. Doesn't he get enough money being Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cell? Virtually the only original thing about Vampire Wars is how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Watching this latest film, the only pleasure I received was from weak attempts at creating scenery. Since when are sticky PCI computer cards on the wall considered to be a finished room on a spaceship? The money needed to make this film could have been used much better.
