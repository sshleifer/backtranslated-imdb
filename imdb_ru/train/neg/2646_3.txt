When someone gets into a movie of this type, it is possible that an overdose of this great over-the-counter drug for the brain “Suspension of Unbelief” turns out to be very useful. <br /> <br /> Janette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Bridgette, a woman whom Nelson Eddie has ignored since time immemorial, but which is also an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw that it was a dumb sigh, "Hun?" Where have I seen this before? It turns out that I saw it before, but in a film that was shot much later than this one. DATE WITH ANGEL, an unforgettable heap of a dragon, made in 1987, naked in the ethereal beauty of a certain Emmanuel Beart, who had no lines of speech, also wore a bright wig and made life hellish actor Michael Knight. Much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra-low values ​​of the 80s, but, most likely, with an updated version of this turkey in 1942. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you don’t go into details, this is not a memorable film, and it is standing in front of the door information, because it was the last time that MacDonald and Eddie were not very good actors, but amazing singers , played together in "innocence" and "pure" novel, which they were known for. After that, you may need a cold shower, not because there are some paired scenes, but to get rid of the memory.
