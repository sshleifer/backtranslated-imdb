I am stunned that @ IMDb reviewers gave this television film as much appreciation as they did. This is a harmless, sweet, uncomplicated cliché of the film, in which there were two loud last names from the past (both of which did a decent job), but this film smells like low-budget work that we can see on any day of the week on smaller cable channels. I like a good novel, like everyone else, but since my wife and I watched it - and before we saw the rating - we said: "There are people who are going to rate this film too high simply because there is nothing in it" to challenge them brain, their faith, their level of comfort or their cultural preferences. You can make a good film in this way (and “Away from Her” is an example), but it was an amateur hour. There are some pretty good films rated much lower than this one. Truly, another in a long line of terribly inadequate holiday films. See the Stone of Last Name. He is far ahead of this castle.
