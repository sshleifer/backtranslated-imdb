In the first case, these were mostly giant rats, but there were wasps and a giant chicken. This, however, is just a gigantic period of the rat, well gigantic rats and one really growing little boy. This story is about this growing boy and scientist who is trying to help him, so he accidentally creates giant killer rats ... you know how it is. This film has some murders and its moments, but I find it on par with the original, I just prefer a bit of variety in my films about giant creatures. Well, it's not like that ... I really like The Empire of Ants, maybe I just don't give a damn about giant rodents. In general, a rather boring film, although there is one rather strange turn of events in this single sequence of dreams, which is really strange. I just can't recommend it.
