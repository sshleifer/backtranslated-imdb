This is a very strange film ... I was not sure what was going on. Some Londoners from London find a dumb child in the forest, who, they all think, is a kind of oracle and somehow makes them all in its own way. change something in your life that usually ends in disaster. The film ended in about 90 minutes, and I felt completely unsatisfied, almost irritated by the senselessness of all this. I was not worried about any of the characters - none of them had a chance to please the viewer. <br /> <br /> What is this message? Am I dim? It was too weird. What happens to the runner? Why does Emilio shoot a child? ... it made no sense, meaningless. Can someone help me understand this mess of the movie?
