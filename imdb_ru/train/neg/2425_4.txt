### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What does this movie offer? Out of control editing and cinema, which coincides with a terrible plot. It's sad to see Denzel Washington's talents get lost in rubbish like this one. We are certainly hinting that the Mexicans cannot save themselves, they need external forces, perhaps military, American ones. And we know that the father is a shadow character, after all, he is a Mexican, unlike his wife, who appreciates Chrissie more, because he is American. He killed them all, thinking that she was dead. And she? Of course, she will not, she is a young child, and you should not hurt the feelings of a Hollywood fan. The only thing that prevented me from assessing it below “improbably successful” (as one of the critics noted) “Taken” was the only thing that was unavailable. The nausea of ​​such films will take time to go. It is in the rating of such films that we must doubt the accuracy of IMDb.7.7 for a film like this, and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure it out! Mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
