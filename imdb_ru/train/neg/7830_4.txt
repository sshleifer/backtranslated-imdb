Until now, Nightmares and Dreamscapes have been strange and disappointing. The first episode, directed by Brian Henson, may have given little in terms of innovative stories or real fright, but at least it was well-directed, intense and visually interesting, with a solid play by William Hert and very impressive special effects for the mini-series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was just awful, and not for the better. The scenario is bad, requiring small, unsightly protagonists to act illogically to move the plot, and force the characters to wander endlessly for clumsy, unnecessary exposure. The acting was overdone and unconvincing, and I felt much more sympathy for the cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlyweds in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make the story look like a ghost, but with an amateur acting and script, the end result looks like a cinema school project for beginners, with camera movement for himself, and a little in terms of plot. or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues, I will be very disappointed. I look forward to installments of William H. Macy, and I hope that he will get a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is too controversial to predict in any way.
