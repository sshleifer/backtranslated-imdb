It doesn't matter what someone tells you, there is a word “obsession” in the films, for example “what made you make this film green?” Religion has nothing to do with it, but it has common sense. That is, if you have a clear head and you are in your right mind to judge. <br /> <br /> At many levels I tried to justify where this movie will entertain .... or even interest the average consumer. Star? Story? Unique idea? A nice movie that kids love with a dinosaur and a black woman? Oh my God! I'm sure that when it was an “idea,” it sounded good. But somewhere in the development process ... someone had to indicate where the idea could not be turned into an entertainment program for which someone would want to see or pay ... unless they are experiencing the profound influence of alcohol or drugs and saw what others could not see. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is a complete mess. Disorder, confusion is sin and disorder. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (which plot?), and others. Whoopi got a salary, but I would be ashamed to take it. I very much hope that she fired her agent / manager / publicist for this career step. Obviously not, she continued to make more bad films. And bad movies. Sad.
