-SPAILES - Lame south of the border adventure film, which is somehow connected with the blackmailing of Rosenlsky, a large cooperative leader, President of Unasco Inc., who lives on a beach lamb David Ziegler on his beach. House in Cancun, Mexico. Having this CD, which he gave to his brother James, he spent three years on the phone between Rosensky and the President of the United States involved in criminal transactions. This disc gave David an edge over the international gangsters who are pursuing him. <br /> <br /> The fact that James is getting a little greedy, trying to loosen Rosenlsky for 2 million diamonds, not only cost him his life, but also put him at risk of losing him. Ropsensky wants to negotiate a CD with David, forcing his ex-wife Liz to talk to him about leaving him, Rosnellsky made a deal to pay off his debts if she comes. Later, David was killed by the Mexican killer Rosenlyski Tony, with the help of a great white shark, which simply does not deal with all these peaceful matters on the part of his boss. <br /> <br /> Tony took the CD that Liz had left to her boss at the local hotel safe, and now wants to kill James, as he did with David, and at the same time keep the disc in order to have something over Rosenlsky. <br /> <br /> David, who secretly hid the diamonds that James had at the time of his assassination, is now the goal of Tony and his men to stop him forever. David also wants to take the diamonds and at the same time create an impression from his boss Rozenly that the disk that David had was lost, but later I will use it so that Rosenlsky does not know who is behind it to blackmail him. <br /> <br /> In the movie “Night of Sharks” there are many shark attacks with this huge one-eyed white shark, which eventually kills about half a dozen actors, including Tony. David, who firmly believes in gun control, uses high-explosive knives and Molotov cocktails, as well as fists, to destroy Tony’s entire team. Tony even killed a killer shark, but with a hunting knife, not with a gun. When it came to using firearms to save his friend and partner Paco, Juanita's girlfriend and his priest Father Mattia live from Tony, and his gangster weapon was no-no with David; he was more of a man with a knife and spear than anyone else. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was as predictable as it could be when David thought he was killed by a one-eyed shark that later emerges from the crowd after Rosenlesky was convinced that he was dead and leaving the village. David continues his life as a freedom-loving and loving beach trader, and no one wants to kill him, and another two million dollars richer. to David's credit, he had his friend Paco give Rosensky his CD, but on the condition that if something happened to him, his cousin, who Rosenles does not know who and where he is, will shoot his big mouth and let know the whole world. about his dirty and criminal cases.
