I won't spend too much time here, just want to say that Darkman 3 is cool. I have all three on a DVD, I added them to my collection of DVD movies. The dark man gets there with the best, such as Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die Hard, you understand. There's not so much good horror, thriller. Many thanks to the whole team and for giving us the trilogy about the Dark Man. By the way, if you're wondering how I came across this on a DVD. I purchased it over the Internet, but this is Region 4, because, as you know, most DVD players in the USA belong to Region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player, as this is a player for all regions . Simply go to the setting and select the desired setting for the region of the witch (1-9).
