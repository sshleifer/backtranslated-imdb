As a young Latina, I am always looking for films that reflect the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie in the video store, I thought I would like it; Unfortunately, I did not. Although the themes presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story simply was not properly developed. The film continued to drag on, and many of the characters appearing on the screen just come and go without much contribution to the overall film. If the director did a better job connecting the scenes, maybe I would like it. Honestly, I would recommend such a film as Victor Resurrection on this day. I just wasn't too impressed.
