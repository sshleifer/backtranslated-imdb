God, I'm so tired of the shit that comes out of America called "Cartoons"! <br /> <br /> Since the anime became popular, American animators either create a cartoon with a 5-year-old lazy ass drawing style (kappa jerseys) or some cheap Japanese animation plagiarism. (Usually spoil the classic characters). No wonder anime beats American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They donâ€™t even try anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about it last night; I live in the UK, and when I found out that this show first came out in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was so modern with current shows.
