This film insults ALL submariners. That was stupid. Looks like it was written by monkeys. The game was absurd. If this is the opinion of most people in the fleet, then I mourn our defense. This movie was terrible. I put it below "Journey to the bottom of the sea" as far as underwater films go. Gene Hackman must have really needed a rent to do this shit. Denzel Washington must have been tall. Little in the plot makes sense. And the ending. For a rebel to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would have thought about this garbage. If you have not understood, I did not like it. And if it were not for all the pro-comments, I would not post.
