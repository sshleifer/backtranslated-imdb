How low can someone fall, trying to regain the old glory? ST: HF will be glad to show you. <br /> <br /> If you are used to seeing what is done for a good Star Trek show, do NOT watch it. <br /> <br /> Writing written specifically for you. - the pillow, the images of the actors of their characters are weak, and, above all, the design work is just a dog. <br /> <br /> How to watch strong captains, do not look here! Like the strong attitude of the Federation? Forget it here! Starfleet mocks the ensigns, wearing SPIKI in their hair. <br /> <br /> While the captain seems to be mentally unstable, he shuffles and, within two minutes after the opening of the first show, Ensign Spikey tries to arrange a meeting with an engineer. It just gets worse from there. No, not even outfit, for God's sake. They are too small or too large, collars to chests, and the TNG uniform of the first and second seasons mixed with the third season uniform and DS9. Strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals are missing from this product right down to the steps! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve with each season. Well, I take it back. Who uses CG, which is inexperienced? Designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Don't worry, it will offend your sense of Star Trek, just like mine. This catastrophe will not save even throw back to previous shows. <br /> <br /> I cried openly when I watched it, perhaps because my eyes were bleeding and my head was almost bursting. This is bad.
