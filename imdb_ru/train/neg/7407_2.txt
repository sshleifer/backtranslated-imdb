The first viewing is 06.06.2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Deer-Pete Risks): A strange psychotic film about a girl with autism, who is being tested in a hospital, strength shimmers, and then all hell falls apart. I'm honestly not sure what the intentions of the directors were this time. What we get for the next hour and a half (at least not longer) was a perverted horror / twilight film / zombies / ghost movie that really had no meaning even to the very end. Initially, after a power outage, everyone disappeared in the hospital, with the exception of a small group of losers, including the girl and his father. There is a typical annoying character, a creepy old man and a typical tough guy, similar to many frightening characters, and, of course, a young girl to whom the main character is drawn. Random things start to happen at different times, for example, ghosts and monsters appear, hinting that time has stopped, and dead people when this small group tries to escape from what they are in. Of course, the autistic girl is somehow the center of everything, and I really hate how they used this girlâ€™s illness and hinted that she was the cause, and put her in a hospital where people are cared for, really lame. We will never know the answer to what is happening, which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. If you do not want to be scared and confused for an hour and a half, this is not for you or any movie lover. What a waste of time ?? really !!
