Let's hope this is the last nightmare. This is the epitome of bad stuff. Well, there is still some pleasure, but only in the most ordinary sense. Rachel Talalay was there during this franchise, worked in manufacturing and even worked. I don’t know what she was thinking, but this debacle is complete with a man from a video game and a guest from <br /> <br /> Tom and Rosanna Arnold! I would like to have an idea of ​​what she thinks when she wrote / sent this disappointing piece of garbage. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this film was nothing more than a glorified movie about popcorn, instead of having some resemblance to horror with the skillful use of a 3D final. Are these glasses not elegant? And you can keep them! This is equivalent to just spending $ 9.00, making me rich. Here are 10 cents. Now, you don't feel special!? Sorry, but for me it just did not make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddie had another facelift. I think this one was the worst. All the fine workmanship that went into his “appearance” in earlier films was replaced by a decidedly cheaper, less detailed set of prostheses. He looks ... less like a burn victim, which he should be, and more like his skin disease. Thus, the change in the composition of the hero in the series is about the same level as the change of the main character. But wait! They did it, and they did it. So I guess it doesn't matter. But it mattered to me. Freddie is no longer scary. He's just ... another low rent monster, like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> This is more ... a dark comedy than the horror classic that this series promises; riddled with the fact that you can only hope that the authors thought that they were witty single-row and clever repartee (unfortunately, this did not correspond to both accounts). <br /> <br /> So there is nothing more to say than to take popcorn and get ready to laugh, because in this whole film there was not a single scary or disturbing moment. <br /> <br /> Rating 3.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
