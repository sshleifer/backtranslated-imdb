Well, I'll start by acknowledging that I am not a fan of John Ford. (I only watched Informer because I’m trying to go through the list of “great people.”) So, if so, just move forward, because you don’t agree with me. <Br /> <br /> What a perverse and outdated piece of stupidity! I will say that there is a good idea for the film (it made me think about how few films about the Irish revolution), but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury him under excessive action and cheap moods. I think it is interesting to watch for a while in order to see the not quite smooth transition that was made from silence to “walkie-talkie” - some of the directors' acting styles have this wide quality inherent in early films and films really look like they can play better with title cards than conversational dialogues. (Of course, title cards would not allow Ford to renew each emotion six times.) In some dialogue, they usually say, "They are always with me, happy enchantments!" own version of irish accent. Of course, no matter how bad they are, accents help us remind us that we are in Ireland, because the scenery basically looks as if they were dragged from some kind of German expressionist who is being filmed in the next sound scene. (It feels like you can see some of the villagers set fire to Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) <br /> <br /> The methods are changing. Tastes change. So I will not dwell on how crazy this film seems, which was so popular in its time. But this is not a classic that stands up, but simply an “honest warning” that the overly simplistic malaria, to which Ford was going to devote his career.
