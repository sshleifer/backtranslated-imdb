The recipe for one of the worst films of all time: a male villain who looks like she ran away from WWF has a terrible target with a weapon that has conflicting effects (the first guy she shoots catches fire something else they just disappear) and takes time to stroke the deer. Then you got unattractive characters, 30-year-old college students, an unsuccessful attempt at an unexpected finale, and much, much more. Avoid at all costs.
