... so I decided to add a few words about William McNamara. A good way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in your panties - obviously, he is ready for this role and looks damn good at them - or less. In the cave there is an extended sequence, where he must undress to his underpants. There is a good moment when he must pursue Miss Eleniak in a positive mood, only his hands are groin-covered. William McNamara is naturally a bit thin, but he has a good, generous handful of loot. In addition, there is a moment when he gets out of bed, that if you stop the action at the right moment, you will be able to see the whole enchilada. If you are inclined to do this and so on, half of the people who decide to watch a film about the naval forces on a “road trip” are people. I just wanted to thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity and nude nudity. Can William McNamara Act? Gosh, if I know.
