I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson, who considered them buddies. They are, but Busey is at the opening, then does not appear again until after 40 minutes the film appears. Although every scene he is in is amazing. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind tramp. <br /> <br /> What is unbelievable in this film is the plot. In the film, Fred Williamson is trying to figure out who is stalking and killing the sex operatorâ€™s phone. At some point, I think this is his Busey. But it turns out that I am only partly right. Busey is not a murderer, but he calls and bothers women by telephone. What for? I dont know. He has nothing to do with the killer, I think he just does it for the sake of a kick.
