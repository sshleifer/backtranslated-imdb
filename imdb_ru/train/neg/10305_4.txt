As an engineer, I have to say that the first season of this show began very promising. Much of the applied mathematics was somewhat believable, and the relationship depicted between the Eppes brothers and the father gave the show an interesting advantage. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show began to deteriorate a lot. Most of the mathematics and technologies used in solving crimes are completely meaningless and very ridiculous with all people involved in science and technology in fact. <br /> <br /> The participation of the actors is still good, and I can imagine the amount of money still being spent on the production of each episode, but in the end it worsened to a very unpleasant-tasting dish, which is a mixture of action C and a CSI style cop show. <br /> <br /> If you watch it, go only in the first season and, possibly, in the second. After that, I would not waste my time. I myself gave a show in the middle of the season 3. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> Summing up to 4 stars, Since Charlie I no longer know my math, I will not worry about my own.
