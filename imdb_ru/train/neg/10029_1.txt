I had no idea what the film was about before I saw it, because Tashan had only commercials while he was advertised. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it, and they said that “This is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote the scripts for Dhoom 1 and 2, and Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim debuts in the film, playing it as a child in his memory. "<br /> <br /> After watching, I understood why it was not the right trailer, because there was nothing in the film that could be shown. The story was extremely stupid, and even 10-year-old the child could come up with a better storyline. There was hardly any action, and the camera shook under any Possible angle, and it’s hard to understand who is killing whom .Also the action was stupid and unreal, for example, 1 man managed to kill about 100 people with automatic pistols. <br /> <br /> While I watched Tashan, he reminded me of 3 films : <br /> <br /> Sin City: during the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Coila: the terrible English language of Anil Kapoor, such as Amrish Puri in Coyle. <br /> <br /> Jum Barabar Jom: incredibly funny jokes that aren't even funny. <br /> <I also heard that the budget is 40 crores, which equals Dhoom 2, and I don’t know where all the money went. In any case, if you do not like Dhoom 2, you have absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. The race was on the heels, and it is a million times better. <br /> <br /> Only two good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya, and both songs are shot in good places in Greece, but what is the use of this garbage film? Even the terrible English language of Anil Kapoor could not save this embarrassment.
