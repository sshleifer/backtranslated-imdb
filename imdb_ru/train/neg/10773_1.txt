I just watched this horrible thing on TV. Needless to say, this is one of those films that you watch, just to see how much worse it can become. Honestly, I do not know how much the bar will go down. <br /> <br /> Characters consist of one lame stereotype after another, and the obvious attempt to create another bad news bear confuses, to say the least. <br /> <br /> I At one time I saw several expensive turkeys, but there is no reason to list them, since this is “Numero Uno”. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about it like this, I watched the film Vanilla Ice because it was so bad, it was funny. This ... this ... is not even that good.
