This is the worst damaged brain, ultra cheap, super stupid, stupid, meaningless piece of trash that I have ever seen, incredible trash of instant cult status among fans of the strange. If you think Ed Wood's “Plan 9” is bad, well ... let me tell you, it looks like Citizen Kane compared to that. ¿Special effects? ... again, Plan 9 is Star Wars. Acting? ... Thor Johnson - Al Pacino ... so this is really bad. But if you are looking for such incredible films, this is for you! I’m an American International fan of many great horror films, the Price-Corman-Po saga and some great things about the blacktail, but with Star Beings, they go straight down to Z level. Of course, my 1 in 10 works the other way around if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing the Indian chief is great), have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
