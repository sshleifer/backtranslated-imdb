This film is very difficult to swallow the premise, even by the standards of this genre. We are asked to agree not only that the reproduction in the opposite direction can bring the dead person back to life, but also that the recording contains hidden messages specifically aimed at one child when the singer was not associated with the boy when he was alive. Of course, there is no way to find out from whose hand the recording will end. Anyway, the movie is funny for a while, but in the end, stupidity and meaninglessness begin to reign. If they really tried to create a new, horror-like icon of Freddie, they would be far away: the villain here does not have individuality, motivation or diversity. (* 1/2)
