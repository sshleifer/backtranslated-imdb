In a way, Mr. Fo (initially and more appropriately called “Hallam Fo”, I do not see his title character being called “Mr.”) is a tribute to a good game. And Jamie Bell, like Hellam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, and Sophia Miles, like Kate, his strange partner in sex and a fantasy novel, are convincing. The problem arises when you try to associate your roles with everything that happens in real life. A young man who follows the intimate details of people's lives, as Hallam does, would have been deservedly beaten to a pulp. And the woman in the situation of Kate will be repulsed and scared - she is likely to call the police. <br /> <br /> However, this is not what happens in the movies. The mother of poor Hallam died, and his father married a woman with whom he had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets him know. She has sex with him. Kate is a hired man who puts Hellam on a dishwashing job and plays sex games. She looks like his own mother. Everything ends well with the fact that Hallam "solves" his "problems". <br /> <br /> Forty years ago in the film “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf” (“Afraid of Virginia Woolf”) was the same optimistic ending when the characters became wiser. and better after breaking with each other. The problem is that it does not always work this way, especially when no one cares. In Virginia Woolf the ending is plausible due to the intensity of emotional revelation. Mr. Foe never has an emotional revelation.
