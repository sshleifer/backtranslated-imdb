There is only one thing I have to say about this film - the scene where Shaq plays in a music room with a Francis Capra character about wanting to be a genie; never watch this movie. The story is terrible, the acting is terrible (oh well, this is Shaq!), And I would prefer to see Capra in Free Willy (equally terrible) twice before I ever watched this movie.
