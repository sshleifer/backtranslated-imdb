This film was so ruthless that I could not believe that I was watching it. Directing, editing, production and screenplay - it all looked as if they were made by high school students who do not know much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sense. Great emotional moments and climaxes (as at the beginning of Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and the relationship of the characters (as hinted at the very beginning) are absolutely not from anywhere and are not created, as in a more elegant and effectively filmed movie. The characters, unfortunately, are underdeveloped, so it is difficult for us to have any connection with them. The game is surprisingly not entirely bad, but the terrible essay brings to naught relatively convincing performances. The film plays as a particularly bad T.V. western / epic, and, unfortunately, reduces the exciting (truthful) story he is trying to tell. I read many reviews that protect the film as important for Australians because of the subject matter. This is all very good, but only because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon does not make the film a good one. Nobody says that the theme is not very good, only the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was a very important historical event for Americans, but that doesn’t mean that I’m going to defend the film and say that it’s good because it’s still bad. Failure is everywhere, although Heath and Orlando are nice to look at.
