Just passed this weekend, I looked at “28 weeks later,” which was very good. After that, I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I have already told you that this is one of the most boring so-called horrors that you have ever seen. Scenes were unreal, there was no script and plot. The alien creature was unreal. And the scenes of the fight are soft compared to the fight in the schoolyard. Worse, the guy named Cody had an uncontrollable weak dirty language that distracted attention from the main film. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie; better go and see 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Greetings, Mesack S.
