This is really a rather strange film ... First, we have an ex-gymnast from the USA trying to become an actor (or something like that), and this seems to be the only role he ever received (which I know about any case) - and for good reason. Although he copes with the role well enough to maintain some interest, this is a rather soft and even view. Secondly, we have the MOST GOOD AUDIO sound effect ever used in the movie Iâ€™m not joking. This alone makes the film extremely comical, but in such an annoying way. hehe! And thirdly, as long as we have a generally decent cast, the cast (including the hot chick needed!) is actually a good story and some cool visual effects; dialogue, fighting scenes with the participation of gymnastics (funny!) and the overall execution of the plot are weak. This film would have been a little better than a film on network television (pity, Fox was not in 1985). This is one of those films that are just bad, but you can't stop watching or even enjoying it when you get used to it, especially now that he has found the perfect eternal home on late night television and cable television.
