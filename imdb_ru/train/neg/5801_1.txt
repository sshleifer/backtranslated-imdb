Ivan (Valery Nikolaev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the inexplicable. He goes to this small town where they say that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing society. <br /> <br /> His car stalls, he takes refuge in a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly she turns into a demon, and he kills her, and the city wonders who killed this woman ... who, I think, was a witch, but I'm not quite sure. Ivana is now pursuing her spirit or something like that, and he needs to believe or something like that in order to win. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian films. They are usually filled with lame actors, a silly storyline and minimal effects. Not to mention the fact that it is not just a Christian film ... but also a foreign one. The voiced actor for Ivan made the film more ridiculous than terrorizing, because he is so tall and weeping. You will not miss much by skipping this movie.
