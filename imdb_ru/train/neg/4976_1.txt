One evening, I watched Grendel and was forced to make an announcement of public service. <br /> <br /> Grendel is another version of Beowulf, a thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of innocuous and uninteresting films, and the preview promised an unlikely low-budget mini-epic, but this one refused to allow me to switch channels. It was awesome, overwhelmingly bad. I looked with admiration and horror at the wreck of the train, from which it is impossible to take my eyes off. I reached for my notebook and managed to capture some of what I saw. The following may contain spoilers or may simply preserve your sanity. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> - To end this, Beowulf's warriors wore horned helmets. A trivial problem compared to what happened after. It also appears that the helmets were in the bin and were handed over to the person who followed him. Fit, appearance and functionality were clearly not important. <br /> <br /> Marina Syrtis was obviously blackmailed in the film by Ringling brothers, Barnum and Bailey. She managed to avoid the red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup. <br /> <br /> - Ben Cross pretended not to be confused like a king. His hero, Hrothgar, was to become the king of the Danes just a few minutes before the opening of the film, and he had not yet had the opportunity to change the size of the crown to suit him. <br /> <br /> - To make it easier for the actors to return to their day-work desktops, no one needed to change their hairstyles at all. The variety of hair included pigtails, sideburns, buzzing and mullet, and at least served as a distraction from the dialogue. In order to prove that it was a multinational cast, everyone was encouraged to retain any accent they chose. <br /> <br /> - As usual for this type of film (at least after Mad Max), leather armor was required. In this case, it was a strange form, inappropriate and completely new. <br /> <br /> - The love interest of a woman Ingrid performed by Alexis Peters followed a long tradition of beauties who need to be watched with a completely reduced volume. <br /> <br /> - The unintended focus of the film was a recurring, complicated crossbow with exploding bolts. It never needed to be loaded and even recoil when fired. She managed to destroy the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, historical fact and plot frosts. <br /> <br /> - The Palace of Hrothgar, Heorot, rather than the long Scandinavian hall, was obviously designed and built by artisans who sank with Atlantis. <br /> <br /> - Beowulf arrived home to the Danes on a two-masted ship with a stern lock, which was originally part of the set, the other two were Santa Maria and Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unfert observed the approach of the Beowulf ship with a telescope. Before you can recover from this astounding innovation, you must see the ship from its point of view. Judging by the angle, the prince was in some kind of plane. <br /> <br /> - Fun fact 1: In Bulgaria, a fire (like from a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the actors breathing indoors or outdoors. <br /> <br /> - Fun fact 2. The Dark Age dance in Denmark reminds me of slow dances that I went to in 8th grade. <br /> Fun Fact 3: You can also make a catapult with a time-sensitive explosive. But don't expect it to really hurt anything. By the way, Beowulf, apparently, was a veteran of World War II and shouted: "Join!" To destroy any remaining part of disbelief. <br /> <br /> Grendel was so frustrated and always in a foul mood, because, being completely a CGI creature, he could not leave any marks. Even in the snow. <br /> <br /> Grendel’s mom (“Hag”) was in a bad mood because she was a single mother, and the youngest did not inherit her wings. I guess the recessive gene. By the way, we can now make an informed assumption that Grendel’s popularity probably was Swamp. <br /> <br /> - Grendel and Mom decided to randomly kill, fly away, or drag their prey based only on close reading. of the next few pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - A funny medical fact: the blow of a mythical beast, which was hit hard enough about fifty feet against a stone, causes light scratches on the face, which do not bleed much. <br /> <br /> - The sword of the legendary Beowulf, which was used to send Hagah, was long while it was tall and had enough steel in it to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, the reel dispelled all concerns about its weight. <br /> <br /> - The best feature of the film: Prince Unfert was just pierced by Hag and spit out a piece of blood about six feet. Princess Ingrid gently hugged him and said: "With you everything will be fine, my prince." Here you have a job in the clinic sorting. <br /> <br /> Now I feel better.
