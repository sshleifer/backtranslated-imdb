I have always been a big fan of Linda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when the sci-fi channel launched this film, I had to watch it. I was bitterly disappointed. This movie is "Wonder Woman" only in name. the right costume [she must have refused or ordered major changes], and the plot goes like James Bond for a poor man. Nothing that made the comic hero a success, that is, superhuman strength or resolute will. bad sleep I don't even think that Katie is so attractive. I would not waste time on it.
