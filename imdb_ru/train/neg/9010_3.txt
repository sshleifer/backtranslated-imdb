When you want the dragon to eat each actor, you know that you have a bad trip. <br /> <br /> I came up with very, very low expectations, after reading some other comments, and was not let down. However, unlike some other cheap and unsuccessful films, this film does not really remain ridiculous (and unintentionally) ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - THE AMBASSADORS OF THE FOLLOWING - <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is very contradictory. Looking through the "minor" errors, such as the dragon, which grew up in 3 hours, the whole idea on which it is based is flawed. You see, the film wants us to believe that dragons came from space in the form of meteorites, which really were dragon eggs. Having explained this, they show how a peasant pokes him with his pitchforks, and the dragon jumps out. Later, the obligatory "crazy scientist" guy talks about how dragons survived dinosaurs. So, obviously, people were near when there were dinosaurs, or we just have a small hole in the plot. Another important thing is that the laboratory exploded with a force half as large as that used for Hiroshima. Then two guys later come in to check everything, and it's almost unscathed! There is even another dragon who grew up from those who know what. In general, it is very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned cloning, I guessed that they were cloning a dragon. This means that our guard, Mr. Smartty, is not as intuitive and intelligent as if you believed in a movie, if you ignored what I knew that this movie was about dragons, you know. <br /> <br /> Leaving it aside, the second worst thing is “special effects”. Others mentioned fake stones falling at the start, a CG helicopter and a dragon. He looks a little better than a drop, but he destroyed everything he wanted when he was dragging along the corridor in the same way time after time. To their credit, the flying dragons looked pretty good at first (although the one in the cave is probably the worst in the whole movie). However, these things are fun to watch. Scenes showing a million different pictures of the same person facing each other are not shown. Also not “introductory” screens with vital statistics. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, they were not the best, but I think at least they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors in the recent BloodRayne, for example, and you should give them points for that. However, I noticed one thing: the woman who plays Meredith was often covered in makeup with a makeup that was several tones lighter than her rest. She looked as if she had a bad fight with some kind of white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and stupid. You don't really notice the music, but for the most part it's not so bad. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that you don’t watch it if you don’t want to see it, because you hear it is bad (for example, I did), although the only funny things are the bad effects of computer graphics. In addition, do not waste your time and money.
