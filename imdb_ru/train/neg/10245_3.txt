I expected a lot from this movie. Itâ€™s like Lee, like Naustradamus, like a character, but instead, all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can't even explain this movie. It was a wooden game, a horrible script of bible pieces like hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But it was at the end! The rest I had to wait and hope that something significant will happen, but this did not happen. This film tells about a couple who is trying to figure out what changes are happening in the world, for example, places in China where an earthquake occurred, and ultimately in a monastery headed by eight nuns and a priest. The monastery becomes the key to accidents. The whole movie is deceptive and boring. One of the worst is Lee.
