I once thought that Stone Age was the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed it in all respects that I could imagine, and some that I could not. In Stone Age, I hated characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated the actors ... and all the others who participated in the creation of this atrocity. I will not include a teaser for this film, I'm not so cruel. I could not expose innocent people like you to such agony. In fact, any discussion of the plot relating to this film is meaningless and humiliating. The words I would use to describe this film are: tasteless, stupid, and simple. <br /> <br /> In conclusion PLEASE do not watch this film. I ask you, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one person to another, PLEASE. For the sake of their own sanity and intelligence DO NOT LOOK IT. Destroy all copies you encounter.
