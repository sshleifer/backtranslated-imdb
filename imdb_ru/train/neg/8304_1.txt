"Christmas Story" - one of the most favorite films of all time. ACS was able to move the viewer to such a time and place in such a way that very few films ever had. He had sweetness and goodwill to him, which is rare. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) for him to continue, “It works in the family.” The film was released almost a couple of times, only at the last minute. When it finally came out, the IRITF was (and, I suppose) a complete failure. <br /> <br /> The sets and cinematography were just fine, but the direction was not fully achieved. The film was nothing more than a formula for the cash flow of lazy casting, lazy writing, and aloof acting. <br /> <br /> Narrator Jean Shepard, who was one of America’s great humorists and narrators of America, forced us to a false reprise of the warm mind that he used in ACS. He is too emotional, and why he did it, I will never know. He somehow managed to become an annoying, exhausting parody of himself. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in IRITF is unreliable and enforced. The actors may have seen ACS, but any wit and nuance that were in ACS should not have been recorded on any of them at all. The acting was embarrassingly hooligan and devoid of any dry Shepard humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but to call IRITF a continuation is to insult all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
