Listen to some interesting things of our combat hero, healer Pat, his son Gordon (the ministry of television is like a family business) and Terri Meusena (won by Miss America in 1973, wearing a swimsuit and showing her legs. Oh my God, merciful!) Say when our poor viewers get sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone with an “abscessing right tooth” has just been healed. Someone with a "bowed bowel" was healed. 3. Then Terry said that there was a person with a “strange condition” (do you mean that God does not know?) A burning sensation in the legs that has just been healed. Then Gordon said that there is a man (who narrows it down!) With swollen sinuses in his right cheek, with severe pain behind his right eye, but now he is healed. 5. Someone with a problem right thigh, limited mobility from a stroke, can now walk. 6. Terry said that she saw someone with severe cruelty in the bones of the neck, but did not know the exact illness (God does not know?) - that the person is now healed. 7. Someone was paralyzed on the right side, especially (not quite?!), Now the right side of the face is cured. A person (who again narrows the world's population) with a plate in the skull constantly has problems, and doctors simply do not know what to do. Terry said that she saw how the bone was reformed around the plate (funny bone ?!), And the pain in the man disappeared, now he has healed. <br /> <br /> Her, like our war hero Pat, helps our sick and poor people. 1. In Kansas City, there is a woman (Missouri or Kansas, but it narrows her.), Which has a sinus, and the Lord now dries her, thank you, Jesus. 2. There is a person with financial need - I think one hundred thousand dollars. (I think their god should go to school or something like that!) This need is being satisfied right now, and within three days the money will be provided. through the miraculous power of the holy spirit. Thank you, Jesus. 3. In Cincinnati there is a woman with cancer of the lymph nodes. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if I was still diagnosed (Ask your vengeful god Pat!), but you are not feeling well, and the lord is now dissolving this cancer! (What?!) 4. In Saskatoon, there is a woman (I suppose, in Canada) in the curvature of the spine in a wheelchair, the Lord corrects what is right now, and you can get up and walk! (If you have this condition, ignore Pat!) Just claim it and it's yours. Thank you Jesus! Amen, Amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popoff? Oral Roberts ?, Benny Hinn ?, Terry or Gordon? Not! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to a real doctor to have surgery! (Do you mean that he doesn’t trust his friends who heal the faith, Terry or his own son Gordon?!) <br /> <br /> When L.T. Pat Robertson was in the Marine Corps during the Korean War, he was a liquor officer responsible for keeping liquor officers. He was known for drinking himself and frequent prostitutes, and he was afraid that he was associated with gonorrhea. (You should ask the healer-faith for help!) <br /> <br /> The reason why Pat left the fight was that his father Absalom Willis Robertson (D. Wa from 1946 to 1966) was the chairman of the Senate military allocations committee. <br /> <br /> Terrorist attacks, September 11, 2001. We presented ourselves invulnerable and immersed in the pursuit of health and wealth (Pats Worth from 150 to 200 million dollars!) material pleasures (a mansion on Virginia Beach in Virginia platform for helicopters!) and sexuality (he had sex with his future wife before the wedding, in which they had a son!). This (terrorism) is because God removes our protection from us (statement issued on September 13, 2001) Pat Robertson reminds me of Burgermeister in Santa Claus, who arrives in the city, and his evil vengeful god reminds me of Wenger in the dungeons and Dragons. <br /> <br /> A spoiled boy, Gordon, does what Papa says to him, and Terry is a paid one and a woman who has no mind of her own! <br /> <br /> It really captures you! The September 5, 2005 issue of The Club Club contained a report by the correspondent of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Gary Lane, from outside the New Orleans Convention Center, which hosted mostly black disaster victims over the weekend. the evacuees, ”said Lane,“ they include this voodoo cup with the inscription: "Let there be a curse with you." A shot of a souvenir cup from a plastic cup from one of the countless knick-knack shops in New Orleans appeared on the screen. the name "Guerrilla War" and "Thugs 'R' Us.", - said Lane, pointing to a bunch or rap CDs scattered on the ground. (His fanatical dad Absalom taught Pat racism!) <br /> <br /> If any of you Good people ever think about donating to these fanatical sexists, please, in the name of God, don’t sponsor a softball or give the basketball team a food shelf, be a big brother or sister for a child, but please do not let these people, because they have been around for more than 40 years and have not decided anything. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe me, type “Pat Robertson”, heard during a commercial on the Internet, and click “Search”, and as soon as you hear that he really likes it, I I know for sure that you will not give a cent to these deceivers! By the way, once Terry had a divorce, and Pat many times opposed the divorce on his shows. <br /> <br /> I would like to say hello to people in Dover, Pennsylvania, Orlando, Florida, and good people who suffered from Hurricane Katrina, and I hope that this is a pleasant day. Was Operation Blessing Good for New Orleans? (Doubt!) Please let our readers know! I do! By the way, if you are sick, go to the real doctor and let everyone laugh at these liars, and once Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go somewhere else and take with them their evil god Wenger!
