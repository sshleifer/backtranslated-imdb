I'm not going to criticize the movie. Not much to talk about. He has good animal action scenes that were probably quite awesome at the time. Clyde Beatty is not quite the morning idol. He's a bit thin and doesn’t look particularly good. But it normal. He is a man in that cage with lions. We know that when he cannot take time off from his lions to care for his girlfriend, he will be on the island with her and must save the day. Someone said earlier that this is a history lesson. Scenes in a circus from another day, especially children who moan about nearby. I did not realize that even in the thirties, they swam on three masts. It looked like something from the 1860s. I think they have these shots. Not surprisingly, this thing has crashed. They always talk about correcting it. There is even a dirigible. It tells us a little about male and female relationships at the time, about some ridiculous nonsense. But if you don’t take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
