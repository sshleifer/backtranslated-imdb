I admit that I saw, probably, five minutes of “Jerry Springer”. I do not consider myself a snob, but I really think I am above watching what is on his show. You should try to rise above this level. <br /> <br /> I saw this film as part of a social science event that I hosted. I was told that this film really has nothing to do with Springer himself, rather, it was about the lives of those who appear in Springer. If you look better, this film might seem like a fascinating look at how miserable the lives of these people are. I admit, I felt a pang of sympathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). That's all she has in life. How sad that she feels she needs to go on a Jerry show to solve this problem. <br /> <br /> I really wish Molly Hagan appeared in this. Have you noticed that after this film she was mostly shot on the role of "B" on television? I will say this about Kagan. She is very beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very serious in her game and tries to play her roles with great sympathy. The problem is that Kagan cannot carry the stage on his own. She just does not have what it takes to play a major role. Her best work will always be the Angel in Hermann's Head (the show, which was not very good, but his heart was in the right place), and when she guessed about Seinfeld as Robert Sister.
