I have a good collection of films, and this one has been added to it. The number is 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> At first I had a name. University of Spray. I thought it would be a great horror movie. Have I ever been wrong? Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been much better. I love all the movies, but this one was more laughter than scare. <br /> <br /> Poor sound quality, poor play and poor arrangement are some of the areas that could be improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie is perfect for a good laugh. If you are looking for one of these movies to make fun, then this one!
