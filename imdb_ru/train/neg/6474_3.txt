It was the first sequel that I saw (except for Jafar's Return), and I honestly thought before watching that it would be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The storyline was, in fact, the first scenario with several additional characters, and the situation changed. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not happy with life on earth. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel hid her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her — and when Melody learns that she is upset and evil. And then she decides to escape, and she becomes a mermaid. So, she is happy, floating around, and Ariel goes in search of her - a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story doesn’t sound that bad, it’s written down, but the cliche and repetition of situations from the first movie is just too obvious. And the addition of the fact that Melody, in general, is very annoying, and the film becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of other new characters - Tip and Dash, which are two of them. They are not so bad as the characters themselves - just try not to think about Timon or Pumba! The songs also leave much to be desired, they simply do not have the same magical energy as the songs of the original. In the animation, obviously, there was not all the load put into it, in some parts it is nervous, and for the movements of the characters, a lot of imagination is not required. <br /> <br /> Another tip - try to forget about the original character Ariel while watching this movie. A lovely, naughty, curious teenager “everything grew up,” turned into a boring, boring wife and mother, and her red hair with branded symbolism is all tied. It is much better if you have never seen the original - you will have nothing to compare with. <br /> <br /> In general, however, it could have been worse - it’s not as bad as other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it is not in the same league as the original. But this is for your collection, if nothing else, as if Disney continued in the same spirit, they will lose all their old fans.
