- I was planning to write something explaining what I didnâ€™t like in this film, but it will be harder than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much about it. I watched him just three days ago, and he almost did not impress me. This is usually a sign of the present smelly. The only thing I remember was incredibly boring from most of them. The novelty is that Humphrey Bogart is like a detective who quickly disappears. It would be different if he could act, but he is an artist with one note. The murder scenes were amateurishly processed, and there was no concern for them. If you can't find the killer in five minutes in the film, you need to see more horror euro. Casting is the dead sale of the killer's personality.
