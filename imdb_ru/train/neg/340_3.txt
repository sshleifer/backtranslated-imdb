I guess the reason why this film sold so well at the box office is, of course, Eddie Murphy. I think it was his first film since the Beverly Hills Cop, so at that time it was hot. Considering that one earned more than two hundred million, and that was R, and this one earned about 80 million, and it was said that he was not so popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so maybe this is another reason I didn't care about it at all. In this there is Eddie as a kind of seeker of lost children. He must find the golden child, or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but, no matter how bad it is, it doesn’t compare with special effects. I saw better things done in the 70s than what this one offers, Ray Harrihausen did the best things. However, the main reason why you are watching such a film is that Eddie, unfortunately, is not funny at all, and it’s just silly to put it in scenes like “Raiders of the Lost Ark”. I guess they were hoping for fish out of the water, but for me it just didn’t work.
