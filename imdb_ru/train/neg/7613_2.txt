The small Californian town of Diablo abounds in mysterious deaths after sheriff Robert Lopez discovered an ancient box. Legend has it that a sixteenth-century Mexican demon named Azar is in the box. FBI agent Jill Vega is sent to investigate the killings and joins forces with the sheriff’s daughter, Dominic and Mary, to fight the evil and bloodthirsty demon. “The Legend of Diablo” is absolute rubbish. In the film there is no panic and casseroles, acting is amateurish, and the direction is bad. Animation is the only aspect of the film that I liked. I'm a big fan of indie horror movies, for example, I liked Torched, Live Feed, Bone Sickness or Neighborhood Watch, unfortunately The Legend of Diablo is a huge flash in the pan. Definitely to avoid.
