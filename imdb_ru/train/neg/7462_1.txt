Direction should be a problem here. I recently heard John Cleese talk about working on a parody of Fawlty Towers. He had to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too fragile and not funny. The second branch was too tight to be funny. The third was fragile enough to be funny. Such attention to detail is absent from Corky Romano. No matter how awkward the funny comic bit was, it was not corrected and left on the floor of the cutting room. The only meaning I can find in this film is the study of a very incorrect film that somehow got into the distribution without repair. <br /> <br /> I scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time strengthens my suspicion that some people are paid for promoting names. I can not understand how someone older than 9 years could appreciate this title more than 4, MAX. C'mon, 5 is average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who earn on it, appreciating it even at the average level. <br /> <br /> This is my list of the 10 worst films of all time. And, in fact, I like The Three Puppets, and I can even tolerate Ed Wood!
