Body Slam (1987) is a terrible movie. The low budget smells, the direction is pedestrian (at best), and the script and acting skills are lame. But if you like old school wrestling (from about the 1970s to the mid-80s), then you will be more entertained than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this film stinks on ice. I gave him two because I wanted to be generous. This turkey was "directed" by stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, Tonga Kid and a group of scrub fighters and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> This film is about a promoter who wants to combine “hair rock” and fight. But these are others who don't want him to succeed. There are more, but I don't want to spoil it for you. If you can digest bad acting and meaningless plot, there are some surprises near the end for die-hard fans of wrestling. <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t recommend this to my worst enemy (and I mean that).
