Director Ron Atkins is definitely insane. This ultrabudget film tells about the few days of the life of one Harry Rousseau (John Dzhankaspro, who also co-wrote), who is nuts, who receives Rezinek's doll from his sons bitch. He begins to take orders from the doll to take a huge amount of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What begins with the “balls into the wall” manual film remains so, but it becomes VERY repeating VERY quickly. I'm more inclined to madness. Hard to forget, although seen. As if Tom Green ever starred in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Lori Farwell is completely naked; Jasmine Putnam shows boobs and scrub <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: repeatedly seeing John completely naked
