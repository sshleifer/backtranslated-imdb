After seeing about half of this, I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I endured to the end. This is a film that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. Acting is bad - much worse than in the films of the 80s. <br /> <br /> There are several attempts at humor that fail miserably, and the film is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager, this film will be attractive, but for those who have seen a lot of films, you will know how the film will turn out in the first 10 minutes. The rest of the time you spend in agony, waiting for the final credits to begin. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this.
