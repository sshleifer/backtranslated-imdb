According to the character of Charles Dans in this movie "Damn!" No conspiracy, no character development, and absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Complete material that simply does not exist in the real world (since when did British police inspectors arm themselves with pistols in their holsters on their shoulders?) Full of errors (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of boring and artificial communication. And directing / editing is terrible - shaky shots from a hand-held camera that add nothing to the film, except for the vague feeling of motion sickness; confusing jumps; without structure. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipesâ€™s character is completely non-sympathetic - why should we care what happens to him? Straight to the video? Right in the trash!
