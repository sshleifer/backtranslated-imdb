This may not be the last film of Mandy Schaffer. Someone do something! :-( <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> What a little life this director's work could have. Completion of acting skills. Do not blame the cast, everything is in order. Even the winemaker is younger The brother was quite young And he didn’t even get to the cinema until the middle. And please, please, include Mandy in some more films! She is too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age., heh ... <br /> <br / > Two specific critics in case anyone cares (no one really liked this film.) First, the way Tracy continued to appear Going to the right melodramatic moment to see what she had to see, and which she had never seen in return, was very unpleasant. Hollywood: please stop giving the villains perfect luck in a time that ends exactly when the climax comes. Write the best scripts so you don’t have to use this device to plot again, if your script isn’t good enough to handle it, don’t create it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Carmen would not fall. Common crawl en For this fake trick that Tracy pulled. She already had Tracy's fingers. More bad writing / directing. <br /> <br /> I could ruin this movie even more, but mercy forbids. In fact, I did not hate it as much as others. It simply had no particular reason for being made, unless it was a pure vehicle to show off the beautiful Mandy. Oh, and to someone who did not consider her sexual ... the character was not well written, but how can you say that she was not sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I don't think it's me. <br /> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I would also like to see her again. ;-) P.S. Did I mention that I hope Mandy makes me more films? <: - D
