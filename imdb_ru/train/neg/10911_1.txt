I hated this film so much that I remember it well. This is not even funny. Any film based on unfunny sexual jokes and racism does not deserve the money that is worth it to shoot. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a bag of rancid milk. All I could think was “he deserves it for making such a bad movie.” Do not waste your time or money on it.
