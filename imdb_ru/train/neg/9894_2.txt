I missed the beginning of this film, which may explain why I did not like it so much. On the other hand, I have studied the fall of the Roman Republic for years, so I know history. Again, this could also be the reason that I didn’t like this movie. <br /> <br /> There are more historical inaccuracies in the film than in statistics. Although it’s so inaccurate that I don’t think they tried to do it right, in which case it can be forgiven. The strange thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate, which ultimately becomes confusing. How to throw the wedding of Antonius with Octavia, and then move her two scenes later. Why even raise it, if it does not make sense for a conspiracy, but Octavia has never been seen? And just as in some scenes he called Antonius by his real name (Marcus Antonius), and in other scenes - by his strange English name Mark Antony. <br /> <br /> Despite historical inaccuracies, the film would still seem funny if it were not for the leading lady. There is not a drop of dignity in it. She is hysterical, dramatic and completely out of control. Instead of being a smart and balanced queen, Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a severe case of PMS. 95% of this comes from a bad game, but 5% also from a poorly written script. Too many silly dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you didn’t watch Antonius and Cleopatra, you watched immature versions of Dawson and Joey from Dawson Creek. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something about this period, see ... anything other than that,
