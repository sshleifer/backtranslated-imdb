I rented this film, thinking that it was the sadly sad version of 1959 that I saw in my childhood. Did not have. Therefore, I was very disappointed that, in my opinion, it was a minor game, poor development of character and, most importantly, an inability to emphasize the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... "The Dog of Flanders" is simply cute "aside" from the film. Get the 1959 version!
