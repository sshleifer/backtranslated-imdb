Life in some future fascist or almost fascist state, which seriously limits personal freedoms, is a recurring theme in contemporary literature as well as for filmmakers. Such works publish warnings to us about undesirable trends in our society that need to be monitored; but to be effective, they must also be interesting. Unfortunately, most books are more likely to post warnings more effectively than to entertain us enough to become really widely read; while with films, the problem is usually the opposite. The first such work, which became really widely known, was probably George Orwell’s 1984 book (first published in 1948), and it is still readily available both as a book and as a film. <br /> <br /> Watch or read it: and then, when you feel a little overwhelmed by the inhumanity of a person, reach Cinderella 2000. This is a frivolous, low-budget comedy based on the same theme that provides an easy, but inappropriate viewing; and, as in 1984, the calendar went beyond its previous period. Most of the comedy was shot with the help of a trowel, although there are only a few really funny moments. To train your mind at long intervals between them, you can focus it on the question of whether this film will receive a new life extension, releasing it as a DVD, or it will finally disappear when existing copies of the tape deteriorate after the ransom. . There are a lot of worse movies that appear in DVD quality these days, and to be honest, I don’t care what happens anyway. <br /> <br /> So far, the best of the films of this genre was probably The Tale of the Maid, but I would gladly trade them all for a well-made film about Jack London’s high novel Iron Heel. No matter how ambitious it is, it still seems incredible that not a single modern cinematographer has yet dared to try it (IMDb lists only the black and white version made in Russia in 1919).
