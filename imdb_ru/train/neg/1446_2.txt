The film is a very long tale about a classic novel that is completely unable to grasp the spirit of the original adventure. The rather awful American Patrick Swayze acts in the role of the British hero Allan Quatermain, despite the evidence of his nationality. <br /> <br /> The film continues into a “Hollywood story,” changing the plot and characters to fit more conveniently into accepted form. The film can be predictable everywhere, even for those who are not familiar with the story and suffer from some extremely bad actions and terribly frustrating fights. <br /> <br /> In general, a terrible addition to the already Good collection of films based on the legend of King Soloman and the mines of Allan Quatermain.
