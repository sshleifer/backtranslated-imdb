When this film was released, it spawned one of the most remarkable capsular film reviews: Sphinx Stinks. Yes, but fascinating. Casting silly starting from the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gilgud as the Egyptians? Cosmetics are not enough for this in Cairo, at least during the filming of this film. But it's pretty funny to see how they try. The performances range from mum-like (sorry, obvious observation) to excessive, with very few stops between them. Leslie-Ann Downâ€™s character looks as if she cannot find Egypt on a map, much less expounding her archaeological treasures. This is, at least in part, because of some really bad letter, one of the curses that all viewers of this film will visit. In my opinion, films with a curse or based on some esoteric theme, such as Egyptology, are ripe for a stupid, rewritten dialogue. This does not disappoint, and rapprochement turns out to be a double blow. The conspiracy has one source of dramatic tension: can it become even dumber and less believable? The answer is usually YES. The location shots are beautiful, and the design set is generally very good, the only constant reminders that this was not some low-cost production. It is also the fact that in such an unintentional laughter there are so many famous people who serve in this service. Cheap, no; Yes Yes
