Unfortunately, realism is boring. This film, I thought it would never end, would be better if all the characters were shot in the first five minutes. Where is Blade when you need him? Although DEAD CREATURES is as gloomy as Battle Strike, Dream Required, and nightmarish as BOISE MOI, it is not as interesting as any of the aforementioned dark movies. While unreasonable cannibalism can cause imitator's hearts, Jeffrey Dalmers, to beat a little faster, it was not as interesting as RAVENOUS. In fact, I found it as interesting as late-night commercials, and as exciting as going to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you may be able to transfer it, otherwise for no one. I was very surprised that this was not done by people from Brain Damage, as it was the quality of Dead Creatures.
