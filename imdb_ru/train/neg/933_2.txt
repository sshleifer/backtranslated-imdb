An undeveloped / unbelievable storyline, (by the time I understood where it was going, I did not care anymore) poor casting. (Come on ... William Macy as a hired killer ???) bad direction (did you ever see Tracy Ullman act SO bad?) (Do I have to worry about what happened to the unethical, incompetent, indifferent character John Ritter?) Bad script ... (Indeed, I'm not looking for a formula script, but it was really terrible. The only really good thing about this was a child. Ten lines? Is it not normal if your comment is less than ten lines? Come on ... whose rules are these? Why can't I say something that is say less than 10 lines ??? Is not that random? Why is not normal to have less than 10 lines of comments?
