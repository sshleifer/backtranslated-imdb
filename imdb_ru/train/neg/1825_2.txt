I'm not sure about that. I just could not laugh at this. I had an open mind. I did not want to be polite about it. But I seriously just could not laugh at this movie. It was just not funny for me. In some parts, it seemed that Ben Stiller and Jack Black were trying too hard. If you connect two very funny men, it does not mean that it will be a great comedy. Some films simply do not have to be made. This is one of them. Because he makes a lot of old jokes, and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know, it's a comedy. It seems at least. But I was just not impressed. Sorry, but I can't give it anything lower than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
