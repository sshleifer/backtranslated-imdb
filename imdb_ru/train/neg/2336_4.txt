I read some exciting reviews on IMDb and thought I'd watch this movie. Disappointed. On the other hand, good male roles and some interesting photos, but in general this film does not convince. It seems that he is full of his own indulgent value, trying to say something meaningful, but not enough, and the whole picture is unconvincing. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that are classified as a noir film, which can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "The film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, threat and cynical characters." <br /> <br /> This is a story: 3 losers face each other with their collective problems, including mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, debt, etc., and together they plot to kidnap a child and outwit each other. <br /> <br /> A film would have been much better if the story was limited to kidnapping, and not to the shortcomings of the kidnappers. I thought that the main role of a woman was not in her depth, and she seemed to be an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> While some good moments were running out, I felt like I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
