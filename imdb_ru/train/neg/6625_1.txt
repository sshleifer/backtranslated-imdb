This is the first time I write a movie commentary on IMDb. but I had to write it for that. This is 3 hours of real torture. from the very beginning you have the idea that the film will be bad. action is pitiful. I am a big fan of Ajay Devgan (I loved him in Bhagat Singh), but in this film he is the worst. It seems that Amitabh worked hard on this, but for some reason the fear was gone. Prashant Raj is not an actor. and the most annoying part of the film is the kotari niche. I have no idea why the director shot her in this film. background score is repeated. for some reason, I felt that Rama was trying to repeat sarkar, a color theme, a background assessment, camera angles, but it did not work. PLEASE DON'T LOOK IT
