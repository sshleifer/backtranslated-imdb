Connie Hoffman is very beautiful and sometimes attractively topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, guys. The only reason to think about whether to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These plays of the period of sexual exploitation of the 70s are sometimes very interesting because of their outdated form (flared pants, big hair, sapata whiskers, etc.). This is not true. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having an elderly romantic lead man is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> The name hinting at a sexual comedy is misleading. <br /> <br /> I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding this one, like the plague.
