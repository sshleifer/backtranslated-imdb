... this verson is not so bad at fighting a bard. It’s still a terrible minimalist performance, Hamlet’s Dutch uncle inexplicably dubbed by the Spaniard (whether Ricardo Montalban or not, is the subject of controversy), and Maximilian Schell replays like never before. Most of the dialogue makes it unscathed, and the fact that the MST3K version feels compelled to repeatedly point out that the performances are long * spirit * does not seem incredibly funny to me. This is basically just a bad game.
