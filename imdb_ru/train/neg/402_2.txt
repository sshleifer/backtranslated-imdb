Describing this film as rubbish is unfair. At the very least, digging through the trash can be a fascinating hobby. This film was neither exciting nor interesting. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon could act great if he had the opportunity, so no doubt he had the IRS bill when he agreed to this terrible scenario. The story of a mad scientist about the "Empty Man" was told earlier, told better and told without resorting to such a number of ridiculously expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of these special effects seem to be built around Transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs that could be bought in the early seventies. In the UK, they were sold as “Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)”, where they may have been named for this film. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, terrible script, non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
