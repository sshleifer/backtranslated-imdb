It is too early to talk about how the series will develop, but I can say that the pilot was less than I thought. However, this series still has potential. Of course, when I first saw Voyager, I thought that he, too, had potential - but was very disappointed. However, my intuition tells me that the Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> With regard to the pilot's impressions ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had good ideas and good topics. I liked the intro. The opening captions of the show were interesting, with the progress of the study and the right song for the topic. Scott Bakula excellently copes with the role of captain. <br /> <br /> For me it was not enough that in history there was not enough of the “feeling” of the beginning of a great adventure. The plot of the episode itself was rather a “common” story of “Trek” with the themes of “intelligence” and “first step to space”, just a subplot and subtext. If you edit the links to this first mission in deep space, the plot will be difficult to distinguish between the Enterprise, TOS or TNG epochs. The central plot did not reflect and did not pay tribute to the great theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The story of the launch of the first mission would be quite ambitious without "action." Instead of separate references to the novelty of the research, they could become history. Get a little more nostalgia and philosophy about it (oh, for a television show that would once again make us THINK). Make us feel the excitement of the "wind" and stay on the "sea", instead of distracting us with salvation and a variety of shootouts. There were too many shootouts. <br /> <br /> We had a feeling that people are “freshmen” in a well-established school. New children on the block, and not to risk a largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of finding them. This meeting could be much more historical and more sociological. How do two such different societies interact? Don't just hint at it, SHOW it! <br /> <br /> I should have thought of this more as a “march with an awkward team and limited technology”, and not a “first bold step into the unknown”. I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept, but so far I have not seen this new, wonderful concept. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I repeat the view that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blolock has potential. The overall theme is most interesting since we first saw Kirk in the world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes could do justice to this great and wonderful topic, we will have a show that will create new legends. <br /> <br /> You shoot an arrow in the air ... Good luck, Captain Archer. <br /> <br /> Producers: MORE RISKS AND MAKE US * THINK *! :-)
