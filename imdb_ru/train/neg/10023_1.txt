Shame on the films Yash Raj and Aditye Chopra, who seem to have lost their intelligence over the years and provide constant fare in this piece of cinematic shit that is not even worth You Tube standards. I gritted my teeth throughout the entire film, ending with a schizophrenic direction, a plot line that was never fully realized, and on the last scene I was just ashamed that my country and its directors from different countries could “throw” crores on stupidity Shame on the actors for taking this job and even commenting on it as some part of the work that they can trust. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed with your choice of film. Karin shows enough skin for puberty, and Akshay appears like a fool. Anil is another retard with a passion for English. His friends were commendable in their actions, and with the help of strange cinematography scattered over the last 15 minutes, this was enough to open a blood vessel. DO NOT spend any brain cells, energy or your money to see it - Go, SEE / Rent AMU - instead with Konkan Senskharma - a wonderful piece of independent film that has ever left India. A clever, insightful and wonderful story that will amaze everyone with smart actors and give me hope that all is not lost in the making of Indian cinema.
