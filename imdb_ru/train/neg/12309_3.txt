It was a disappointing movie. Given the material - army life is always good for laughter - and the stars, this film was supposed to be the most ridiculous. At best, it was worth a couple of chuckles. Steve Martin was much funnier than this, and it seems that Dan Aroyd must stick to dramatic roles where he can follow Robin Williams' example and win an Oscar someday.
