This film is a perverted nonsense film made in Japan about a dysfunctional family, which ends with a strange cruel guest who just idle and watches 4 family members in their worst form. There is nothing sacred about this film: sex drugs and violence stretched to such an extent that I am surprised that it was censored. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that he will be liked only by those whom we should not be encouraging, and not by some supposed basic message, which we will consider to others. A film that condones the worst element in society and, in any case, doesnâ€™t like it at all ... The disappointment of the man who made the great films Dead or Live and Listening.
