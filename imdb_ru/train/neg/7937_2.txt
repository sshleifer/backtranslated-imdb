After 30 seconds, you already understand that for this cheap fake there was no real budget. The story is drawn from great films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. I like such films, even if they are well duplicated (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But “Side Sho” is difficult to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogues are stupid, and the music is dull and completely inappropriate. You don't care what happens to the characters. The so-called bad guys are also not at all interesting and rather stereotypical. So what about blood and gore? Well, there are some, although it is rather cheap, and the action is very bad. 2 points, only for blood and gore, but I understand that it is hardly worth watching, even for beagles.
