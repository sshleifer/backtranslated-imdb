Major Payne was not at all very good. Despite the fact that here and there it was funny, the story was ridiculous, and the game was bad. Major Payne's voice and temperament were particularly annoying. The idea was ridiculous, but what the boys had to do in this film was even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this film to anyone.
