Very tired Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary fighting with his former employers for the thing that these non-heroes are planning to sell to the Iranians. The low-paid nonsense video from the producers of Silk Stalkings offers some decent action films and a lot of ineptly staged "drama" ... lack of logic and truly awful dialogue are defining aspects, although the last turns and shifts in loyalty could be a good end for a better movie . Bert is still present, although it also means that you notice more when he insults the semi-dry one-liners.
