Pallbearer is disappointing and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that simply does not work partly with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow is watching the entire film with an embarrassed expression on his face, and it's hard to say what David Schwimmer sees in her. <br /> <br /> However, Pallbearer is at times amusing, especially in church and group scenes. with his friends it's a laugh, but that's about it. Watch The Pallbearer only for these scenes and rewind the rest. Believe me, you do not miss much.
