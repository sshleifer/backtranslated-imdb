I mean, I thought I heard the dialogue in the film, but it was so bad and inappropriate that I could not believe it. I laughed so hard at what must have been the worst scenario and acting skills in the history of mankind, I was very worried that I might have a heart attack and die right in the theater. <br /> <br /> So in the scene I’m talking about, the “hero” just saw his brother crash, and his brothers' car exploded a few steps away from him (the hero). The “hero” threw the expected “attack”, seeing something so tragic, and people tried to keep him from colliding with a burning car. <br /> <br /> In the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable rage / emotional breakdown, he says: “I’m so sad,” he said, right? I'm crazy?
