It was a turning point in my life for watching movies. I went to see it in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at how bad it is. Such films make you think about who is investing money and who owes someone a favor - a very, very big favor. Special effects are absolutely first-class, like any first grader. Toy rubber bats on the ropes without trying to hide them, arrows that are drawn on the film and look like an arrow that can be found on a road sign, and a ridiculous storyline. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to Conquest. Every student of a film should see this thing just so that he knows the very definition of a bad film.
