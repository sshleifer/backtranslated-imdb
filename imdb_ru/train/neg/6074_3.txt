What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes will be associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that includes baseball and shows baseball scenes, at least make the action look somewhat realistic. Why did the crowd always stand for no particular reason during the games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie .... what was it? We are somehow inclined to believe that De Niro found his way on the field in the form of a judge and that this game is even played in a shower ... one of the worst scenes in a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10
