The subtle story concerns two brothers from a small town and their struggle for the honor of a family. David Morse is a responsible, direct cop and "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, a “bad” boy, a former soldier and a former prisoner. As an actor (especially in his early years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his actions in accordance with the method. Having become the first writer and director of this skilful, stupid drama, he works through his script and characters within the same methodological process, slowing down the pace of crawling (supposedly so that we can catch all the nuances and excesses). This approach could be fascinating if you had to take care of three-dimensional characters, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really as convincing as brothers and sisters. Worse, we expect more from prominent veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who are unlikely to be able to come up with something interesting. The painting depicts inconspicuous plots, shaky narration and intricate editing (always tilted to emphasize artistic excesses). Penn's tricks with the camera show a talented eye, yet they are mostly irritation. * 1/2 of ****
