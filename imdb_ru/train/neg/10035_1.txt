Absolutely horrible movie. A complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The background music is so loud that you cannot understand the speech. Well, if you really listen carefully, what they say is really illegible. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is bad, there is no editing, the background assessment gives a headache, the action is poor, the dialogues are illegible, the action is terrible and Well, Karina used to look like a fighter, now she looks like a hungry fighter. Gosh, you can lose weight, but you cannot gain mercy. <br /> <br /> After spending three hours watching the film, I want to like it, but this film does not give me such pleasure. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, keep watching this.
