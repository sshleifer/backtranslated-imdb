This film could be a decent B-film if 3/4 of the film was not so strongly focused on sex scenes. I mean, he is a sex addict, and Iâ€™m sure that much more happens with sex addicts than just having sex on a regular basis. Michael Des Barres did a good job, considering what he had to do, and that was a bit. At one time or another, he will have to laugh at him, because his character was so pitiful. Nastassja Kinski was okay in her role as an interested sex therapist, although she could have done more, and I do not suggest that she have sex. In this film, I was most distinguished by Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as a loving and caring wife. There is something in the beautiful inside and out that attracts me greatly. She played this role, and when you watched the movie, you start to feel displeasure towards her. <br /> <br /> The Sexual Addict Diary, although it is not Oscar material or modern classics, someone's standards is quite informative and does an honest job of showing you how personal demons can capture and destroy those very things in life. which you highly appreciate.
