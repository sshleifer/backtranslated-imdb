Young and attractive Japanese again fall into the mainstream of a curse, this time for mobile phones. Various people die until the angry spirit behind it all opens up, so basically, if you have seen more than two recent Japanese horror films, you can shoot this movie in the dark with your hands tied. <br /> <br /> The main attraction here is that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. Until now, I was more impressed by his discreet works, such as “The City of Lost Souls”, however, when “Missed Call” reached me, I missed his more famous envelope distribution “Dead or Alive” or excessively pseudo-Kronenberg style Audition. Despite the fact that many of his films are mostly empty, at least they have such virtues, or at least something that you can pay attention to, for example, like Tadanobu Asano in brilliant costumes posing as Johnny Depp. In One missed call, there is nothing like that; just very little benefit: the game is modest and average, very little (nothing, to be honest) in terms of panic or waiting, and in some places just boring. <br /> <br /> However, there are times when a sense of humor, like a glacier, seeps through soft commercialism; in particular, due to the television show’s intention to film the demise of one of the cursed subjects, and television programs care more about their ratings than about the lives of girls. But other than that, there is nothing to suggest that this is Miike behind the camera; first of all, his usual visual talent disappeared without a trace (and this includes his famous blood), although it is more likely that he simply had no enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One missed call is not offensively bad. This is just a disappointing average. <br /> <br /> Miike obviously likes directing. With his huge annual output, it is obvious that he will not be 100% concerned with all his projects. But even with that in mind, One missed call felt like he was just paying bills.
