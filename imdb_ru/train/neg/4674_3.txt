I do not know who is to blame, Miss Lee or her director, but her performance in the role of Catherine is almost impossible to observe. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, does an excellent job — no matter what, to my knowledge. His character is too charming and attractive. but, of course, did not seem greedy enough to put up with the stupidity of the character Lee. Chaplin seems stunned by the fact that Lee’s shyness and lack of grace cannot be understood, but rather her orthopedic instability. In his interests there must be some element of plausibility, but as they say, this is incomprehensible. The performances do not fit. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney, of course, beautiful, despite any attempts to disrupt them. The supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch. What a pity that the leaders do not work together, because the production is nice to watch.
