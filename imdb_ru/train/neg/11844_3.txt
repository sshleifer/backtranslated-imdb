Anyone who likes jazz of the 1920s, dress of the 1920s, Charleston and ultra-smart yachts (for example, I, in all respects), will want this film. But the sad fact is that this is all there is. The plot is banal and obvious, in most cases the action is either horrible, or it plays on the farcical side of what is happening, and when everything ends, there is not so much left as the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a beautifully made bad movie.
