I can not believe that someone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget indie films, but this one absolutely sucks. Low budget does not mean that the film should be crazy. Horror does not mean that the film must be crazy. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was just a celebration of blood, and especially disturbing. The game was average, given that they were all unheard of actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film is trying to look like "artistic" or something like that. This is not one of those really great indie films that cost only a thousand dollars but are incredibly well made. It was nothing more than a pretext for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions in the movies. Other reviews also said that the soundtrack was crap ... because most of it was written by the same person, and some songs were written by one of the film's authors. There were no redemptive qualities in this film. A complete waste of my time and money.
