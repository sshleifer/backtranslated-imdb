People who really loved the Problem Child (1990) need to examine their heads. Who would have thought how an evil little boy would hurt others and find it funny? The film is not funny, never, in any case, beginning to end. It wants to be a cartoon, but the authors do not understand that the farce is not funny when people are attacked by bears or beaten with baseball bats. This may be funny in cartoons, but not in the movies. <br /> <br /> The young hero of the film is Junior (Michael Oliver), who since childhood has been placed in the front doors of his adoptive parents. for acceptance. Families reject him because Junior usually gives them trouble. <br /> <br /> Then he is thrown into a shelter, where he terrorizes nuns and writes letters by correspondence to a convicted bow tie killer (Michael Richards). Soon he is adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (deceased John Ritter and his wife Amy Yasbek), who die to have a baby, to be like any other parent next door. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the Healy family, and “Little” Ben shows interest in him, despite the fact that he destroys the campaign, luring the bear to the playground, or throws the cat at the father of “Big” Ben (Jack Warden ), fanatical politician. <br /> <br /> I think we should take care of Junior to support him when he takes revenge on people. His new mother, Flo, is a bitch, his grandfather is completely selfish, and one little girl - who despises adopted children - is such a spoiled child. <br /> <br /> But what Junior does to get the last one to laugh is not funny - it is mean, cruel, and sometimes life threatening. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the film? What should children solve problems with violence and vandalism? What should they seek friendship by writing to convicted murderers? They definitely do not understand what it means to be a bad child. Junior is not alone - he is just a sadist, a little crazy. There was a time when children were bad at beating others. Now everyone laughs when Junior beats up children with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film is being sold as a “family comedy.” Worse, this is a problem for a child with a PG rating. What did the MPAA think about when they saw this? There are many profanity and vile jokes that may wonder about the separation between PG and PG-13. <br /> <br /> Children will enjoy it, but parents will be shocked by what is happening. depicted on the screen. And for most people, the problem of the child will be considered the classic of "guilty pleasure"; a film that shamefully admits to someone that they like it, even though the prevailing opinion put forward by more serious viewers is that the film is a piece of shit.
