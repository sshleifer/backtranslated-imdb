In addition to the great cinema of the wonderful James Wong Howe in battle scenes, this film is a real bastard. <br /> <br /> This is the second film I have seen in recent days, directed by Alexander Korda. The first was the "Rembrandt" of Charles Lawton. It was so bad that I turned it off. I am afraid that this one is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps her performance as a virgin queen was good for the standards of 1937, but if you compare it with the performance of Helen Mirren, it is absolutely not consistent. Robson declares his lines. Her military message to the British troops is so weak in spirit. <br /> <br /> Even the dashing Lawrence Olivier cannot save this piece of boredom. <br /> <br /> Vivien Leighâ€™s future wife is in a supporting role here, and she really conveys nothing here. Just think that Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the story of the Spanish Armada in this film is so boring.
