I'm so confused. What is this movie about? What was the killer's motivation? He seemed rather angry, but I still have to figure out why. Nothing in this movie made sense. He had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. What I think would make it a hill. Or a bunch. Shit. The game was terrible. When I looked for several actors in this film, they were in very few things I had heard of, and this was not a surprise. I can’t decide if I’m sorry for embarrassment at the fact that they’re so badly shot in the film, or feel that they’ll never be offered another acting job. Starting, NOW! (Reference Seinfeld.) In fact, do not waste your time on this. There is so little substance there that there is simply nothing to make fun of. This was undoubtedly one of the worst slash beats - NO, one of the worst clicks of ANY KIND that I had ever watched, and I saw a lot.
