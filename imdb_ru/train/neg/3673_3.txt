William Hurt, a diving scientist ??? Are American agents investigating overseas? A sick polluted man kicks his butt after dropping 20 feet to his back and runs off? The sniper is missing and does not kill Hert (just hurt him), but the second shot to "kill" is dead? Waste of time. Comparing this with the fall, as other reviewers have done, is ridiculous. Yes, and by the end of the film they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands, except for the “evil” agent, and Hurt decides to kill him, giving him a “viral handshake.” What kind? By the way ... when did IMDb take 10 lines of text? I'm just chatting here. Doesn't this diminish the content of the reviews if you need the number of lines x?
