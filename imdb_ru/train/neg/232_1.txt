It was supposed to be one of the worst films ever. When Kate and Jed appear with a group of guys, and they all start clapping ... so, Hollywood. Another bad scene - when Kate ran her hands along the sidewalk, it turned out that she was studying the texture of the sidewalk. Andy's acting skills are so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel love for each other. The other 2 women, however, were very good and clouded Andy. In any case, it was such an indecent film. I usually like movies of this type, but I just could not get into this movie. Too many unbelievable situations, and again Andy's game did not help the film. In addition, it is all gum. Lankom should put makeup on with a spatula, because she looks glamorous in commercials.
