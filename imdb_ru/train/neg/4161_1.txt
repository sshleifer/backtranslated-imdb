The stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and uncontrollable (at least) dialogue amaze this TV show, which would hardly be interesting even with a billion-dollar production budget. <br /> <br /> Characters are not believable in their motives, actions or their professions. The plot looks like a bad hack of Dungeons and Dragons â„¢, but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are serious problems with continuity, and the degree of meaningless interaction between the characters makes this author, at least, make a face. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you will get the best game, dialogue and plot. Ugh.
