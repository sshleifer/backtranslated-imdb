It must have been an embarrassment for every member of the full African-American composition. Every derogatory, derogatory stereotype of the black American community is shown prominently. I will not exacerbate insults by listing them here, with the exception of the mention of chickens, watermelons and dice. <br /> <br /> One good song by Ethel Waters (and some bad ones), the dancing talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis are fantastic singing, bringing the total to 1 below 1 on the IMDb scale.
