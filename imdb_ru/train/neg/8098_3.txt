This is one of the most brutal correspondence I've ever seen. If they want to make a lousy movie, they should refrain from giving it the title of a beautiful book. There is hardly any connection between the book of Wolfe and this film, except for the title. I am not against changes if they help the flow of history on the screen. At the very least, the changes should not damage the final product. The last scene in the film is painfully unconvincing. Actors are mistaken. The director and / or screenwriter obviously could not decide whether to make an unconvincing comedy or preach an unconvincing preaching. <br /> <br /> If you watched this movie and did not like it, try this book. If you saw this movie and you like it, read the book.
