I made a special effort to watch this film, and was completely disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems encouraging, and the choice of actors leaves hope - I liked Pacino in The Woman's Fragrance and I saw Annie Duperry and Martha Keller in several French and other 70s / 80s films. But I forgot how important the dialogues in the film can play, and in this film they are absolute ... rubbish! The filming sites were also attractive, but hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogues drove it all to below zero. In addition, I am quite allergic to the world of motor sport, and I find no interest in this sport. Even the inept dialogues in The Love Story were better than in this film (and that says something !!). I really expected the best from this movie and was very disappointed that I was so let down.
