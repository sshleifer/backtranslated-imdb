I read here messages about the Wonder Woman costume for this television film. It should be noted that during the filming of the film she was not wearing a traditional costume. In the early seventies, the producers adhered to the concept of WW comics. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, I have to agree with many other posters. Snoozefest! I was a kid when he appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was at that age when I appreciated a film about a comic book hero. And yet I was so “absorbed” by the plot that I stopped watching it three-quarters in the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was not at that age to appreciate Katie Lee! :-)
