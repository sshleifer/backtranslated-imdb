The original Boogeyman was a silly, but entertaining, supernatural film. It was not a great movie, but fun in the right mood. The third edition of this series, The Return of the Bugmen, on the contrary, is simply terrible. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless new footage. Secondly, LOADS from recycled bits from the first movie. New stuff is incredibly amateur, but not very funny, just incredibly tedious. These frames were clearly brought together quickly and without any effort. It serves as a frame for endless clips from the first (and, possibly, second) films. And boy, they milk those clips from earlier films; sometimes reuse sequences over and over. The only new addition to these parts is the voice over, which meaninglessly describes what we see with our eyes. Watching this is truly overwhelming. <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman Return is an example of the worst kind of exploitation; the kind that exploits the audience is very cynical. I want this review to be brief and specific, because this film no longer deserves. There is nothing valuable here. It costs nothing.
