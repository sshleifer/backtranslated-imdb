I have not seen a lot of low-budget films, which I have to admit, but this is the worst film that the main character has ever been, probably, the old man spoke to, he had a lobotomy and he lost the ability to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, 5 summer can act better. The plot had the most terrible plot, and itâ€™s good that the guy from the army put what he considered to be an army and then just went over the top, I just watched her laugh at how bad it was and hoped that it would lead to to the film, I can't believe it was under 2 nights for rent on blockbusters, instead of taking it for free and putting it out of sight. I think there was one almost decent actor, besides a woman, I think the only thing that is good with the budget is makeup, but they show every important scene of the film at the beginning of the musical beat. Awful just awful.
