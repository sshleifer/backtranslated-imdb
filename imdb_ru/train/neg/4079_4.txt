I bought a DVD with this film for my girlfriend, who bears the same name as the ghost girl in this film, and loves paranormal films. The film was shot entirely on video, so it looks like PBS. The special effects look weird, but in fact there are some scary moments in the film that make us jump into place. Especially effective fear associated with the statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, the acting game is bad, the plot plots are long and very boring, and I will tell you that I have no idea what the end has happened. If you get a movie, rent it, if you buy it, make sure you pay less than $ 5.
