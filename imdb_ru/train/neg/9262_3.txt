At first glance, the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in an exorcist, when girls are obsessed or damn effective, it is very effective. But in Omen 4, it smelled. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think that she can be a devilish child; rather, she is a child with problems. Questions that can only help the therapist, not the priest. She doesn't look scary or devilish. Rather, she looks sullen and capricious. <br /> <br /> This film had potential, and if it was made by the same people who made the previous three films, it could work. But it is really a shame to continue one of the most beloved horror trilogies, as specially created for a television film. <br /> <br /> On many levels this fails. Looks cheap, acting and effects are typical of television drama. Characters do not cause sympathy, and you are not confused with them. Recently, I looked at it again after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it became outdated. <br /> <br /> If you think to watch this, I would advise you not to do this. Look at one of the others, or the exorcist, or the good son. Just do not waste your time on this nonsense!
