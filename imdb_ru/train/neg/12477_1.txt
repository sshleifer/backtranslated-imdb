This is one of those films that you and a group of friends are sitting on, drinking beer, eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately for me, I found myself watching this one alone. My friends and I shot a big block of films and never saw this one. It was because I came back, and I thought it was a waste - not to watch it. I did, and I was impressed with how terrible this film was. <br /> <br /> Now I really like bad movies, and I probably would have liked this if the “hero” were not so disgusting. The whole movie I was hoping that he would drop this stupid sword and allow someone to kill him! He does very few heroic things in the film. He is cheeky, disgusting, stupid. He has less redemptive qualities than the villains. And what was it with all the naked chicks? I mean, I love nude chicks just like the next guy, but this film was overboard in this department. <br /> <br /> Well, in any case, if you like bad movies and can tolerate a disgusting hero, “Then I'm sure you will like this movie from the movie.
