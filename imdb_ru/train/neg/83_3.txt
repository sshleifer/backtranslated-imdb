Jill Dunn (played by Mitzi Kapture), an attractive, sweet woman, exhausted by her intelligent mouth-daughter Liv (Martha Mackaac) and a petty, courageous husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of whom were tediously self-centered and disgusting. <br /> <br /> It was advertised as a restless family, pursued by a crazy killer during an unrelenting storm. <br /> <br /> The storm doesn't even happen until the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then sending someone to the storm cell is about. <br /> <br /> Tracking also does not become intense almost until the very end of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the films weâ€™re doing while listening to Jill and her unbearable daughter Liv argue until I just want to slap my daughter next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv is that she contacted Zach, a boy of dubious nature, and they are constantly sorted out - in fact, Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv's bed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the time we listen to Jill's husband, Shawn, either whine at Jill or criticize her. <br /> <br /> Sean was not at all attractive - as his face is covered with freckles, you can play by connecting the dots. <br /> The story begins with the fact that Jill receives a notice of an outstanding bill on their credit card for the hotel in which she had never been, and that she thought that Sean had never been in any. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner and manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, elderly, divorced man who sympathizes with her. In fact, when he sees his husband there again, he calls Jill and calls her. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without seeing Sean, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he gets home. It didn't make sense to me. <br /> <br /> Jill gave Richard her business card, and so he calls her and she apparently does the real estate business. She shows him the apartment. After that, they drink, and between them it becomes cozy. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill make it hot and heavy. In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary when Jill suddenly decides to give up. <br /> <br /> Jill and Shawn confront his betrayal. Sean whines about how Jill has let him down since her father died. Apparently, his absence of any morals is her fault. In the end, Jill admits that Sean lacks morality and a close relationship to adultery, and, of course, Sean is to blame for everything. <br /> <br /> A small family decides to go camping. - which means more whining and grumbling among them, especially from a spoiled daughter. <br /> <br /> I was so rooting for the pursuer to get everyone but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
