Why should the stories of Mary and Childbirth be so harsh? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why are there very few references to the original show and characters? The daughter characters were stupid and uninteresting. Why can't there be daughters who like their mother on TV? It makes sense that Mary will leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda will return to New York, but why can't the Phillies or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems like a pathetic way to memorize such wonderful characters. Of course, it was nice to see Mary and Roda together, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there was the Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion Show, the Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, I hope Mary will be better next time if she visits her old Mary Richards again.
