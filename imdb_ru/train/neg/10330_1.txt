Wow, here it is finally; action "movie" without action. In a real budget setting (do not miss the fun flying saucers flying several times) of the future Seattle, we find a carefree die-hard man seeking revenge for his childhood. <br /> <br /> Thereâ€™s nothing even a remotely original or interesting plot and acting game only foolishly compete with attempts to steal other films, mainly The Matrix, without having the money to do it right. Yes, we see some running around the walls and slow firefights (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are about as steep as attempts of a silly rigid body to joke about male incompetence from time to time. <br /> And, yes, we are also provided with a number of potential clients who do not lead anywhere, as if the script had been invented by a previously invisible actor during the filming of scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me, this is as bad as possible. In fact, it does not deserve a serious attitude, but perhaps I can force some of you not to rent it and save you money.
