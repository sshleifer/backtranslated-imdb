It must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember watching him many years ago when he first appeared on video, and for some strange reason it seemed to me that I liked him. So, like an idiot, I ran out to buy a DVD as soon as it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even go into the plot, because it is so transparent that you can still see through it. I'm a fan of Gershella Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to the stupid effects of blood and bad actions, but these people take it to a completely different level. Itâ€™s almost as if they were deliberately trying to make the worst movie humanly possible ... if that was their goal, they succeeded. If they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe that it was real, then they failed ... WHY! Avoid this movie ... read the plot synopsis and you've already seen it!
