This film does have noirish / neorealist great visuals, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood sugar coating, which was possible only because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some scenes go on for too long (especially the wedding), and I found that an exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialogue is more appropriate for the stage than for the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly distracting, and it seemed that things were getting worse with the development of the film. Most of the characters were either Italian Americans or Italian immigrants who lived in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialogue sounded as if they were practicing the plots for the Shakespeare play when they mixed cement and laid bricks. In the end, I laughed, not because the directors wanted me to do it. I believe that stilted poetry can be defended by saying that the characters would speak Italian, and dialogue is a literal translation of how they actually speak. But it absolutely did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Another line of dialogue made me laugh for another reason: the son of the protagonist, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, unexpectedly raises the wonderful lust of a British accent. I just assume that this is somehow related to the fact that the film was shot in England. <br /> <br /> I give this film an “A” rating for its efforts and intentions, but for a performance rating that is significantly lower.
