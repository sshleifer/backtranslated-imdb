Potential was there. I saw Krip and thought several times: “Oh, this is getting interesting.” Yet somehow, interesting plot lines turned out to be unexplained or ignored, as if they never existed. The main character annoyed throughout the film, and once my boyfriend and I both screamed that we wanted her to die. There are some really scary / scary moments, but they are extremely clouded by moments that just annoyed me. This is another one of these horror films that pops up for a while and intrigues you, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the filmmakers tried to achieve. the movie is a bad guy, but when the villain is more likeable than the main character, you know that you lost.
