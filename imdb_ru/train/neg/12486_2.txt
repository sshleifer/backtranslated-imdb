Rich idiot Joan Winfield (sadly mistaken Bette Davis) is engaged to marry the stupid selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson looks lost). Her father (Eugene Pallett) is determined to end the marriage, and she was kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney. Seriously). They fall to the ground in the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) begin to fall in love. <br /> <br /> This seems to be praised by reviewers here only because Kagney and Davis are participating. They were both brilliant actors, but they were known for dramas and NOT comedy, and this film shows why! The script is simply terrible - in the whole film there is not a single real laugh. In this joking joke, Cagney and Davis fall booty in a cactus (this is done THREE TIMES!). Only their significant talents save them from complete humiliation. How they both do their best with lousy stuff. Cagney tries his best with his lines, and Davis screams every line in full force, but it doesn't work. Throughout the film, Carson has the expression “what the hell” on his face (probably because his characters' emotions change in seconds). Only the Palette with his characteristic voice and excessive reading manages to cause several smiles. But, in general, it was boring and without laughter - a real routine to put up with. It gets two stars only for the actions of Cagney and Davis and some excellent cinematography, but in fact - it's not worth watching. Cagney and Davis hated this film in the following years, and you can see why.
