The reason this is such a bad film is because it is very poorly written, and it is entirely the fault of the hacker novelist Robert James Waller, also the author of Madison County Bridges. Scripture is bad, because the plot is completely banal, and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A bad couple - a blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a story she is ashamed of - is swept up by a strong, independent criminal and after several adventures (mostly terribly cruel) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the killer, she leaves the impotent killer partner, who, no matter how bad, sees her more clearly than anyone else before. Nothing can help this film succeed, even the face of Scott Glenn in the role of the killer, nor the attractive breadth of Giovanna Zacharias in the role of Lous, and even Harvey Keitel's unsurpassed performance in the role of a CIA specialist to track down the killer. Serious waste of time.
