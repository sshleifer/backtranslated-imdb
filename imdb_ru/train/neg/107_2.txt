If the Zombie Chronicles team ever read this, here are a few tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In a Twist-Final film, you shouldnâ€™t put EVERYTHING DEATH IN A FILM close-up into the opening credits. It tends to mess up turns, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know that you did it on a scanty basis and, frankly, you worked wonders with your budget, but please hire people who can really act. Or at least walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I look at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you are going to shoot part of your movie in the past, do it only if you have the requisites and costumes of that time. <br /> <br /> 4. Completion of the ending should be a surprise. Of course, we do not need turns, which do not make sense, but the designation of "disclosure" as soon as you introduce the character? This is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the guys for trying, but to be honest, I would prefer them not to do this ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombie trailers.
