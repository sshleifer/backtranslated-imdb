Like most people, I was shocked to buy this film, because pictures of the mighty Bolo Yenga pasted all over the box, and the assumption (from the above pictures and the name of the film) that this film was completely about the Beast from Vostok kicks ass for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, to my disappointment, “Chinese Hercules” for Bolo Young — that which was not a retreat, was not surrendered to Jean-Claude Van Damme; exposure to video, the minimum actual screen time! Well! <br /> <br /> The storyline is a fairly simple material, but it was well-made — the peaceful kung-fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a person and promises never to fight again. Then he runs off to work as a laborer on the pier, where he impresses his colleagues with his skill in lifting a heavy bag, forcing them to suspect him as a formidable fighter (I don’t quite know how it works, but never mind). Meanwhile, the corrupt pier boss makes a deal with the gangsters, giving them exclusive use of the pier. As a result, workers are thrown into their ears and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their boss, the gangster boss and his clumsy minion Bolo Yenga. <br /> <br /> While the film was quite watchable (mainly because of the expectation of the next Bolo glimpse), I had several problems with it - firstly, a bad dubbing, but, of course, it is given in old films about kung Fu. But also, the film tended to stretch between different scenes of struggle. As for the battle scenes themselves, I discovered that they are too long, poorly placed (obviously, Jackie Chan!), Poorly shot and sometimes performed by people who seem to have no abilities in the martial arts ... in fact In fact, most of the fights in this film were not “fights” at all, they just beat them, without providing any resistance! <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero played by Chen Hui Min. I have never seen other films with this guy, but I have never been a fan of him. Not only did he always look weak and on the verge of tears, but I found that he insists on not fighting with rabies! I understood his reasoning, but he could have saved many people from a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew that he would do in the end and fight! An even bigger mystery was why this whole community of people pinned their hopes on a guy they had never seen in a fight! <br /> <br /> Indeed, the great grace of salvation in this film was the presence of Bolo Young. He is not only huge and cruel, as always, he has some wonderful, funny lines and he gives the rest of the actors a master class on how to fight in the movies. The guy exudes the presence of the screen, and you can easily see how he became a star. The guy scares me to death, but I’m sure that I wasn’t the only one watching this film who had been supporting Bolo throughout the fight! <br /> <br /> In general, a below-average film about kung-fu raised several huge chipping because you know who. I have never met a man who did not think that Bolo Jung was great. Legendary person!
