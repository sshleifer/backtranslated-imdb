As a southern Baptist, it hurts me that I have to give a rating below average for a frankly Christian film. Of course, not so much that I wanted to dissuade filmmakers from the genre, which is terribly used. Nevertheless, I must honestly say that “Love is an eternal joy” is a typically low-budget, discreet, consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, acting mediocre (I'm good), and editing is brutal. As a television film, it could be a little above average, but as a feature film, it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You should have a film about real Christians somewhere. May I suggest that you turn to J. C. Chesterton or S. S. Lewis for inspiration?
