On the “Trivia” page on IMDb, they claim that the filmmakers protested because this film was cut by the studio to “simplify the plot.” If so, then these efforts were a complete failure, as this is one of the most inconsistent narratives I have ever seen in the film — I would not like to see it until the plot was “simplified.” <br /> <It is sad to see Warren with such a small temper that even he cannot do anything with inept material. It is interesting to see Caron in the 70s mode instead of her glamorous clothes and character of a Hollywood era, but it is sad to see her hopelessly wandering through this started game “do me a favor to my husband”. In fact, she would later contact him and marry the director, who, as you will notice, never directed anything else, but from that moment he was strictly engaged in the 1st or 2nd anniversary of working in television. This is enough to tell you about it right now. <br /> <br /> I call this “interesting” because I have an automatic love for American films of this period, and this role really adds perspective to the Oates fantastic film of 1971 (Two - Lane Tchertop, Hired Hand). But "the detective story of the 1940s is like a fish out of water in the 1970s, LA" The theme, which is the only thing the film actually has to say, is sold too awkwardly. A similar topic would have been much more effectively resolved in two years in Altman's Long Farewell. And since Oates is playing a stern guy on a doomed errand, in three years he will give his final performance in Alfredo Garcia's “Bring Me To Your Head”. If you have not seen this yet, do not waste time on it!
