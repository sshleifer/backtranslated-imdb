I have seen most, if not all classic Laurel and Hardy films. I always stupidly liked it there, even after I watched it again and again. This new film is trying to bring back the classics with two new actors like Laurel and Hardy, but fails for different reasons. One of which is how irrelevant their fabrics are (still at the beginning of the 20th century), however both are depicted in the 90s settlement. Some of the previous dialogues were returned, but they also could not come close to classic TV shows. This film may well be the worst film I've ever seen, and should be taken off the shelf and locked up forever. The real Laurel and Hardy turn sullenly in their graves with such a bad imitation.
