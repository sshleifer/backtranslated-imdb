This film made me very angry. I desperately wanted to strangle the "scientists" and the invisible directors during all this. It is very, very painful to sit. Sophomical and pretentious at worst. Some good information about brain functions / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in the sea of ​​a new age. The worst criminals were the charlatans "Crackpot" Ramtha and Joseph Dispens. Mr. Dispensé tells us that most people lead a mediocre life, and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, lives on a higher level. Even the ideas and views, with which I mostly agree, are presented in such a cruel, awkward, excellent, pretentious, preaching manner that I felt the desire to disavow them. I think it made me so angry that the fact that they took really deep aspects of established scientific thought and spoiled them with their new age. This is largely due to the error in applying the concepts of quantum theory to the macrocosm. Suitably theatrical pieces with Marley Matlin are amateur and cliche. <br /> <br /> Instead, I would refer people to the excellent scientific review of Bill Bryson: "A Brief History of Almost Everything." There are many deep wonders about life and the universe in real, well-established science.
