When I watch movies, I don’t go to bed and watch it, or if I don’t like it, I go to bed, but it was nonsense, I actually got up and left! together i hated it. In addition, they should not have removed Brendan Fraser, he was much better. It was not as good as I expected, considering that I really liked George from Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first, for example, the bird, and when it fell on a tree. I hope that the director will listen to this, and in the next films he makes, he needs to reconsider ... horror! I really would like to give Ursle a job well done, as she made the film worthy (until I left) ... in general, I give this film 2 of 10
