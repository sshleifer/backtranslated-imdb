I can lovingly recall Bo Bo Derek's heyday and the attention of the UK press (especially Sun & News of the World dirty newspapers) - all after her small role in “10” with Dudley Moore. It is clear that a lot of fuss caused her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly shaped jumping breasts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is never a strong point! I think they should make one of the three collections of discs that you will always find in DVD baskets - Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All these films can be nominated for "So bad that they are great." <br /> <br /> This will be my fault, “you have to buy”! If you have ever read your press or this comment, Miss Derek, do not be offended - you have always had a weak spot, and more important things happen in the world that you need to worry about than your acting skills. Lots of love.x
