Watching the channels late Saturday evening, my friends and I stumbled upon this film. First of all, is Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as Native American? Seriously?! His accent broke through so much, although his character was clearly Scottish. Then I was stunned to find that this film was shot after he had already played James Bond / Agent 007 twice. This film reproduces stereotypes with the inspirational figure of the professor. The girl who played the pony, you need to pay, so she kept her mouth shut. And this film received an award? I can not believe this. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously wanted to evaluate our eyes, watching this for only 10 seconds. We switched from Kicking and Screaming to this, and we wanted to switch back. Earlier in the night, we watched the 1995 Nursery Classic in the Nursery, in which the Iroquois were also discussed. The next line represents our desire to escape: “Get me outside, farmer.” From the "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you do not need to look."
