the only thing that often pops up in my head when I write this review is that I will never get this half an hour ago !!! To show that I’m not just blowing air, I’ll compare the film to other films of the cube trilogy (the cube and the hypercube)! the cube was not great, but it was original, and this made up for some technical flaws! the sequel lost the advantage of originality, but it looked rather sharp, and I even liked that it was better than a cube (the story was better)! but the zero cube in comparison with its predecessors is really not worth anything, the complete absence of good effects, a very bad scenario and just the old bad game are not well combined! example: all the time during the movie I thought it would be incredibly stupid if ... it happened, and then it would happen, so this is also not very original! my advice: do not lose the hour and a half that I lost !!!!!!!! oh and i hope this movie falls and burns !!!!!!!
