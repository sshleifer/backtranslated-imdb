Iâ€™m really starting to believe that Seagal will see how his films can become trashy. This particular film was a complete and waste of time watching. My first complaint was the DVD cover, where they wrote his photo. and made him look slimmer and younger when in the movie he looked like shit. He has a big belly and a double chin, and on it was the most pitiful and boring expression. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was ridiculous from the very beginning and was drawn for too long. The entire film led to the finale, where Seagal and his team had to fight a bunch of people under the influence of top-secret military chemical adrenaline. a lot of useless dialogue, not to mention the ridiculous and constant duplication of Seagal's voice even in the middle of a statement. The voiced voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was rather comical. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the fight in the film were terrible. Half the time when Seagal Fugue you could not even see what was happening. There will be tight shots when he claps his hands on the camera, and then the person flies through a wall or something like that. It was like an old kung fu series on television. too slow motion for battle scenes. <br /> <br /> I think it's the worst Seagals movie to date, and I'm glad I didn't buy this movie, or I would be very upset because I'm a big fan of Seagal Aikidoist. The action star quickly fades away and seems to get worse with each performance.
