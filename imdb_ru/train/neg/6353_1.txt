For comedian author Woody Allen really brings a paid viewer with this meager attempt at character development. There are a few interesting points, but no more than anyone could listen to their drying drum tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is wasting his time in this film, which does not show his usually fun game. Amanda Pete did well, but again, she had no place to move to this otherwise corpse-like film. The film is so heavy and boring that you can't carry it, but if you carry it, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you like films that continue in one scene, and you do not achieve anything, except to show that their writer can write several lines of quick dialogue, then you will like the movie.
