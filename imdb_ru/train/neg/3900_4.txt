As a person who has read the book, I can say that it is significantly inferior to the big American version with Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead role. There are various reasons for this. First, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, she has flaws, and this is not the easiest person to like, but the viewer should not directly start to despise her. Secondly, Mr. Knightley is mistaken. His thoughtfulness and melancholy in this version are better suited to adapt Bronte or Gaskell than Austin, and cast the mood of the whole thing "away." Thirdly, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet; and why was she made to look so bad? Harriet should be blonde and blooming - not to look like sheâ€™s going to get carried away in the next scene. Fourth, the structure was destroyed and the scenes were cut out. In the end, when Emma decides that she loves Mr. Knightley, this seems completely incomprehensible, because this narrative was not adequately shown and continued throughout the entire film. Fifth, what exactly happened with Mrs. Elton's accent? She went from being like an American actress, trying to suppress her own accent at first, to the entire American half, and then back to English at the end. Finally, it sucked at the end. The book and the big version of the film end with the wedding of Emma and Mr. Knightley. After the announcement of the wedding, this version looks confusing, but does not show us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> In general, a rather random attempt. Read a book or take the Paltrow version in return.
