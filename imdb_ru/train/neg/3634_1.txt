A boring childhood fantasy that gives Joan Plowite a star billing, but does little. Juicy children pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (wk), while Hazel's best friend is running for mayor - she is 13 years old! Absolutely pedestrian in all respects, plus an additional lack of syrupy performances of both girls and baseball players. Of course, less effort for Showtime --- no limits?
