This film is not funny. It is not interesting. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it force you to show the slightest interest in characters or situations. In addition to this, he is the same youthful film, like everything else lately. It’s as if a group of 14–15-year-old schoolchildren who never actually met or didn’t have any relationship with a real girl, sat down and wrote a film based on their wrong fantasies about being an adult man, the film is boring, unpleasantly stunning, and sometimes offensive and disgusting. At the most, it contains one or two points that make you laugh. In addition, it seems twice as long as 85 minutes.
