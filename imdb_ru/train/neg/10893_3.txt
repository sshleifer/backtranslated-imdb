This is one of those films that were supposed to be much better than it turned out. I’m afraid to think about how the blockbuster-approved editing should look like, because the directing version on DVD was a bore of epic proportions. Naturally, you do not expect it to be The Godfather, but one or two acting classes might be useful. <br /> <br /> There were so many nice guys in this movie, but they were unfortunately not under-exploited. I like to watch a bunch of hot girls writhe in their BVDs just like the next guy, but even I have the right to expect a bit more. It was not a complete loss, though; at least we looked at Drew Fuller's (closed) trash and really upset him. And there is Huntley Ritter, looking even prettier than he did in “Bring It On” (and acting much the same). There is always a silver lining, children. You just have to look very hard for this. And sometimes you have to use the pause button.
