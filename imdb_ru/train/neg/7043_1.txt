I was ready to laugh throughout this film, as an experiment of the Science Theater of the Mysteries, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had a lot of friends, enthusiastic bikers, and from there they accidentally decided to make a film. <br /> <br /> Often unavailable for viewing. Many videos of bikers riding along a dirt road, with the same music that they play repeatedly. Unfortunately, Rene Harmon is barely in the film. Harmon would probably liven up the situation. She may have had other commitments on the day of the shoot. <br /> <br /> Of course, bikers are terrorizing a small city. Fights, murders, cowardly policeman, dumb mechanic, etc. One of the bikers always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all other criminals. <br /> <br /> The scenario has nothing to offer. In one scene, a biker attacks a woman and screams in her face: “You are all the same! You are all the same!". We return to the site after a minute, and he again declares: “You are all the same!”. Could the writer come up with something more creative to say? <br /> <br /> In the end, the good guys killed the bad guys. We also learn that the wedding between middle-aged mechanic Joe and young Susie has been canceled. Suzy goes to college and we suddenly find out that Joe's wedding is still going on (but with another bride). The end.
