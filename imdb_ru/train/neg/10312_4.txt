As an impressionable 10-year-old, I liked the philosophy of “love conquers all” of the 70s comedy series Bridget Love's Bernie. I really understood the contradiction that was about the romantic complications between the Jewish taxi driver (David Byrne) and the teacher of the Irish Catholic school (Meredith Baxter) and both sets of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents; Audra Lindley) and David Doyle ( Bridget's parents), who have problems with the interfaith marriage of a young couple. <br /> <br /> Looking at the show with many years of personal life experience, I am amazed that even one show was successful, although the season was highly rated. “Bridget Loves Burney,” created by veteran television series Bernard Slade, who a few years after the series was canceled, wrote the successful play “That Time Next Year,” was a very light, superficial comedy that fell apart under its own air weight. br /> <br /> There was no doubt about the real chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in later years, both actors showed that they are the best actors in other projects (Byrney in his short role in “St. Friend” and Baxter in “Family” and “Family Ties”). Here they tried to breathe life into a show that needed a much brighter comic point that could give a more controversial theme to complications. <br /> <br /> The show was broadcast on Saturday evening between two CBS power plants. : "Everyone in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these shows were clever, funny and had enough wit (more on the first than the second), which supported my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Lovese Bernie" was not very smart and had only some random chuckles. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a show that actually wasn't as good as I remembered.
