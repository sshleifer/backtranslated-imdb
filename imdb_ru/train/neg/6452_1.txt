You know the story .. Pretty children are alone in the forest when BAM! Something starts to cut them. <br /> <br /> Well, this shit is no different. A group of children returns to the cabin, where a man leads a twin. Brother has disappeared many years before. Suddenly, "UNKNOWN CREATION" cuts them, and their only help is a doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> To say that this film was bad is an understatement, that is nonsense! The game was terrible. <br /> <br /> The creature looked very stupid. And as in all films these days, they try to capture a twist-final, which they donâ€™t have! <br /> <br /> There is one bright spot in this film - the lost star Maggie Grace in the title role.
