I have seen many, many pieces of The Nutcracker. Now, perhaps, I watched this film from the spoiled point of view of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that people in a particular business of ballet choreography find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical point of view, I found everything, from design to choreography, dull and unsuitable for “motion pictures”. None of the traditionally “weird” and impressive costumes looked as expected (i.e., the candies did not look like candies, the rats did not look like rats, but rather like chocolate kisses), the game was weak, perhaps too much for the screen, and the choreography did nothing for me. This makes the whole performance very satisfactory (at best), as if it were intended to be no different from any other production. But remember, again, this is from an artistic point of view of a theater director, not a dancer or choreographer, but a direct male theater director.
