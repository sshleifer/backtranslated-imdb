My husband and I found this film very stupid. It all started well, but it quickly became incredible and ridiculous. Most of the game was bad, except for the little girl, Abby, who was really awesome. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and unconvincing - especially Gideon, the angel. In addition, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, it almost seems careless. At first we thought it was a “shock,” but then we realized that it was just a horrible scenario. We love almost all the Hallmark films and their heartbreaking stories, but this film is not suitable for becoming one. There are so many great ones - don't waste your time on this horrible movie.
