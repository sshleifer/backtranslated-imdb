“Power Rangers” is definitely the worst TV show and completely absurd line of plastic toys in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> There is nothing even spectacular in this absolutely terrible TV show. <br /> This is just the worst show ever made, with terrible actors dressed up in colorful spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no use for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Today’s children should try to watch the best shows, such as the Toy Story movies, and not this trash.
