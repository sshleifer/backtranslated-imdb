They probably should have called this film “The Map” because most of the whole silly film revolves around the cemetery map. Not to mention how many boring pictures on the map. The only thing that they show more than the card itself is small drops of sweat that constantly accumulate on the forehead of our main character. This, of course, was the way filmmakers showed us how incredibly tense things climb the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on, could they not show us just one of the death scenes? We hear a lot about how all those on the map fall like flies, but we see nothing. Some way I buried The Living managed to hold my attention, so I was pretty generous with the rating I gave, but I will not recommend this movie to anyone If you are not into cards or later, I recommend making the best movie, for example I spit on your grave "or" I drink your blood.
