It was just a terrible movie. It was painful to look at that. Almost every action was unmotivated in the context of the film, the acting was really bad (P. Diddy was the best actor who really says something about the film), and the plot was generally predictable. Some references to Carlitoâ€™s Way were fine, for example, his dream of moving to Caribien one day, but in general they were weak. A love interest in my mind was being thinned wrong, but hey, this is debatable. In any case, I really did not expect much before watching the film, and I think you could say that even these expectations were not fulfilled. I feel bad because of Jay Hernandez, because he really is a worthy actor (Friday night lights). He was lucky because I am sure that there will not be too many people watching this film. I usually give films a decent rating, if they make me interested at all, so I'm going to give it two stars. Lucky next time. And yes, I really liked the way Carlito.
