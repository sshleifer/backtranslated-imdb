The only thing that is worse than surfers without waves is a film about surfers without waves. For viewers who love surfing, this film will be a huge disappointment, as the total number of surfing minutes is struggling to reach three. <br /> <br /> History is a piece of life about the surf that stands on the beach and is not waiting for the perfect wave, but for any wave at all. J.S. (Sean Pertwy) is an aging super-surfer who flirts with devotion to his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta-Jones). As soon as he is going to find adult bliss with his beloved woman, three old surfing friends come and convince him to go to the beach in search of monstrous waves in the Boneyard. The problem is that until the very end of the film there are no waves, so most of the story is scattered on a winding series of scattered beach events. <br /> <br /> Acting is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a few funny moments, but mostly his game was mundane. Ewan McGregor was a decent person involved in drug trafficking, by far the most interesting and unique character of the group. Probably the funniest performance was Peter Gunn in the role of Terry, who turned his fat body into a constant spectacle. Catherine Zeta-Jones, as usual, was sexy, but her character did not really have enough meat to demonstrate good acting skills. <br /> <br /> There are not many comments here. I rated it 3/10. This is a real beach bummer.
