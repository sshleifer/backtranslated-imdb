When I first heard about the “Solar Crisis,” and then received a load from the actors, I was surprised why I had never heard of a movie with such a big performance before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For a film that covers space, the sun, vast deserts and megacities, this is a terribly tight and claustrophobic feature; it seems that everyone is sitting next to each other, so the camera should not move too far back. <br /> <br /> The effects, although good, are quite impressive; We are talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth, if a team of scientists and soldiers will not be able to reflect the deadly solar flare. But apart from the screams, sweating and red glow about everything, there is no special sense of an emergency. <br /> <br /> Don't start me with the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, and others do in this film, even without bothering to act with any feeling for the material, can only be guessed. Makes you think, for whose apartments do not pay in Hollywood .... <br /> <br /> And to the end .... Well, let's say, it is intense and intriguing, but too little late in such efforts. If he had maintained such a pace throughout the entire film, perhaps I would have heard of the "Sunshine Crisis" before. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly for missed opportunities and bad career moves. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithy does his job, how is this trash?
