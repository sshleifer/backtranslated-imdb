At some point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neela (Cillian Murphy) about why she is constantly looking for adventure. She said: "because I am arrogant." This means that she cannot truly live her life by performing some mandatory actions. Well, I think its reason and the path of this film are very ironic. Because “Watching detectives” is a fun boredom. <br /> <br /> Did any of these characters really do anything exciting this time? Neil is a geek who has his own little video rental store. He and his other geek friends usually walk around the store and watch movies together, and then discuss them. But Neil's life changes completely when Violet enters his store. She is an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. Anyway, after some dates, they decide to see each other. The problem is that Violet is a person who constantly jokes with Neil and cannot do something normal, while Neil is completely opposite to her. The question is. Are they going to fall in love at the end? You bet. <br /> <br /> “Watching detective stories” is essentially a romantic comedy of cliches. And they made it worse by pretending to be something else. From the first few setups, we know that Neil is a pretty laid-back guy who really is not committed to anything. And then Violet takes the stage, looking weird and annoying. So, at the moment, we all know that we are going to sit in all meaningless situations to find out how they will end up. Is it worth the wait? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give something more to the audience. "Observation of detectives" is trying to talk about commitment. Watch how far people go to achieve something they desire. In the end, we knew that the insane acts that Violet had done were checking how far Neal was willing to go to win her heart (or something else). Well, I think that is complete nonsense. This film will end pretty quickly if Neil just says to himself: “Forget about it, this girl is crazy!” After a recent collaboration with many great directors (“Sunshine” and “28 days later” by Danny Boyle, “The Wind That Shakes the Barley "Ken Loach and Neil Jordan's" Breakfast on Pluto "), this is a rather strange choice for Cillian Murphy starring in the film with the comedy squad Broken Lizard Paul Soter. Of course, he is not bad (as usual), but such a talented actor as he should not waste his time in a film like this. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly awful, like Violet. Her play is a mess. I mean, it's all over the place and so excessive. Tony Montana would be proud. <br /> <br /> The last but no less important mistake in the film is a completely irrelevant title. You simply cannot connect the point between the plot and its title; and then you finish thinking that it makes no sense at all. In short, “Watching Detectives” is nice if you forget about the movie, and you may have a chance to capture it on cable television so quickly that you can't even imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
