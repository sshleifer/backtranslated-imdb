“Hak Hap” or “Black Mask” (in English) was a disappointment. I was told that this is a kind of "Japanese version of the Matrix." Imagine my disappointment. The film was either poorly dubbed, or the soundtrack was not well combined with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was largely bad. Very little thought was put into the English version of this film, and this applies only to the genre of "mindless action." Not a movie I would like to see again.
