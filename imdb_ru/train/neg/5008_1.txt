No reason to watch this movie. The good idea of ​​the plot is handled very badly. In the middle of a movie, everything changes and nothing else makes sense from there. The reason for the murder is not clear. The game is terrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was excellent in the bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson from Buffy once has to change her character. Even those of you who love useless sex and violence will be disappointed. Although the film lasted 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this), there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts of the characters. /> <br /> Don't waste time on this.
