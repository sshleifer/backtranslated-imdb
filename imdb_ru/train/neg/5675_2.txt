The Seed set in the 70s is centered around convicted serial killer Max Cid (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. He is sentenced to death, but he does not die in the electric chair, even after being hit three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Pare) and other officers hide this secret, burying the Seed alive, Seed flares up and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin. <br /> <br /> Shot by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), “Seed” is nothing more than a film about trying to stretch the shell of a decent society and will not be able to provide in any aspect of the storyline. And he said that it is based on real events, because if a person survives in an electric chair after being hit three times, he will be released. This is a city legend, and this will never happen. Much like the other abominations of Ball ("Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seed" is just awful.
