I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35 pm last night, watching Larry Sanders (I usually do this DirecTivo, but not last night). I woke up at 3 am (an investment banker on the west coast) and was delighted to see it on HBO2. I was shocked by how poor this “movie” is. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a comment on iMDB. This is really very bad. Writing is boring, but the direction and editing is simply lower than that of a film beginner. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a video shot. Keep in mind that this is captured on video, not digital video. It looks like a soap opera. Skateboard video clips seem to them more “cinematic” than this horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe a bad director, but to be honest, I don’t remember anything. Shots and blocks are stupid. Yes, I chose the word "stupid." not unconventional, not brave, not brave, not boring, just stupid. I know that people reviewing this review will say, “Well, give me an example.” I cant. It was 3 in the morning. but believe me, I know that you still watch it, terrible reviews will attract you. <br /> <br />
