I rented this movie for a laugh. I have never seen a parody of SNL, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, things could not be so bad, could it? The answer is: it was. This film was hardly a means of rest after a hard dayâ€™s work. I just kept on waiting for the plot and the funny part, but there was no. The highlight was Tiffany Amber Tyson, and that's just about it.
