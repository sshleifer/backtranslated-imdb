This film was a disappointment. I was looking forward to a good movie. I am the person who starts the film and does not turn it off until the end, but I forced myself not to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn’t turn it off was because I’m a big fan of Christian Slater and wanted him to play it. I was really speechless after I finished watching a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Thank you, Christian Slater, for putting a little bit of humor into it. If you were not in this film, I would be bored. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins should continue to play. When the film ended, I did not even understand the plot. I was confused and annoyed.
