It was a weird movie. It all started pretty well. A solid soundtrack for flashes of images of blood and disorder, when our psychopath did his job. <br /> <br /> Then comes his “fall”. Here I can say that a real stupid film “B” is waiting for me. Bad behavior, I mean, how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a policeman? These guys could not. After the scene of the death of our psychopath, we get an initial loan, and the film begins ... <br /> <br /> From this point on, big boobs, an occasional bucket of blood and poorly made death scenes do not work. <br /> However, I gave the film four, because, despite its flaws, there was some kind of creepiness in it that I just could not get rid of. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film, but I must admit that I seem to be worse.
