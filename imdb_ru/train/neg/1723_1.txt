Dude, what is this scam! Not because it wasn’t good (because I didn’t expect anything from it), but because I was misled by the cover of a DVD, which ignorantly exposed its “stars” as Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Of course, their names do not appear in the credits for the opening of the film, and even more so in the rest! As it turned out, the only film that unites these three actors is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975). but what does this have to do with Monster Lake Crater? <br /> <br /> Despite this, since I paid $ 1.50 for his rent, and in any case I was in the mood of a monster movie, I decided to watch the movie no matter if it was, yes, it was smelly! Besides the fact that he had a nameless cast and an anonymous team, the unmistakable amateur air could be seen for many miles, and the most I could do with it was to laugh at JAWS-like claims and, deliberately, over the opposing antics of two moronic boatman owners who often quarrel among themselves, looking at the stunned local sheriff. The creature itself ?? plesiosaurus, that is, half-dinosaur / polish ?? unconsciously (naturally), but, as in the case of The Giant Claw (1957), which I just saw, this did not seem to embarrass the filmmakers, since they flaunt as much as they can, especially in the second half of the film !
