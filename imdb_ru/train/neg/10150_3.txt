Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to appear in this film and was forced to play the role of a Mexican, otherwise he would have been removed. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Presumably, after the success of "Dodge City", Warners tried to continue with Errol Flynn and his regular friends such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mac Hugh and omnipresent John Liteel, but they made a huge mistake trying to present Miriam Hopkins love interest for Flynn vs. Randolph Scott and as a singer to really do everything badly, because she proved one thing, namely, she can't sing. The story was not so bad, but with Bogie, obviously, also erroneous, it turned out that it was a bad western, which was too long and with a small budget, but, frankly, the color would not have helped.
