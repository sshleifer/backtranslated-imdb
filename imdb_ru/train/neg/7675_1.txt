Can it ever be said that there are some films that have no redemption functions at all? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After putting on the post a terrifying director of "House of the Dead", Uwe Boll now cast his less talented look at yet another video game adaptation. Don't these guys understand this? For those who can not understand, here it is for you in capital letters: DO NOT MAKE VIDEO GAMES FOR GOOD FILMS! The game here, at best, does not meet the standards. Scenography and special effects leaves much to be desired. Unlike the video game (which had its scary moments), the film has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or threat. Layout and image are mixed up, and the paper on which the script is printed would be better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses a camera with the grace and skill of a monkey with a brush. Zataskannye zooms, blows and pans crashed into a dreary story in unpredictable moments, leaving the audience disoriented and bored. Why this guy was ever let out near the set, this must be one of the greatest secrets of the modern cinema. Avoid at all costs.
