It is hard to find any positives in this film. It seems that the producer needed to earn money without much effort, and therefore we turn to the full show of the Galaxy, which is the roughest excuse for a film in history. The police girls looked very sexy in their little uniforms. More fighting shots of two cops and a lot smaller than the Galaxy would be the way to go. Of course, this will add to the budget, so they decided to fill the space with this poor restart. Miss Albright looks great sexy, and her acting in the first place, Ms. Stubs, whom I heard, but did not see on the screen, also looked very desirable, but it seems that she lacks basic acting talent. Besides Miss Albright, this is real rubbish.
