As a casual Rolling Stones listener, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, since this film is very "his age" in the 1960s. For me (for someone born in the 1980s) it just looks to me like propaganda for hippie-purist crap, but I’m sure that this film was made not for me, but for people who were active in the 60s years I expected drugs to be in large numbers with th Stones, I was disappointed, in fact it showed real life, hard work in the studio. So much so that I felt that I was working with them to come to the conclusion of this terrible film. I have not seen any of the directors of other films, but I suspect that they follow a similar direction style, a kind of “inquisitive”, which gave the impression that the Eurotrash television show was poorly directed, mercilessly built and devoid of real entertainment value. My only good opinion about this is that I did not spend money on it, it came out free with a Sunday newspaper.
