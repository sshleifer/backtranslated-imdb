I had high hopes for this film, as it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But those hopes fell to the ground in the first 20 minutes or so. Palance was funny. Even Hestonâ€™s action or the beauty of Annabelle Schofield (or short naked scenes) could not save this film. Some of the cosmic effects were pretty good, but others were cheesy. The plot was ridiculous. Even science fiction fans should skip this. Grade F
