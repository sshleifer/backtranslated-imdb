As you may not have heard, there are no real battles between vampires or zombies in this film. Someone may ask why the title says this, but in fact it is appropriate, because nothing else in this film made any sense. There was absolutely no story or plot, just happening. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than safe commercials. <br /> <br /> Not only was there no fight between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. Their make-up looked like it was put on by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was completely random and inappropriate, and one of the characters who fought zombies with a brush cutter (I'm not kidding) participated in it, but they used the sound effects of a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not have ridiculed completely for every person responsible for the production of this film is if I knew that it had been shot completely by an 11-year-old. <br /> <br /> Indeed, despite all the criticism that I offer here, I would advise watching this film solely on the basis of the fact that it may well be the worst movie ever, and because of this he pretty funny. Even by simply counting the flaws in this, you will be entertained.
