Ho-hum The deadly biological weapons of the inventor (Horst Buchholz) can fall into the wrong hands. Not knowing that his son (Luke Perry) works all the time on the antedot. Log in to CIA agent Olivia D'Abo, and the chase for the cat's mouse and shooting will begin. Also in the cast: Tom Conti, Hendrick Hayes and the aging Roger Moore. Moore seems sullenly sneaking through this mess, definitely not from his best efforts. Perry fans will take. D'Abo is not suitable for the role, but it's nice to watch.
