Despite the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing in Lopez was ever funny. I watched him stand, and never resembled laughter. <br /> <br /> His things seem vindictive, and his hostility towards white people oozes from every pore of his body. <Br /> <br /> I laughed at the jokes of white people from many comedians and love many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a grudge that will not end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Latinos who only have this show to present themselves. <br /> <br /> Plots are always cookies with a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> Canned laughter over silly comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> It is possible that this is why this show is always turned on at 2 am during playback.
