This film conveys a fine line between satire and stupidity. Although the system of bridges, in which there are no rules, can contribute to harmony in marriage, it certainly can not contribute to a victorious bridge, so the satire on me did not work. But in any case there were a few things that I liked, especially after the big match between Paul Lucas and Ferdinand Gottschalk at the end of the film. This is considered to be very similar to the boxing championship. Not only is the arena for contests cut in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a judge hanging between the participants, and the broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers continuous chatter about cases. At some point he even lists â€œOne ... Two ... Three. .. Four ..., as if the four-diamond bet was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radio for all of this, a regular event for the boxing championships. This parody really worked very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few actors provide the comedy needed to maintain their intended satire. Paul Lucas has no particular propensity for comedy, and he is incorrectly considered; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comedian Frank McHugh did not give enough good lines; Glenda Farrell has a good comic image in the role of a forgetful blonde at the beginning of the film, but after that she almost disappears. What a waste of talent!
