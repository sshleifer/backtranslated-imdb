in fact, it was pretty funny ... damn it, how the hell did this movie come out? if you’ve been joking movies all your life ... what am I kind of doing ... go and watch it ... but if you really think "is it a good movie?" come off <br /> <br /> this movie sucked from the outset because of the worst role I've ever seen in any movie ... they usually get five minutes before you realize that this movie can suck. " but no, you know right away. This film tells about Edgar Allen Poe ... although he never tried to explain this to people who didn’t remember Poe’s life story ... so I don’t know if a fact. <br /> <This film tells about the writer "Itan Po", who picked up his cousin "Ann" .... both of them are descendants of Edg and Allan Po ... or they?!? apparently, people give what their ancestors did. This guy Ethan Po is actually Ethan "Asher", who is supposed to be a descendant of the history of "House of Aschers" written by Edgar Allen Poe. Anne's brother sometimes appears to try to rape her ... Ann is also pursued, at some point in the film, by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... they are kind of right behind her, looking at her and she is not even aware). characters that are being killed everywhere appear at the end to try to save the day ... but they can't. In the end, Ann shoots Ethan while he tries to kill her best friend. of course, before she shoots him, she must scream "never!" this movie no longer need to watch!
