I watched this film several times, and all I can say is that it is low-budget trash and that it has nothing to do with real historical facts. Actor's activity is very bad, but this is the result of limited acting ability. Anyone who watched this movie now probably thinks of Hitler as some kind of crazy, thin, crazy person who runs with a gun, like some kind of Chicago gangster. I can only say that in those years the films about Hitler and Germany were much better, and the “Revival of Evil” was much lower than average. I can recommend the German film “The Fall,” in which you can see the brilliant performance of the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler.
