Many thought it was a good movie, but I disagree with them. At the beginning of the film, a spacecraft crashed on the ground, and several aliens fled from the spacecraft, then they killed some people on the ground, but for no reason. In addition, he is in a dark forest, I see nothing on the screen, I can barely hear the sound. <br /> <br /> A few days later a predator came to the earth, but no one had sent signals to him, he should not know what happened on the earth, therefore a contradiction arises. Finally, the predator found the director of the aliens and killed him for no reason. He did not live on earth, it is not his business about what happened here. Finally, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short, and it cannot clearly tell the reviewers about the story. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I donâ€™t think this is a good movie.
