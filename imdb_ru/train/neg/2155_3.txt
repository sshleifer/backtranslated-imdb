Good night, Mr. Tom begins in an incredibly exquisite village in the south of England, where the sun always shines. Before we have a lot of understanding of the period, we hear the radio announcement of World War II. Soon the train, blowing in the clouds of steam, will bring refugee children from London, and when shy little William is reluctantly billeted, rude old Tom (who, as you know, will have a heart of gold), our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what is this sentimental cotton! In fact, this is just an old buddy formula. Are there any new stories being written? <br /> <br /> As I expected, there’s almost no time in the village, and in London there’s almost nothing but a strange old ambulance. And, of course, there is not the slightest hint of the horror of Blitz, when the London citizens politely rush into bomb shelters. Even when the husband of a local schoolteacher was reported missing, allegedly killed, he later returns to life. <br /> <br /> I found “Good night, Mr. Tom” shaded and obvious, and John Toth's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of Two Ronnie with a straw in his mouth, emphasizing the “village priest”. <br /> <br /> By the way, my wife liked this film for the reasons why I didn’t like it, and I’m looking at my imdb reviewer colleagues who seem to me to be a minority of one. <br /> <br />
