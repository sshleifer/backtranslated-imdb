First of all, I would like to say that if I had to honestly evaluate this film from 1 to 10, then I would give it -4. It's not that I'm a harsh critic, it's just that this film is SO bad. Everything from the story, to the direction, to the installation is awful. The story is not even half a decent start (you can't expect much, because it is based on a video game, which I did not know would be in the film), but directing and editing made it even worse. The film is interrupted at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, such as the scene of quick sex in the middle, do not even make sense to invest in the story, because the characters do not show any feelings for each other. You can go to this movie, expecting to see a bunch of crap on the screen for an hour and a half, and you will still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie, then you waste your money, and if you donâ€™t pay anything, you still spend an hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and don't watch it.
