I usually do not write reviews, but I cannot understand why this rating is so high, and I wanted to warn horror lovers, as I can only assume that all these high ratings were given by average viewers. <br /> <I just watched the first two episodes, but these two were so cliche that it was not even funny. the same old stories that you have probably already seen / read a couple of times - living toys, evil things from other dimensions ... and not only that these stories are not innovative, they are also pretty bad versions of these cliches. I would prefer, for example, "Chucky" and "Silent Hill" over these two episodes at any time. and don't even ask about the visual effects ... the ones in the first episode are fine, and in the second ... terrible. it seems that some kind of student film project went wrong. blood ... or blood ... uh ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> it may be interesting for a ten-year-old child who probably hasn’t yet seen / seen so many scary stories (although I'd better recommend “for faith” - that's what I call a decent mysterious TV show). but for an adult horror fan, it doesn't cost anything. I gave only 3 points, because in fact there is excellent cinematography (especially in the second episode) and a good acting game.
