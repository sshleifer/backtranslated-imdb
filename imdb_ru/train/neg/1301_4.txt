I recently saw this on the 2009 International Film in Palm Springs. This is the directorial debut of the full-length Dutch actress Monique van de Ven, and according to my observations, it should be the last. I hate films that are so implausible that you make out almost every scene. This movie immediately leaves you scratching your head. Initially, a young photographer and his girlfriend, working for an international aid organization, travel slowly through the mountains of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban, and discuss their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of the car to watch as all five people in the truck kill Taliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts photographing all this when he is noticed by one of the rebels, who throws a hand grenade at them, killing his girlfriend. since they are at arm's length, they cannot be more than 50 yards, but he somehow walks away. His girlfriend is blown up, and he photographs the moment when a grenade hits her, and gets a prize as a photographer of the year for a photo. Each scene and situation in this film is as ridiculous as its discovery. The following year, Bob is assigned to National Geographic on a Dutch resort island, where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and is built into her sinister underworld by international drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I would give 4.0 out of 10.
