I watched it with my mom, and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We didn't get it at all. I may be mistaken, but the chair is somehow connected with the death of the father of this woman. This movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good unknown movie. Bad unknown movie! * shakes a cane in a movie * I will never see it again. And I'm also a big fan of life movies! They need to stop trying to make films from books. It drives me crazy !!! <br /> <br /> And Whit was ugly, and yet, she loves him more than Hugh, who was tiny, a little more attractive. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
