I want to clarify a few things. I am not familiar with Min-Liang Tsai films, and I am very familiar with feature films; I grew up in the seventies of the time of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci, and many others. <br /> <br /> The feature films then were truly ART; like paint. People did this to express their inner feelings, without actually worrying if other people understood anything. They were outside commercial values; just look at some old Antonioni (or early Picasso), and you will understand. <br /> <br /> Tian-bian and doo-yun (the wayward cloud) has nothing to do with this. This is an opportunistic film designed to deceive the judges and critics of the festival by playing a lot of things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> History does not make sense. The lack of water causes the government to encourage the use of watermelons for moistening. A girl in despair, steals water from public toilets. There is also the beginning of porn (a neighbor), trying to make a film with an actress he does not seem to feel comfortable. There is some romantic awakening between a girl and a porn star. The confusion ends with the sex scene (not pornographic) that many people feel shocked, but I find it less provocative than you can see in American Pie or the history of violence. <br /> <br /> The two main characters never speak. Sometimes musical style No. 60 appears and explains (through the song) what is happening in the minds of the characters. These video clips are really welcome, because the previous scene, without dialogue or music, only people looking at each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even more minutes, which is too TOO in the times of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are also several bits about “hard to make sex without love”, the “selfish mind of the porn industry”. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film is intended (to get away with it) to deceive the jury and critics of the festival. He has several pseudo socking scenes (as part of Taiwan’s censorship), and many of the topics are open, but nothing is completed or goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks allowed the film to receive several (challenged) important prices at film festivals and get a film with undeserved commercial success (I see a film in France, and the theater was overcrowded). <br /> <br /> However, please do not be fooled. This film is nothing new, original, or even originally narrated or filmed. It is boring and empty; really a scam to the public. Boogie Nights (which I didn't really like), Intimacy and 9 Songs are much better films.
