"Lies" tells about the novel between an 18-year-old student with a thick chest and a skinny 38-year-old married man, in which a couple of protagus spends about half of the screen, engaging in bare sex and flogging hockey, and the other half wanders around the pathetically naive storyline that seems A little more excuse for sex scenes. With a very low production value, including obvious plumbing fixtures and fake erotic sex in a story that is a dirty mixture of comedy and drama, Lying is quickly becoming excessively nauseous. With almost 2-hour mileage, subtitles and such a small amount of material, “lies” are simply not recommended. (WITH)
