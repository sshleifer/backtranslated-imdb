This is one of the most rotten films of the 90s. I would not recommend this if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> In this picture, African Americans are wild, uncultured, brutal, inarticulate, sociopathic smokers. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his squad of friends constantly disrespect others in the hostel, not only white people, but also Asians, and they are never punished for their actions. Despite all this tolerance, they continue to whine and cry about the evil white oppressors who control their lives and stand in their way. In fact, it was Fudge’s influence that makes Remmy bind to the skin’s heads, drop out of college and eventually kill Malik’s girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinheads are presented as a hidden group of minors who share the campus pavement and generally stay away from everyone else. They never release their music to annoy people, nor do they mock the police. They commit serious crimes such as beating and rape, but they are not as ugly and not as threatening as Fudge and Dreadlocks (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There is a lot of material in this film that I almost insulted or made me giggle. Some of them are listed below. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are enrolled as students at Columbia University, but we never see them in class, and it’s not at all clear how they pay tuition. It only remains to assume that the smoking they smoke is related to their finances. Although they are students in what looks like a private university, they cannot pronounce a single line of correct English. Their characters develop only through their obsessive nagging and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> Drunken Kristen (Kristy Swanson) seemed to know exactly why drunk Billy was taking her to his house. She even asked him to take a gum so they could start. The fact that he broke into her without a condom would be rape, whereas sex would be great only if he had one thing. Later, Kristen assured Kristen (Jennifer Connelly) that she was not responsible in this matter, and, despite the deliberate jumping into the guy's bed, she was not ready for sexual intercourse and was brutally used by a sexual predator. About a week later, she met and slept with an oversensitive virtue who knew how to avoid rape and brought a condom. The director carefully focused on contraception. <br /> <br /> This film is full and full of rubbish, because of which black people look like shots and women look stupid and fragile. Cole Hauser’s acting and Lawrence Fishburne’s accent are the only reasons I can watch them. The author / director is obviously a person with limited intelligence. If you like, keep up the good work and limit yourself by following this shit, but keep in mind that neurons do not grow. Just follow the advice at the end and UNKNOWN.
