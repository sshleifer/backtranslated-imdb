John Heder was absolutely terrible in this film. I felt like I was watching a bad student from a student film for the first time. Anna Farris was on top, not very, but not terrible (plus she is sweet). Diane Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this film (although it was a bad judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> In general, I would avoid it at all costs. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Header will be stuck forever in the role of the typical “jerk” if he doesn’t do a SERIOUS job on his acting chops.
