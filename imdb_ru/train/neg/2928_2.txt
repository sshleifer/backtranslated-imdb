I really, really wanted to watch this movie, and waited months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When he appeared in our mailbox, I threw it directly into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very sadly disappointed, which in turn made me angry. I will give any film a chance, even if I want to leave the theater / press "Stop". I looked through it all, but did not get anything out of it but disappointment. <br /> <br /> The game was very, very good, but that was all. Nothing is explained; although we understand that Mathieu falls into depression and falls into some kind of psychiatric ward, we have not been given to understand his “fall”. Although we understand that he and Cedric broke up, again, we do not see how it happened and WHY it happened. During an interview with a doctor, Mathieu Cédric says that he once cheated on him, but it was not scary. I expected to see it in my memories, but no, nothing. We also get hints that Cedric was the one who took Math to the hospital, but AGAIN we do not see it. <br /> <br /> I know that some films are based on the principles of “take it as it is”, but this film honestly ticked. When Pierre, the former Cedric, appears in the club and he has problems, we do not see his skins and hair until the very end, and it took me a long time to understand that Pierre WAS a former. His personality in the club and when Mat finds him are completely different. Maybe I’m even mistaken when I said this, it was very confusing. <br /> <br /> The film expects you to know everything and move along with its incoherent, irrelevant and confused pace. I can keep up with movies like Pi, Citizen Kane, and other movies that have flashbacks / flash forwards left and right, but CU didn’t capture or adhere to the style. At the end of “Citizen Kane,” you will find out what is happening and find out the answer to the main mysteries. CU just leaves you hanging. In his presentation, “we are not going to tell you, damn it, figure it out for yourself.” It’s like reading a book with switched chapters and missing pages. <br /> <br /> Good game, as I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was too disappointing.
