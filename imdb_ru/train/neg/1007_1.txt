It was very very difficult for me to watch this after the first 5 minutes of the film. I managed to lie down for 45-50 minutes before turning it off with disgust and instead watching Monster House (which, by the way, is a lot of fun). <br /> <br /> There are big holes in this story. The storyline is extremely overpriced and boring, the game is terrible, especially from Justin Timberlake, who must really stick to what he is doing well (look silly and sing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly awkward, especially when he was forced to dance to rock music for no apparent reason halfway through the film after his meeting with Timberlake. The characters of Freeman and Timberlake seem to have some sort of father-son relationship or something like that, which is simply not obvious, except for the fact that; Although Freeman’s character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid Timberlake character, he nevertheless does his best to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> It will take some time for the incredible suspension of disbelief to do justice to the storyline, which is simply absurd and blown up in all proportions. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie, it’s a waste of time.
