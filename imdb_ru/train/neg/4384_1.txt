The fact that someone really spent the money on such a bad script, I can not do. It really has to be one of the worst films, in addition to the “Haunted Highway” I have ever seen. Bad actors and a really bad story. In this film, there are no normal reactions to events, and even though Halloween came, normal people would have a stronger reaction when they watched their father being killed, not to mention the giblets, people with tape covering their airways. , could not breathe. (in a room with at least 50 people, I would add), and a person dressed as Satan, pulling dead people out of his house, even an 8-year-old will see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one can be so naive and stupid as to believe in the reality of the appearances of Satan and Jesus on the same day as this child does. When I was 8 years old, I probably had more brains than that. <br /> <br /> But the really silly thing is that everyone else seems to fall in love with this dumb Satan without asking any questions. The question throughout the film: is it really Satan or is some crazy person killing people when he wants to? Well, he has human hands, hands built and all that, so I think he should also be in the film, otherwise they did a lousy job of hiding it. Then, when this man was a man and everything else, he was able to kill an old woman, a man and his mistress, 5 (!! ???) policemen (all with arms and workouts, I suppose) and several other people. .... and, obviously, everyone just stood there, waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling a story is absolutely the worst that I’ve seen, and I would never recommend anyone to spend 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this complete nonsense.
