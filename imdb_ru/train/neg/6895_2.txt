The plot is stony. The acting is somewhere to the south of the high school play. The cinematography is not bad, but it looks like it was cut by a machete. I could not decide whether it was intentionally abnormal, or the people behind him really thought that they were making a good film. Think Death Valley meets Mayberry RFD. People run around the "lawless" modern city in 6 machine guns with a quick exhaust. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' material. Imagine how good guys drive up to an old farmhouse and park a Ford Mustang right in front of the trailed rail. Imagine a clerk in a hotel who is obviously watching a western (hemisphere) movie with a Japanese audio track, but with English subtitles. This is all really strange, but it can be improved by looking at it, taking a small peyote. It is a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie clich√© you can think of. The soundtrack even has a modern version of a kind-hearted girl from the dance hall and a Judean harp. Indeed! If someone brings it to your home for a Saturday night film show, tell me that your DVD player is dead.
