Oh man. If you want to give your internal robot Crow T. a real workout, this is a movie that needs to be inserted into the old VCR. The potential of the stripped down lines in this film is simply infinite. <br /> <br /> (Minor spoilers ahead. Hey, do you really care if a movie of this quality is “spoiled?”) Tracy is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed titles for this when a child develops sexual love for the opposite sex. But this girl seems to have one for her same-sex, and I don't think there is a term for that. This may be because her mother Dana plays Rosanna Arquette, whose cute bite, originality and juicy figure make me forgive her any number of bad films or sympathetic characters. Here, Dana is not only ignorant of her daughter’s behavior; she seems to be fighting for the gold medal in Mother's Olympic compassion. <br /> <br /> Dana may have missed Tracy’s killer series because, to tell the truth, Tracy seems to have the hamster’s criminal skills. It is only because the script dictates to her that she manages to shoot any number of bodies. <br /> <br /> A particularly funny note in this film is the character of Mexican maid Carmen, whom Dana describes as having been around so long that she’s like one of the family, although she dresses in what the director thought would say: “ I just fell from a truck with tomatoes from Guadalajara. ” Carmen is so clever in Tracy's intrigues that she can also wear a sign that says “Hey, I'm the next victim!” Of course, Tracy confronts Carmen when Carmen returns from Mass and picks her up with one of those angular keys with a slight angle car manufacturers put next to your spare, like a bad joke. I suspect, rather than in real life, these things are as useless as a murder weapon, as well as for changing tires. <br /> <br /> In another episode, Arquette puts on a light dress on the vineyard, under a cloudy sky, talking to the owner. Cut her in another dress under the sunny sky, talking to the owner's brother. Then put her dress on in the first place, under a cloudy sky - but that should be later. You get the picture. We are talking about bad direction. <br /> <br /> As for the skin, do not expect much, although Tracy has a pair of nice bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those who are looking for a trash can, 8. For all others - 1/2.
