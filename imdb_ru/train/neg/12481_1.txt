This magical story of the monstrously cruel and soulless "hero", defeating the evil king, is useless in almost every detail. The game is terrible because of the starring role. The grumbling, malevolent jubilation with which the director reveals the hero smearing blood is absolutely disgusting; nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause, since he is as bad as the people with whom he fights. Editing of Z-films is abundant, including the scene in which the character “dies” from a sword strike, which is obviously completely missed! <br /> <br /> The film clearly uses the charms of female heroes, Barbie Benton and Lana Clarkson, which is displayed for the most part naked throughout the film. Being a man older than 20 years old, I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen does not appeal to me. But the attitude towards their characters is so humiliating, and the sex scenes are so random and bleak that I could not enjoy even this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the foolish films of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by the carefree sense of ridicule (continued better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take himself seriously as a heroic fantasy. Never! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 from ****.
