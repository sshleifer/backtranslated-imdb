... that would be what you got. <br /> <br /> Alone words cannot describe how bad it is. If you have trouble sleeping, put it in, and I guarantee that you will quit in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowry was a pretty good actor in the 40s - but he calls here. In an interview with Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that in one of the scenes he and Batman had to run from car to house, and that Loveri was confused outside the camera because his belt was too narrow! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy's miracle - in fact, he looks more like a guy in his thirties who is waiting for Lowry to work so that he can wear a big raincoat. <br /> <br /> Driving the Batmobile Looks like she left the used Honest Ala car at a price lower than the sticker - Dynamic Duet doesn’t make much effort to hide the fact that they are driving behind Bruce Wayne’s car - in fact In fact, it is noticed by several characters throughout the series. <br /> <br /> The game is wooden - the scenery is cheap - the dialogue is terrible, and if there was even a script that they followed, I’m sure that it reads "Batman says something here", because, of course, they seem to be doing this along the way. <br /> <br /> Batman’s service belt is made of thin fabric without visible pouches to keep his gadgets in one scene, when Batman needs a full-size burner that producers simply fill when the scene begins and never see her again. His hood is so bad that he can't even look It comes out of it, and its ears look more like the sage of an angry Easter rabbit than something like a bat. <br /> <br /> In one scene (I don’t invent it), Batman replaces fake radioactive money, which light up as soon as they get into the air as a reward to some hoods. It is radioactive, so it can track it - the reason for which it is so easily ignited is not explained. Well, unfortunately, the gangsters open the packaging in a cardboard warehouse - we know that this is a cardboard warehouse, because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes, which look like they weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out - and soon all the place burns to the ground. Thanks to Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene, after the Batmobile is turned off, Batman stops a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and picks up his car - leaving the person to stand up for himself and tell him not to worry because if Batman crashes the car, the police will definitely buy him another! Yes, you guessed it, the car is removed from the cliff in a few short seconds. Not that it was of great importance to a motorist who probably died of exposure while trying to drive back to Gotham City. <br /> <br /> There is a tired plot with a clone of Lois Lane, Vicky Vale, who is convinced that Bruce Wayne is Batman — she must have noticed the Batmobile parked near Bruce’s house — or maybe she saw Batman and Robin run through a walk in a clearly densely populated suburban area. <br /> <br /> Everything in this series is bad - and everyone except the smallest in the audience will want to throw a toast to the screen. If you're looking for bad cinematography, you might not get a better grade — if you want to have fun, try the Burton Batman films, the Adam West Batman series, or the earlier Lewis Wilson Batman series.
