This movie has one redemption feature. At some point, after a character was attacked by a fairy who owned an ax, his brother asked him: “Why is your dick there, Chuck?” After nearly an hour of a bad movie, it almost made my drink go out of my nose. <br /> <br /> Some actions are not so bad, but children all stink, and PJ Soles should be ashamed of this movie. The story is weak, and no one does what you think (or what common sense dictates) they should. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many plot points that do not add up. For example, in one scene, the ghosts of young children must concentrate in order to move a physical object so that they can prove that they exist, a difficult feat, since they obviously cannot interact with physical matter. However, after a few minutes, they all pick up branches from the ground and beat the Tooth Fairy with them. Obviously, they CAN sometimes move matter, and sometimes CANNOT. Go figure it out. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and guts, though ... some nice tits. But this does not compensate for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you want a film about the Tooth Fairy, rent a Waterfalls of Darkness. I think this is great, although many other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least it creates a mood.
