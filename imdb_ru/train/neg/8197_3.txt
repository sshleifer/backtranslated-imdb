I just watched this movie tonight and have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he ultimately causes even more irritation, because this film is more than less, a remake of the classic Santa Claus film of the 80s, but without a camp or a bad Tire Easton song at the end. This is a story about how you run with a mill in a family that returns to your family for holidays, but with the North Pole. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is a family mistake that comes home after a series of failures, in which his girlfriend (Rachel Weiss as a cameo) throws him, so he comes home to meet his parents and his more successful brother Santa. Klaus (Paul Giamatti) and wacky jokes follow with a bit of rivalry between brothers and sisters, as well as some anarchy that threatens the whole of Christmas. Now, if you think you know the ending of this film, I think you would be right, because it is predictable for a hill. As for acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same attractive loser he always plays, but this time he ends up more annoying than pleasant, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role of more than one note, Elizabeth Banks plays Santa's assistant, but sheâ€™s not much of a character other than a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey, ultimately playing mostly the same person he plays in the Glengarry Glen Ross film, but a little more anal. The only two actors who emerged from this film with intact dignity are Paul Giamatti, who makes a sincere and warm role as Santa Claus, but looks a little embarrassing because he is in the film and you can't blame him and Rachel Weiss, who manages to perform a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors - this is a shame, because Rachel Weiss and Paul Giamatti deserved much better than this script gave them. <br /> <br /> In short, a great disappointment.
