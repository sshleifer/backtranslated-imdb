I could not wait to see “Mr. Fix It, because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. However, I got a nap within 1-1 / 2 hours. The package seemed pleasant: Boreanaz - Lance Valentine, a business owner called “Mr. Fix It”, where abandoned men secured him to make their girlfriends take them back. <br /> <br /> Among the problems with this film is the montage, the script and the acting. Although Boreanaz was amazing in his other roles (except for the movie “The Crow”, in which he starred), it was disappointing. At times his character was interesting, while others were flat. The supporting cast reminded me of the players of the day of the soap opera. I understand that it was not a budget film, but some scenes and music just seemed wrong. <br /> <br /> My advice: look at your own risk.
