The film will never become unbearable to watch. And, frankly, he, too, has nothing to show, except for, perhaps, the semi-sexual Alicia Silverstone in a dull, non-sexual character in frank pretty sexy dresses. It is very easy to follow the story, or there is nothing to follow - you can see it anyway. There is no expectation, few actions, unimpressive dialogues, unsatisfactory sensuality, the same boring locations and a very soft game. Kevin Dillon is absolutely useless. Silverstone ... well, I do not particularly concentrate on her game, I confess. However, as I said earlier, if a person has nothing to do other than watching a movie, it will not look so bad. 4/10
