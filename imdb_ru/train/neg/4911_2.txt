First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> At first, I admit my mistake: I did not realize that this was done for a television film. I was "thrown off" certification "R". The plot is strong, but the film lasts about 40 minutes. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part, the cast was exceptional and worked well with its characters. The disadvantage of the film is that it definitely belongs to the "Chick Flick" genre. Although there are some scenes of violence, none of them should cause an “R” rating. There are no nude or gratuitous sex scenes. In fact, no sex scenes. She Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Christina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Gleenys Davis were guests of the SG-1 series, but this film did not help them move up the career ladder, since they were all used as second level actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as usual, and Mitch Pileggi made me think about Lee Marvin's modern day. Very talented Megan Gallacher, whom I began to respect as an actor during the Millennium series, did not give anything difficult to show her range of abilities. The greatest disappointment with the cast was Tracy Pollan. In addition to being below average and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself drowning out the TV during its dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves programs like Lifetime TV. However, I would not recommend paying money to watch this movie. Given that I have not found anything that could have caused censorship, this film is worth watching only on TV, since nothing will be cut out. As a television film, I would rate it as 5 out of 10. As a feature film with “R” certification and, for example, a strong cast, I rate it as 2 out of ten.
