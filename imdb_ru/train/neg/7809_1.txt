Definitely a strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecila Moe, an alcoholic whose life is crumbling around him. Cecil takes the phone book, searches for the name of the preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's house and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. It makes everything better. Aah ... if everything in life was so simple. The fact that this “film” looks like it was shot for $ 500 definitely does not help. 1/10
