If someone really wants to understand Hitler, read the story of World War I, not the history of World War II. Find out what happened during that war, how the soldiers had to live around the dead bodies all the time. How many soldiers have gone mad, from what they saw during the First World War, at a time when they called it "shaking," now call it post-traumatic stress disorder. If you recognize the true horrors of World War I, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a person can become desensitized to death, not because of his evil, but simply because it was the only way for him to cope with the horrors around him too much. <br /> <br /> This film, unfortunately, lacks that so many others do. Read a few books on this topic, and you should watch the movie “Ways of Fame”, the only good film from the First World War. You will see the soldiers' frustration in this film, the feeling of helplessness and the complete devaluation of human life as nothing more than bullets hunters. <br /> <br /> That's what this film is missing, it really is a key point to an understanding of Germany. The war is lost, where millions and millions of Germans died for no real reason. Then comes the complete economic collapse after the war. It is these factors that create extremism. <br /> <br /> Loss of family members and mass poverty always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this film ignored these factors and turned into another piece of garbage that can be thrown into a pile. Without real value, there are movies based on fictional characters that can give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than this. They simply threw on this name of Hitler to sell more.
