What can I say. <br /> <br /> “What we know about blep” is almost impossible - almost all masterpieces of the genre, such as “Postman”, “Dungeon Master”, “Merlin”. “And fourth, he will go down in history as the worst movie I've ever seen. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is really impressive, because I have seen a lot of bad movies. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two intertwined parts, alternating between a silly and contrived plot of extremely annoying irritation. a photographer abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti-depressants to survive, and a bunch of talking heads going on to talk about how quantum physics supposedly justifies its pseudophilosity of the new time. In fact, if you start your day off by meditating on people like Enya and Kenny G, this film is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a lot of good grass, then this film is also for you. Otherwise, stay away. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me was, “What you know, bluff,” is what seems to be edited and collected by the same people who rent cheap weddings. the camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer generated sparkles on the screen, and other miscellaneous nonsense. Who lets these people to theatrical release is a mystery to me. I think this is what Kenny Ji does to you. The film has been riddled with a wacky GCI, that you or I can create on our own computer through an over-the-counter video editing software, but we will never do that because it's just too funny. <br /> <br /> The script was obviously written by someone without any writing experience. Not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and invented beyond belief, but the “writers” felt that they needed to push through every relevant information, or rather, disinformation, which was discussed in this film, right up to the end. your throat Well, given the target audience, it might not have been too bad an idea. The main character, for example, spends half the film on effervescent tablets. However, it is clear that this was not considered sufficiently convincing, so there are at least some dialogues that specifically mention her anti-anxiety pills, in case the audience cannot link her excessive pain and suffering with the small white pills that she takes when she feels bad. Acting ... Well, I saw the best way to play Ed Wood films, and no, this is no exaggeration. Hell, the little play I was in when I was 12 years old showed a much more inspiring play than this one. It really is. <br /> <br /> The story here and there is interrupted by a handful or random talking heads, a strange mixture of strange scientists, strange doctors and self-proclaimed mystics. physics allegedly provides an “explanation” for how man or woman created their own reality, simply by participating in life experience. You see, reality is a field of probability of many different possibilities, and it is established only when you, the observer, decided to notice it. What happens when more than one Observer does not speak, but again, who cares. Listen to Enya, meditate, observe, and you will be God, and nobody will give a damn about such stupid and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. Any reason is immediately discarded because people are stuck in their path and unable to achieve “change paradigms ”and“ go for the rabbit hole ”. In addition, Heidelberg’s uncertainty principle is supposedly proof of alternative realities, parallel universes, and the like. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the entire film. All these people keep talking about going down the rabbit holes. I'm not sure that it was related to something else that they said or showed, but one thing I am sure is that it is somehow connected with anal sex. In fact, the film is _extremely_ anti-sex. Everywhere sex is presented as dirty, ugly and anti-educational. <br /> <br /> In any case, talking heads say that the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by drawing hearts all over her body with a magic marker. and continues to walk with an even more stupid look in her glazed eyes than she began. <br /> <br /> I want to return 2 hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Here are a couple of random quotes that I accidentally remembered: <br /> <br /> “What I consider unreal has become much more real for me, but what I used to think is real, often much less real than unrealistic. "- Some talk about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br />" What does it take for one person to have an erection? Only one thought is required. Nothing changes outside, all changes are inside. And yet he has an erection, "the mystic proclaimed herself, the head of her own school of education. <br /> <br /> [looking at herself in the mirror]" I hate ! I hate you you're fat you are ugly I have you -!!!! Protagonist, fat and ugly photographer.
