Straight to the point: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most unfunny, stupid and frankly horrible films ever made. This “comedy” is so devoid of anything that remotely resembles the traces of wit that it is almost incomprehensible that it was even made. I said almost because in the end there are fans of everything. <br /> <br /> This film is not even “good” bad or “pleasant” bad. Placing this film on the same level of entertainment as Plan 9 or Robot Monster would be a crime for these films. Such films that you can really watch and have fun. But this film is SO bad, SO poorly filmed, filmed and written according to the script and REALLY incredibly stale, that there is simply no trace of “camp” or “chox” left. <br /> <br /> Even if this was done before the premiere of Saturday Night Live, comparisons were probably inevitable. I'm not a big SNL fan, but this movie is worse than the worst SNL parody you can find. And man, this is bad. Just to prevent viewers from leaving, Shapiro throws out a pair of breasts from time to time, but ill-removed breasts of 1974 will not bother anyone these days. To tell the truth, this film is so poorly made and is such a dream-inducing excursion, I doubt that they, too, worried someone in 1974. <br /> <br /> This movie was made by a man named Ken Shapiro. By God, any ten-year-old child with a video camera could have done something funnier and smarter. This is simply unreal - this is really an incredible film. The “joke” and “gags” are so infantile that even little boys who love to sneak on MAGS’s father’s porn will not laugh at night <br /> <br /> I will give this film one thing -. The latest sequence of the episode "The Dancing Man", where the guy (Shapiro) is dancing to the melody on the streets of New York, is easily the best thing in this terrible movie. Not that the "dancing man" sequence was also gorgeous - she definitely has moments when she is not smart, as Shapiro is desperately trying to fill the time for the whole song - but in reality it was somewhat watchable. The part of this sequence where the policeman begins to dance with a man is the only single trace of acumen in the entire film. It is not surprising that Shapiro put this sequence in the last place - again, although he is not so good in himself, he easily surpasses everything else in this “film”. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this film is so full of shit that it is incomprehensible as to the fact that a real person can be so completely reckless. The name of this film was supposed to be "Craparama Ken Shapiro". Surprisingly, this was done, but many truly talented directors cannot enter. However, I will say that I bet that geniuses at New York University will like this film. Total garbage.
