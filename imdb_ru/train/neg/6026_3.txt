* review may contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> predictable, elaborate, bad special effects. he has a tv film feeling to that. The idea of ​​the Bible that the UN passed into the possession of Satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world. The package is interesting, but its justification is underestimated. if you want to convert people to Christianity with this film, at least make it a quality one! I seriously checked my watch while watching this shard. I can’t say anything more about this film since I saw it more than a year ago, and there’s nothing much to say about this film, except ..... miss it!
