I watched it today, partially attracted to the cast of all the stars and partly because I enjoyed so many other films of this kind. However, this should be avoided. There are dozens of poorly cut scenes where continuity simply does not flow, for example, a billiard challenge at the start. The fighting scenes with the locals are about as good as you might recall in these old black and white films about Tarzan, you know where you see a spear flying through the air, and the camera cuts a dead native, still lying on the floor, from which sticks out his thigh. Is this instant death? There are also some completely unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, for example, saving a little girl while collecting flowers. Really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch. If you watch this movie, the main points will be the crabs, which are moving forward at a speed of about 5 km / h. Somehow, you manage to sneak up on David McCulum and give him a hug. As if there was no time to leave the road, as when the obelisk in the city falls, the native has all the time in the world to take 2 steps to the left, but no, he shouts, and he falls on him. I give it 2 because of Ekland. And why does McCullum's voice develop stuttering along the way of the film?
