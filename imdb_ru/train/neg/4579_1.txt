"What the hell do we know !?" was one of the worst times I spent in the movies. It was not so much a movie as a special after school, but at the same time nothing special. The attempt at narration, in which they substantiated their ideas, was absolutely pitiful, as almost everyone will tell you. Marley Matlin in lingerie just shouldn't happen. I will not dwell on this. I will reveal the criticism that many can not articulate. This film, although tedious, also suffered a huge lack of reasoning. It was terribly contradictory, because it took such a manipulative, to become the creator of your life, a manifestation of abundance, shoes without shoes. Interconnectedness is explained as a big side of our existence. Nevertheless, the film encourages the fact that we control our environment with our mind. This completely neglects that there are other people with a mind that could control us, which seems to be more true. Or, at least, the structures in which we exist severely limit us. Thus, the film was inappropriate solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnectedness simply do not mix, unless you are an almighty God. If yes, then you will be impressed (?!?) With all the elegant things this film will show you can do. If not, you will be greatly disappointed, idiot, or perhaps both. In addition, the name is so funny that I hardly warn people not to watch the movie, because I feel backward, mentioning it by name. Shame on everyone involved.
