“Floating House Horror” is often considered the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film that advertised “Watch a Movie That Can't Get an Oscar”. Underground members of the disco band begin to die dying from a burnt maniac when they try to make a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. Badly played and wrote a slasher with zero uncertainty and annoying characters. This, of course, delivers blood: the heads are split in half with a machete, the throat is cut, and a woman is killed by a horseshoe. If you like silly slasher movies, you can try it, but you have been warned. At least it's better than the Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
