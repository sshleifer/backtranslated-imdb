I do not know anything about the earlier works of the author or director, so I did not bring any prejudices to the film. Based on a brief description of the story in the TV guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But the implausibility was accumulating. Each turn of the plot seemed to be a reason to delay the bloodshed, terrible makeup or special effects. <br /> <br /> The score was professional, and Kari Vührer seems like a decent actress, but the others were more than disappointing, It was positively repulsive. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the vagaries of the story, but I will give an example of what I consider to be an excess of obvious blood. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch and pulls the frozen body of his previous victim (Wendt) out of a deep freeze. McKenna killed Wendt, biting a piece off his neck. Now he feels that he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in the death of Wendt. (What are the cops going to do, measure the bite radius?) McKenna takes out Wendt's head and neck from the freezer in which he is, takes an ax and begins to cut off Wendt's head. Whack. Whack. Whack. A piece of ax continues to crack Wendt's neck. The air is filled with bits of frozen, frozen flesh, one of which falls on McKenna’s head. (He shakes it off when he finishes.) Then McKenna takes the frozen head out to a small bonfire that he built. He sits his head on the ground, squats down next to her, takes out some photos of the woman he just killed, and shows them to Wendt's head. “Remember her? We could really do this if it were not for you guys, ”he says to the manager. "Duke, you always liked fires, didn't you?" he is asking. Then he puts his head on the fire. We can only see how it burns, but we can hear burning fat in the flame. <br /> <br /> I don’t want this type of garbage to be censored. I just wonder who likes to watch it. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue the film. Well, I will give one example of “implausibility”, since I put forward this idea. McKenna was kidnapped and locked in a dark, bare hut. He knows that he will be hammered half to death in the following days. (He literally invited the heavyweights to do this.) What would you do in this situation, like Po? That's what makes McKenna on what could be the last night of his life. He finds a dropped calendar with a pin-up girl image and masturbates (successfully). Give this man the Medal of Freedom! <br /> <br /> A Pizza Hut-like monster is thrown into some unnecessary memories. The camera often holds up and staggers. In the dialogue there are such lines as “Life is a piece of shit. Or is it the best of all possible worlds. It depends on your point of view. ” A wide-angle lens is used that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. In the end, the house explodes with a fireball, while hero McKenna walks towards us in the foreground. <br /> <br /> Some hero he too. First, he kills a man for $ 13,000, several times hitting him on the head with a heavy statue, then with a potted plant, before finally kicking the refrigerator over his body. (It bothers him a little, but it is not enough for him not to insist on payment.) Then, I hope I have an order, he kills Wendt, pulling out a part of his neck. Then he accidentally kills the wife of his first victim and blames hard things for this, although they have nothing to do with almost any moral calculation. Then he burns Honcho (Baldwin) head alive. Then, having turned off the two smaller weights, he deliberately blows them up, although one of them is not at all sympathetic. And we have to root for McKenna. <br /> <br /> This is not a cartoon death, as in the films "Dirty Harry" - bang-bang, and you're dead. It is slow and painful. The first — a $ 13,000 murder — was done awkwardly enough to resemble what can happen in real life. It is not easy to kill another person, as Hitchcock showed in Torn Curtain. But this scene does not lead to anything important. <br /> <br /> Some people might like it, especially those who are young enough to think that pain and death are what only happens in the movies. Here are some things on the screen.
