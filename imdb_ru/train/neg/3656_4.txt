I have to admit that I was a samurai movie lover, as I remember myself. I used to look rather unintelligible, be it “elite” works, such as “Seven Samurai” or bloody variations of comics, such as “The Lonely Wolf” and “Cub”. I also liked American / Japanese crossovers such as The Bushido Blade. And of course everything that contains Sonny Tiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I practically watched every samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993 I first looked at the Kabuto video that even samurai films can be boring. At first, I waited impatiently for Mayed to reach Europe, and a confrontation would arise, but by the time he really reached Spain, I no longer cared much about the film. <br /> <br /> It would not make a justice film to call it “bad.” Technically, this is a clean entry to the genre. But there is simply never enough quiet. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as a director and actor, and has only a small fraction of the above-mentioned charisma of Japanese actors. And if we talk about the son of Sho Kosugisa Kane, who appears in almost all the films of Sho Sho Kosugi as the son of Sho, he inherited little or no of the limited acting skills of his fathers. By cons, you can add the lack of blood and blood, which until then had been the trademark of all samurai films. Obviously, it was intended for a younger audience in the USA and Europe. <br /> <br /> Let's just say: this is an average film for an average fan of historical adventures, but a bore for inveterate fans of samurai cinema. Fans who belong to the Samurai meets ?? genre should better go see Red Sun (1971) with Charles Bronson as a cowboy, who should team up with Samurai Toshiro Mifum to take the samurai sword from the bad guy Alan Delon, It is very similar to how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> So, although the film is only 100 minutes long, it seems much longer. <br /> <br /> The reason why I gave him honorable 4/10 points instead of 3/10: when I first saw this film, I saw it in the German synchronized version. In this version, Kosugi can really be understood. I have to admit that his "Angrish" is at times amusing, but it becomes tiresome after about 30 minutes.
