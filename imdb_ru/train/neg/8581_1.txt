This is an apology for a film about absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths must have needed money. The film must have been made with a very low budget, because the coverage did not exist. I swore an oath, if I ever see Pete Poslezumting or another, I will commit suicide. I would be glad to know if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regret - I wasted my time watching this trash.
