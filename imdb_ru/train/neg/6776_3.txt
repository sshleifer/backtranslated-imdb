I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love this? Cary Grant, Jane Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. However, the train wreck, which was Susie Parker, ruined the whole experience for me. Her game was so terrible that I sat with my jaw open, not believing my eyes or my ears. I could barely make it in one view, SO how disgusting it is at that. <br /> <br /> Cary? Superb and in beautiful dramatic form. Jane? Charming, cute and obviously have a ball. The supporting cast works well, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning retro elegance. <br /> <br /> Then you see how Suzy Parker is trying to express her views with a wooden, dead, ignorant one simply does not give in to faith. Who told this creature that she can ACT ?? OH WAY people.
