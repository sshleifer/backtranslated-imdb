It was the worst low budget horror movie I've ever seen. I'm an open guy, and I always like a good horror movie. In fact, when I make films, I specifically look for a few underrated horror films. They are always good for laughs, believe me, I know, I have seen a lot. But this film was so terrible that it was not worth the laugh. I was going to turn it off in the first five minutes ... which probably should have been done. There is nothing good in it, first of all the film crew sucks A $$. The intro was as stupid as the end. The acting and special effects were terrible. Please, I beg you, do NOT watch this movie, you just hate it.
