I don't know what you guys are talking about when I first watched this movie with my two friends, we could not stop crying. This is one of the funniest crap I've ever seen. This remark about porn is so true, though hahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this film is actually worse, but it does bring tears to my eyes because of fake heroes, poor dialogue and actions. Not to mention the expensive cameras that they shot ?! Looks like one of those movies from my ed drivers. class. The props look like they came out of a theater series. The music sounds as if it were from the original Nintendo system game. The only thing that even came close to being scared by this movie was that it had a killer clown who is not intimidated by fat, hiding clowns? hahaha, if anyone ever watches this, they need to keep track of the actors' verbal mistakes, such as spanking their words and some of their expressions. hahahaha, i'm dead. <br /> <br /> Susan
