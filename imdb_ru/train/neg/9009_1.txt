What a horrible movie! For some reason, in scientific laboratories and outposts, there always live a staff of dirty, filthy, vile misanthropes living inside. These people, who seem to be working together on complex science projects, do not seem to be able to agree on how to survive the death at the hands of the dragon CGI. Spoilers: a very nasty scientist, whose main acting skill - "mocking" and "sinister look" - cloned a dragon. While the lab was supposed to work on such things, other scientists were shocked, because obviously they were far behind in their experiments and were caught with their pants down. The rest of the story is similar to "THING" or "Ten Little Indians," where the staff is hunted and killed for the staff when they try to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the "Dragon." The CGI Dragon creature is a dark gray color, which seems to be a popular color for most cheap CGI special effects. It is unlikely that he looks better than a cartoon, and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the Dragon. It all looks like a gray blob. The game is less terrible. These scientists behave like a group of children who cannot agree on anything, and this helps the Dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. D. Dean Kane is hardly better than any of the unknown actors in this film. It seems that he falls to the level of his auxiliary composition. This film is really terrible. The game is bad. The story is stupid. CGI is very cheap and amateurish. There is nothing commendable in this film, it is not even a good time killer to watch while doing housework or other work.
