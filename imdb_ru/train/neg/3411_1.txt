Mix exotic tropical places, kids in scanty clothes, explosions, cute Dudley Do-Right clones, a movie star with the best years behind him (Martin Sheen), some martial arts and sexual malice (Tracy Laure ... .er, sorry ... Tracy Elizabeth the Lords) and you will think that escapist fun awaits you. Not this way! This is a grim television film, and although he likes to advertise himself as a deal with Charlie's Angels, he is far from being as good as the original series or even the insane, irretrievably stupid, recent SA films. This abomination is best described as a movie of the THIRD SPEED of Andy Sidaris. Not so much fun, like Andyâ€™s Hard Ticket To Hawaii, although some of the fighting scenes are decent enough. Girls spend too much time posing and trying to look elegant, and after a while this is annoying. There are things of a better genre that it is there. Oh yeah, and "kids" are not as hot as they like to think they are. Awful soundtrack ... when he's there.
