Sorry, I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. When I realized that the whole movie was really about an older guy experiencing his dream, I felt deceived. Of course, it could be a device that could lead us to something deeper, more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So do not buy a big drink, otherwise you will run into the rest room. My children didn't like it either. Oh, good.
