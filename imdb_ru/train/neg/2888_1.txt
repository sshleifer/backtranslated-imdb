In order to compare this misery with the old, low budget porn movie will be an insult to the old, low budget porn movie. Animal scenes have no meaning and do not represent this person and his crimes, even in the broadest sense of abstractions. The synopsis on the back of the DVD case says, in part, “A gripping retelling of the BTK Killer terror rule.” This is NOT a retelling. Retelling would say that you are told the truth about what happened, how and why. None of these things is true. I am a studio serial killer enthusiast and have seen some pretty silly movies about them, and, frankly, this is NOT one of them. It's not even about the BTK killer. Save yourself some time and a few dollars and rent a Dahmer instead. This serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you just MUST watch this movie yourself, try it for free at the local library, and even then you will still feel deceived.
