All X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including the long-hated X-Men. They had solid characters (in my opinion, Magneto and Xavier were the best, and a good plot). <br /> <br /> I was I was very excited when I heard that this film was in production, and my expectations grew more and more until I saw the film. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film is “The Fountain”, although you will not hear about this film when they talk about the actor), and his acting play doesn’t spoil the film. <br /> <br /> The entire film is replete with meaningless characters who add nothing to the plot (for example, Blob or Gambit), who were thrown there to make fans believe that the filmmakers read original comics. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of XMen, I read many, many of their stories, and this film did not respect any of them. No one. Not even continuity. He does not respect the project "Weapon X", or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, Wolverine motifs are just stupid and are seen in millions of films: "Revenge for the death of a loved one." <br /> <br /> Oh. What I was expecting, this whole damned film was Bersecker’s moment for Wolverine, similar to the one he had in X2 at school when Stryker’s people come and he alone destroys the forces of the enemy but hey, this is Fox, this is a family movie you will not see the apparent violence from the most cruel and terrible hero Marvel. <br /> <br /> In addition, I had a feeling of constant déjà ví with this film, because Wolverine’s origin is already explained in X2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton, so there’s no point in filming what we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally think that wolverine is one of those few characters who don’t need a solid backstory. because the secret is the character's character. Do we really want to know how Joker got his scars?
