The wise blood of John Houston was a more horrifying distortion of Flannery O'Connor’s book than I could have imagined. From the absolutely terrible acting performances (and isn't it: “Oh, it was done on purpose, you just don't understand” - me!) Until the musical score, which was more suitable for the episode of Rockford Files, this film was disgusting. I looked at it without ill will from the very beginning and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the distortion of the southern characters, from the absurdly fraudulent southern tension to the comic, comic image of their faith, was unforgivable. To the very end, which was completely devoid of any sentimental sentiment, he failed in every place where O'Connor's book shone and resonated. Actors depicting "southern" policemen may also have eaten strangled hot dogs from the street stands of New York and quoted The Godfather. The only thing that helped the performance of acting skills was Ned Beatty’s lively and ruthless presentation of the religious con man Hoover Schoats, who hears Mouts preaching the Church of Christ without Christ, and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. The powerful O'Connor book is best known for its eerie religious movement, which combines the lifeless corpse of "Faith." Mr. Houston’s film is a shameful mockery of the author’s intentions, as they and I understand most of her fans, if I can be so bold as to say it. Although I admit that I cannot know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for her and her work so that they want to remain a fan. If I looked at the Wise Blood the way Mr. Houston seemed to look, I would throw it in the trash. For the sake of Flannery and for my sake, I forgive you, John Houston. Forgetting .... it will take some time.
