The path to the ace! You have just turned a frightening, extremely intriguing story about a necrophilous cannibal into a soft, juicy drama. Obviously, the film called “Dahmer” will be one of two types: horror or documentary right? It was neither. It was not close to any detailed facts (in fact there was almost nothing) It was not really painful or scary or even tried to be very disturbing (as if you had to try !!) What the hell is this writer / the director thought ?? Here is one of the most REAL examples of sick serial killers in the entire history, and we are poorly shot, poorly acting rape by gay bars on the roof and long buzzing memories alone in his old parents' house. I think that Jacobson really tried to present (or invent) the “soft side” of J. Dahmer.
