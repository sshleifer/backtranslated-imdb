Imitating its long title, the film finds ways to approach the mark of 90 '. Beautiful sets here with everything that made the trademark Hamer's values, yet Paris, drowned in fog, is a sign of lazy disregard. This story is obvious and can be summarized in a dozen words, so nothing unexpected will happen and nothing is worth more than 5% of your attention. <br /> <br /> Direction is difficult, as a direct translation of a theatrical production, the actors are mostly tough, like wax figures (well, this is a feature of Hamer, only sometimes it is better represented in the whole package). My conclusion: this film is rubbish, not worth the time that I spend this evening. Eternal life is a boring question, and I should have hoped that the guys responsible for programming in Cinemath√®que would know better.
