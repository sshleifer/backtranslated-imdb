After all, Life is a miracle, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe that these films were made, for example, by the same person as You Remember Dolly Bell. A covenant is two hours of stupid antics without history. Underground's wild and unbridled humor seems to have been reborn as a miserable buffoon. It seems that Kusturica has steadily descended since he started making life-affirming comedies, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I really liked his early films, and therefore itâ€™s especially unpleasant to see something like that. Let's hope that his next one will be great.
