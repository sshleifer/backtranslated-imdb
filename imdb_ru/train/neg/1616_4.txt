STARS RATING: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This second issue of Che's films promotes the story until late at night. The 60s, when this man moved his resistance fighters into the hills of South America, having survived without enough food and water and with increasing tensions between the group. Everything comes to a conclusion when he crosses the border with Bolivia, and government forces intensify their campaign to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Without a break between the time and places of the last film, the second part of Soderberg focuses solely on the action in the hills, and manages to be an even more boring experience. And even more pretentiously, the score was drowned out, giving the second batch more of an undesirable kind of art that turns out to be just as alien. The film is simply unshakable boredom, which never gives up. You can’t blame Soderberg’s ambitions or Del Toro’s aspiration for the title role, it’s just a shame that somewhere in production everything turned out to be such a disappointing turn. **
