I cringe this whole movie. First of all, the idiotic plot has nothing to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood tried to create a kind of comedy film about the pursuit of the car. Imagine Enlbreth Hendrix Sings. <br /> <br /> Disregard this film, to be precise. The name Parsons in the name and theft of his body is simply used as a springboard for a low-budget chase film, blatantly trying to get a few dollars from Parsons and his fans. Graham's father died long ago in 1973, other global characters are fictional, this has nothing to do with Gramâ€™s life or death. <br /> <br /> If you're a Gram fan, I advise you not to do that. watch this movie I wish I didn't do that. It is sad to see that something special is seen as such a shameful feed. I swear, I heard Graham turning in his grave while playing a movie. If you are not familiar with the life and legacy of Graham, do not take anything in this film as a representative of Graham. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough bad words about this movie. If Gram was alive and saw this film, he would have killed himself. On the other hand, perhaps he would be afraid if he knew that this film was supposed to end.
