How did this become a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know where to start, why this film sucks too much. The film was predictable, there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the actions of some characters. The film was too bright, they had to do something with the lighting, for example. making the environment darker. The makeup of some of the dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror movie. This is 2006! People don't get scared of other people wearing heavy makeup. We took most of the horror scenes from other Hollywood or Asian horror films. Just rip off! That is why I do not watch Tagalog films. The only reason so many people “screamed” while watching this film is to correspond. How many times do we have to copy scenes from the “Ring” and improvise that instead of the girl leaving the TV, she now comes out of the window next door? No matter how you articulate it, IT IS ALL ONE. If you want a good horror movie, check out the top 50 horror movies listed on this site.
