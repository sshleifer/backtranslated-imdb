A rajinikanth is reborn after receiving magical powers, which he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are several problems with this film that are obvious to a normal audience: the 50-year-old Radzhnikant is still at home with his parents; the father of the neighbor girl thinks he is a convincing "boy" (vaseekaramaana paiyan); Radzhinikant suddenly interrupts the film with his sermons, the worst thing is how the women of the past did housework - but we must believe that he is not a theist; although he was well read, he spends six of his seven powers on a stupid kite; I can continue, but you get the picture. <br /> <br /> There are God-men, there are gods, and there is Radzhinikant. It’s hard for a directory to put Rajinikanth in one of these categories. At first, Radzhinikant - this is just Radzhinikant, who does what Tamil heroes do - confronts the villains and, despite being the oldest, caring for the most beautiful girl in the film. Rajinikanth does it well, and some of Rajinikanth’s signature styles are really nice - “women counting” is a novelty. What makes this film unbearable is that these first few minutes are a preface to the worst book ever written. Even this preface is interspersed with some kind of comedy, which is forced and obvious. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero faces several obstacles (as usual from politicians), but we cannot really root for the hero because we do not know what the ultimate goal of the hero is. In the end, when everyone wants him to be a leader, the hero utters another of his sermons and leaves to become a recluse. The director does not offer a solution to the problem in the climax scene. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's assessment is really interesting. Either he demonstrates brilliant spots, or he did not bother to fully embed himself in this film - who can blame him. There is one scene where Radzhinikant enters the van of one of the crooks, and then throws a knife and begins counting women. The music is very suitable at the moment and acts as a catalyst that adds extra stress. All songs are mediocre, no one would worry about the songs from this film in a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in IMDb. This film has all the elements that justify its rightful place in the IMDb rating.
