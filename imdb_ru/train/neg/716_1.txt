This film is one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is absolutely no storyline, jokes only for the mentally retarded, and there is nothing else that could make this film worthy of attention. Throughout the film, Fredy (oh my God, what a funny name. Haha) does not ask himself ONCE how he moved from a plane to Middle Earth. There are many stupid and completely unfunny characters whose names should sound funny. for example: Gandalf is called Almgandi, Sam is called Pupsey ... and so on. I never even smiled for the whole movie. It seems that the plugs are made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat hits the door (this happens about 5 times), then this film is probably for you. Another funny scene: they try to guess the code word for the closed door (do not ask why - never ask why in this film), and the code word (ha ha): manure. So, if you laughed at these examples, you might like this movie. For everyone else: go to Youtube and see “Lord of the Grass”: it's much, much more fun.
