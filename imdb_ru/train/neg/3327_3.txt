Two sisters, their perverted brother and cousin problems with the machine. They then take place at the home of Dr. Hakenstein, who finds it convenient to use parts of the body of three young women to use in the experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life. He tells them that he will help them get home in the morning, so they spend the night. Then the good doctor starts working in this low-budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a bit funny, in fact nothing bothers you (I stumbled upon this on Netflix instant viewing and streaming to xbox 360), but better than I expected it would be a movie acquired by Troma. Most of the humor does not work, but they are still parts that made me smile. In addition, the deceased great Anna Ramsey has a small role, and she was always pleased to watch. <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Bambi Darro and Silvia Lee Baker have become topless <br /> <br /> My rating is D +
