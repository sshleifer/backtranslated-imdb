Ursula Andress's naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) also have excellent bodies. Then why is the highest rating that I can give a film with such quality and number of naked bodies, only 3 out of 10? Because to get to the incredible body of Ursula, we have to watch a movie that is otherwise not funny and boring (keep in mind that I watched the full 101-minute version, and not the 78-minute American version, which probably cuts off a lot extraneous material). In the typical Italian-comedic tradition, most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures (army freak, “Latin lover”, a constant drinker, a naive maid) who are not funny, but just replay. Last word: watch this, but hold your finger on the fast forward button, you will need it. (*)
