In the future of 2001, Freddie will be the last surviving teenager on Elm Street. Waiver of ANY scares everyone for the sake of humorous attempts at humor and unnecessary cameos of celebrities (come on .. Rosanna ??? Tom Arnold ?? !! ?? WTF?) This is due to the second part - the worst thing a child has ever done rapist. Wow, that was a piece of shit. Even the great legendary Alice Cooper could not get rid of the stench of this film. And when the hell did Freddie ever have a daughter? The whole film is very backward in every conceivable form, form and form. Rachel Talalay, you stink of heaven, baby. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Additional information about DVD: Biography of actors and actors; Go to the 3D-sequence and "Go to the nightmare" (additional materials for the film can be found on the seventh disc of the set of nightmares DVD set). <br /> <br /> Contents DVD-Rom: Trivia game; Scenario; and web link
