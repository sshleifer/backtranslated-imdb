This film tells about a very young girl, Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller), who leaves her family and is about to become a first-year student. One night, Cassie and her friends decided to go to a wild party with a lot of booze and dancing, and Cassie goes with her boyfriend who likes her, but never tells him that he loves him. When Cassie was driving, the car was stopped in the middle of the road, and she could not avoid the accident, and as a result, there was a bloody death of people with her boyfriend. Cassie is very emotionally upset and she has nightmares that cause her to have hallucinations that her boyfriend comes back to life and meets men trying to kill her, and she struggles to find out who her real friends are her death, and whether she will survive this horror of horror. Cassie wants her boyfriend to make love after he dies, and finds another guy in her bed, and she is told that she asks him to make love. This is an output film, and not very good.
