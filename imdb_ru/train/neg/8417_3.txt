I was expecting the release of the film just like any fan of the Broadway play. I waited and read reviews for several months about award-winning performances. I mean the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the film cannot be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film didn’t match the hype he gave, and Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson were the only saving graces. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's play “James Browniesk” saves the film precisely when it hits him. Her performance “And I Tell You” was the only time when I felt that the advertisement was well deserved. You cringed when she pleaded with her so that no good person would let her stay in the group and in his life. According to many reviewers, she steals the film from more experienced actors and deserves all the honors she receives for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong public with a great voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, traveled through their performances. The acting skills of Fox in this film seemed to precede his extraordinary performance in “Ray,” and Beyonce Knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video shoot, posing and swaying in the film. Her performance was not strong enough to make you take care of her character at any time of the film. <br /> <br /> The film was too popular, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's “soulful” solo for Jamie Foxx) for too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
