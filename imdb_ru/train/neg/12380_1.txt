Creativity of this film was lost from the very beginning, when the writers and directors missed a good storyline to replace it with terrible special effects. This film seemed to be focused on funny kids, but couldn't even do it. Many low-budget low-power films can be excellent, but this film is very close. Fortunately, it will be another movie that is easy to make and easy to forget. This film was probably a chance for the actors to make some money on the side until their chance appeared for a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has respect for films should avoid watching this film at all costs.
