Sending this expected sequel was really good, and after the huge success of the remake, I expected a lot sincerely. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this film is really absurd and inept. The situations are stupid and have no meaning, and the game is really terrible. <br /> <br /> At this time there are no great characters or violins, unlike the remake. In addition, there is not much blood, and when this happens, it is really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is minimal, and it's a shame, because there are many arguments that make you think that there is a place for heavy violence. I mean, there is a spetsnaz team that hunts a family of cannibal mutants. You certainly expect something else! When I watched him in movies, I wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a vivid example of how discarded films turn out to be erratic and show poor quality in all aspects. <br /> <br /> A mess that made a remake fan like me. That is why sequels are never welcome; at least this film is not as horrible as the 1985 continuation to the original.
