In a word: painful. I was advised to read some articles about the philosophical implications of this film later, but after sitting through the endless 115 minutes of the film and slowly crushed by its bloated symbolism and lava oppression, it seemed to me that it was better to simply report my reaction to the film. In the end, who goes to watch a movie with a training program in hand? And this film was dark. Chief actor Claude Laidou, from opening the film to its end, wears the same tedious and annoying mask of agony to be virtually indistinguishable from the eternal, dull voice-over of the film. Shooting one over the other could work better than subordinating the audience to both, since they basically say the same thing: Priest Ambrikura is an unhappy person. The story of a persecuted priest who is trying to help a troubled rich family does nothing to make its characters distantly interesting or sympathetic, since the family is a bunch of unpleasant eccentrics, and the priest himself looks like a curious wrecker. a fascinating message about the grace and suffering of one person, equal to the sufferings of others, but because of all the condescending close-ups of the suffering Layda and the vague subtext in the script of Robert Bresson, all I feel is tweeting, it was finally over, let's get some ice cream. It is interesting for fans of the fanatic Bresson Paul Schrader just to see how many elements of character and setting Schr√∂der transferred to his own scripts and films, especially Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Easy Sleeper.
