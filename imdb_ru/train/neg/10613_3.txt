Dancing was probably the only watchable thing in this film - and even that was disappointing compared to some other films. Oh my God! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst film - one that suggests that it is a work of art, because it contains all the attributes of a film as art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but ultimately lacks the depth and intensity of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself. Tango is teasing, it's hot, he has drama, it's bold - just what this film is not.
