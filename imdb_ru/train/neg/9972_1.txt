CHILD'S PROBLEM - one of the worst films I have seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but he got into trouble later. This junior can drive a grandpa's car. He can scare people with a bear. He can put a room on fire! This is a bad movie just like BATTLEFIELD EARTH. The sequel is even worse fate. Rent a CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** I give.
