Director Fred Shepizi (Roxanne) directs this well-meaning, but bad comedy about Albert Einstein (Mattau), trying to link his scientific niece (Ryan) with an ordinary guy Tim Robbins so that she can relax and enjoy life in the 1950s. To make Ryan love Robbins, Einstein is trying to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is nice, but the film is falling apart with banal situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the awesome cast are trying their best to keep this stupid comedy afloat, but they can't save the film. Unfortunately, so many talents went into creating such a dull film. I would not recommend to anyone if they are not big fans of Meg Ryan.
