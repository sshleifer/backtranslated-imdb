Must agree with another reviewer. It must be the worst movie, not to mention the western one I've ever seen. A terrible game, a dialogue that was unimaginable and pathetic (not to mention that it was completely inappropriate for supposedly in the 1800s), and, oh, I mentioned the battery pack, which is visible on the back of one of the characters? I waited for the microphone to crash in the middle of the stage. And the ending? At the very least, I can say that it matched the rest of the film ... absolutely terrible. And yes, it contained all the clichés in the book, starting with a slow walk along an empty dusty road and ending with funny frames “let's remember when” when the main character dies. Fortunately, I saw it on TV. Do not waste your time.
