Once again the same familiar story about a man (a writer here) who sells his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambitions in life: success. An unfunny script (we must “go home and write better”), ridiculous lines to understand the “strong” “Christian” message (our only desire in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) and a very long ordeal scene at the end where Agent Hopkins defeated the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not at all sexy and not evil) for all the bad things she did to this unpleasant character. A good effort from the actors (Baldwin also as a director, Cattroll again in the role of “Sex and the City”, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). Postscript Try also a not very popular film from Greece called “Alloimono stous neous”, a brilliant adaptation of this myth (the old man gives his soul to the devil to restore his youth)
