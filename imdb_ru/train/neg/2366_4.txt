I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, but this is terrible. Deaths are so fashionable. If you look at it after 20 years, the whole Nintendo scene is outdated. I really liked the memories. I think they should have done a prequel about when he was still alive. That would be more interesting. This is a movie that you can take or leave. It depends on how much free time you have.
