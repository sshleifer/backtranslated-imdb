Rosario Dawson plays the role of a girl who is raped and then begins to live in the dark until she gets a chance for revenge. Although it is clear why Dawson took on this role, it’s a chance to show off her acting shots and make a small independent, obviously not a Hollywood film, but it’s also clear that, besides her stunning looks, Dawson seems out of place in this role. Sorry, I just couldn't find her. This is not a mistake, this is what I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes, I know that she is on the screen, but although I spent most of the two hours looking at her, she did not make any impression on me. I blame this scenario, because, apart from the final, not everything that happened on the screen seemed to have any real meaning. People seemed to be posture rather than reality, and what was happening seemed not to be combined. Forgive me for the fact that I was uncertain, but nothing in this film, except for the end (which I would like to talk about, but I can’t, because it would spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image remained with by me. What can I say, it can click with you, maybe not, the time has come for me, I can't go back. Only for fans of Rosario Dawson, although keep in mind that there are several real reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario - please, you are the best actress, choose the best scenarios)
