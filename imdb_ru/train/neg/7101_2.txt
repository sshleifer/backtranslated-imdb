I would give this movie a zero out of ten, but I will give it two. The first reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is actually not the reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this film and does cuddle with Kamal. I love Rani very much and respect her for being a wonderful actress. That is why I did not enjoy her in this film, kissing Kamal, but this is not scary. In any case, there are enough scenes in the bedroom that made this movie visible, let's actually talk about this movie. Good or bad, I think it is a completely trash movie that made me yawn. Being a fantastic critic, you can see my 250+ reviews by clicking on my name, I have great taste. The film is not entertaining, this is one thing, and if it is assumed that it strongly affects the cinema, then why is there no morality in this film? This is a biased film that is not truthful and stinks. The fact that Kamal kisses these actresses makes me sick, the Man still can not kiss properly.
