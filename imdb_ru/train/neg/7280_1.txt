I will keep the review of this program as short as possible. Skip this. Low budget, not funny, lousy script. Acts not as bad as writing, but still bad. That's all you need to know, but I will continue in order to write more than you need. <br /> <br /> This is a film of three parts, each of which parodies some other type of film. A much more funny movie with the same idea - “Cinema Film” with George Scott. Very incomprehensible, but worth a look. MM parodied the films of the 30s and did it with elegance, precision and dry mind. <br /> <br /> This film did not. He parodies three types of films, presumably from the late 70s, early 80s, only parodies films that I have (almost) never heard of. First, I think, in a sense, a parody of Kramer vs. Kramer. Peter Reigert does his best using a dirty script. Second parody, I do not know what ... Daniel Steele novel? I mean, you could see such a story on Lifetime television, but in a movie theater? I mean, I remember the 70s, I was there. This is a parody of the type of soap opera about an attractive young woman who sleeps on her way to power. Such things usually parody themselves, so I do not understand how it was even necessary. <br /> <br /> We are a little easier with the third segment, “Municipalities”, which parodies films with the police. I noted the elements of “New Centurians” and some “Dirty Harry” that were almost 10 years old when the film was created. Yes, beautiful and relevant. Robbie Benson plays the idealistic young recruit (insane super), while Richard Widmark plays an old gray-haired cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in a police car (Oh! Stop! My parties! Disrespectful!) Note that this was the first movie after "Animal House" with the name "National Lampoon". Wow. Five years from this classic film to this pile of manure, is nothing but a shock. I could spend hours talking about the sad demise that led to the fact that one of the most advanced and original voices in American humor (it was National Lampoon, the original magazine, about 10 years ago) sold out and began a long, slow dive into world of shit, where now the magazine is long gone, and it exists only as a trademark that slaps low-budget "comedy" films. Another reason why capitalism (and cocaine) sucks so badly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film is a serious time. Don't waste your 90 minutes. I want my back. On the positive side, Fred Willard is at it!
