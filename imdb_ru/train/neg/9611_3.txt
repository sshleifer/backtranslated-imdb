There are so many stupid things in this film that I canâ€™t name but a few: <br /> <br /> BOGARTA character: 1. His name ?? Beat McCord (too easy, so I'll leave it at that. Boy, this makes Humphrey sound good.) 2. His long curly hair and silly sideburns. 3. His black bart, complete with spurs! 4. Not sure what color lip gloss they made him wear, but this is not too flattering. <br /> <br /> Character Cagney (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick does not provide him any good. , or. 2. A man is swallowed by his hat throughout the entire movie! Couldn't they find a hat to fit it? Even a little bit? !!?! 3. His pants are too tight at the back. 4. He blows smoke from a pistol too many times if you understand what I mean and I think you understand. <br /> <br /> If you're a casual fan of Bogart or Cagney, and think about it, it could be a change of pace to see them in the west, do yourself a favor and forget this thought. EVEN THE HORSE IS LOOKING! (That is, when they don't look boring.) <br /> <br /> In fairness, I admit that westerns are my least favorite movie genre, but I still saw a lot, MUCH better than that. <br /> The Oklahoma Kid works at a comedy level or in a high camp. Otherwise, the viewer is wary. Therefore, see this only if a) you must see all Westerners, b) you are TRUE Kagney or the Gods cart, c) any of the above comments you like. Wow .. ??
