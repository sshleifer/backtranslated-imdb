This solid little horror movie is actually one of the best Renny Harlin. The story is rather routine, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come to life; in fact, the ghost story is almost an afterthought. The real horror comes from the prison itself, and Rennie H. doesnâ€™t regret the details, showing us how bad the conditions inside this crumbling, leaking old hole filled with rats (with a sadistic overseer too!) Viggo Mortensen is usually superb in the lead role, supported by some very looking prisoners (in this cast no cute boys). Horror fans should check this out.
