“Shinobi” is one of those films in which the killing of a character in itself automatically causes a sense of gravity or emotion in the story. Unfortunately, in order for the audience to really care about people who are dying, you need to develop characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially complicated when you have a LOT of characters, all of whom die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you don’t want the characters to be memorable or sympathetic, you can at least make the reasons why they died believably, right? Nope Here we have a war between two ninja clans, and neither side knows WHY they fight each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. However, even after it becomes apparent that the emperor wants ALL of them to die, they still refuse to give up their meaningless missions. This is not stubbornness ... this is just nonsense. <br /> <br /> Good, good! There is no character development, and the plot does not give a reasonable justification for the fight. At least they die fighting in the coolest scenes, right? Once again, NO! In fact, many fights are not fights at all: super-ninjas that the film spent so much time and effort, presenting death suddenly (and, in my opinion, stupid). I’m talking about things like: “Lalala, I’ve come forward, and I ... * neck is cut *”. END for this character. Not even halfway through the movie, I raised my hands in despair at the absurdity of this movie.
