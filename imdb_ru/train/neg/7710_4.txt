"Attack of the killer tomatoes" consists mainly of disjointed, poorly collected shots in search of a film. The plot does not make sense, and various characters appear and disappear without explanation. Watching this stupid parody, you get the feeling that many other comments captured so accurately: that it is easy to make a cheap low-quality film and then use the “parody” angle to justify its cheapness and low quality one scene, female swimmers are afraid of tomatoes, who swim alongside them, how far can the "suspension of disbelief" go - even in parody?). The title track is great. (* 1/2)
