Although some training scenes were realistic, too many of them depicted military instructors as former Nazi types. Obviously, the people who wrote the script were either anti-war or wrote a film for this audience. <br /> <br /> I’m a Vietnamese veterinarian, and even during this period, military instructors who behaved into some of them are likely to still be serving time in a military prison. <br /> <br /> And I really liked the scene when the “hero” and his friend (both ordinary) sit in the captain's office and smoke Cigarettes, talking and swearing with the captain as if he was their friend. This kind of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, as it was the purpose of the scene. <br /> <br /> At the end I asked myself: “What is this film about?” as if he were wandering everywhere without any attention, except for “I hate all power”. Thank God, I got it from the library and did not pay to rent it.
