I hated this movie. They were absolutely terrible, poor, poor, pathetic actors, REAL REAL REAL REAL foolish criminals who were not even LITTLE FUNNY (unlike the first two home movies that were very good). all traps are weak, miserable apologies for ideas poorly copied from the first two, which simply meant that the people who wrote this film were just lazy because their salary did not exceed $ 20 a week. This movie is absolutely lousy, not even worth renting. In fact, do not even watch it on TV! Use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! I SAFELY give this 1 star (out of 10). Just believe me, when I tell you, if you liked the first two, and you are not a complete stupid person, you will not like this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
