Bo - Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) in Africa is studying this or that. She tracks him down (how?), And he tells her the stories of the natives about a giant monster whose nightly howl can be heard through the jungle. It turns out the monkey man himself (Miles O'Keefe, who has the best dialogue in the film), who saves her from the bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them plenty of time in these two painful hours to mess around naked, while the horny monkey looks at and cheers. I am usually very inclined to differing opinions about any film, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie in history. If you do not agree, you did not see it. (Notes: Newsday called it “intolerable,” which is the best one-word summary I can think of. The Cinematography Manual in Maltin says that they almost had to think about rating lower than BOMB.)
