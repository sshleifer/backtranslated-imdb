I had some beautiful poetic bits, but in reality it’s just frilly Farsi without any direction or permission. How do these people go through film school? who gives them money to do this shit? it could have been a lot more, a good lead actor, and I always like Fairuza Balk, but come on, the alt-rock metaphor that I just look emptyly unable to find something convincing, just so tired, and that is certainly not brings benefits to movies. the director must go away and live a long life, and not return to the camera until they really have something to say. it looks like a school of artistic creativity “throw spaghetti at the wall”, just match up a bunch of sincere images and hope, like hope, that poetry is born. it may work if the director really has a vision, or he has a brain that knows when he is in the presence of potential, but here it’s just a space filler, with no consequences. I felt a lazy ending, coming a few moments before it sounded, and shouted “lazy bastard” on the screen when credits appeared on the screen.
