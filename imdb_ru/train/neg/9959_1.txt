Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> It also has a terrible dialogue, inconclusive characters and a ridiculous, or rather non-existent story. It just sways from bad to worse as a result of a cynical attempt to wrest some emotion out of insincere and inexorable hysteria! <br /> <br /> AND BLACKBERRY !!!! How many cheap pictures can make a movie? By the way, the hedgehog gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety minute shaky-aton. <br /> <br /> If you have already considered the possibility of watching this film, do not do it. Sorry, but I can not find any function for this movie. It gives me a big, fat ZERO. Strictly for dog lovers. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> However, if you liked dancing in the dark ... <br /> <br />
