The woman (Miriam Hopkins in the role of Virginia) is chasing Men (Joel McCree in the role of Kenneth) for her father (Charles Winning in the role of BJ). The woman wants the man to invest part of the money of the deceased mother in the business of the father; but the father is notorious for losing money on enchanted schemes. Few people know, but the real evil intriguers pose as Man's best friends to steal his fortune ... <br /> <br /> Production looks fascinating, but the story does not fit. The players are not drunk. Known as the first appearance of Broderick Crawford - as a gopher "Chunk"; aside from doing errands, Mr. Crawford was nailed to the floor by Mr. McCree. <br /> <br /> *** A Woman Pursuing a Man (04/28/37) John J.
