“In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared into the Peruvian Amazon. A year later, he emerged from the jungle ... naked. It took him 45 years to return. ” Presumably, “Keep the river to your right” is a “modern cannibal tale.” In fact, anyone who seeks some understanding of cannibalism will be disappointed. The first half of the film is more like Nova Jinway's travel magazine, mostly about native art. The second half is based on photographs of the Peruvian cannibalistic tribe, but in fact it is all. Unless, of course, you are interested in home movies about a Jewish wedding or how Schneerbum introduces his former male lovers. I give up. Great disappointment and not quite the "modern cannibal tale." - MERK
