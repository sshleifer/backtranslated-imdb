Devil Hunter gained fame for being on the DPP "Video Nasty" list, but it really shouldn't have been. Many films are on the list where there are only known reasons for God (and the DPP), and although this is not the most modest group; there is not so much that justifies the ban ... it's a shame, because I would never sit where it would not be because it is on the “shopping list”. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least a decent base than most cannibalism films - and it follows the actress who was kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. The hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he must venture on the natives, led by a man who calls himself the "Devil" (hence the name). The film basically just lasts eighty-five minutes, and in fact not many interesting scenes. It is a pity that Jess Franco has finished filming such films, because this man has a talent; as seen from such films as “The Devil's Doctor W”, “Venus in Furs,” “Faceless,” and “She Kills in Ecstasy,” but, unfortunately, his good films are just gems among a pile of shit, Devils ”is in many ways part of this shit. I watched this film simply because I want to say that I saw everything on the DPP list (only two left!), And I think that’s why most of the other people who saw it, saw it. But if you are not in search of Nasties; there is really no reason to worry about it.
