Obviously, when you offer the actor enough money, they will do whatever they want. I'm not sure how much John Rhys-Davs got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even having to do with such a ROTTEN film. The special effects were worse than the effects from the films of the 1950s, and the rest of the actors were even worse. Regarding how bad the acting was, in my opinion, second place. English was terribly accented, and I think that no one could even speak English, they just remembered how words should sound, instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character “alive” and real.
