The Omega code was a model of cinematic inconsistency. There was little (but very little) good acting, mostly from two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise, the game was clearly bad. The storyline was rather weak and only partially based on the already dubious biblical interpretation. Of course, not one of the best in the year.
