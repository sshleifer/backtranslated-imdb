awful, just awful! my old roommate was watching this junk and it drove me crazy. the book is one of my favorites, and it's a shame that some people never know what it really is, because their first impressions of such a drop have changed so much that it is hardly recognizable. which confuses me, since the book still reads like a soap opera, providing enough food for modern entertainment. it looks like one of those life movies that say “based on real events,” but they are completely made up. there is neither emotion nor depth of the book in it, only meaningless melodrama. If you're in high school, look for a way to stop reading, I suggest you try a different version.
