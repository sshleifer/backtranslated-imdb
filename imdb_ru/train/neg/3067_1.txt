This is just bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they deviate from the original, are good in themselves. They can bring a different point of view and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. It was as badly thought out and executed as possible. It was useless, even to stand alone. Viggo Mortenson is a first-class actor, but some of his collections of roles and projects leave much to be desired. The original “Disappearing Point” was such an exciting, psychological adventure; it is not an adventure at all, and it is neither fun nor entertaining. This was done because of the approach to creating a movie based on numbers, with the addition of a plot that someone in Hollywood thinks will like what he sees in today's cinematic audience. In fact, they see a bunch of idiots in us. It's a shame that someone will release it as a feature film, and even try to change this cult classic so casually. Manipulative plot techniques, aspects of "make it obvious so that they do not miss", a ridiculous dialogue, stereotypical characters, amateur management ... <br /> <br /> This is just bad ....
