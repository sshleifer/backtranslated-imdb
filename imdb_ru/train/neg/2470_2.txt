Over the years I have seen a lot of horrible shows, such as the Nightstalker, devoted to the legend of Wendigo, so I was looking forward to an evil spirit that caused chaos to give a taste to the Halloween season. Man was I wrong. The whole film creates a sense of events that must happen, which will be scary and creepy, but then tell a very simplistic story of revenge and murder due to the loss of some kind of property. Very scary - no! This film has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another loser. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s getting harder to believe that Hollywood is pushing movies about scary movies because they rarely become something original and frightening. What idiots pay to make such a fake movie? Go back to the guys at the drawing board and do something useful with the millions of dollars that you have to throw.
