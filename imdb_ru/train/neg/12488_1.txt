0.5 / 10. There is nothing good about this movie. Acting is one of the worst I've ever seen, which is really amazing, because EVERYTHING is terrible, not just some here and there, everything. The direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly obvious, the rating is terrible, I would not say that the film was edited, brutally split up is a more appropriate phrase. It combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. It's not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. Ludicrously bad in everything. The letter was terribly bad. Cinematography is really cheap in appearance, sometimes very grainy, and cinematography is terrible. Again, what the film really does is how awful all the actors are. Cheese.
