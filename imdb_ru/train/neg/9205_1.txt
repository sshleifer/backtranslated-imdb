This movie is terrible. Bad game, bad letter, bad music. That's just terrible. Not only does this incredibly distort role-playing, but the key elements of the film are poorly executed. May God, whom I do not believe, have mercy on the souls of the unfortunate villains who conceived and gave birth to this abomination.
