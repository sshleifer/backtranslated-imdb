What happens to the RGV? It seems to be repeated in every movie. Did he run out of creative ideas? If he has time, move to the back seat. I watched the film with a great expectation - of course, I never thought that it would be somewhere close to the original. I knew it would not, the promo said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great pleasure from the RGV, after all, isn't he the same guy who led Satya and the Company? Or is he? I have doubts after watching Aag. I'm not going to talk about the plot or story, since most of them are taken from the original, if you really want to see this plot, you can play a fun game with friends: identify scenes from the original one and give your ratings! So Veeru becomes Hiro (how trivial is it?), I think Hiru won't sound so great. Ajay Devgan is a real disaster, since Hiro, a tense comedy, and vague conversations that were really effective in the company, sound fake. Chemistry between Hiro and Gangkhru (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the nicer the niche, the more annoying it is. It peaks toward the end. Raj is actually not bad compared to others, he is a guy you can look at in the future. I was very disappointed that Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something from a bowl covered with a shawl, instead of inspiring fear, he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only view that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I don't have the patience to write more.
