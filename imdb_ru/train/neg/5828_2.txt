I could not agree with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be very boring and boring "in content." It can produce eye candy (and I love candy), but its pretentiousness and fundamental artistic emptiness simply diminish all the joy. <br /> <br /> I’m afraid that many people don’t make a distinction between similar (but really only on the surface) works by Khodorovsky or even more linear directors such as Tarkovsky or Kubrick (I love 2001 Odyssey and never been bored in the final scenes ...) Such art, as in the work of M. Barney, adds confusion and pushes away viewers who might otherwise begin to appreciate experimental cinema. Typical empty postmodern "conceptual" art. And check out his interview. I just don't buy it, sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I was never bored watching Alejandro Khodorovsky’s films, and drawing Restraint 9 was a complete disappointment. Especially while he offered the possibility of being something, to actually say something in a non-linear, unorthodox way (for example, the beginning and the magnificent choreographic dance and preparations for the ship’s sailing. The ships "meet" at sea ... Ideas feces like object of value (if it was feces). These "pearl" divers ... Everything could create an excellent surreal film with some content. But it is not. And these terrible pretentious scenes of dresses and fake tea ceremony ... How vain, fake and philosophically rushing Scary, but empty can it get? <br /> <br /> I have some great picturesque scenes, but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious, completely empty and fake, which made me physically sick. <br /> <br /> And he doesn't have a good tempo. I like slow films, but it was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and fake - so I just had to watch a long scene of artistic vanity ... <br /> <br /> Such films just kill art and the spirit of t in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
