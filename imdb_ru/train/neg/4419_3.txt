As a “missing Catholic,” who had 11 years of Catholic school, but he did not attend a 35-year mass, with the exception of weddings and funerals, I thought I would enjoy it. And I did. the first two thirds of the film. These were all standard things - strict parish school teachings, repressed sexuality, etc. But then the film suddenly turned around. Actually means. Now notice, I saw it before the scandals with pedophilia broke out. , and, perhaps, I would not be so offended by such heinous, hated excavations in the Catholic Church, if I knew about these abominations (such a Catholic term!) and concealment. <br /> <br /> It has been a few years since I shot the video, and I will not be returning to rent it from a new point of view. It just left such a dirty, nasty, ugly taste in your mouth. I wonder what kind of experience all the actors got with the Church, because either they * really * hate it, or they earn money for salary. This is an incredibly anti-Catholic film, offensive to anyone who has a glimpse of respect for Catholic education. What I am still doing, because in the 50s there were no best teachers. Whatever these nuns did, they forced me to learn to read and write in English. They made us remember. (How many children today can do simple arithmetic in their heads?) The truth is that in America there is nothing more important for success. I can read? Can I add / subtract / multiply / divide? Fine. You can get any degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will help you not only continue your studies, but also for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of the Catholic “mythology” that we all had to learn. <Br /> <br /> Such a great cast, such a lousy, rotten script. I really feel bad (and no, it's not “bad” - believe me, the nuns taught me better) for a writer and director. <br /> <br /> I thought I had mixed feelings about the Catholic school. But the participants of this project must have been those bad (i.e., Foolish) children who sat in the back of the room if they willingly participated in the making of this film.
