In 2005, George W. Bush began his second period as president of the United States; North Korea has declared its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a film called Into the Blue has appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened that year, but the film itself was pathetic and possibly the worst of that year. Now, in 2009, the United States has another president, another dad, a new Korean nuclear weapon ... and the film Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but this is the same thing as saying: "get your fingers" "Slice better than slash your head." This sequel is a really bad movie that made me feel terribly bored and not interested. In the movie "In the Blue 2: Reef", the actors of the series are shot, who absolutely lack the authority and drama. weight, but which are perfect for showing your body. Chris Carmack (OK), David Anders (Heroes and Pseudonyms), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Thomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring empty and boring performances. I liked some of the previous films from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Beal Ted and I in “Superb Adventure,” especially), but in this film he can't even generate a minimum level of tension, emotions or entertainment. The characters of this film are not only poorly executed, but also disgusting. Honestly, I wanted them all. The cinematography from this film is also unconvincing, and it seems that it was made by a technical team that makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels. Blue 2: Reef is a terrible film that is better than the original film, but it's the same thing as nothing, as I said earlier. Avoid this crappy movie at all costs.
