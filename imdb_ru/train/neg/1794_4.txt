not your typical vamp story, not Bram Stoker or Anne Rice. really original story about vampires. these vampires are genetic mutants that are not disturbed by sunlight. they are pure evil. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect. many of the actors are clearly amateurs. Although the two leaders who play van Helsing and rally the vampire are pretty good. the film is very cruel that may disturb some people. it is also loaded with scientific details that many will be hard to understand, and they may get bored. I was sold on a clever storyline and a couple of good performances. not to say how successful this film would have been if it had a larger budget, and it received massive distribution
