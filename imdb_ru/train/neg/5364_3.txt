Complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed at women. I'm fine with these nocturnal soaps, such as Grey's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or the West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even if they never end. However, when the idea is parallel to daily soaps, aimed at simply putting healthy men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) on sexual tension and bustle, as well as on many ridiculous difficult situations in the so-called small hospital, it looks like a hospital general profile ... or the female equivalent of Baywatch. It was what men wanted, and they had it, so if this is what women want, then let it be, but the idea that this is a high-brow show (or what men will watch) is unreal.
