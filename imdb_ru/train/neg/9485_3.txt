Due to the fact that others have problems with the synthesis of the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this film. There may be spoilers; I don't care to filter them. <br /> <br /> - Given the small budget of the film, the creatures' design was pretty good. It's actually nice to see a horror movie made right on the video, which is not covered in horrible computer graphics. Unfortunately, the quality of digital film is quite grainy in places, and this is most noticeable in the well-lit white rooms of the shelter. <br /> <br /> - A ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film, not to mention variations in the course of time. I understand that the director might have tried to simulate dementia, but in order for it to be effective, it was necessary to establish a constant flow of time. In fact, it just seems amateurish. <br /> <br /> - The plot twists were numerous, but consistently predictable. I had no doubts about the personality of the cultists in vestments, nor that some kind of lame, trump, good development would appear at the end. <br /> <br /> This may seem like a niggle, but the characters in this film are reliably unable to use any common sense. First of all, in all mental health care centers, there will be regulatory commissions that unilaterally announce all deaths of patients and workers caused by cardiac arrest. Why can the chief psychiatrist also conduct an autopsy? Why was there no plot made from these impressive qualities, or from his acquaintance with the strange choice of religion? What background? What should make us care about anyone in this? And, just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through acquaintance with this place, see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with him, and then come to the conclusion that it is still a great place to get a place of residence? This film did not even respect its heroes enough to give the mind the advantage of doubt. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: see “The Wicker Man” instead.
