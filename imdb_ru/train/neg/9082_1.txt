This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was deceived when I thought it might be good, because there are a couple of my favorite actors in it. Now I want to hit Jason Schwartzman in the face for this role. I was physically sick after watching this movie. I really do not understand Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people trying to hack that Iâ€™m sure you can take off the top and get the best. So the worst movie you shoot is equivalent to Ferris Beullar, not this sludge. Fun, like a doll for the hair and frankly ripping jeans, added film humor. Glad I escaped this movie and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid the January releases at all costs.
