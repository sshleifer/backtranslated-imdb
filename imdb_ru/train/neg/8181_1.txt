I went to see this film (in fact, I went to see Family Portraits, which has “Cutting Moments” + 2 other short films by Douglas Bac) at the Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina) ... I just could not watch it ! After the first half of the Cutting Moments, I had to close my eyes and occasionally look in. By the time it was over, my stomach turned over, and I felt dizzy. I just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the start of the 2nd short number (by the way, I was not the only one who left the room). It was too cruel and disgusting for me! I am impressed with many brave people who really loved it. I just do not understand how you can love such films! The shocking, bloody and terrible images that I saw were really stuck in my head like two days !! I'm also trying to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw it all and told me about it), and I just don’t think it makes any sense. I mean that the amount of violence and stuff has no other meaning than trying to shock people. And this is not a good enough reason, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this film that I could say: “Well, at least,“ x ”was good in that.” But, probably, I will never understand such films.
