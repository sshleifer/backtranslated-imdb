My wife and I both thought that this film was a “diluted, created for television” (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery ... which is good in itself but not great. There is little interpersonal tension or chemistry in history, and not much plot. The character of Woody Allen just somehow wanders, running into his mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson have nothing more to do. I must say, it is quite disappointing. The role of Jan McShane is just an extended cameo. <br /> <br /> The first thing that occurred to me was: “I wonder how much BBC Woody Allen had to pay to get him out of Manhattan?” He must have needed money, and they must have needed his call to expand their audience beyond the youth market, attracted by two stars. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3, because it’s an unpleasant background noise. If you ever want something to be put on while knitting or sorting your stamp collection, it will work. I would not pay the rent again.
