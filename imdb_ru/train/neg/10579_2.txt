According to IMDb Takashi Miike, the master of the horror segment "Imprint" was banned in the United States. So I decided to translate the Swedish review that I just wrote for him ... <br /> <br /> It was hard not to expect any expectations from Ichi. The series of killer director Takashi Miike in the "Masters of Horror" series. And the Fingerprint DVD cover actually looked very promising. <br /> <br /> The story basically takes place in a distant Japanese bordello, some time in the 19th century, and tells the story of how a journalist searched for Komo, a woman he left behind and for which he promised to return. Tired and dejected, he arrives in Bordello, hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, an ugly and quiet girl, knows about Komo, and a desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what happened to her since he left. The story she tells him is as bad as it is difficult to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me in this episode was how unnatural it seemed that the Japanese cast was mostly free to say in american style -English. But I will leave it at that, it is not so important. Which is a big deal, however, how unhappy the rest was. Miike's story moves at such a slow speed that I could not look at the clock several times for 63 minutes. The magnified torure-scene, which happens somewhere in the middle of the film, felt so unmotivated — and pornographically obsessive — that even this scene had become interesting. I felt that it was violence only for the sake of violence itself - without a sense of style or purpose. The only scenes that aroused my emotions were images of bloody embryos rolling across the bottom of rapidly flowing water ... and, frankly, the only emotions they aroused were feelings of disgust. <br /> <br /> The journalist searching for the love he left behind plays Billy Drago, for me the most memorable for me is how Frank Nitti is the killer of Al Capones in white clothes in the movie “Brian de Palmas the Untouchables” (1987). I have always believed that Dragos portrays Nitti as very icy (and I mean it in a good way), and therefore, probably, I was almost annoyed when I discovered that he was so terrible (NOT in a good way) in this one. It seems that his actions take place between a lack of feeling or sympathy for the manifestations of some really bad reappraisal. When his character was supposed to react to the horrible things that Komomo was subjected to, I was sitting on the couch, turning and turning, trying to avoid the horrible acting work put forward by Drago. I am grateful that most of the story is told by Juoki Kudo (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2005), who plays a deformed prostitute. <br /> <br /> The ending is probably choking, maybe even disgusting and terrible, but I just found it kind of ... well, you know ... "blah" (and once again I’ve looked at his watch, just wanting this crappy episode to end). Perhaps the final made me smile a little bit, but that’s just because I couldn't help but think about the Red Dwarf episode and Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules flipped chins, with eyes glued to them, like aliens. .. Fortunately, if you saw this episode and now decide to see "The Imprint", I have forever messed up the visual effects of the final for you. <br /> <br /> My first thought, when Imprint finally ended, was that the only thing that made you suffer from watching it was worth it, to hear the main title theme of Edward Shirmur (the same music that I believe it is used in every episode of this series), and that - if anything - - is this a damn serious warning, isn't it? <br /> <br /> You can point out Michiko Kitamura’s costume design and say that, at least, it lacks style and sophistication. But there are so many other films and TV shows that show Japanese geisha fashion much better. This is nothing less than inferior, and I am disappointed. Horror Lords Takashi Miike are boring, boring and meaningless. In other words; This is really very bad!
