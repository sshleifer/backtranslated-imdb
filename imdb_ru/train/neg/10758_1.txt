This is probably the most boring, worst and useless film that I saw last year. The plot, which was supposed to have some philosophical aspects, seemed to me a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with many phrases: a lone wolf cop, good looking, psychologically upset, sleeping with a gun ... + a good hard worker and shy, but like a scientist a plot of 2 cents, and you have me, robot! I was terribly concerned about the obvious advertising of brands such as FedEx, Audi, Converse, etc. This film stinks of commercialization and, as a rule, is a bad advertising space, which, unfortunately, will not end in 30 seconds. I would not advise this to my worst enemy, if you have free time, instead watch a good TV program or better read a good book.
