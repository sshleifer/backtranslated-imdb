This film features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. It also boasts an always-nice Larry Miller in too small a piece. Despite this, I found it almost impossible to observe. Michelle Monaghan may be cute, but she is almost free from charisma, and the reasons for Downey’s obsession with her character are not at all understandable from the point of view of the information the film represents, or how it is depicted. The final seems pretentious, and although it seems that the audience should join it and wink at the film, since we could not attract us to the side of our main characters, which makes us undesirable or unable to do so. <br /> <Fans say that those who disagree simply “do not understand.” I don't think so. The plot was not complicated or incomprehensible. It was just unattractive, clumsy and obviously crafted. I understood. ”I just didn’t like it.“ I left, ”Paddy Brentnah, and Guy Ritchie's“ Piece ”and“ Locking, stocks and two smoking barrels ”are much better realized examples of film production that director Shane Black cannot achieve. <Br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but looking at his work (mostly as a screenwriter) makes me dissociate myself from any other connection.
