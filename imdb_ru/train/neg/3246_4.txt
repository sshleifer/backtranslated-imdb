The plot of “House of Games” is the strongest thing in this: a successful writer and psychologist has swept over a gang of criminals, but, having discovered a wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do, she finally gets her revenge, It's about filing: Someone must take responsibility for what it looks like the actions of the puppets. Director Mamet must have: Lindsay Crouse had a varied and fairly stable television and film career, so she cannot perform so badly all the time. It is assumed that she has moved from a stubborn, tough, controlled professional to a prudent, wicked fast lady who has fun, as evidenced by the transition from a beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three days in a row, including underwear) to a flexible floral sundress . But everyone seems to say their lines in the same truncated, exact way; I guess Mamet wants to make sure that the syllable of his sparkling script is not missed. The effect disturbs and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and uncertainty, which he is probably trying to create. From time to time, “House of Games” loses any connection with how people actually behave or speak, and it becomes just a mechanism for plot promotion. The awkward soundtrack of vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz doesn't help either. The end result is that the only entertainment you can get is to guess the result, and the sooner you do this, the sooner you will get bored with a robotic two-dimensional representation. And they smoke too much !!!
