Oh my God! (and this is from an atheist), this “movie” is bad! <br /> <br /> Reviewers have already spoken about this (those who rated this part 3 and below), to which I fully agree, I just would like to add a few things: <br /> <br /> among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, were chopped up with an ax, raped with a broom, eggs were torn down - the former guy undergoes the most terrible torture when he has to listen to the endless and senseless chatter of the girl at the kitchen table (like us, but at least we have the mercy of the mute button). <br /> <br /> the director cut out an endless graveyard and upturned scenes, our suffering would have gone in 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only things that made this film at least somewhat tolerable were Emily Haack's tits (one point). <br /> <br /> forget about it. don't buy it. don't waste your time. and your sanity. my brain is so hot after watching it, I feel an urgent need to look (and suffer?) "Notes" right now.
