It was one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I laughed at the whole movie! The plot was so cheesy; especially the end. This film turns from the end of the world catastrophe to saving eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use EARNINGS for acne! And there was this terrible kissing scene in the middle with two main characters divorced. How predictable! It was so terrible that my mom, my sister and I couldn't finish it, and when we ADD it, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it, and this time we finished it, we made MST3K-like comments throughout the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Summary: see only if you are a movie buff! Make funny comments, look at the night before a laugh, and I mean HUGE laughter. Also watch out for bullying. A metaphor explaining this film: this is a very shallow field full of dolls with cheese and a toe!
