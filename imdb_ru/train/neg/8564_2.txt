The film itself is so pathetic. He portrayed deaf people as cynical towards hearing people. True, some deaf people are afraid to meet with hearing people, but they are not necessarily angry, like Marley Matlinâ€™s character throughout history. The deaf don't go to the bar and dance like Matlin did. In general, the film itself is more boring than pitiful. It's so boring that I want to believe that this is a film cured of insomnia. If I have trouble sleeping, I can just look at the Children of the Lesser God and see. It puts me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, this is a deaf guy talking.
