This is one seriously concerned movie. Despite the fact that the boys deserved something of what they got ..... sadistic horrible executions were "a little" excessive. The only character who showed some conscience at the beginning of the hunt was killed before he could offer some help to a sad conspiracy. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, it seemed like there was some promise of a mediocre novel, but it was just a ploy to put the audience to sleep with a false sense of security to the joy of the future. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save the film for me would be if Jack Nicholson jumped out of the bushes and shouted: “Where is Batman?”. Kim Basinger could scream. <br /> <br /> Now that would be awesome!
