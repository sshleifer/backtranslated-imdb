So ... we see Brando's footage added ... interesting, but not quite Oscar-worthy stuff. Suzanne York was hardly a stoop. The new scene, where Lois finds out that Clark is Superman, is a bit unbelievable, because he doesn’t notice that spaces go out of the gun instead of real bullets. The real bullets would penetrate his clothes and then bounce him to the floor, but forget that ... let's hear Donner making fun of the version of Leicester, which had a more logical sense. The president says that Zod “defiles” the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Changing this scene made this line rather absurd. Superman’s press freedom line sounded silly compared to “... Careful to get out,” which was delivered better and had a suitable connection to Clark’s earlier scene at the truck stop. Then comes the ending with the effect of "turn the world around to go back in time." He reversed everything in the entire film and made him wonder where the rocket destined for Hackensack, NJ, flew exactly, since it no longer releases Zod and the company.
