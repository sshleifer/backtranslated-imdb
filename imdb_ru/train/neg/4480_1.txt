Let me start by saying that at first I did not watch this film with high expectations. He was advised to me by a friend with a mediocre taste in the films, and the inscription “MTV” was pasted on the cover, so I did not expect much. What I expected was tearing, overly dramatic, but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, let me start by saying that I have never read a book or watched any other versions of the film. <br /> <br /> Acting was my main chain in the film. God, this is terrible. The main girl is rather mediocre, but compared to the rest of the cast she is Meryl Streep. The main “Hero”, Heath, is just awful. He can sing decently sounding clichés, but that's all. His game broke the "sad" moments, being so bad that I just laughed. The girl from Isabella was also damn good, and her brother was just a flat character, played by an actor who couldn’t express emotions at all. And when he tried, it failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only worthy actor playing Edward, although it was obvious that the direction was bad because even he did not match what I saw how he did. Oh, and my father was not half harmful to my memory, but he was in the film for so little time that I hardly remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More gaps than you can imagine. Predictable story (To the end, which I hardly understood). EXTREMELY one-sided characters without a real depth of them ... In general, just not interesting and not convincing, nothing that we have never seen before has done MUCH better, and nothing is worth watching here. <br /> <br /> The ending is supposed to be a tear. Nothing like this happened. The ending is not built at all, it almost resembles a belated thought. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY the ending really happened, and when they explained it to me, I must have had the expression “Wait, when did they say that? What?". Never a good sign. Editing was probably the worst thing I've ever seen, although I understand that a gradual disappearance occurs because it was originally made for television, but this is really no excuse. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is just garbage. I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of The Simpsons. I never cried during this shit, even close. In fact, this film is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tear man, look elsewhere.
