There’s really nothing to say about this movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting and dialogue is very far from decent, the history of the werewolf hybrid is not well explained, and that's the point. there are holes in the plot here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you don’t want to see. It is so amateur that it makes me sick. <br /> <br /> The only good thing on the DVD was in Extras. Gag gag. Everything else is just a waste of time and money. I hope no one buys it, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from that.
