I entered it with my hopes, by twenty minutes in the film I could not be more disappointed. Although I thought it would be another terribly bad remake, I had high hopes that maybe ... just maybe someone would do it right this time. Unfortunately, the prom is about the same level of quality as the recent remake of April Fool's Day, bad script, bad direction, stupid excessive play, and generally terrible horror. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end it’s boring, repetitively worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. We saw it all before, and we saw that it made a million times better than that. If you go to see the prom in the theater (I would say, wait a DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience laugh, because they will laugh. Laughing is not in those moments of the film that should be funny, but in response to the key “exciting” moments of the film that are so poorly made that you feel you are watching the latest version of the movie “The Terrible Film”. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a fake? Cinematographers missed so much here that a large number of spectators in the theater I attended attended about halfway through the film. What in retrospect, I would like to do. Not me though, I had to torture myself and stick to it, hoping it would get better. Needless to say, it is not. “Awful” scenes are a joke, not so much because of the action, but because of the direction, the script, the “special effects” and the camera work. The film looks as if they spent a fortune on its production, but still came out of it with a microbudget film. I was half expecting to see a dollar store tag on some of the props and kept thinking that I would spot a porn star in a cast somewhere. <br /> <br /> These films are scary, well, if this is the future of big budget horror, then the horror genre is doomed.
