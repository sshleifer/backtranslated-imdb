Not sure why this movie was advertised as a wild, whimsical, funny comedy. There is nothing in this film that can entertain or entertain the viewer. Annette Bening (whose performance was advertised as Oscar-worthy) comes here as a manner, with her work, seemingly routine. The character of Brian Cox is confusing and annoying, and the main role is played by Augustin ?? Joseph cross ?? it seems just not enough personality to fulfill its role. The best thing about the film is Evan Rachel Wood, but it is not enough to support this boring, unpleasant film. <br /> <br /> The film disappeared quickly, and this seems like a good reason. I found some scenes unpleasant (the scene with Brian Cox and his freshly used toilet rivals, some of the worst scenes in “You and Me, and All We Know” and “Squid and the Whale”), some embarrassing, and most disturbing . I found the whole experience a waste of time. You do not waste your time ??
