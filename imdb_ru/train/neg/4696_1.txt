I know people, I was engaged in animation and graphic design, and the show is terrible! They are rich little children who have no talent, and probably just begged Nick to accept them! Alex played drums for one year, I played 4 1/2! The film is terrible, like the show! This is the craziest mixed comedy I've ever seen. This is so stupid that makes me want to soar !!! It is so insane that Nickelodeon will someday accept something like that and such a stupid one! They are sooo stupid and strange! I hate them and their shows, and I think that as soon as Nick realizes how stupid they are, they hopefully shoot it!
