So, I learned about this film, and I watched the preview after reading almost all the reviews, and it was difficult for me to discuss whether I should watch it or not. Even before I watched the movie, I was emotionally strange. I was so not sure if I was going to watch it and be bothered for a long time. So I decided to take a chance and look, and this is what I thought: the beginning began well for me. It seemed to be moving in a decent direction. Passed the scene of rape, and I could not understand why people were so worried or bored by the movie. Don't get me wrong, the rape scene was just as sad and scary, but in fact it didn't bother me until the dramatic moment. Then, when the middle came, I understood the boring things that were happening. There were 5-minute snapshots when people walked around, saying or showing nothing! It's one thing to shoot when a person shows some kind of emotion, but this film was not. There were about 3 such meaningless scenes in it, where you see how the main character Maya gets out of control, but it did not show that it made me want to rewind. Then, when she participated in hard parties, it was not so boring, but still a bit boring. Oh, and as a note, Rosario Dawson still did a great job. Well, we continue, so finally, after an hour of meaninglessness in the middle, revenge attracts Maya's attention. This is where it became anxious. I did not feel bad for him, or nothing, he got what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing, and I just felt terrible after that. I can not tell you whether to watch this movie, because it is so ... I do not know, I can not find the words to summarize. But if you decide to look, just do not be reckless.
