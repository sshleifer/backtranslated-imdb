It’s not that I’m joyfully full of joy at the sight of realistic bloodshed, but when I insert a DVD in anticipation of bloodshed, and I get one bloody scene (eyeball) in the tail of the aninite slap-slap and spin As a result, I thought: “Here, 43 minutes of mine life is gone forever. " I would not consider this or “films” from “Flesh and Blood” as much as the exercise of the will; to see if you can sit through them. The Flower of Flesh and Blood had several difficult places to observe. Devil's experiment did not. It was stupid at best, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I put a DVD with the thought: "Oh, it will be bad." After I watched them slap a girl about a thousand times, I watched her on an accelerated basis. <br /> <br /> This film may be interested in two types of people. 1) People who are looking for F'd up movies, just to see how good they are, or 2) The most complete horror. I was looking for this and other guinea pig films for the latter reason, but even if I were in the first category, this film would not let my boat go. In fact, I could imagine this film increasing blood-thirst ... as in "YOU WOULD ONLY KILL B * TCH !!" So in conclusion, the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes. If you need a slaughter that does not give the traditional horror, find traces of death. Of course, this also sucks, but at least you will get the blood and courage you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see anyone who praises this nonsense is that they feel they should. There are no artistic merit that I can understand, there is no reason for their notoriety, there is nothing. Just an unsuccessful attempt to be shocking.
