The “secretary” is one of those cheese, stamped “thrillers” that should be watched on a Sunday afternoon, when practically nothing happens. Although the plot (an insane woman begins to envy everyone who succeeds in her office and decides to do her best to stop them) may be one of a kind, I learned countless plot twists, probably taken from other television films that I was subjected to the same reason. <br /> <br /> Worse, I wasn’t thrilled with the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many television films as “mother” or some kind of “victim” of dishonest play or abuse, so you need to ask yourself what kind of life she leads. In this film, she enjoys playing with her mother and the victim psychoanalyst Sheila Kelly, who was not a good choice for a villain. While Sheila Kelly made some good career moves (“Singles,” “Breaking,” and, I believe, “Law and Order”), she is also overwhelmed by a number of pathetic television roles, and this episode only adds to this. As for the others, I do not have clear memories of them, so I have to say something. <br /> <br /> This WILL play on Lifetime Network (I think that’s where I saw it), but don’t worry if you’re not too tired of words. Not that it bothered you more ...
