This film was a waste of time even on DVD. If the shots from the super-speed camera are faster than this, we could pay twenty dollars to get into the laundry, popcorn and see how the dryer rotates. Jet Li is much better than this. One can only hope that he will not make deals in the near future in order to make another film similar to a cliché like The One. <br /> <br /> If there is one movie that you should avoid, this is “The One.”
