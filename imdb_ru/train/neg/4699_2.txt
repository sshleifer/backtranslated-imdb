wow, the group "Naked brothers". What should I say. I think I can say that this show just sucks. Number one: they have no talent, they probably can't even play instruments. Number 2: The ad says that they are famous, but no one even heard about them until the shit show started. Listen, I really don’t hate it so badly, I would rate it as 4 out of 10, but it annoys me that everyone says that they have such great talent, and Nat is so deep and writes deep texts. Deep down my ass! he talks about tough fighters with inner feelings. wow, I could read what is written on the walls of the bathroom, and that would be deeper than that. And they didn’t become known by themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and they wanted their children to be such a bad show. I have a feeling that this will be canceled soon.
