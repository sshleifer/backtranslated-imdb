Sorry, but I did not really like this document. I can come up with a million ways how this could be better. People who have done this, obviously, do not have much imagination. The interviews are not very interesting, and no real insight is offered. Video recording is also not very informative. This is very bad, because this is a film that really deserves special attention. I will say one thing: Isabella Rossellini is getting prettier than older. Everything is considered, it only gets "4".
