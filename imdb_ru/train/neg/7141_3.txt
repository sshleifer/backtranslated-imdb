So, I entered this film, not expecting much, I realized that the action movie was like The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars, some pretty girls, some decent plot. Unfortunately, I have to say that this was probably the worst film I have seen this year. Don't get me wrong, the cars were good, and the girls were fine, but the way they put the movie together was just shitty to express it well. The story never forced you to take care of the film crew, and the film seemed to be folded together. So in general, this film was far from the worst, but if you were looking for a film for the weekend this weekend, I would now pass on this film.
