Nothing can prepare you for another lousy walk! This time it will bring you the inevitable Fred Olen Ray! As for the exploitation of films, this one does not click! As science fiction, it’s just unoriginal! All we see is an ugly female android, dressed in a bikini to destroy the Earth, and showing off all that it is almost impossible to resist! Give me a damn break !!! If you love this kind of entertainment, why not shake those old SI swimsuits from the attic for a change ?! It would be much better if this factor were not too high, but it still would not make this figure excellent. I would like to mention another Jim Winsky film called THE ASSAULT (1996), which resembles the personality of ALIENATOR. This shows why the first-class first-person action movies, the “femme fatale” are not well suited for America. Sorry guys!
