The film begins with 3 people meeting each other at the bar. OK. They talk about their imaginary life, they lie all the time without a reason. Still fine. From time to time they even make you laugh. Interesting. The first 30 minutes you really enjoy! But then ... everything gets worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you see is how the naked old ladies touch each other! Not good. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be in the top of the film, but that’s all but that! Cinema does not make sense, it is boring and painful! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) at the FEST festival (film festival) this film was the most popular, according to studies, of course, before people watched it! I even thought (before watching): “Hey, this can be interesting, although this is a Russian film”! But oh god no !!!!
