Trite, clichéd dialogues and plots (the same as what we saw in science fiction films of the 1980s), hockey music and drawn characters knock it out of action for all but the most hardcore fans. <Br /> <br /> What saves this film from a heap of rubbish is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi’s work, rotoscoping and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... in motion. The violence is impressive, and the artistic direction and animation are not like any other film about swords and witchcraft of that period. <br /> <br /> I like to watch it without sound, instead playing the soundtrack for the first film about Conan.
