I was not completely impressed with this film. He was originally called Sin Eater and was supposed to stay that way, given that this is all that was said in the last half of the film. I'm not even sure that the first 20 minutes of the film were related to the rest of the film. It was very slow, and that was with the choice of Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. It was a sad moment. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say check it out if you like things related to the Catholic religion, but you do not expect an exorcist or the stigmata from this film. In a few days he will surely fail, and the rumor will turn out.
