The minor connection between this film and the first Fat is set at the very beginning of the film, when Didi Conn, one of four actors repeating their roles, approaches the young Maxwell Caulfield, who is a British exchange student. Although Olivia Newton St. John’s stranger’s speech was not explained in the previous film, here it is explained that Caulfield is her cousin. What Conn is still doing at school, I think she just likes to walk around Rydell High, although now she is a beauty therapist. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is an intelligent child, so of course the types of hoods led by Adrian Zmed are labeled as nerd. And this is especially bad when Zmed's friend decides that she likes Caulfield. But to be a nerd simply will not succeed. <br /> <br /> It was then that Caulfield decided to play in the modern act of Zorro. He pulls out a junk bike, picks it up and teaches himself to ride. He wears leather biker clothes and glasses to hide his face. If you get Michelle Feiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield will not have problems with a girlfriend in any leather bar for gay men, as he is dressed. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 introduced Michelle Feifer and Maxwell Caulfield and began their successful career paths both enjoyed. If you watched the first film "Lubrication", the film is much better than you probably imagine how this film will turn out. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eva Arden, Sid Caesar and Dodi Goodman, all the teachers from the original Grease return to their roles. The musical accompaniment is not as good as the songs from the original. <br /> <br /> It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not so cool.
