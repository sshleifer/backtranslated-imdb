Saving Grace is undoubtedly one of the leading contenders for the award "How to spoil an adequate film in the last few minutes." Naturally, if you mix a strange Cornish village, where retired ladies from noble families mostly live, with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of stupidity will occur. Nevertheless, the last seven minutes of the film turn into completely ridiculous and are not even redeemed, being especially funny. This is a real shame, because this comedy can be as good as The Awakening of Ned Devine in 1998, which also depicts a small picturesque village and its strange inhabitants trying to get out of a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of Saving Grace is the recently widowed Grace Trevetin, an elderly woman whose legacy of her husband’s bad debts forced her to take up an unconventional way of making money. With the help of her gardener Matthew, she turns her gardening experience into profitable growing marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads her to a confrontation with the local police, her husband’s creditors and the French drug lord. ,,,,,,,, whom everyone appears in her greenhouse at the same time. Relationships and mutual understanding between Grace and Matthew are well depicted, and Brenda Bletin engages the viewer in emotional contact with her cute character — you can really feel what she is going through. <br /> <br /> Acting of secondary roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather oddly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques-drug baron in the romantic interest of Grace is extremely improbable and does not fit into the tone of the film. And, of course, hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of hemp cultivation? Unfortunately, the film exchanges gentle humor for a farce and ultimately turns out to be as fake as the marijuana plants.
