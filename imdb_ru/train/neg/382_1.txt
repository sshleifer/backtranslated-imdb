Greetings to Bollywood and male directors! <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is the ultimate limit in the total sacrifice made by an Indian woman !! <br /> <br /> View the current state of affairs in India, where wives are becoming day by day they are becoming more vicious and very attractive to their husbands - directors .. they can also be called uncle Scars (see the film "The Lion King" ), and they came up with a completely new concept of how a spouse and wife can live together happily after everyone has shared it among themselves ... including spermikins. <br /> <br /> Storyline: a married couple is very happy - but an accident happens accidentally and a miscarriage happens to the wife - a lost fetus along with the ability to become a mother forever! <br /> <br /> Now in India, criminals, as a rule, drive off the daughter in law if she cannot give them an heir! Thus, the wife comes up against the main plan - a surrogate mother ... but scientists intervened - "Of course, artificial insemination" - NO said that the artist (actually the director) - "Neighborhood finds out that the daughter-in-law is so fruitless they are going for a surrogate mother !! <br /> <br /> Neighbors! Society !! Damn those who are watching Fashion TV day and night - watching girls between the ages of 14 and 40 ... in bras and panties - well, these neighbors suddenly become central to family planning and decision making !! <br /> <br /> So the wife sends her husband to the beer garden p where girls dance on stage - all mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love these women because they can satisfy their ego! <br /> <br /> He hires a lead dancer in a pub - asks her to have a child - in exchange for money — she agrees — she comes home — gets pregnant — a wife and stays — both coexist in the same house — while the prostitute also gets a taste of the household. if there are so many caring people around, she misses everyone and cries softly !! Meanwhile, no one in the family finds out that a real daughter-in-law is roaming with a pillow under her skirt !! - the mother or other elderly people never took her for an inspection - nor did they try to feel the movements of the child in the womb !!
