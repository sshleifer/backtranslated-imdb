I'm sorry to say that this film is really bad. It reminds me of C-class porn with one major difference: No porn <br /> <br /> The plot and the dialogue does not need a major overhaul. Maybe then a bad game would not be so noticeable. At the very least, the pace should have been increased. <br /> <br /> Although I admit that it had a small budget, and the director did a good job, given that he had few resources, he had to spend more time on history or even better, ask someone else to write this. Many scenes were just meaningless. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of my time.
