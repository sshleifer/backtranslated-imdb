The slug veteran Bruno Mattei is back at it with this erotic thriller that clearly follows Joel Schumacherâ€™s 8mm movie. But, as expected, Matthews make their film on a tiny budget - so that it already looks obscure when it is recently released <br /> <br /> After her daughter gets kidnapped, the mother enters the dark world of underground pornography , because. The kidnappers belong to an international organization that shoots snuff films while exclusive clients pay well. The search for her daughter not only lead the mother throughout Europe, but also engage in prostitution. She goes to bed with some guys to get her tips. When she finally comes into contact with the organization of smoking, headed by the mysterious Dr. Hades, she herself is in great danger. <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about it, although he is beginning to promise. The problem is that the film is far from as dull or frank as one would expect from a director who made films such as BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) Not bloody enough and does not contain the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention. The plot is also not so special, except for, perhaps, surprisingly many different places throughout Europe. The ending is very disappointing. The acting is not very remarkable, with the exception of Anita Auer, who plays Dr. Aida: she looks and behaves very creepy. You do not want to meet her in a dark alley (or, for that matter, in your bedroom). <br /> <br /> In general, SNUFF TRAP attracts only collectors of films Bruno Mattei. But it's nice to see this man behind the wheel again: this was his first thriller since 1994, when I played GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
