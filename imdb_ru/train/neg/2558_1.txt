I had to check it out for the website, and I looked at it with optimism that maybe it would be at least a stupid but interesting disruption, and it didn’t even do it well enough. <br /> <br /> “666:“ Child ”is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (even worse than“ Luck ”) with scenes that are torn off from“ The Sign ”without shame. The ending is very similar to how the “Omen ends.” <br /> <br /> Not to mention that acting, writing and plot are just beaten. If these films bring money, I’m sad to see where the asylum goes . This confuses.
