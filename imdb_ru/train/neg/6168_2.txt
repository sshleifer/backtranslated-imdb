Hmm, IMDb rating 7.5, good comments, bla, bla ... well, we ordered pizza with two friends, sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi, or at least something brainless, but funny like Versus. But Naked Blood is sucked. It is a complete waste. Well, the scene with the woman who loves to eat is quite outstanding. But that's all. No more, no less. I will not sum up the plot, other people have already done it, I just wanted to stop the deception. But look and appreciate for yourself. Maybe we can push the rating where it should be. Another thing that comes to my mind: the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever was - well, John is cool ... :) 2/10
