That's right, you heard that this movie is a damn "ABIMINATION". First, the band that the hell is going to see or listen to a band called "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! Not only is the name awful, but also musicians, they can't even play anything! In addition, the vocalist sounds more girly than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is terrible! They are not only terrible musicians, but also terrible actors. Led by a stupid director and a subtle plot, it should be the dumbest movie ever. I would like this site to allow you to use ZERO OR BELOW out of 10, because giving this dirt 1/10 is TOO generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what you can call this comedic movie. If you are looking for comedy with music, go to this "Strange Al" Jankovic, because he does it much better than these incompetent teenagers.
