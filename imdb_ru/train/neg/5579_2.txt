“60s” is sometimes an entertaining film, most of this entertainment is laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take, for example, switching between black and white and color. If done correctly, it could be quite effective, but since it was done poorly, it turned into a nuisance and only diminished an already bad experience; most of the film had a strange feeling about it. Acting was not very bad for a televised film, but on the other hand it was quite embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ultimately were confusing. How did this family somehow end up at many big events in the 1960s? The ending was too rough for my tastes; because it was Hollywood, it should have turned out right at the end. I would advise you not to waste time on the 60s and do something else with your time. I'm glad I watched it in class, and not in my free time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the film was the inclusion of Bob Dylan’s music. These are just my rambling thoughts about the film. I hope you take my advice, and stay away from it.
