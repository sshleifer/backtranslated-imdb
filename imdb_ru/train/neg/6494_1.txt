I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested to see what he would do as a writer / director. I could not be more disappointed with this step. The film was so scattered and the cinema was so finished that I wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. The actors were very good, but it was such a waste of talent. Not all actors need to be writers or directors, and, obviously, Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the films I've ever seen in 50 years, this is absolutely the worst movie ever. Please do us a favor, Mr. Hopkins, and stick to acting that you are excellent in, and leave your letters and instructions to those who are talented in these areas. If I could give this film a rating lower than one, I would certainly have done.
