"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought. In fact, here is the show: cavemen are an alternative race, they face prejudice, etc. It is quite possible the silliest idea ever created; almost be worthy of a prison for writers. In one of the shows, cavemen came into the club, tried to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. It was like listening to Andy Rooney’s 22-minute dialogue, followed by the death of steak knives through juvenile cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, here is an example of a dialogue: “Are you sure that you are fine with a walk with a caveman.” “Yes, everything is fine. I had about 10 thousand! ”Jolly ... Perhaps the best essay I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of cavemen with terrible makeup, solving complex social issues ... Sounds like an entertaining night. I also like how bad the recent ideas are that they resort to creating a comedy film from auto insurance ads. I wonder if they will do Gecko further so that I can get a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I would even say that it is worse than Viva Laughlin. At least Viva Laughlin was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspiring. <br /> <br /> Similar shows instill hope that somewhere there is a comet aimed at Earth. <br /> <br /> Honestly non-extensible ...)
