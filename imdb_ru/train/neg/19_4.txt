I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosla. In the end, seeing him as the star of a recent film, and not just a small part of it, pleased me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I received recognition in college, and the only thing I can say that I didnâ€™t like it was that the film was shot in an abandoned part of the city and there was no background movement or temptations. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the acting leaves much to be desired, but Arnold is a great actor, I have to draw with chalk in the direction of the scall, and the supporting cast leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Voslu, and he made the film visible. Otherwise, I would write it off on another disgusting film. <br /> <br /> I find the rape scene cruel and unnecessary, but the actors who left at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shootout were pretty bad. The film has some glitches (continuity), but they are not noticeable, given the low-caliber film. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the movie because it was Arnold Voslu. <br /> <br /> jackie
