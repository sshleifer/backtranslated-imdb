I have seen this movie twice. I can't believe Pinty made such a fantastic movie. I am also a film / theater director and I know what I'm saying. This is no longer Romania, but I see that events occur in the same period as the September 11th incident. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just empty pictures. <br /> <br /> What most Romanians donâ€™t know, this film is for French viewers, not for us. They really believe that this is reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pinty should stop making films. I really do not know if we can call it a film, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we have such an image in Europe. It was a reality, but no more. My good friend from the British Embassy said: "You have no idea how long the Romanian people went from Ceausescu."
