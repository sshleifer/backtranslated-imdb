Honestly, I heard that it was pretty bad before I decided to watch it, but I will never allow others to influence my views, in fact, I am more likely to watch something out of disobedience! In any case, Bullheep had one thing that I wanted to see before watching: the fact that Rhonda Fleming and his gorgeous eyes were in him immediately interested me. The picture is not very good, and in fact very morally questionable, all the characters are corrupt and changeable in one form or another, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, itâ€™s good if the surrounding film can do justice for a bunch of mean people and create a tight climax trembling the pictures. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and since the finale fills your eyes with sugar, you can't help but scream that you were deceived in watching a pretty bad movie, no one in the cast has received the slightest recognition, with the leading man Guy Madison painfully wooden in extremes. <br /> <br /> Even the beautiful Rhonda cannot make me recommend it to anyone, 3/10
