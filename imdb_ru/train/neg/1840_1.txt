It should be the most brutally unfunny "comedy" that I have ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken like a crazy homeless man can't make me laugh? Something must be wrong with this picture. This is the only film I've ever left. I used free passes and still felt I wanted to get my money back. I can sincerely say that the only film I've ever seen worse than this one was “HOUSE OF THE DEAD”. . ONLY. worse. movie. I really laughed at the stage of the carousel, that's all. If you spend 2 hours on a comedy, it will bring you more than one laugh, right? I do not know, I think the filmmakers thought that “flan” is a funny word or something like that. And another running joke does hit a dead horse - literally.
