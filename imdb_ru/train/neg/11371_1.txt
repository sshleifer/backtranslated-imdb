“Documentary,” and we obviously use this term weakly, sums up that Muslims are trying to forcibly take over the world. Then he declares that any Muslim who does not recognize this, either does not know his faith, or lies to your face! Also, each person interviewed in the film found a market for his ridiculous view of reality, selling claps to conservatives willing to let others think for them. The West should know that this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental dwarfs. If you are looking for an up-to-date documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that gives several points of view from qualified sources.
