This movie was supposed to be fun. Young Leah Thompson, young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But he was drawn out, had unattractive characters and did not have a target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to space camp and accidentally launch into space by their robot friend (named, respectively, Jinx). In this case, space scenes are long, repetitive (the same crash happens twice), and depending on your point of view, they are either crappy or frightening. Adults will be bored and damp, children can be scared, because the way it was filmed, really leaves a terrible feeling in it. <br /> <br /> There is a promising novel, but unlike the shuttle - it never takes off, Why it turns on in the first place is not clear, except maybe add additional tension between the characters - but it was not possible if had an idea. <br /> <br /> Young Leah Thompson should be fancy and attractive, right? I mean, “Back to the Future” is great. But no, she was annoyed and looked average. Not the one with whom you would like to meet, have a friend or even be considered a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He was really lucky that he ever appeared in the movies again in this performance. Maybe he can act like Mikey in the Life Cereal ad, but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy. He doesn't fit on the screen, and I don't think we can identify with him at home. I would actually be happier if he never returned to Earth. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
