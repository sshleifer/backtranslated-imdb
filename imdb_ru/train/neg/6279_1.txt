No, <br /> <br /> You basically see something that does not make sense. In order not to spoil the film for people who really want it, take a look at the film, I will explain the story. <br /> <br /> Normal everyday woman, walking along the street, it turns out that passing by her own car. She follows her, and during this time many events occur, including her and her family. <br /> <br /> I specifically commented on this film how horribly it was written. The acting was great, the events were great, but the story simply came to nothing - it could be incredibly added and turned into a global epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer tried to accomplish by creating this, usually at the end of the films most of your questions get answers, but in this film you ask what just happened, and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed in vain. /> <br /> The spoiler starts. <br /> <br /> They had this area between two dimensions (ours and behind the glass), which would fall into our world and kill us. It was not worked out in detail during the film, and you never know how it happened, why, or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the movie. The main character should not even be the main character. At the end of the film, the guy who finally finds out everything and runs away (her sister's friend) was supposed to be the main character, but unfortunately, the film ends in 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> I bought this film for $ 10, threw it away right after ... don't waste your time. I really hope that nothing like this will be done again.
