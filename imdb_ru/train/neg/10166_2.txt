If he wanted to be precise, he should have chosen some natives of Frisco, and not a group of New York actors who know nothing about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I have lived in SF all my life, and people here do not speak or behave like these actors. Everything was overly dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the bay was JT Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper. Not surprisingly, he was the only one in the film who really dressed here like cats (that is, his warrior shirt). Not once did I notice that someone wore any Giants or 9ers gear; instead, he put them in some raw SF or Oakland jerseys that are not even sold here. HP doesn’t have bowling lanes, the black and Asian gangsters don’t wear hats or bracelets on the colors of Africa or the Chinese Olympic team, and every Chinese gangster doesn’t wear Yao Ming's jersey and tries to sound black by removing the hoops. In addition, although now a significant community of yuppies has intruded into the Mission, all that has been shown is some kind of white dude and self-proclaimed “100% of the West Coast of Borikva”. This is NOT New York! There are very few Puerto Ricans here, and Latinos in the Mission are very, very different from ONE, which was shown here, which was, no doubt, from New York. In addition, HP is not the only black area in the city. An accurate picture would show the drama between HP sets in their own hood, and also against Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better if Lee had done some more homework and have the best storyline to work with.
