waste of my life .... the director should be confused. why people feel that they need to make useless films will never make sense to me. when she died at the end, it made me laugh. I had to change the channel many times throughout the whole movie because I was embarrassed watching such a bad game. I hope the guy who played Heath will never get a job again. In addition, I hope that the director will never be able to make another film, and his check is taken back for this shit. {.02 of 10}
