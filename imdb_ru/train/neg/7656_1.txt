Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role-playing games of all time. I remember spending all night in front of a computer screen trying to escape from this mansion, and in fact I was amazed at times when monsters suddenly appeared. Now, pay attention - I'm tired of movies created by a computer game. I donâ€™t remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some of them are interesting enough to be watched. And yet I am such a big fan of the game that I could not resist. My rationale was that if the film had a plot that was very similar to the plot, then everything would be fine. <br /> <br /> Dude, it was 90 minutes (which seemed 300) of my life, which I will never return. If I had such a chance, I would love to spend it on rearranging my box for socks. It's not even in the "so bad, it's funny" category. You might think that even Christian Slater made a little more sense than joining this smelly bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the goal of putting this chick in the lead role is to have a sex scene - which I fully understand and support (hey, I'm a boy!) - I saw more of her body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> The plot has nothing to talk about. Do not waste your time to give it to you. The credibility of the story falls below: "I did not have sex with Miss Lewinsky." The acting is only a few steps higher than Street Fighter, which, by the way, is one of the worst films I've seen, I would recommend ABOVE this. <br /> <br /> Kids, I recommend Video game. It has a much better story, action and much more thrill. As for the movie, here's the spoiler - it stinks! Wait for the porn version.
