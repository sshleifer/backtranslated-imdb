There are several plot lines in the film that repeat several different characters. Different plot lines are not similar to a single piece of work, which makes this comedy very incoherent and sometimes even annoying to watch. <br /> <br /> It may sound weak and cliché, but it is true; It’s much better for you to watch the Crocodile Hunter series on Discovery Channel with Steve and Terry Irwin. It is more fun and more fun than this movie. I am sure that both the actors and the film crew had a lot of fun in this film, but the film doesn’t give us a lot of fun. For a comedy, it's just not funny enough, and Steve and Terry Irwin are just not good actors, even when they play themselves! Their antics are just not good enough to create a whole movie, and their scene seems long, distracting, unnecessary, and even annoying from time to time. <br /> <br /> The film had quite a lot of potential, I mean, Steve Irwin is one character who is strangely intriguing and funny to watch, so when I first heard that they were making a movie about a crocodile hunter ", My first reaction was that they were; brilliant! The film, however, suffers greatly from its weak history and disjointed plotlines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. The film has a certain entertainment value, at least, sufficient that this film can be watched at least once, but, nevertheless, I certainly would not recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie was a waste of time. However, this film can only be watched once when it appears on TV, on a rainy day. He has some good moments, but the storylines really completely destroy the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
