This film was in a sci-fi pack of 50 pieces, which my friend gave me for Christmas. This is very similar to the first film on Gozille, and, as in this film, scenes with the participation of American actors are inserted without any real reason. One interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that the tension in the Cold War is depicted between America and Russia. Like Godzilla, Gamera wakes up from an atomic explosion and rages around the world, paying close attention to Tokyo, because no big monster movie is ready if Tokyo doesn't bite it. In general, this is a good movie. Some scenes with the participation of Gamers, in particular the scenes in Toli, are quite spectacular and have special effects, which at that time were quite decent. If you like Japanese movies about giant monsters, you really enjoy it. I give him 4 out of 10. If it were the unedited Japanese version I was looking at, she probably would have received 5.
