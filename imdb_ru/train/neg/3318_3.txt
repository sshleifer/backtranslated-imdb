How nice, Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... It is a pity that she is completely out of the role. I have not read the book of Jane Austen, but I cannot believe that it is so superficial, and the characters are nothing but caricatures. It was probably not so easy to cut about 600 pages of a book in 2 hours, but I expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I sighed with relief every time I saw an actor who didnâ€™t cross the replay line (a couple of times).
