OK, I love horrible horror. I especially love horrors bad enough to make fun. Demonic or House of the Dead - it was bad enough to make fun. Break was not. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoilers - who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I watched the whole movie, and I have a number of comments, both in the style of “it sucks” and in context real criticisms. <br /> <br /> Story (sort of) - There is a guy in this city (maybe Seattle, see comment below) who runs around and chops off heads. He has been doing this for more than a year (I am not going to return to get exact figures - thanks, VERY MUCH), maybe two or three years. One head per week. And the police JUST NOW summon a “specialist” (who ONLY calls himself a psychic, but that never comes again). <br /> <br /> Right! Feds take over after what, three related murders? After almost the same murder in a hundred, we had a terrible martial law !!!!! <br /> <br /> In any case, this “specialist” consults with a voodoo chick whom the police ignore all the time, and two of them conclude that it is Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit that cuts off their heads to get enough strength to make yourself a body (and then probably take over the world - or perhaps just head off to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Customization - where does this happen? Well, if you are not from Seattle, you may not realize that the bar / rave (occupied by about ten filmmakers and their families) has a poster for a local radio station, and this is on the entertaining dialogue “Pulp Fiction” (as if ) between two policemen (yes, those who had their heads cut off in about 15 minutes), they are discussing a “new stadium”, which may still have been a problem when this film was shot. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize on behalf of the film and hang my head in shame. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is where it becomes really critical — to be a horror film writer (not published, don't look for my name in IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the screenwriters of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - while Woodon Loa (spirit), who guards the cemetery and is traditionally associated (with various Christian oppressors) with “Satan” - is in fact a deceiver like “ Loki. The God. <br /> <br /> In other words, he does not chop off the head. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main part of the Woodon religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies are centered around the possession of various members of the loa congregation. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that if he is already obsessed, why create a NEW body? <br /> <br /> Also. If Baron Samedi got a body, he wouldn't cut off his head, he would get good rum and cigars and almost everything !!! <br /> <br /> In general, the only thing they did Correctly (surprisingly) correctly is that with completely unnecessary reading of tarot cards (used only to show that the voodoo chick is “creepy”) they did not spoil interpretation of cards, as most films do. Again, I did research. (Does anyone remember the old nighttime tarot-reading ad on the phone? ”“ Lovers, will you fall madly in love soon ... ”and all this nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you made it this far through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I apologize if you feel the need to watch a movie because of me, so please don't.
