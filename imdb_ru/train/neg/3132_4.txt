I did not see such an incredible rating on IMDb, but I still went to him, because I am a big fan of biblical material. The first thing that bothered me was that there were a few too many films about Indiana Jones, but it also looked like Casper Van Dien didn’t see these movies Jones until the end (but he should). I believe that he tried his best, but the script just stank. Music also tried to be in Jones style. Excellent work, but for such a film it seemed too much work, as the video part did not deserve all this great music. Robert Wagner showed his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script nullified everything. “Jokes” is an old school, about 20 years old; they only brought me a cynical smile. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unreal. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea of ​​this story (in my opinion, but I love such stories), but in the end nothing happened. Maybe he should put it on paper while it is still fresh in his head. When I (in the first minutes) saw that this film would become one of those low-budget ones, I hoped that at least I would “hear” a good story, but sometimes the films simply disappoint.
