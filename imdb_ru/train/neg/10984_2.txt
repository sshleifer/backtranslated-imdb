I watched this movie for two hours and I have no idea what it is about. Someone was killed, and maybe not, or maybe someone did it or not. It brought back memories of good old days (bad old days), when all Canadian CBC films were smelly. Recently, smelly have been the exception, but this tangled mess with fashionable feminism, shocking memories and the muttering of dialogue makes up for lost time. I have never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This film continues this beautiful Canadian tradition. It is not easy to watch. Maybe fashionable people at Ti Chi Toronto cocktail parties will pretend they like it. We, the people in the houses, are a bit less pretentious.
