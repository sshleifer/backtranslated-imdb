Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and strangely thumbs), who hitchhikers over rough terrain, eventually finding her true place among a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls at a ranch dedicated to the conservation of a whooper; Rain (bow) Phoenix - their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, whether it's a thumb or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted the book by Tom Robbins, but his satire does not have a main goal and just moves across the entire map like Sissy (it may have been his goal, but it does not attract the audience). The notorious box office failure was not as panned as it was ignored, and you can understand why: this is a series of sketches in search of a plot, and performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variables. Thurman - stitch, posing along the highway, trying to ride, but it largely marked the beginning of a career Phoenix. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write this, but perhaps should have done it), provides the most confident work as a doctor who works on one of these thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
