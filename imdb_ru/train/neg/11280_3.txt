This film is about how a personâ€™s life goes wrong. His business is crumbling and he cannot feed his wife, despite numerous attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is complete chaos. It just does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the film makes sense. The story is so poorly told that I simply could not understand it. It's a shame because the scenery and costumes are well made and visually stimulating. Frames are well made throughout the film. However, these redemptive possibilities still cannot make up for a bad plot and a bad story. I am amazed by the big names that agreed to star in this film. It is such a waste of their talents. This film is very bad. Avoid it !!
