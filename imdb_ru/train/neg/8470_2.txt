I watch a lot of scary movies (or at least they try to be them), and it must be the worst, if not the second worst movie that I had to force myself to watch. I never knew the depth of Masacism until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered with used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but it's worse than I hope for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising, and I was intrigued ... during the first one and a half minutes the loans were rolling, and I hadn’t yet seen how the pain looked at first hand. Perhaps there are some viewers who enjoyed it and can point me in the right direction, but again I know those viewers who understand, if they don’t remember me, especially when we had to turn off the video, and this is simply NOT done with our observation (we have to were to make one exception, obviously). <br /> <br /> If it was a remake, I would give it a chance if it included no more than 1% of the original. It's all.
