It seems that in the 70s several such films were released. And the fact that I can't remember the name of one of them out of control is a measure of their influence. This is what the writers would call "boilers." They are hardly more than a means to keep movie stars in the public eye. <br /> <br /> We have Michael Kane, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to get asses on cinema seats. Every taste in the hero is served. Although it can be suspected that most of the viewers still left disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents are simply thrown away, and I wonder that stars with so much money and such a reputation can be so desperate or deprived in the good sense of the word. This kind of movie hardly adds gilding to the summary. Sometimes, perhaps, the actors have to choose their director, and not vice versa. <br /> <br /> It was quite obvious that it would be nonsense even from the very beginning. This ridiculously inappropriate jazz-jazz themed music, which also penetrated whenever some random noise was required, had all the atmospheric persuasion in the Muzak elevator. Who imagined using a jazz band, when the scene was depicted on the stage of the paired jungles of central Africa or the endless Sahara with camels and palm trees as a background? Definitely a serious dumb ball. Ennio Morricone would know what to do; and his results would have exuded enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating by two and a half points. This director had to take the trouble to watch Lawrence of Arabia or even Western Sergio Leone; he could learn a few things. But then again, he probably wouldn't. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock played the role of an endangered wife well in his movie Mad. It was later redone with equal charm, staring at Harrison Ford. In each case, the confusion around her loss and the intensity of the chase was palpable. Here, when Michael Caine could have been forced to use a little intelligence and bravado, Rex Harrison continued to jump out of nowhere, like some kind of cunning old genius, so that he would return to the previous course whenever the narration stopped. <br /> <br /> At least the picture was pretty good, with beautiful use of often beautiful furnishings. But then stupid music should sound and blow up the atoms, what a small atmosphere it created. <br /> <br /> Action scenarios were also invented and raised with such ineptly staged fighting episodes that they could be put in the first year of drama. And, of course, players must fight to the jazz accompaniment - like you. <br /> <br /> And this is about as many comments as this item deserves. Also, to say that the script was pretty pathetic. <br /> <br /> Stick to your hobby on this. Even if your favorite movie stars were in it, you will probably be disappointed too.
