This “Cinema” should be the biggest pile of steaming C * ^ p I have ever seen <br /> <br /> What can I say besides BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD Nothing will save this "film", and I pray that they will NEVER talk about the creation of a sequel. If you are thinking about watching this, then you should know that the storyline is such that two scavengers are dragged into saving the land. Films such as Men in Black were torn to shreds and gathered together to make this “Comedy”, but FULLY failed. Please avoid this movie, (save yourself).
