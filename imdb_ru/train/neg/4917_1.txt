**** WARNING ABOUT SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever made for a screen. It is absolutely impossible to take it seriously. It would take a major novel to list all the comedy routines in it. In the glory days of her program, Carol Burnett and her company, who often made films, made the film in ways that were hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly fell ill with only a slight cough, and then squeaky music sounded, and everyone looked around, wondering where she was from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with smooth locks and looked almost like Ryan O'Neill. The only thing that is funnier than this bit is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What is the scene of death at the end. Jenny really looks like she is dying ... dying for her makeup artist to come and give her some paint. And, of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to go to bed with him in the last minutes of a patientâ€™s life. The final scene with Ryan O'Neill sitting on a bench in the snow reflecting on his future in the movie business is an instant classic. He had something to worry about. He never recovered from that.
