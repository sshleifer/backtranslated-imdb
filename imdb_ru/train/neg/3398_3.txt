It seems that the purpose of the film was to show the aggressive (like the mafia) character of Russians, or at least those Russians who can travel outside their large country; it's too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so inefficient that they cannot find the person who robbed the bank, even when these people leave the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the alleged Russian colleagues spoke a language that was not defined anywhere else, probably aliens in the Ural Mountains, but far from Russian. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, be kind, go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and study the grammar of the Russian language and its pronunciation.
