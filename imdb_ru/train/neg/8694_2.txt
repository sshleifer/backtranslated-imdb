The main character was a terrible actress who made the whole movie mediocre. She smiled too much when she first approached the cameras to talk about her daughter. This was supposed to make the police suspect her. I would be inconsolable in the same situation. She seemed calm for a mother who could not find her daughter. As if she did not even want to act in films. Jennifer Aniston would play a better role. And that would make a lot more money for such a controversial, important issue. All the others were excellent. I donâ€™t know where the lead actress is, but I hope she got some acting lessons.
