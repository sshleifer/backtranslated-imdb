This movie is really bad. It may be rude, but it is. It really is. Bad script, all the clichés about vampires in the book are used, and generally do not sympathize with the origin of the main character ... that is, Ole Dracula. There have been some really brilliant Dracula / Vampire films in the past, but that doesn't even turn them into a “terrible” slot. <br /> <br /> Take people who seem to have fallen out of a teen slash movement, add a drop of Dracula Lore and mix the intoxicating tonic of religious / surrealistic dreams ... and you will get confusion in the film Dracula 2000. > <br /> I really can't find anything good to say about this film, as if it was not bad enough, that it was done first, they seem to have made the Johnny Lee Miller effect an English accent ... In what's the problem with this, I hear you cry ... Well, he's an Englishman, but he sounds like an American trying to do a center in English. <br /> <br /> In general, you can also tell your money (if you were going to buy it)), or rent it out, look and find out for yourself why it is as scary as Tellibby. <br /> <br /> PS Although La La is pretty scary!
