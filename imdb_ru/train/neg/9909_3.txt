It was not a well-made western. This nut rides on the scorching sun in a buggy with an umbrella over it, killing people for its own reasons. You have the same person who sits in a snow cave during a blizzard, cutting off the wreckage of his anatomy. Then you have a woman in the house, somewhere somewhere they shoot wolves, which are not there. What is the meaning of this movie? Can't Bruce Dern find anything better? It was a waste of the film.
