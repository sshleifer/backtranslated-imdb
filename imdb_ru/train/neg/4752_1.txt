I heard a lot of stories that this film is great ... Well, I took a chance when I saw it at a low price on Ebay last month. <br /> <br /> I watched it, and I have only a few comments about it: <br /> <br /> 1) terrible storyline, 2) terrible game, 3) bad fighting scenes ... < br /> <br /> I have never seen any worst movie in my life, so far away !! When the storyline is bad, then at least make the fights something more interesting. But BOTH it is made ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing in this film (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks good in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's all ...
