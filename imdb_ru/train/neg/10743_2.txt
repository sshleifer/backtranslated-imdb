This film is really bad, with a script full of “memorable” lines and incredibly bad performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen), and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it in order to believe it. Only two short themes (about 30 seconds long) are repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
