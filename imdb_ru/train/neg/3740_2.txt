Immediately this movie was funny. Not that it has no redemptive aspects ?? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful backdrop of the scenery. Anyone who does not live on the East Coast should know that in the South there are no beautiful mountains like those found in the West. I knew that it was Utah right away, but perhaps Dalton was not able to put down his English accent, so they had to apologize, saying that it was a southern city. Turning his accent to the south was easier. Of course, the film has plot twists, but its fake sense of place was something I could not get through. It's not that there were no methamphetamine laboratories in Utah ... so why the authors thought it necessary to pretend that it was in the South was beyond my power. <br /> <br /> Another thing in action movies always puzzles me. Why do they always produce a “agitated” sound effect when a character takes out an automatic pistol? It seemed that any other sound effect in this film was “chukchich”, meaning that the 9mm was loaded and ready for shooting. Of course, the weapon already had ammunition, so there was no need for it. <br /> <br /> Finally, pyrotechnics was WAY over. But hey, this film was aimed at a certain “market segment”, I suppose ... This is very bad. Each of the actors can act, but this film was lame.
