Was this movie based on real facts? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We see that numerous armed police are devastating the same amount of weapons from two guys who have received only an armored torso. This is a brilliant idea; Aim for armor! ... excuse me, but what about those big fat unreadable heads or their legs to cry out loud? Or were there invisible tanks protecting them? were they from krypton? Did I miss something here? <br /> <br /> This film started off pretty well, but after a 20-minute skirmish it really turns into a boringle. <br /> <br /> And this documentary style didn’t work for me either, but it’s just that someone finds it cute or not. <br /> <br /> An incredible material that makes it difficult to see through. <br /> 3/10 for perfect editing.
