It was almost worth seeing the whole horrible movie, just to know that I could never experience anything as bad as this one. Acting - 0, script - 0, battle scenes - 0, male leadership - 0 (Cheddar Bob with eight miles as a suave war hero who gets a girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is gorgeous and not a terrible actress). These are the criteria that I used to average it to two. I lost count, but I believe that the movie has ever been clich√©, ever, in this movie. When the driver who allegedly killed her father miraculously appears at the end to race against her, it reinforces the previous statement from nowhere. Plus it just appears for no reason. He has never even been mentioned before. I don't know what else to say here. Just see when he appears on television in a couple of years. At least in this way, some of them will be edited for advertising.
