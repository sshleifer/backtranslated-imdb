“Land of Plenty” is not a movie. This is a tombstone in the directorial career of German director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many felt it at The Million Dollar Hotel, and now Land of Plenty makes this very clear; Not only did Wenders lose him, he actually became the director of the BAD, creating terribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> It can be argued that “the time when you lose it” comes for each director, but Wenders is at the very least. As if he completely forgot everything he knew about the movie and started everything from the beginning - just to get careless results. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this film does not deserve your time.
