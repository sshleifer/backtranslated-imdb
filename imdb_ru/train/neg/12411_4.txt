A lot of really good horror films were released in the seventies, but this film is definitely not one of them! It's a shame that “The Child” is not better, since it works on a decent idea, which includes a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of ​​a vengeful child who worked so well in classic films like “Bad Seed”, and then we have a central theme about zombies, which, of course, was the basis of many successful horror films. The plot is basically this: a young girl blames a lot of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the cemetery and resurrects the dead to take revenge (like you). It's all good, except that it's boring! Nothing happens for the most part of the film, and although in the end it rises with some pleasant blood; not enough finals to justify sitting through the rest. The film was obviously shot on a tight budget, since the seats look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. In general, I can not say much about the film, as there is nothing special about it. The child is a dark horror film of the seventies, and I certainly do not recommend it.
