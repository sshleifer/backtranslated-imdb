As a true Elvis fan, this film is a complete embarrassment, and the script is a disaster. The film begins with the beautiful son “Stay Away”, and the landscape of the Grand Canyon gives the viewer hope for something special. Elvis gets into the picture, and his talent is wasted, especially on other popular songs. I watched this movie twice, just to make sure it is a piece of trash !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
