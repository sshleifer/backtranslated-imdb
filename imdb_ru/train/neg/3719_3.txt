Imagine that you take off the mask of a deadly assassin and find Barbara Cartland there ... this is what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> The discovery revealed a promise, but it soon throws off all claims to be a thriller (or even a creative love story) and the only reason they made this story becomes completely clear: fill the gap in their female viewing market, creating another new phrase “misunderstood, thoughtful bad guy” (Andrew) meets the “innocent” Whimsical beauty ”(Paula). <br /> <br /> The filmmakers didn’t just waste time creating the original premise: the filmmakers went straight to the money roll: the bad guy who is tamed by this bizarre beauty. This is followed by a series of insincere and strongly ordinary love scenes, studded with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff. Andrei’s recognition of the fact that he (“one-to-one”) “a poet” draws attention to the qualities that the Byronik hero must possess, but even when it’s written in a heavy, stressed form who and what he is, it’s still hard to believe - or care. <br /> <br /> For the hero / anti-hero Byronic to work, history needs subtlety, style, and innovation — all of which is completely absent here. This is not the modern Phantom of the Opera, this is exactly what happens when a weak and rather stupid woman (with a loose elastic in panties) meets a bad man who, after meeting her, seems as dangerous as bunny slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances could save this film if they were good: the main character is busy looking sexy and “otherworldly”, no matter how forced or funny it is; and poor Dougray Scott, it seems, was befuddled when he sneaks through his unit. This is not his best work. Glimpses of interest were caused by Jürgen Prochnow as “Washon”, and Andrew Lee Potts by a young photographer / brother. The best film could hurt her sister and leave her brother instead.
