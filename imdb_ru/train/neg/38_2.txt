or someone who prayed for the look of Al-Cleaver fighting a naked 7-foot black guy in full nelson, your movie has arrived! The film's star, Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfelner), was kidnapped by a group that demands that a ransom of $ 6 million be taken to their shelter on the island. What they do not count on is the strong Vietnamese veterinarian Peter Weston (Cleaver), hired by the film producer, to save the girl. And what they didnâ€™t really count on was a local tribe that likes to offer young women to their cannibal monster god with bloodshot eyes. <br /> <br /> Almost the same shooting as cannibals, this time Tariffs are a little better when it comes to entertainment value, mainly due to a fun dub-track and an incredibly stupid monster with bulging eyes (Franco confirms that at the disc interview they were ping-pong players). Franco gets a strong cast in support of EuroCult, including Gisela Khan (POLLUTION) and Werner Pochat (whose death is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen when a guy who is not at all he is shown - close-up) trying be it). The film has tons of nudes and blood (a kind of Tempra dye) there. The highlight for me was the slow fist fight in the world between Kliver and Antonio de Cabo in splashing waves. Unfortunately, old Jess brings this to an amazing (and sometimes painful) 1 hour and 40 minutes when he had to run 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice, but strange ghostly images appear in some darker scenes. In addition, one long section of dialogue in Spanish without subwoofers (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). Franco gives a good 16-minute interview about the film and talks about Buchfelner much more pleasant than his star CANNIBALS Sabrina Xiani.
