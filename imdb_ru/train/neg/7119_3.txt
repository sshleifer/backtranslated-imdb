* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I am sure that when it was released in 1958, it was very suitable for its time. Then films evolved more slowly to allow viewers to follow and analyze the story. Here the man moves to a house belonging to his last wife, who mysteriously died with his new wife. Gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nichol, who also made the film) is a truly underrated character. He gets a skull to indirectly warn Jenny that she is in trouble, as he knew that in the death of the first wife was unfair play. He can't tell Jenny directly what happened, so he tries to scare her with a skull. We also found out that Jenny saw her parents die, causing emotional distress that led to institutionalization. Like many viewers of today, I found the rhythm too slow for my tastes. But if you like slow horror without a lot of blood, this film is for you. <br /> <br />
