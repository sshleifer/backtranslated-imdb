I am usually a fairly generous critic, but in the case of this film I must say that it was incredibly bad. I am stunned by how positive most reviews seem. <br /> <br /> There were some great shots, but it’s too bad they were wasted on this funnel of the film. This could work if the Daggers were purely action films, not romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between the couples, everything that exists between May and her men seems more passionate than love, and for the most part the dialogue is simply stupid. This may just be a problem with translation, but the frequent use of the word “flirting”, in particular, reminded me of grade 8, and not about how to beat by ear, together forever, for the love of death; I also felt that we were hit on the head with the metaphor of the wind. The viewers have very little about the characters they really care about, and, therefore, very few emotional investments in the film as a whole. I wanted the remote control to move forward, I fell into place, ready to snore, but basically I just cringed. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now icing on the cake. Rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was truly one of the most terrible, ridiculous I've ever seen. The boys quarrel, scream, scream and swear at each other. Oh, and then snow begins. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger in the heart) suddenly jumps out of the weeds. She then throws the dagger, which seems to take about 5 minutes to reach its destination, even slowly slowing down the middle of the screen to hit a tiny drop of blood. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Well, finally, May finally dies because she threw a dagger that was fed into her chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, presses the body to himself, the screen goes out. I and the people around me laugh. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but in the end a failure.
