This film was one of the greatest films ever created, it had everything to make a great movie. Incredible game, awesome special effects ... oh wait, I think of a good movie. Well, it was not one of them, it just sucks. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is that for the bone head thinks that in this film there are 10 points. When I voted, there were 206 people. Now, as for any other vote, 8 or 9 was even too high, but 10 ??? Come on, what made this movie sooooo good to give it 10? I know that those are the 206 who thought that Jean-Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
