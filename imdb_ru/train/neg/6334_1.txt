I saw this film in 1979, I was 17 or 18 years old when it was released. When the film began, the theater was a quarter full. After ten minutes of the film, my friend and I, who went with me to watch the film, were the only people in the theater. The film was really strange and had no plot or reason for the script, and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay at ALL movies ... why suffer such torture? ... that's why. We wanted to be real film critics ... having a standard based on all other films is hard to justify, saying that you have seen the best film (10), they always come up with something better. But it’s easy to base all other films on the worst movie ever made (and that’s all ... at best 1). There may be other films that really qualify as 1, but I have not watched them yet. Now I base all the films that I see on a scale based on this worst .... I AM A CRITICAL CRITICISM OF THE FILM ... heh heh.
