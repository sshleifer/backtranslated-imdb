A very familiar comedic story about a modest cute guy Paul (Jason Lee), who after the night of his bachelor party wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde he met last night. After lying about this to his bride Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to lie more and more to hide his tracks. <br /> <br /> I am sure that most of us have witnessed such a story at least once before ... in the movies or on television. The film is formal and EXTREMELY predictable, with an ending you can see a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least, the cast is of some interest and allows you to watch him. Lee is just in the main role, and Stiles is very fun in a carefree comedic role, different from the very serious roles that she usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, this is not quite well written. At least one question was left unanswered: for WHAT, is Ray (Laughlin Munro), Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend, is the AI ​​investigating? <br /> <br /> And I didn’t like the Buck character. (David Kechner), Paul's stepfather; he is a very disgusting jerk who got on my nerves so quickly that I begged someone to hit him. <br /> <br /> Add one more debit: an unreasonable, uncredited cameo of comedian / actor Larry Miller, who again plays a grunt (in this case it is a little justified - his character is an ultraconservative minister). <br /> <br /> Not good at all, but, as usual, I put three out of ten based on the effort of one actor.
