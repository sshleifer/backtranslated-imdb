Gorgeous bodies, gorgeous colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, a banal plot. The name of the prima donna, Camilla and flowers of the same name, which appear often, is enough to remind us of the similarity of the plot from the novel Dumas “Dame about Camellia”, the movie “Camille” with Garbo and Robert Taylor in the leading role, and finally, but not Vervi’s last opera, La Traviata. Beautiful, not too virtuous young ladies, social outcasts for one reason or another, loved, separated, reunited just in time to die from tuberculosis in the last scene ... Banal conspiracies and silly unrealistic dialogue in the opera are forgiven, but why spend Hayak, Don Sutherland, the beautiful performance of Los Angeles in the 1930s, the deus ex machina earthquake that comfortably kills another woman, and all this beauty in this mediocre turkey, where there is not even beautiful singing?
