I can't believe the same guy ruled this shit and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written if it acted poorly. <br /> <br /> This bunch can't even claim it. It begins with the defeat of Dracula at the end of 2000 Dracula. It then ignores the narration, which subsequently describes what happened after that. Properly following the narrative could somehow make it a good sequel, but Craven decided to go in the style of his old films, not having a good tie, other than the name of the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even the actor playing Dracula was different (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to the blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have respect for your taste in movies.
