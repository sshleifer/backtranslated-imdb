Being the mother of two small children who grew up or should have said that they grew up with Scooby’s many reincarnations, I feel good to comment on Scooby’s historical and current version. <br /> <br /> If, as a family, we didn’t see any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby got a hint, we might have liked it as a lightweight, nothing special on a Saturday morning cartoon. But this, in fact, the problem is that in its current format it is so light that it will not have the longevity of the “old” Scooby and the gang. I am sure that this may succeed in a quick cash return, but I am sure that the long-term buying up of old and young people is in very real danger of being lost. My 6-year-old son, having seen the new version, was very unhappy and, without any prompting, said that she looked terribly lively and why she was not something like the last episode (Where are you). <br /> <br /> Scrappy Doo was an anomaly, but still infinitely better than this. Hopefully, it will be helpful to get a hint with reference to the manufacturers.
