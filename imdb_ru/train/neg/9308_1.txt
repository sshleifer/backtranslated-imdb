this film was definitely the worst film I’ve seen in my whole life, and I’ve seen some pretty bad films. I did not like how this movie was shot. all the actors are unknown, and it seems that a group of friends got together and decided to make their own film. but it is absolutely horrible I have never seen the worst movie. the story is so fake, and I just discovered that it took a long time to finish the movie. there was no conspiracy, it looked as if it had not been planned before they began to take pictures. the story is too strange I did not like how slowly it came to the essence of the film. there was no point in even making this film. If you plan to watch this movie, do not. you just waste your time.
