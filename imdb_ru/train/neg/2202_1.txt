This film makes me think that the others I saw with Combs were an accident. There were more holes in the plot than I think I’ve ever seen in a movie that claims to be more than film b. The game was so ridiculous that even Combs' past march victories didn’t have enough memories to save her. Considering the scenario, I have to imagine that the budget did not have enough money for such things as continuity and original ideas. I'm totally upset that I paid a blockbuster price for this garbage. The fact that this was done for television helped me avoid this atrocity and, honestly, the films that this poor man should have warned about. Avoid this movie, no matter what.
