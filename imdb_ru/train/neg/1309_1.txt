This film was very boring. It must be at least 15 minutes. Images of dead children and animals were a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write comments, but this one was so bad that he had many good and excellent comments. I think that in this case we are one step closer to an honest assessment of this name. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from the 8-hour sleep period. I think this is the point itself. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between the characters, except for two sentences at the very end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep watching this, do not try to rewind and catch up, because you will fall asleep again.
