The comedic power of Prior and Gleason could not save this dog from a thin conspiracy, weak script, dark behavior and ridiculous continuity in the joint editing of this mess. He has very few memorable moments, but the well dries quickly. When I was a kid, I remember it as Luke's warm car for two actors, comedians, but there was always something strange in the stream and the feeling of what was being transmitted in each scene, and how it relates to the plot as a whole. Watching this again many years later, he shouts about crazy mania. I am not so worried about racial controversy, because I donâ€™t mind that the film would shoot this question with a little frivolity. The most obvious drawback for me is that the scenes are laid out as confused, unrelated series of two-minute comedic episodic bits (any not very good) that were stapled together by the editor after almost all night the local watering. Characters change their feelings and motives on a dime, without rhyme and reason, between scenes and within scenes, creating the feeling that no one had the slightest idea what to get out of the script. Not that it was some kind of gem to begin with. I feel bad for two actors whose legacy is overshadowed by this disaster, which should never have been done. Maybe my sense of humor has become too subtle ...
