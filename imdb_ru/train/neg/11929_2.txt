I watched "The Eye" before I looked this. I really liked The Eye, it was one of the best films of the recent Asian horror film. So, I chose this “Bangkok Ghost” because it was the same director and it was quite popular here. But, man, what a disappointment ... "Bangkok Ghosts" - these are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc., which are not at all scary, do not even bother (as the "Eye" was) ... there is nothing. I can’t even fill in the 10 lines required for a comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 2/10
