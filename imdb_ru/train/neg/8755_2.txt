This film was terrible, to say the least. I was hoping for the best after watching "High School Musical". This whole film was a complete excerpt from Simple Life, but it was not a reality show. <br /> <br /> The acting was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had moments when she was not so terrible. On the other hand, Alison Michalka was bad all over. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's love interest, played a French guy, but had a terrible accent. One good thing about this movie was the completely amazing Michael Trevino, who played Alison's love interest. Just something to keep in mind if this film were shown in front of High School Musical, it probably wouldn't have looked so bad. But this was no comparison. <br /> <br /> In general, I give him 2.
