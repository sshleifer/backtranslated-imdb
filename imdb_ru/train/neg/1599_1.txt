NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNION was a failure when released. It was not long in the cinemas in my big city. What for? Because it is BAD !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way, but bad in the most awfully unfunny sense. Then the whole cast was largely unknown and remained unknown after this turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really great (a parody of slashers), but the execution is not enough in all respects. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy." Your time is more valuable than spending a nanosecond to watch this embarrassing misfire.
