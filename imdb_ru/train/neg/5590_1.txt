Horrible movie. About the old crisp artist who hangs out with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil runs through the movements in his part, and has some of the most difficult lines in cinema history. In this film, Richard Burton looks almost on the verge of death, and we have to believe that he looks "Good for sixty." The game is bad, like the plot. Characters are terrible, like history. It is really hard to feel for those in this film, with the exception of Larry Ewashen, who plays the guy in the porn theater that falls on Tatum, he is funny. This film is really a waste of time. If you are a Tatum fan, like me - which is why I rented it - please do not watch this movie. She is really bad at it, and you are wondering, maybe, the PAPER MOON was a happy coincidence. No, because of the BAD BEAR and LITTLE DARLING, it is known that she can play well, but still do not shoot this film. And if you're a Burton fan, rent something when it looks good and not fossil.
