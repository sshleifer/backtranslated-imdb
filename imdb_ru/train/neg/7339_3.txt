Maya is a woman with no interests. She just dreams of her life and wonders why she does not feel satisfied. This can be an interesting topic. This requires a good story, good atmosphere and good dialogue. He has none of this. This film is totally boring. There are only lengths and no climaxes. The only climax is Shah Rukh Khan. But although I am a big fan of it, I could not stand this film. Even he cannot make this movie exciting. The film is not as bad as "King Uncle", and if you are an art-house fan or slow, you might like it. This is not funny, not interesting, does not catch. My recommendation: do not watch this.
