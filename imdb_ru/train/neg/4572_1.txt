This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas limited to statements such as “we all create our own reality”. <br /> <br /> Sorry guys, reality is what is true for all of us, not just for the gullible. <br /> <br /> The idea that “everything is possible” does not hold up for careful study: if something is possible, then the opposite is possible, and therefore nothing is possible. This leads to postmodern nonsense, which is nothing more than an attempt to blacken established truths so that all ideas, sound and foolish, are equal. <br /> <br /> According to science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well: “The reality is that when you stop believing in it, it does not disappear.”
