After reading a book that was of great importance to me, the film did not give me the feeling that the book conveyed. It makes me wonder if Kaufman liked this book because he successfully turned it into something else. Or this, or he is just bad. The main thing is where ease ?! From the very first scene, the music drowns out most of the dialogue and feelings, and this continues throughout the film. I think that the creators thought that if during the whole film cheerful music would sound, the plot would seem easy, but here they completely failed. Instead, the music manages to convey everything that “feels in the film,” thus dramatizing events, so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy. <br /> <br /> embellishing the storyline, making it more dramatic. In the film, we see Franz driving along Thomas Street, which drives toward Sabina. The introduction of this chance meeting / passage, which undoubtedly did not occur in the book, gives the story of Thomas more significance than it makes it bright. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has changed, in general, for the worse, but this could have been done because the book simply doesn’t turn into a film, this is Kundera’s style. It makes you wonder whether all the generous reviewers on this site wrote, referring to their books and films, and not just about the film. The film, which is as long as it is unconvincing. For those who have not read the book, I recommend simply reading this. For those who have it, I have to say that you just waste your time and probably end up writing similar warnings.
