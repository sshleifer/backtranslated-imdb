Dumb, as stupid, in this completely uninteresting, supposed black comedy. In fact, what begins with the fact that Chris Klein tries to keep a low profile, eventually turns into a boring version of The Three Amigos, but without laughter. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which is not the case with Play Dead. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be called evil, like Play Dead. In fact, “Play Dead” is a city full of crazy jobs. Fred Dunst, however, does a fairly honest imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from Simple Plan, while Jake Blouse fairly honestly emulates Jake Blouse. - MERK
