Well, I'm not American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin was not, never was and never will be a funny person, as long as our writers point south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny person, no doubt thanks to the skillful script writers and directors and all the other talented heroes who worked in the team who contributed to one of the funniest and timeless comedy situations that America has ever released. The fact that someone had the courage to even try to repeat the character of Phil Silvers, I can not do. In order to put things together, the exercise was repeated in Martin’s unfunny attempt to become an inspector of Peter Sella Claus, another unsuccessful attempt, in my opinion, to spark a clearly unfamiliar career. Some of your authors say: “Steve Martin makes his own imprint on the character,” to which I would say “balderdash,” his images will be forgotten for a long time when images of Silvers and Sellars are appreciated for future generations.
