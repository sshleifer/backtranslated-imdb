After the success of Scooby-Doo, where are you, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But, unfortunately, they added a new character who forever ruined the success of Scooby-Doo. They invented a new show with the new name Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Skrappi-Doo who made this show a complete failure, probably for adults and children together. Skrappi was a stupid, brave puppy who was always ready to beat someone. Scooby and Shaggy were frightened by the villain, and they also tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo doesn't need little annoying nephews. If they wanted Scooby Doo to be more successful, they should either kill or never invent Skrappi. It was just bad, maybe your children would prefer it!
