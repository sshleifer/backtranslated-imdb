I watched it on a DVD in the original language with English sabs. Either the subtitles were very scanty, or the dialogue itself does not create a special story and does not give development to the character. There are quite a few HK stars in it, but the film does not need their presence to make it better or worse. This is just bad. The bright and colorful scenes made in CG are attractive for pure colors and brilliance, but may soon become stunning. In any case, it makes me think of a children's film with a continuous stream of cg, scenes of struggle and a shitty plot. I'm sure I understood what happened in the film, but the whole story was pretty lousy.
