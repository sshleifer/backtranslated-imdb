In the end, I watched the whole (very long) film, because I was fascinated by its stupidity and naivety. It is hard to believe that many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gilguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would willingly take part in this farce. But maybe in 1968 people were really so naive? The plot seems to be written by some embarrassed Latin American Marxist priest with the agenda. There is a superpower conflict, and the Russians are actually good guys, and the General Secretary of the Communist Party is a good and spiritual person who suddenly, 20 years later, sees the light and feels compelled to weaken his bad conscience by freeing the prisoner. a priest from the Siberian gulag. The priest then quickly becomes Pope for a series of coincidences. We are allowed to see the secret voting process in the papal Vatican, which is depicted in the most monstrously pious form you can imagine. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the communists in China have achieved the usual socialist economic miracle: the hungry half of their country before death. To solve this small mistake on the unflagging, brilliant road to communism, they want to start a nuclear war (to fairly distribute the western capitalist wealth among China's poor workers). <br /> <br /> Our good old comrade General Secretary was a little alarmed and calls the Pope just before the coronation to ask him to make peace. They meet with Chinese leader Comrade Peng, who looks and behaves like a 15-year-old boy. You will roll on the floor, laughing at how people in 1968 thought what the Chinese look like. Comrade Peng demands that Western capitalists pay (which, after all, is logical, doesnâ€™t capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists?), And that the Pope must sacrifice something for the sake of the general altruistic cause of equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> So when the Pope is crowned in Rome, he promises all the wealth of the Catholic Church throughout the world to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. And thus, he saves the world from a nuclear catastrophe. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some minor plots, which, alas, do little to buy this incredibly bad film. I would give him three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn does not look like dad at all. It is much more believable than the Greek Zorba.
