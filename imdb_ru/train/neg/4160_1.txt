It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends, and after it was over, none of us understood the plot. In addition to the lack of plot, the acting was brutal, the “special effects” were not so special, and the script was absolutely terrible. The only factor in a movie redemption is that it is so incredibly bad that it is rather funny. You can't help but laugh at the zombies being knocked down while the actors belch crappy dialogue. I would not recommend this movie to those who are looking for a good movie, but a group of friends can get together and laugh about it. Now this is a joke among my friends and me. 1 out of 10.
