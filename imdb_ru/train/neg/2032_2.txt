I gave these two stars for the amazing clarity of the DV image, which gives the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. I cannot recommend it because it is neither poetic nor stupid. Neither dramatic nor alarming. Neither controversial nor trivial. This is just a pathetic piece of garbage that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it, whoever you are. Please stay away from this terrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
