INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Starring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes of PG rating <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> The new Disney film "Inspector Gadget" tells about a policeman named John, who survived a major accident and was saved by a modern experimental operation that turns him into a robot that looks like a machine, which during its use all kinds of tools and devices are built into his body when he says “Go go,” only to be ordered "Inspector Gadget"! <br /> <br /> The actual structure of the film is in many ways similar to the formation of the body of the Inspector Gadget. myself. It is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of several indecisive tricks gathered together to create something that has nothing to do with anything else present. In fact, the film is a series of exciting action films that seem to be inserted together with the characters, and the uneven story that only children aged 6 to 9 years can enjoy. <br /> <br /> The policeman, who was reinvented, is performed by Matthew Broderick, who, before Gadget Inspector, was successful in films such as Elections. His character becomes Inspector Gadget after meeting with the tough villain of the film called The Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett, who has already survived a catastrophe this year with the terrible William Shakespeare Dream “A Midsummer Night's Dream”. <br /> <br /> This film has a romantic plot, as well as many scenes with Unusual body parts and elements of the mechanism of the Inspector Gadget. In it, Nut and Claw are drooling on the attractive character Brenda, played by Joely Fisher, and for her appearance, and for her knowledge of the particular invention made by her late father, who was previously killed by Claw. The competition turns into a fight and a reason for many events in the film. Also, the main character is Gadget Mobil, similar to a car designed for the Inspector of the Gadget itself. Sounded D.L. Hughly from the comedy series The Hughly's. <br /> <br /> “Inspector Gadget” is a film that seemed to me rather bad. I know that I am not exactly the target audience of cinematographers, but even my ten-year-old relative found this film not to his taste. The film is full of obvious flaws and obvious problems. I never cared about the characters. There is no development of mood except for some neat opening credits, in contrast to the much worse movie of 1997 “Mr. Magu”, which was opened with the use of clips from the original cartoon. Is it too much to ask about such things in this comedy, which is rarely funny and hardly ever convincing. The overall production of the film is nothing more than a confusion of unfinished sights and consists of one joke: the awkward fool of the Inspector of the Gadget. <br /> <br /> In such films, viewers crave boundaries - something to help understand what can and cannot happen. In the "Inspector gadget" there are no such boundaries. Truth be told, this is nothing but a party for actors who have a lot of fun. I remember another missing comedy a few years ago, called “Blankman”, which again contained a lot of props and energy, and the actors, of course, had fun with all the gizmos and props, but it also lacked something required for each film: Participation in the audience. <br /> <br /> One of the characters that I often don’t notice is the daughter of Gadgets, which by the end of the movie, I still don’t know what her name is. It is used only as a plot device, and I wonder how it was used for the further development of the plot. For her presence in the film there is nothing appropriate or productive. We never know her reaction to the operation or the accidents of her father. Thus, it is one who could be completely excluded and would not have any influence on the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say that Inspector Gadget is a terrible, insufficient excuse for a children's comedy. And, believe it or not, I compare this film with the cruel and very young audience of the last years of The Blade. Once again, I declare that I had more of a film in which nothing happens than in which everything happens. “Inspector Gadget” was so keen on this that it literally made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
