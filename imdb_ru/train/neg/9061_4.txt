What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days earlier, I watched Lilis, and it was one of the best gay movies I've ever seen. So it was not the best time to watch a mediocre gay movie. <br /> <br /> The story was stupid, and the acting was fine. It was not too bad to turn off, but he had bad moments and terrible stereotypes. It was not well filmed. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie? No, you would spend your time and money. I do not understand why such films are made and who finances them. Instead, spend time watching Noah's Ark on the Logo. I think this is the place where this film tried to go, but never got there.
