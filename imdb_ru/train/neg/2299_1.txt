Before I begin ... let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay, now this is so, I just want to say what the world thinks that these morons, who call themselves "masters", are doing ?? The last time I checked that the presenter did not discriminate, he dispels hatred on TV or tries to exorcise his own beliefs to every unhappy soul that goes to the channel. From all this crazy, idiotic, conservative, biblical knocking, Fred Phelps' lover Pat Robertson does daily. I’m for freedom of speech, but since when does this apply to a guy who pretty much says that if you risk abandoning his ideal lifestyle, are you going to hell right away? This is just an excellent example of why religion is causing many problems. Once we had a deputy teacher in my classroom, so we decided to watch TV, as the teaching did not give us any work. And we (against the will of many of us) watched the “700s Club,” and, of course, this idiot Pat ranted and raved about the Bible, and he told Simon in the spirit of “God says homosexuality is a sin,” and I actually heard the baby go "Hmm, I think he is right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the owner is trying to make people think that someone’s sexual orientation is a great sin, then they need to seriously take this owner, stick it on adhesive tape and throw them off from a cruise liner in the center of the Arctic.
