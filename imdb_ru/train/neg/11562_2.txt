Wealthy widower Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a lover of sadomasochism and a British lord. He leads sexy red-haired women into his castle, where he whips and kills them. Black stripper Erica Blanc (like Suzy) temporarily leaves. Mr. Steffen is pursued by his wife Evelyn, who died in childbirth. As a therapy, he decides to marry again after meeting the pretty blonde Marina Malfatti (as Gladys). By the end of the film they will have to dig some more graves. “The night when Evelyn came out of the grave” is at least a great name. <br /> <br /> ** La notte che Evelyn uscì dalla tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Eric Blanc
