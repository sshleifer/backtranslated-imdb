The Hazing is tangled chatter that The Evil Dead so much wants to be that it even refers to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is that he is simply not in the same league as this terrific movie. This film is not so original. The plot has already been used by Kevin Tenney in "The Night of the Demons", and it was much more fun. This film is wasting too much time on complex exposures before putting the children in a spooky mansion and starting demonic events. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourif, as usual, is not allowed to do much here, but when he is on the Screen, which he inserts into another stunning presentation that will make Christopher Walken jealous. As for the game of children, it is tolerable, but by no means good. Shaky camera work is more annoying than smart or atmospheric. There are some good moments when the first guy is obsessed and scatters several deadly liners, sending his victims, but not for a second was it scary. The blood level is medium to low, but the director is trying to fix it, several times showing topless actresses. In general, it is good if you have 87 minutes to spend.
