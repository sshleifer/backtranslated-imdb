I love the book "Jane Eyre" and saw many versions of it. Everyone has their strengths and their weaknesses. However, it was one of the worst I have seen. I didn't give a damn about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsburg (Jane) was almost tolerant and, of course, looked simple, but she had no emotions in any of her lines. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt even had less emotion than Jane if it were possible. How two such tasteless people can fall in love is a mystery, but this, of course, did not attract my attention. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during the production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Daltonâ€™s version (too beautiful for Mr. Rochester!) is much more true to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester. in version A / E of 1997 (which is not quite true for this book). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive in this film: Geraldine Capelan was beautiful in her role.
