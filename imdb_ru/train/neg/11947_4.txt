An interesting change from the first. There were more puzzles in this movie than in the first one. Even when it ends, you ask yourself what happened, who was the killer. There are some good moments in the film, the first half starts slowly, and then in the second half it picks up the pace. The whole movie is enjoyable. The story happened 22 years after the events in the first film, Norman Bates left the shelter and returned to the Bates Motel, but when a woman appears claiming to be his real mother, everything starts to go wrong. Perkins plays well again at the age of Norman, and the scene at the end was excellent, he hit him very hard.
