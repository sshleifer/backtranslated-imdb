In 1972, after his wife hit the road, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a good-natured, long-haired, beautiful, stately beauty queen, is about to fill the void in Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce became final, Linda was already in place as a friend of the legendary performer and travel companion until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a tasteless look at their love affair and companionship. Linda cares about the needs and desires of her lover with all her heart. And even put up with a handful of drugs to swallow it and introduce her to her own love affair with Valium. Sometimes this film is harsh and gloomy; a very unattractive look at the "king" and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely terrible, like Elvis. Over acting on the handle is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks Lindaâ€™s classiness, but she does a pretty good job. Auxiliary staff includes: John Crawford, Rutu Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching this twice is more than enough for me, but don't let this review prevent you from checking it out. For most Elvis fans I've met, this is not a favorite presentation.
