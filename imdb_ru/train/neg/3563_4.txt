For the most part, this film feels like a “television made” effort. The direction is crazy, the action (with the exception of Fred Gwinna) is overworked and soapy. Denise Crosby, in particular, pronounces his lines, as if she was cold, reading them from a cue. Only one thing makes this film worth seeing, and this is when Gage returns from Semetriya. There is something disturbing in the fact that a small child kills someone, and this film may be more than some can handle just for this reason. It is absolutely scary. This film does only one thing right, but it knocks this thing out of the park. Worth seeing only the last 10 minutes or so.
