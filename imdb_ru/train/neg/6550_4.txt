I almost fooled myself when I was going to start this review by saying, “This film reminded me of Billy Elliot,” but then I looked at screenwriter Lee Hall’s resume only to find out that he was the guy who wrote Billy Elliot. so Mr. Hall is fooling himself, not me <br /> <br /> Am I a little cruel to him? No, because Lee has something that most other novice writers from Britain don't have — he has a door to the door, he previously wrote a successful British film that won awards and made money at the box office, and what does he do next? He gives viewers more of the same. <br /> <br /> Young Jimmy Spoud lives in some kind of kitchen sink estate. At school, he is bullied, and no one loves him. The only thing that supports him is the desire to become a ballerina. No, in fact, he has a desire to be an angel, but, given his household, he can also be a ballet dancer. He has a courageous father who thinks: “Ballet dancers are a bunch of ottomans, and his grandfather says:“ Ballet dancers are just as strong as any person you could meet. I remember seeing the Bolshoi Ballet. “In those days, the ballet Yup was the main topic of discussion in the abandoned estate of the British Council - NO. If you think about it, then the policy of the left wing, which seems to be the sole prerogative of the middle class. Gooders who live in good big houses, so at once everything about this mood seems ridiculously false. <br /> <br /> Another serious criticism is that this film has no idea who he is trying to turn to. I often criticized Channel 4 for broadcasting films at a completely inappropriate time (for example, “THE EARTH, WHICH HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN” at 6 am), but they showed it at 2 am, and this time they have a place. I hate it) lung cancer and poverty, it can in no way be considered suitable for a family audience, but since the main character is an 11-year-old child and has angels and ballet dancers (do not blame me if I seem to be obsessed with the subject - not it was necessary to refer to them) here is not so much for a smart adult audience. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the producers told Lee Hall at the script development stage that he had to write a story with a student and an angel, he categorically refused to say that he wanted to write about other topics and then I would apologize, but Throughout the film, you have the feeling that after the film is completed, it will be sold to the same audience that liked Billy Elliot.
