Elizabeth Taylor's rich, ill, cares for the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or does she simply overreact - or, more precisely, replay - as usual? In fact, both of them are applicable in the wandering, meandering disorder of the director Joseph Losey, called “Bum”, appropriately entitled, since the characters are almost ready to explode in a lush, luxurious setting. Richard Burton climbs Taylor Mountain without an invitation; she dresses him in the samurai's mantle complete with a saber. Despite the fact that they look great on a widescreen image, otherwise the picture is rather deadly, a failure that even Liz-Dick-files should avoid (the collective attitude of the stars "what the hell!" x reached the mad ego nadir here). “Boom” is a disaster, meaningless, confused and maddening - although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play “The Milk Train Does Not Stop Here,” is said to love it very much! * from ****
