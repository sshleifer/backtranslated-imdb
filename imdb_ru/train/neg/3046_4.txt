I first saw this film when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a good Christmas movie for me and my brothers. This film, however, scared the hell out of me. You may ask yourself how a Santa Claus movie might scare someone? The filmâ€™s plot revolves around Satan sending one of his minions, Peach, to the earth in an attempt to kill Santa and spoil Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon from hell to kill Santa Claus. Step chases Santa on Christmas Eve, trying to trap him on the ground when the sun rises on Christmas, because if Santa doesn't return to his home in space, he turns into powder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and quite interesting, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which happens at the beginning of the movie) is simply terrible.
