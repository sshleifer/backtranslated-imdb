I really can't say anything bad * or * good about it. His characters are pretty cute, he is skillfully made and designed, and looks professional (with the exception of this stupid monster costume). Nevertheless, it has no originality, no ideas and nothing that you have not seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, a cookie cutter, "dirty corporate drones in deep space against an uncontrollable monster." Almost a waste of time.
