What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very mysterious script? Was it a few pieces on purpose? What about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very confusing story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candace Bergen, who played a terrible role, accept such an ungrateful role? <br /> <br /> Domino principle wants on the same basis as Parallax-View or Manchurian Candidate, and misses the mark with a very large margin. A serious misfire Stanley Kramer.
