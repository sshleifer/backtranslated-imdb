By now, you should already know about this film, the “bomb” of Jessica Simpson, who pretty much went straight to the video (limited, anemic theatrical run). In fact, Katie Miss Simpson is traveling from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman. She is stuck, but she has one friend (Rachel Lee Cook, whom I would like to see more often in the film), which allows her to stay. In the end, Katie gets a job thanks to two cunning employees (Penelope Ann Miller and always funny Andy Dick), who simply use Katie to drive out the president of the company (Larry Miller). This is strictly a movie b, it should not be deep. Jessica Simpson is by no means a great actress, but she is very beautiful and never annoying. The film is watchable in the sense that it is not an abomination, but a catchy fluff. In one of the Penny Marshall episodes, a funny (subtle joke about Milwaukee made me laugh), and there is a funny scene with Norwegian priests (don't read too much about this). So not terrible, but easy to miss. Your safe bet is to watch it on TV if it ever happens. Again, not good, but not a deep disaster.
