While watching the channels, we found this film with a promising summary. We were alarmed by the flat game and formulaic plot. We found fun exploding car scenes, incredible gunfights and sets that collapse with the weight of tyropenes and cardboard. What was even more amusing was the vision of all the reworked scenes from Dante's Pick, where the church facade falls on a school bus, shop windows are detached from the main street, the overpass is destroyed and a red truck rushes along the lane. like bricks falling on it. It was a good laugh, albeit an unintended one, and made the viewer wonder if he was originally conceived as a low-budget parody of disaster films.
