This movie is really bad. The game is just awful, except for Michael Ironside. I do not understand the story. Richard Greco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mac gangs. He comes to the city, and suddenly he is chosen to fight against bad people who want Indian lands. On the cover it was said that he himself was an Indian who also returned to his hometown, I did not hear that in the film, if so, it was unclear. <br /> <br /> Richard Greco was a damn bad actor. Hard and ugly. He said that his lines also like him. And we will not talk about Shaun Young, she was not my favorite actor, but in this film she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Greco). She is terrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I made a choice between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this one because Michael Ironside was in the cast. Perhaps I should have taken the Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, unless you think that Richard Greco looks tough on a motorcycle with glasses. <br /> <br /> I will update the cast list soon, because I have it at home. I recorded it after seeing the movie.
