Like watching films about the summer camp of the neighbors, “Indian Summer” is a bore that causes sleep. Eight alumni barely get to know each other when incredibly boring memories of characters about which we know nothing begin. Wonderful actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are completely wasted in this film. One tourist's remark that “everything seems much smaller than I remember” is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you squirm. Expected jokes are neither funny nor original, unless you think that a short sheet is a real "howler". This film was a big disappointment, given enough talented people. "Indian Summer" did not make me homesick, just nauseous. - MERK
