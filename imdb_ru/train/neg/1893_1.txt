This film became very stupid when everything began to happen. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and the lead actor (forgot his name) also got on my nerves. I can not remember how it all ended and so on, but the very idea that aliens have human bodies, and everything in this film just seemed silly, things were not entirely justified. My dad told me that this is a stupid movie ... I had to listen to it.
