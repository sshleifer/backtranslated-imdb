It is assumed that this film will take place in and around Seattle. Why is Park P-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Porteau Cove shown? Provincial parks are located in CANADA, not in the United States. The inspector uses the Palm Pilot bundled with the stylus to “read” that someone hacked into the bridal shop computer. I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device. The woman appears in the film without any representation and is never represented. Halfway through, we learn that this woman works in the district prosecutor's office. Then in the correctional center, the guard actually CONTINUES Jenks through the door and holds his back to the criminal !! This would NEVER happen in a real correctional situation. The director really screwed up - this does not happen in real life. The game is adequate. The plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, many errors found in succession result in 3 out of 10 votes.
