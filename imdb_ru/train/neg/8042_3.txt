The secret is ... this film is blowing. Sorry, but it just did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff I KNOW YOU ARE THE LAST SUMMER AND SCREAM, Beth, played by Dory Barton excellently, joins friends in trip to spring break. The group rents a fancy house and tries to have a fun holiday. Then death begins. First one, then another, then another of the friends are killed, which leads to a sad and banal climax period with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One note: Dory Barton - this is Reese Witherspoon for the poor man - she looks like Reese, behaves like Reese and can pass for Reese in police custody. Maybe it threw her? Anyhoo, decent cinematography and fair acting could not compensate for the poor dialogue and terrible writing.
