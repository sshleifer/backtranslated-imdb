I start writing this review during the break when I watch a movie. This is the first time I tried to do this, but I have problems with this without accidental interruptions. This is not because it is intense, but because it is bad. <br /> <br /> It is almost painfully tedious and incredible, especially when the unusually strong dying brother Ryan (Colm Fehr) appears on the screen, who is tragic and fussy, self-satisfied and self-confident -pitying. It would be a much better movie if they just left this character out of the story. <br /> <br /> He doesn’t add anything but a moukina, milky, very annoying melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they could not make Ryan believable, they would just make him nasty. The problem is this: who cares if a spoiled, whining, nasty moron dies? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing this character does for him is that he is dying and sorry, but this is simply not enough. Death does not make anyone special. We all die sooner or later. No one gives the right to expect sympathy, acting like a jerk. <br /> <br /> Two other characters and actors playing them (David Qubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah) are much more interesting, and their story, without interruption to Ryan’s pity, would make the film much better. But this is not the end, and it's time to play PLAY again. Maybe something great will happen to the end .... <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. This rent turkey is back tonight!
