Badly done. A terrible game and the end, which the Director seemed to come up with out of nowhere, because the film was frankly boring. It is shocking that this film is viewed as a reward at the Gijon film festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who left the theater was of the same opinion as me - what's the point of even making a film? The references to Iraq were either strange, or simply not thought through to the end. I am surprised that this film was released - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, terribly negative feedback, but I hope it will not allow some people to make the same mistake. What a pity that we had no questions and answers at the end of the film - now it could be interesting.
