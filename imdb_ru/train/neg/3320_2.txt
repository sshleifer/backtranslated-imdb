Honestly, I had some great expectations when I first started watching this movie, but it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First, the pace is incredibly slow. So it seems to be much longer than it is (and it is not short). I am sure that when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made it several pages long, filled it with a description and did not intend to read it once, or it could drag out and lose its appeal, which Emma probably did. Now “Feelings and Sensitivity” had this lack of a slow pace, but at least it had live lines to fill it, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> This brings me to shortcoming number 2, which, of course, is valid. Although, strangely enough, I don’t care mostly about anyone who participates in this film, I’m sure that they are capable of a good job, but I haven’t seen much of it in this film. It’s as if people tried too hard to be witty, too hard to be “upper class”, too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they all just acted as a group of actors, not as people. <br /> <br /> # 3. The actors, as I said, seemed only actors, not the people they played. Maybe this is good, because the people they played were not so good. Why did everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Sure, she was sweet with rich, beautiful people in front of them, but she was a terrible gossip behind them. If her friends were "ugly," then she did not even bother to go behind their backs. So why is this girl so wonderful? Why do people have to tell stories, "just to make her laugh?" Of course, the snob couldn't even do it right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow in the role of Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" did not quite change my opinion. <br /> <br /> Well, it is easy to understand that I do not care. I'm sure this is a great book and all that, but some books are not really meant for the big screen, and Emma is one of them.
