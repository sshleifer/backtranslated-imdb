Really horrible movie. At first I did not know that it was an attempt at a kiwi, but very soon I began to realize that all the characters spoke with barely disguised accents on kiwi under fake American accents. Why did it have to be installed in America anyway? - it could be installed in New Zealand, and then the actors could use their usual voices. Surely someone from the film crew could hear terrible attempts to speak with an American accent? Bad bad movie. I'm surprised it lasts so long - how did it come from the can? It just seemed like a very unsuccessful attempt at the Segal / Willis movie. TOTAL WASTE MONEY! If there were money by TAXPAYERS in this scrap, I would lead a revolution to return all the money to the Treasury. I'm still shocked (See? Pickle!) On the absolute rubbish that I just saw. Why did I keep looking? Well, I'm a movie fanatic and can't help myself!
