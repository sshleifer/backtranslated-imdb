I took this title from a friend who had it in his comprehensive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so fortunately I personally did not have to pay for it. I had a suspicion that it would be a bad movie, but I KNOW what a really bad movie is after watching such great films as “Children shouldn’t play with dead things” and “Incredibly strange creatures who stopped life and became mixed zombies” and now there is nothing that bothers me, unless it is amazingly bad. <br /> <br /> Sunny crisis is bad, but it does not reach that sweet spot of absolute pain, as in some films. <br /> <br /> In any case, the general plot is such that the Sun is about to release a huge solar flare to Earth, which in essence will destroy it. To counter this imminent threat, mankind has assembled a spacecraft and a crew whose duty is to shoot a bomb-antimatter at the Sun (which the discovery describes as “the biggest explosive ever to exist”) at the Sun, which through some intricate science fiction logic will force A flash fire from a different angle, leaving the ground unscathed. <br /> <br /> Never mind that what I just described for you sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with the cast (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis has a hard time coping with this level of mediocrity, thanks to a story that starts simply but becomes more and more meaningless over time. <br /> <br /> The culminating achievement of this debacle of the film is the addition of a villain character (played by Boyle) who insists on sabotaging the mission. Using tools that are never explained, he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise a kind of vague electronic control over the mind of a space crew scientist, genetically engineered, played by lead woman Annabel Schofield. Why does he sabotage the mission? Because, from his moron point of view, he believes that a flash will not occur, and that when this does not happen, he will become incredibly rich, because he dug his evil claws in the stock market. In fact, you have a villain with the most absurd stupidity that you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film becomes surprisingly confusing and develops very slowly, using the characters that play only vague or uselessly short roles in the storyline in time. I could sit here and explain in detail what is going on to demonstrate the scriptwriter's apparent inability to create a plot that really attracts your attention, but I sit here and write this review in Microsoft Word, and I know for sure that it would take three pages, and I would just lose your interest. But on the other hand, you will probably get the same effect from watching the movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is terribly bogged down in a very bad dialogue. Imagine that everything that ever happened on Star Trek was that the characters erupted science fiction slang back and forth to each other. Yes, I know, they are already doing it, but imagine that this is ALL that they did and that they used the specified jargon to create vague and almost meaningless scenes that do not cause any excitement, tension or interest in the viewer. <Br /> <br /> This best illustrates the moment when a character in Zero-G is screwing a bolt to a metal box, and then begins to cry in agony for a few minutes and then suddenly explodes. Earlier in the script it is mentioned that the character risks an explosion, but he does not give an exact answer about why or how this happens, and why he cannot really escape. In general, you have a sad cross between the strange and the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Then we have several scenes where dramatic build-up does not lead to anything. Jack Palance’s play is wasted on a character who only serves to lead a boy hero (not to ask) in the desert before he is beaten and killed by a bunch of costumes. On his deathbed, Palance finally tells our hero-boy his last name (when wearing terrible bruised make-up, because of which it looks like someone put a balloon under his eyeball), about which he had previously kept silent. Col. Travis J. Richards. The boy quietly repeats this after dying, giving the audience the impression that this name has some meaning later in the film. Perhaps the white-haired Admiral character of Charlton Heston knows him, and the plot will advance as soon as his name is repeated. Something. Anything. <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. Any of your hopes will be broken when this moment turns out to be just another one of many pathetic unsuccessful attempts to create drama for a character so flat and battered that it will forever remain a stain on Palance’s career, just like the rest of the actors are also spoiled. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is a painfully harsh finale in which Schofield directs a bomb to the center of the Sun, trying to atone for his actions while under the spell of the villain, which is the culmination in which there is one more of the well-made sequences of visual effects of the film who, in spite of the clearly thought-out concern for them, are still always able to give the film the same attractive look as it really is. The saddest part of this film is obviously the big budget, tragically spent on the smelly script and supporting cast behind Beyle, Heston and Palance, who manage to pin the coffin with sheer overstrain. <br /> <br /> Rating: D-
