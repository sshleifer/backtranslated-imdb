As opposed to another reviewer, I think it is WELL, especially because it is fictional, because it takes more imagination; and acted well, because there were no other characters with whom one could share the essence of these dozens of minutes, plus well-made monologues. But I just do not entertain such solemn, pious memories. Everyone has a story to tell, and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems, and some are more intense than others. These are only ten, not very atypical stories and problems illustrating how someoneâ€™s life (or part of it) is food for the cinema. Again, I think badly about reality TV shows. So if this is your bag, you might like this. These are things that can be useful for telephone conversations and / or Internet gossip; but absolutely no verbal action. And, although each of the speakers is female, I will leave the floor beyond that.
