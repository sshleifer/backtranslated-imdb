I did not like the frosty returns and this one. Both films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. Voices could be made, but the frosty return was worse than that because of the unlike snowman they drew. The winter wonderland of Frost was gorgeous, as was the original soul drama. The only good thing about this movie was that Frosty’s snowman looked like a classic 60s and a funny line, as if they were talking about things that are not real, and then Frosty strolls by the window, singing, whistling what he did, but everything else is poorly written and poorly animated, and I barely got the plot. I saw the DVD cover in the library about 2 or 3 years ago, and the art looked shitty, so I didn't take it until this year, because the pictures on the back looked a bit touching, but I played this movie. It was troublesome to draw characters, like on a DVD, and it was just awful because of what was going on. I watched it at night and I was bored because I generally fell asleep (wait, I always do that when I watch something and I fall asleep) But this film was generally boring <br /> <br /> Overall rating : Assessment -C <br /> <br /> This is just another holiday desecration in frosty returns this time too. This is a bad 4th sequel, like "House One". I thought the movie was fine, but Home One was great. But it's like a bad house, only 3 and 4 people hate so much. My sister didn’t watch that much, because when she entered my room to watch two and a half minutes, she left like "I hate animation!" I agree with her just as the 3rd Frosty is back. Just awful!
