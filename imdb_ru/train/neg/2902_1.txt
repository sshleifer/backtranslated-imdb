Spoiler: a group of passive-aggressive people reuniting with the family. The script forces them to say and do things that people will never do, at least with some decency. The hero falls in love with a woman whom he sees as his soul mate in a bookstore on the day of reunion, not suspecting that she will appear as a friend of his brother at the reunion. He tries to submit to his brother's demand, but she, knowing that our hero is clearly in love with her, ruthlessly teases him, wearing sexy clothes and acting like a stripper, rubbing his brother in a clever excuse, which she shows him as a stretch. At some point, she actually undresses and takes a shower with him. He is trying to cover his eyes. His heart is broken. She thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she doesn't want a brother, and leaves the meeting. <br /> <br /> The film is really addictive. The audience coughed and fussed in the long journey. The letter is unreasonable and unbelievable. We almost went out, but continued to think that something would happen that would improve the situation, but neao. All the great reviews must have been written by paid shill to fool such poor suckers like me to see such shit. Comparing this with little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Shame on them, writers, actors, producers and theaters for letting something so bad get on the screen!
