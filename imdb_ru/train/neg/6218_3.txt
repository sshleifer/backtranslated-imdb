My thoughts on the film, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, not at all good. Visually it was great. I was pleased with the tempo, camera angles, etc. However, the characters? yes, quite soft. Plot? It sucks. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed more shitty than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and scary. Science is not portrayed better. He creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but can "souls" destroy monsters and bring life? True? <br /> <br /> This also bites my ass a little. Here we have the CGI film ... created by science ... and they use it to let us know that science will destroy the world, promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask <br /> <br /> "Okay, so what now?" (or something similar). I could not hear it too well, because the crowd immediately got up and took a break on the way out. It was "good ... it was hardly interesting enough to sit here for the whole movie, but now let's get out of here as quickly as possible!" Type of output. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films where you can’t think whether you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visual effects and nod beautifully. Any thought about "what's the point in this?" suck you out of disbelief and make you wistfully watch the weekend sign. <br /> <br /> Good ... Spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> So basically, a scientist creates a “Machine” that can create a different, intelligent, robotic life. Evil people use it as a weapon. However, the scientist understands that he is also guilty. He gave his intellect to the car, but did not give him his heart. <br /> <br /> The machine sends Skynet to the collective ass of humanity and destroys all life on earth, finally, gradually turning off. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking socks-puppets. Each of them contains a piece of the soul of the scientist. <br /> <br /> Last, No. 9, wakes up without knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets with another, like himself, No. 2. <br /> <br /> Well, No. 2 is captured by the last surviving robot of the Machine. # 9 finds more, as he himself goes to help # 2. <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> # 9 notices that there is an appropriate hole that is perfect for the device. He inserts it, and the Machine comes back to life ... pulling out soul # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> Then, in the film, the fighting scenes continue, in which No. 9 is trying to save its kinsmen, who are thirsting for their soul. <br /> <br /> They ultimately succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends who rise to the clouds. Then it rains and we see life return to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hmm?!? <br /> <br /> It does not make sense. Not at all. What the hell scientist wanted to divide his soul into 9 homunculi? What did it do? Were they created to stop the car? Everything is dead! The car was dead! Why bother?!? <br /> <br /> Why did he expect the nine little creatures to succeed when there was nothing else? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight the first ... at least it would seem that it would have a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to have their souls dragged into the device using a machine, and then destroyed the machine and then freed the souls to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the car to turn off and bring life back without all the other crazy steps?
