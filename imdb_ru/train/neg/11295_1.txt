I understand that this film was made for children, and, as a parent, I watched a lot of films that do not particularly interest me, but I can evaluate from a constructive point of view how my children accept it. It is assumed that parents should still take part in the activities of their children and monitor the quality of entertainment that they see, so there must be something that attracts an adult audience at some level, even in children's films. Disney always understood this, so it’s so hard to understand how he could allow such a whole piece of wood to bear his name. <br /> <br /> Technically sound editing is terrible, and all dialogs sound too loud. humor and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but it was doubly terrible, considering that the dialogue itself looked like it was written by a 12-year school project. "Acting" reminded me of a school play, and none of the children's actors had emotions in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short film. <br /> <br /> Now, before I come off, as a video fan measuring a child’s movie with an adult stick, the only thing that can save even the worst child’s movie is a positive message. must be delivered if it is correct. Let's go through this movie and see what messages are being given to it. <br /> <br /> If you get lost, do not worry, you will inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> Approach wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition only because you “know” that you can. <br /> <br /> and my favorite, the last message in the film: <br /> <br /> It is normal to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right.
