With all its visual delights, how much better the Renaissance would be in live action. Yes, the animation is fantastic, but the characters are cold and empty, as in the plot and style of this film. With real actors, perhaps the world of the film would not be so lifeless. There is something to admire, but in the end I found that I can only admire. I didn’t really like the film, and it clarifies what I haven’t seen before: the visual elements may be the defining positive aspect of the film, but without a good story and strong characters, everything can be in vain. I will not go so far as to say that this film does not lead to anything, but sometimes it is dangerously close. I love Dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two films that I think are wonderful. But Blade Runner had its own tragic villain, and Dark City had a storyline. The Renaissance has a shadow and light, but little else. I wish that I liked this film more, but there was a weak story and empty characters along the way. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic explosion of color and life. How ironic that one of the darkest and most lifeless films I saw this year got its name from the Renaissance.
