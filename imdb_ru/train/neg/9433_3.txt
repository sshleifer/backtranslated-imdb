I bought Unhinged, because I was dragged out by a bloody pattern on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. All the killings are shown, and I can honestly tell you that in the frames they look much better than in the film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let's look at the plot. A group of college girls going to a rock concert (through deep dark forests in one of the longest road scenes ever captured on celluloid) move out of the way. No visible damage to the car was caused, but apparently it was enough for one of the characters to be in a comatose state until the end of the film (or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before the shooting started). <Br /> <br /> The two remaining girls wake up in a large isolated house. The house, by the way, is fabulous and controls more drama only by its presence than any of the actors in the film. However, for some reason, this house has no roads leading to it. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five miles through the forest. The girls spend the rest of Unheded, listening to strange conversations between the old rich bitch (which looks like George Washington in a drag) and her equally homely, sexually repressed daughter. The girls apparently did not hurry to return from this concert, because they collected more clothes than the cast of the island of Gilligan, for this three-hour tour. <br /> <br /> By the time we, the viewers, get to the murder scene, we don’t care. We want someone to kill us to put an end to our suffering. Unhinged finally ends in a rather shocking finale that deserves to be in a much better movie. It’s like the ending was written first, the only good idea in the film, and then the writers tried to make a film leading to it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Irritated is a boring movie with a bad game, poor management, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (sorry. I don't know where it came from). You will get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is during the opening credits, when for some reason that is never explained, the screen goes out for about two minutes while the characters say that it’s worth nothing to remember. Do not waste your time. You just feel upset and want to return time and money.
