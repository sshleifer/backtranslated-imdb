Left behind - an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars. The game is weak and boring, the story is even weaker. Viewers are asked to believe in an absolutely implausible and many times funny storyline and to give nothing in return for their good faith. The film is not only poorly filmed and not scripted, but also badly lacking in all technical areas of filmmaking. Production design does nothing to increase credibility of action. The effects are completely non-original and flat. The lighting and general continuity are terribly awful; even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. However, none of this will matter, as millions of families will undoubtedly accept the film for its usefulness and religious beliefs; And who can blame them. However, it is regrettable that they will be forced to accept 3-level amateur filmmaking.
