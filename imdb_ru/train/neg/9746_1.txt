I remember this film on display in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for the time of the week. Although it may seem incredible, and I can not give any explanation for this, this film was shown in a theater dedicated to ... feature films and high-quality films (i.e. Bergman, Rene, Malle, Bunuel, etc.) .. Predicted Man). Few people saw it (lucky people, no doubt), and no mention of this very boring SF film can be found in Peter Nichols' science fiction encyclopedia or the author of the original novel. Very revealing. I remember this, after all these years, there is no history, many special effects that actually seem ridiculous, and nothing more. It seems that in some countries the operating time is 90 mm. and in another's 77 min. Well, that means just a little more pain.
