This film takes what could be a good idea, a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroy her. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry. They go to stay with her Nan and uncle. An uncle discovered a 2,000-year-old witch, preserved in peat. He enlivens her, and she takes the form of Nora She can not be killed conditionally, (more sorry). Nora, however, finds a way to do this. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie that was shot cheaply. This is a sprawling mess. I have to ask why someone would want to make such a bad movie. I am tempted to study witchcraft to disappear. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL EXPENSES
