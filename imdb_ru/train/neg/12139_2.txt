I remember when it happened, many children went crazy about this. I think I was too old to worry, and I was a fan of real martial arts films and always found it a bit silly. <br /> <br /> In the early 90s, we were overwhelmed with programs like this, making children feel that they can fight and be a ranger or equal to these children in 3 ninjas. I think that in the end, parents and directors are tired of this, because all we really had was many children who beat everyone and punched them. <br /> <br /> Many children's films have an important idea and itâ€™s nice for your children to watch and receive messages, there is no message at all ... it just uses a million differences in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are no great visual qualities in the film, but can we expect this? The game is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor, but it was awkward to see him here ... Short, fat, pimply, old fart, like a mighty ninja who was just funny. The kids acted too much, and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst child actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is a story in the film that anyone knows before they read the review. 3 ninjas ... yes, you know that they will fight with a bunch of bad guys and win, obviously ... Do I need to say more. Sorry if I ruined someone. <br /> <br /> With all that said, KIDS LOVE IT. This film is intended for children, and only children can enjoy it. If you don't mind your child watching films about children fighting, this is a good movie to show them. If you don't mind your children seeing the full trash, which has nothing to do with real martial arts, real acting or reality, then you have found a film for your children ... I tell the children, because I think that even girls will I like ... I remember all the girls in love with Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars, because I think that you can make a film for children and at the same time make it enjoyable for adults ... this film could not be done. This is a grandiose and nothing original or unique, and I would not let my child watch it ... Kung Fu, the series is on DVD, and there are many great Shaw Brothers films. .. Why not show your children things that really entertain them and not make them blunt along the way, maybe even teach them some movements, and not just how to kick a person between their legs, like grandfather did for 3 ninjas ... no no no ... never kick a person between your legs ... never .. like it so much.
