When a comedy film boasts a marvelous soundtrack on the back cover, you know that you are not dealing with a top quality movie. I made this movie with friends who were expecting to laugh, but in general, to make us laugh at each other, making fun of the movie. We could not choose the worst movie. <br /> <br /> The movie may have been fine, with some modifications. First, the comedy was painful. Physical plugs were poorly executed and placed. The fat kid in the film made us want to kill himself, bless him for trying the scene and the scene, but he was like a puppy asking for love. If he was pulled out of the film, everything would be tolerated. There were some funny jokes, I think one was when a group of boys steal one of the porn movies of a parent and it turns out gay porn. But in order to better summarize the comedy, I will just say the initial stub for a fat child. He wears a shirt stained with vomit and says he does not know when something is done. <br /> <br /> To finish, a film editor could save a film by removing a fat child, cutting out 20 minutes of school scenes and an ending that lasts more than thirty seconds of random quarrels. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, there are two good elements that the film possesses. Kadim Hardison perfectly plays his part and plays his jokes, so that none of them is missing or undervalued. Another redemptive element of the film is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. Her character is ignored in most films, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time even making this movie. I did not like it, and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
