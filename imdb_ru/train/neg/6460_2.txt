* Can anyone tell me WHERE IS A COMEDY ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian, (Thomas Hayden Church) looks so weak (with him!), and everything is so stupid! <br /> <br /> * They tried to make a live comic book that turned out to be a super bloody comic nightmare and it wasn't even funny? Like a scene in the bathroom; it was so good with his cinematic imagination, but nothing more .. except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * In fact, this is a job that they did only to earn a little money on it, but it became such a crime when this money would be robbed from ourselves, who were deceived by such low artwork, and entertainment in general had no entertainment! <br /> <br /> * Well, it would be uglier if it were a big production and Brando starring in his golden years with a REAL star. <br /> <br /> * Here is the Shina family. Just know about it! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who admired this movie or who the hell loved it! Then you need to go straight to the therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt someone! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but the film is not! And he was not going to be here, having read it for sure !! But the main big problem is that no one has ever worked on it, trying or wanting to be a little clever or even good !!! (Sorry, I'm crying now! The film is tormenting incredibly!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) beats (Mira Sorvino) with her shoes! It was so realistic! Perhaps he saw himself in her, so he punished himself for being in such shit! <br /> <br /> * For billions of times: it could be better (or worse!). The scenario before the train robbery was good, and I just imagined that they could avoid some kind of chase, as if it were different (Smokey and the Bandit), but with (Brando) as a sheriff. In fact, any of these chimeras was much more gracious than what I was watching! <br /> <br /> * Why this masterpiece did not receive rezzy awards ?! Do you want me to believe that there was a lower film than IT? I do not think! This is a situation when the boss Razzy himself must win him for negligence !! <br /> <br /> * Martin Shin is also a guest star, perhaps for supporting his unsuccessful son, but ironically, the father was just as unlucky as his son! and why so ?! Well ! Because I hate Martin Sheen, maybe more than I hate comic films that are not as good as his ambitions! <br /> <br /> * This is not a comedy film, NO .. This is a horror movie, and I just hate horror films, especially those that are promoted as comic! <br /> <br /> * What is something good about it? Hmmm Well, this one compared to another monster film Marlon Brando (“Dr. Moreau's Island”, 1996) will be close to (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: if you still want to know who are bad or bad, then what is ugly and very ugly in this film ... Just pray for your last prayers and see them .. God help you !
