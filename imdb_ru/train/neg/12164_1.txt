This film is not good. the first one almost sucks, but it had an unreal end to be worth seeing. it has nothing. zero scares, zero annoying or unknown. it's not really a horror movie. most kills don't show anything. There is nothing to talk about. This may be a TV, except for nude nature and violence. The game is also not very good. dialog.as for an unexpected ending, surprise, there is none. I believe that it could be worse, although I do not understand how. But then again, it's less than 80 minutes, so I think this is a good thing. although it feels much longer. apparently this is a stripped down version of the film. I found it at a very low price, but itâ€™s still not worth it. If you want a more complete graphical version, check out the Anchor Bay release. In any case, this is the version of Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Kempers gets a big 1/10 fat from me. If you watch this movie, you are likely to become a bored and unhappy tourist. If you are a real fan, you can choose a collection with discs in Anchor Bay (with a survival kit) of three discs containing the first three films without special features.
