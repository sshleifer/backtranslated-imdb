William Russ - the main character of the film. He left his family just to appear and begin to pay debts. But he is trying to stay away from his family. That's where Peter Falk (Colombo) appears, playing several different roles to convince him to return home. <br /> <br /> The story is average, and they really managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use it. to a pretty good degree. But William Russ was not a real star. However, it seems that his acting is still in order. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that the story and the plot are very trashy, because everything was predictable. In fact, for the last 20 minutes, I could almost dictate word for word before this happened. A good movie should never be like that. <br /> <br /> In general, this was an inappropriate film. In the letter grading system, she would get the letter "D".
