Guy Ritchie's noble effort is beaten, knocked down, raped, kicked around, shot, stabbed, spat, punched, raped, insulted and left dead by Madonnaâ€™s terrible performance. Her acting was very similar to a graduate of the School of Dramatic Art and Public Speaking Al Gore. Guy Ritchie made a somewhat noble attempt to redo it, and if you exclude ALL the scenes his wife was in, this is an honest film at best. I think the best acting job ever had to console Guy so that his wife was good enough not to re-film. If you have the opportunity to watch Swept Away or trim your toenails for 89 minutes ... go for an extended pedicure.
