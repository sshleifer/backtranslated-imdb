It would seem, intended to be a movie thriller, it turns out almost ridiculous. This prompted me to exclaim, "My God!" more than once in the intricate conspiracy tricks that were just stupid. <br /> <br /> Fancy or absurd locations just for the sake of obvious novelty or dramatic situation and incredible, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too great to understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and you want to know how bad a picture can be, you will want to see it. Otherwise, devote some time to viewing the paint for a more productive time investment! <br /> <br /> (the film, released in 2003, is already shown on television in July 2003, may indicate the quality of the film)
