It was all that it was not: it was the pace, the popularity and the actors who were not afraid to chew the scenery. He also had a decent script. This one made me scratch my head. If Farra is not very serious about her career, why does she have a manager (and why does he spend his time)? If Kate and Barney are “artists,” why do they sign up for the Jigsaw Show “The Mother of All” (for example, the film “Brady Bunch”, where Robert Reed wants to play Shakespeare just to be on BB)? They were not industry names, but they were not hungry. And although they understood the story correctly (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejects programs for Funny Home Video and American Idol and Spelling, promising his baby Tory one day that he would obviously create for her the show didn't happen. <br /> <br /> I was worried about how the role of Spelling is distorted. He is shown as a show runner and creator when he was neither one nor the other. And the way he "came up with" the "idea" for CA was ridiculous! <br /> <br /> How did Spelling and Goldberg allow Farrah to perform the oral contract when the others were signed? And why did Farrah or Bernstein not tell them that she was leaving, not because she discovered her Inner Diva, but because the majors wanted it? That's why when he tries to create conflict and tension, exposing Farrah as a “bad girl” (like Suzanne Somers), she fails because the fundamentals were never laid - it was there that the picture of Company of the Three was presented.
