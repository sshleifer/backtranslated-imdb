Wow, after about 15 minutes later I messed up Timo Roses's "City of Runaways" CD (South Park is more than a meaningless curse ... I think some people just don’t understand it). I was interested in this movie. I read some pretty positive things, and the packaging and the look of the film seemed far from the common trash I was expecting after “City of the Way.” <br /> <br /> Surprise: the film is not complete garbage, but the problem seems to be just that. Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of the German Cinema of Terror / Spray, like Olaf Ittenbach and the like. This means that the "Barricade" in detail is extremely bloody and detailed. Gore FX is not entirely plausible, but everything is in order, the game is in order, but in some cases just sucks. Jumping chick in the debut sequence is ridiculous and does not recover until she is shot. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem ... the film is terrible, with a typical German underground atmosphere (including classic explosive shots in the blood), good FX and a modern feeling for it like the packaging already promised ?! <br /> <br /> 1. Script of the whole BS. You get a typical village story, lost in the forest, with a few guys and girls who camped and met a degenerate village family. Everything only leads to scenes of torture / mutilation and seems incredibly casual and meaningless. This is the first thing that makes the Barricade indecisive. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also an ideal description for a big camera job (I liked the repetitive incision with tweezers in the extended scene of torture-minuses ... or they didn’t have material, or the editor worked at the hardware store). Editing is even worse ... of course it's modern and much better than many other films in the genre, but this is RANDOM. You abuse this typical effect of exposure everywhere and without meaning ... just here ... all the time. Then there is some kind of grainy / noisy kind of film that is also just added here and there for this, I don’t understand the point. <br /> <br /> 3. Like the above effects, there are a lot of repetitive things. For example, most kills are edited with several repetitions of punches and punches. This is normal once, but here it is annoying and fake, especially towards the end. The attribute "music" is also annoying, which is constantly used without any changes in the background. It does not take long until the film becomes bearable. <br /> <br /> 4. From all this flows the biggest problem of this film (and many others, in my opinion). If you make a dirty film with rubbish, feel its idiocy to polish it with a special FX and a new school version. They seem to take it too seriously. It's not fun, because in this context, decent FX blood is simply wasted. And where classic bloody effects are in order, computer effects in scenes such as a blow to the mouth or shots in the finals look pretty silly (and 3D splashes for the most part suck me even in films with a budget and worthy 3D artists). /> <br /> I often wondered if the time for serious splashing films had passed, and Barricade was just another example; perhaps it was time to put him in the grave. It is not fun, has no character and is too cheesy for its look. The script is a cheap attempt to “Wrong move” and “TCM”, which lead nowhere. You can take it literally ... the ending is just there and just as randomly as many other things here ("I love you" in the spray ... come on !!). The Barricade is trying to unite a lot and fails ... You can be confident in this film, which will help you extensive gutting, acid facial melting, pinching nipples and the classic 13th pair friday scissors, turning over a tent (bloody) boobies cheers! ). But it is really difficult to get through this. A complete failure, especially because you see that it could be something.
