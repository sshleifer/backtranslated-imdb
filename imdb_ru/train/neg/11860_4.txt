If you do not understand what will happen in this film in the first five minutes, then give it a couple more minutes. Lily is a widow. She was left on the shelf for too long, and she wants to escape. She has a teenage daughter who only emphasizes that she is not getting younger. Checking her daughter, she discovers a world that never dared ... a cabaret, where she can dance a belly dance in scanty clothes with sparkles, while men throw money at her. The film is very woman-hater. This image of people is grim. Which is rather strange when Lilia bends down to joke around them, not for the money, but just for the sake of it. When she manages to arouse them, she feels like a woman again. She does not want to mess with them, but she is dependent on attention. All other dancers are mostly aging women, who look like men in drag and understand that their time is not long in the spotlight. Not short enough to speak. She really finds romance, no matter how brief it is, you guessed it ... We did not expect any surprises. Although the finale is good, you realize that it could have ended differently. Maybe this film is simply not aimed at my demographics - 30 men
