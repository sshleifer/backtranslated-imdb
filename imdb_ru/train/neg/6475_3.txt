Although I haven’t reviewed the film for about two years, I remember exactly what made my opinion as low as before. I loved the original Mermaid and was obsessed with mermaids as a child. I decided that I would find time to sit down and see the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you don’t have the original director and actors on hand ... you just want your ass to blow out. <br /> <br /> Further, our story begins with a little older than Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney loves to sing and dance very much, but in fact this is what made Eric my favorite prince. He was calm, collected, and a real gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did. NOT. Sing. <br /> <br /> And then there's the villain. Oh, how could we forget about the tremor that pervaded our spines every time Ursula fell on the screen, terrorizing Ariel and viewers around the world? Unfortunately, this gene was not transmitted to her seemingly useless sister Morgana. Nothing was ever, ever talked about Morgan in the first film; she just appears out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh, how cute. The younger sister is killed with a tick and instead of going after the trident, she decides to kidnap a month-old baby. Gag me. <br /> <br /> Morgana, besides the fact that she was a flat character without a sense of originality, was simply very unorthodox. The same plan as her sister, the same minions (which, by the way, did not frighten anyone. I had a three-year-old boy on my lap when I watched this film and she laughed hysterically). She had no purpose to be there; I would like to see mom as a villain. I’m sure she would have done better there than Little Miss Tish. <br /> <br /> King Triton did not enjoy the respect he received from me in the first film, and did not even get it, I started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Kambala. In the first film, Triton was a strict but loving father, and in the second, he almost lost the desire to instill fear in the hearts of his subjects. Skattle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his “bunker” (yes, I admit it; after that, I occasionally called my fork a bunker). In this film, Scuttle is almost forgotten. Auxiliary character even in the first, he at least added something to the film. He was rich in aroma that others did not have, and in the future they almost completely broke away from him. Sebastian was still the same, but two times more than before. Disney, don't do this. Don't even try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite little fat fish that becomes a father and has a lot of very annoying kids. He is fat, and he is soft, and he looks as if at any second he is going to level the line. <br /> <br /> Walrus and penguin were unnecessary, and after a while you just start to get offended at all. Especially Melody, who has no depth. <br /> <br /> And the other day, Disney, I come out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I didn’t love your originals so much.
