My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I like him too, but in general he found that he should “stick to what he does best” and focus on comedy roles. My thoughts were confirmed by this film. I was bored throughout the film. The story was predictable. I understand that this was inspired by a real story. But I guess that there may have been some uncertainty or intrigue, even if the truth was preserved in history. None of the characters was well developed. There was an additional story about the main character and his partner. These relationships could be explored further. More important, however, would be a deeper study of the mother of the “boy.” It would be interesting to understand her psychological profile. She obviously has a long history that was not affected, except in the most superficial way. If my husband had not been such a big fan of Williams, we would have left 20 minutes. I wish I could get my 20 or 2 hours ago.
