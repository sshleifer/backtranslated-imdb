This short parody can be found on the Elite's Millennium Edition Night of the Living Dead DVD. Good thing, because I would never even try my best to see it. Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like stupid harmless fun on paper. Performing is another matter. This short did not even cause a chuckle from me. I never really thought I would say this, but “Night of the Day of Dawn Son of the Bride Return of Terror Attack Evil, Mutant, Alien, Food Flesh, Hell, Zombified Living Dead, part 2:“ In Shocking 2-D ”was a VERY best parody and not so lame or boring. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
