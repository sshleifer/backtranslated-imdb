Rarely have I witnessed such a waste of talent. There is almost nothing to say about this hopeless swamp of the film. The few interesting moments that the film seems to promise initially turn out to be a little more than red herring. High-level actors - Robert Duval, Robert Downey Jr. - are involved in roles that do not lead; the director of the casual genius makes a film that looks like it is being shot through a camera-dyed coffee lens; the writer (John Grisham), who never created anything worthy, discovers new depths of unsatisfied inconsistency. The film has a cheap, lewd feeling about it - but only at the comment level - it really is part of aesthetics. I usually go to IMDb to write balanced, generally grateful comments. This blatant disaster of a film simply makes me want to produce an endless, bilious rant. I will not, but only because I no longer want to occupy my “mind” with this garbage.
