I couldn't even bring myself to watch this movie to the end. I can not comment on the story, because I did not watch the whole movie, and the reason I could not watch it was because of the “actors”. First of all, for the most part they looked tough, and I am sure that their scenarios were in their hands just outside the frame - but this is a small problem. The main problem I faced with the actors is not really their fault ... whoever made this film! Come on, this film came out in 2003 ... I thought that the actors at the age of about twenty years to play teenagers went out of fashion with a new wave ?! I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines from an adult person is older than me - "I am 17 years old!" How can you take it seriously? Do not become a victim of this film, go for a walk for 90 minutes, and you will get much more than this film can give.
