RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A prisoner, a long-time prisoner (Kurupt), is transferred to a harsher prison than re-opened Alcatraz. He argues that this should be closer to his lady, but his real motives are a little more grand. There he intersects with Burke (Bill Goldberg), a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite the fact that he is less muscular, the same chatty and almost the same. But a gangster war broke out between black and Hispanic prisoners, which escalated into a hostile takeover of the prison, when the black gang leader was shot and his finger pointed at Burke. But shit really hits fans when the real killer and Latin American leader Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twit’s girlfriend and daughter Burke as a hostage. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not make sequels (reportedly, very much in contrast to the idea of ​​Under Siege 2, and agreed to do so only on the condition that the film company in which he was at that time allowed her to make his own film) so, despite the fact that this is a continuation of the DVD, the main role this time goes to Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear in some shots from the first film, which will appear closer to the end.) But there is a reason why he did not do a lot of work with since Universal Soldier 2, and this is because he is not very an actor, and not so and a lot in the battle star, controlling a character who starts to seem very gloomy and thoughtful, but clumsily turns into a standard action movie, awkwardly falling out of boring odnostrochnikov. Wise assistants, veterans from the first film, Curupt and Tony Plana, simply took advantage of the chance for extra work. <br /> <br /> This is a film that tried to copy the original style well enough, with dim lighting, dark shadows and rap playing in all of this. He does it quite well, unfortunately, he cannot fight with a restless hero, an equally cardboard villain and an indifferent story, which the creators seem to have come up with, inventing. **
