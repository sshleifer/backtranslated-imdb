"Problem child" - one of the most stupid films ever made. This is not the worst (although some people will not agree with me about this), but not the best either. This is a devilish 7-year-old boy who destroys the comic chaos of a childless couple (John Ritter, Amy Yasbek) who foolishly adopts him. This film is too stupid and unbelievable, because I do not buy for a second so that the child can behave as clumsily as the child in this film. It's silly and ridiculous, although I laughed a few times (I really don't know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know that I am too kind to this. If there is one positive trait in The Problem Child, then this is better than a sequel, which was just awful. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
