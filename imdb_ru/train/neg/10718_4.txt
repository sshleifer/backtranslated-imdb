Come on, Tina Fey, you can do it better. As soon as the film began, I knew how it would end. Of course, sometimes it was funny. Even laughing out loud is ridiculous. But not enough laughter to save this film. I do not recommend buying it. At best, I recommend renting it, but that's all. Baby Mom has a few funny scenes, but she is predictable and she does not manage to get the spiritual ending she is aiming for. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poulher both succeeded in this, and they succeeded in it. But this is not there the best. Mom Baby was a great cast. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the majesty of the actors. <br /> <br /> Another film about pregnancy got into the world of cinema. After excellent Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very average in comparison. Knocked Up and Juno are funny, heartbreaking and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. The ending "Mommies" was not funny and boring. <br /> <br /> “Baby Mom” was not the best comedy of the year, and this is not happening. I recommend it, but do not expect it to be completely fun. Expect an average comedy that does not give a lot of emotional ending that she is trying to have. I give Baby Mommy ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
