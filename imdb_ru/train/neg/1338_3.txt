I saw a change of goals .. twice .... and always the same feeling ... you see how the Olsen twins shoot the same movie .... they like to play different sports, and then fall in love boys .. Okay, now about the film .... first of all, all such little boys and girls do not play for such big goals ... 2. football does not play on time-outs ... 3. if the game comes to an end , the judge gives extra time (a minute or more) ... and the finish is foreseen .... I think that this film is bad due to the lack of football knowledge .... if it were made by Europe the producers would be better .. and also the mane actors are not the best choice ... they suffer from a lack of authenticity ... Well, they played several seasons in a full house, but that doesn't make them big stars ... you should show your talent. ... and this is what the Olsen twins lack
