This is the worst movie I've ever seen !! There was nothing good to say about this movie. I've seen some bad movies, but this one is shooting. There is no plot, and most of the film you either rewind ahead to make the film faster, or you wonder what is happening, because you can't seriously think that someone thought about this film, and you watch it. I feel sorry for those who had to go through this agonizing hour and a half. Please accept my advice and DO NOT WATCH this film, because I know that you will think that this is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life.
