I'm going to record as the second person who, after many years of using IMDb to watch movies, was motivated by the film Nacho, "Abandoned", to create an account and leave a comment. It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. The plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the "pieces of the puzzle" did not develop. The game was ridiculous, and the letter was embarrassing. How this film was supported and became completely outside of me. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille, who was sly and repetitive, using the word f. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the opportunity to see this film again or to be disfigured by wild bores, I would face a difficult decision. I am disappointed that I can not give him 0 stars.
