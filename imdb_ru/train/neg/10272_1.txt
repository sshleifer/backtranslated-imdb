When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought it sounded really interesting ... so ... my mom threw it into a stack of movies in the $ 4 section on Blockbuster. When we returned home and starred in the movie ... twenty minutes later we found ourselves turning to each other, saying, “This sucks. Let's add something else. ” I admit, a few lines from friends in the cafe made us smile a little. But come on, at least get decent actors! From time to time in a movie, if the acting is bad and the movie does not go painfully slow and actually seems interesting, I can let it out of my head and laugh at how they ended up (or under Make my lines. But I can only so many. The crying scenes looked like the actors were hysterical laughing, their scenes were not delivered ... lovers don't even come close to filming this film. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came here to say that this the film must have been good on some really good ones drugs when they watched the film. This is the most senseless thing I have ever experienced the displeasure of watching. DO NOT LOOK OR BUY THIS MOVIE !!!!!
