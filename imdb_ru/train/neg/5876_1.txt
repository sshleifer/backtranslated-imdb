I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class, and, unfortunately, I chose this version. Everything from acting skills (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to camera shots (all medium or close-up shots ... no shots with decorations and a very small background in the frames) were absolutely terrible. I watched it during my spring break, and it’s safe to say that I feel that I didn’t have 114 minutes of vacation. Not recommended for all loads.
