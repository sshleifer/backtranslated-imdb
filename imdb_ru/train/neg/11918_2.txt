It seemed like a good film, I thought it would be a good film, and throughout the film I was hoping that it would be a meaningful use of my time, and yes, I have to admit that Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval talent for acting is really laudable, but despite all the efforts, this film cannot effectively convey a meaningful message, which seems to have been what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The final point becomes short-lived, and after everything that happens, the final seemed unsatisfactory; a bit like real life in this respect, but films, unlike real life, end after about 2 hours, and the final should leave the audience satisfied if this really was the directorâ€™s intention. In this respect, this is not enough, and it disappoints me the most. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that bothered me was the national stereotyping of American characters - they all seem to be cut from one block. It seems to me that most of the American characters in Indian-English films are based on how the Indians themselves perceive the Americans, and it is clear that no attempt was made to convey to the American a sense of depth or complexity. /> <br /> These two aspects, taken together, create a frustrating story.
