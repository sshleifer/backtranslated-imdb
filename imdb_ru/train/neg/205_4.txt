I did not miss the chance to watch this film without a break and continuously, remembering about it and delighted. But wherever he seemed really scary, he retreated and went somewhere else. Dripping water all over the house, black rain, prophetic dreams taking a wrong turn in the dirty sewage, were thrown back before they could scream. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. The almost inexpressive mask of Chamberlain’s face expressed a slight but perplexed distrust, something I discovered that was reflected when the film was put on. What could be creepy aboriginal singing and instruments in the background, instead, was a cacophony, seemingly designed to strike terror in the head. Ideas that modern people can embody the ancient gods, that aboriginal peoples believe that redheaded white people were the first priests, and many other opportunities are passed on as a shopping list than as a hint in another dimension (dream time). br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene I did not understand what the director was trying to say. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? Tsunami? C'mon It's destructive, but not apocalyptic. Is this the end of the world? With a wave? The last wave? It must be a damn big wave. What for? Was the world such a bad place? In this film, it did not look so terrible. In fact, I did not think that the wave had gone, because the shadow left Burton’s face, which was thrown off by the wave. Was this just the Burton apocalypse? Hell, this happens every day to people who lose it. It was not interesting if it was just him. <br /> <br /> The most frightening scene that best reflects Weyr's potential was in Charlie’s apartment, where Burton went to confront the old one. a man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him "Who are you?" and it becomes really disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the film never followed suit.
