Another one of many nearly forgotten films released by Poor Roe in the 1930s, resurrected by DVD magic. <br /> <br /> Star Reserve Universal player Lionel Atville (often a supporting actor in many films about Frankenstein), twins are involved in the murder. One kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in fraud) and asks witnesses about the exact time, while the other is deaf and turns out to be “innocent” because he could not talk to witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where would it fall apart, if it was congenital deafness, wouldn't they both be deaf? Oh, OK. <br /> <br /> Atville does a pretty good job here, pretending to be deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one here can act so damn.
