Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, thinking it would be crazy bloody fun. That's what it is, without fun. This film is really meaningless, it does not have any plot, character development or any storyline. The main problem with this film is murder and blood. In fact, every murder looks exactly the same. Zombies tear someone apart. Yes, everything is fine, but you also need the original murder. I mean, it was really unfortunate; every murder looked exactly the same, filmed the same way. That's what killed me. I love blood, and the blood in this film did nothing for me. It was just boring. No storyline, just the same lame scene over and over with another person. I also wanted this movie. I love to make films about bloody videos ... like Redneck zombies. But I could not deceive myself. This film has its advantages, but none of this is in the film. I understand that many of the zombies helped with the flood, and there were about 100 zombies, and itâ€™s great that they attracted so many people and helped in the world. But overall this is a terrible movie.
