As a lesbian, I am always looking for films about gays and lesbians. However, with such crap - that would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story that will evolve, or just to make some sense. Neither happened. It was just meaningless scenes, not related to anything. The film failed to convey any story or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense, I just turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this absurdity. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and it doesn't even deserve it.
