This relic of the short film begins with the adolescent going through the process of obtaining a driver's license. It is quickly distracted from almost all conceivable topics related to cars. <br /> <br /> Such things as dune buggies, drag racing, custom painting works and car shows are discussed. It often tries to be humorous, but instead the film is boring, drawn out and even sexist from time to time. None of the people in the movie actually heard. Instead, everything is done in narration and voice acting. Sorry, but I hate it. <br /> <br /> In "Dad, can I borrow a car?" There is nothing instructive or interesting. It's just another piece of meaningless filler that takes time on their TV show “Wonderful World Of Disney.” 1/10
