All in all, this is one of the five worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not that they didn't try. There was something decent, with some elements of the structure, a good cast, a good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements may have been a poor structure and no significant history, much overplayed with leadership (which is probably very much better when holding back), some bad direction and editing. After about an hour I had enough, I pulled out my hair in about an hour and a half and was very excited for an hour and fifty minutes. In all of this was insincerity: I went with someone who used to be a drug addict. He was thrilled that it fascinated something that had nothing good to do. This was supported by a pretty 17-year-old girl who was in love with a 30-year-old drug addict. <br /> <br /> And the crazy nature of the leader was pretty disgusting. There were clumsy conspiracy points that were an attempt to create a structure, but the end result was sluggish and endless (with uneven time lines). The characters were bright, but without end, which made me feel bad because of the quality actors that you simply didnâ€™t see. <br /> <br /> Skip this. I assumed that it was the first director who was fascinated by his own emotions, but he did it before. I am puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will really give them money.
