Well, at first this film seemed pretty good, although it moved rather quickly, and although they only had a budget of 60,000 dollars, that would be good, but if you found your sister dead in the lake and found out who could kill her, why will you chase him around and pull a pistol at him with only one bullet and waste it and eventually run away from all the retarded and kill yourself? Plus, after you found your sister dead in the lake, found a clue and found out who the killer was, why don't you give this clue to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the film, when she behaves like her sister, who was a waitress, and she talks to the bad guy she was supposed to meet somewhere and recorded that she died and what happened to her "proof." I do not know, I was not pleased with the final. This film could be much better if it lasted longer, and the acting was better, and if the final was not so bad! Do not waste your money on this film, because if you do this, you will also write a review here and you will not be happy.
