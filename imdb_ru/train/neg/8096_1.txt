Most of the book adaptations are bad, but this film did not take into account the key parts of the plot and changed the description and some of the characters. They rewrote the storyline and merged the scenes and changed the order. They added to it ridiculous things that never happened in a book and never would have happened. <br /> <br /> If I hadn’t read the book in advance, it would have been an incredibly boring movie, you wouldn’t care. about characters, like them or not like them. This makes the characters a joke. <br /> <br /> Awful. <br /> <br /> Funny. <br /> <br /> Loss of two hours of my life.
