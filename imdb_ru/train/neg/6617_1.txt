Really shows that the hype is not all. Shows that the crappy actor Abhishek and only gets films because of his father and his wife. Amitabh is hard as always. Ajay Devgan is shitty and useless as always, and the new guy is a joke. The leading lady is such an actor waste. Such a pathetic film from such a respected director and from such a big industry. With such films, I reduced the number of Bollywood films that I watch. <br /> <br /> RGV has been making very crappy movies for a long time. Time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol. Any other leading lady wants to be half-naked. Pffffft.
