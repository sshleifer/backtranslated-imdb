Watching “Der himmel über Berlin” as a teenager at the end of the 80s was a deep experience for me - “that could be in the movies”. Along with "Paris, Texas" and "Until the End of the World," he still holds a special place in my heart and mind - evidence of the genius of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in recent years, the steady decline in the quality of his work with the Million Dollar Hotel and Land of Plenty has hit a terrible low point. Gone are the fascinating paintings or music. No search or display great understanding. All that remains is the characters and subtly veiled political statements that are reduced only to cliches and frankly mock the intellect of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Is it well dried up? Regardless of the reason, it’s time for Mr. Wenders to either strengthen it or stop it completely.
