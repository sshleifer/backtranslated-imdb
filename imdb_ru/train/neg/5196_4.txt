Although technically it is a bit more polished than the previous film from the series Bulldog Drummond Escumps, it is a weaker escapade for both the plot, which is less exciting and leading, which simply does not have Ray Milimâ€™s charisma. <br /> <br /> However, several actors and characters continue to fulfill their roles and manage to support the flag. Also present is John Barrymore, appearing throughout the film in various outlandish guises. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is another endless night for BD, when he and his colleagues are pursuing, trying to save the poor girl he intends to save is getting married. The clues are stupid, but again the support actors often make them interesting.
