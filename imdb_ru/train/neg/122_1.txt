I would put it in the first place on my list of films in the category of garbage, which can not be seen! There are films that are bad, but the worst are those that cannot be watched, but you must love them, because they must be useful to you! Sexual sequences, so shocking at one time, could not even call a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strictly a high school of sophomores of amateur night Marxism. The film is a shy art in the worst sense of the word. Photo in sharp grainy black and white. Some scenes are not focused or taken at the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! Do some people call this art? <br /> <br />
