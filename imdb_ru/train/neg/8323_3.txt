From the very beginning this film had several flaws. The main character, played by Hayden Christensen, is a rich young tycoon who inherited the considerable wealth and power of his father, and he struggles to both fill his father’s shoes and cut the aprons that the mother (and co-performer) holds too tight. He also has a problem with his heart condition and suspense in limbo, which is a registry of organ donors. There are minor stories that your first instinct should ignore, which become important later, such as his friendship with the surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his affair with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Uncreative storylines, but not bad enough to spoil the movie. The only real "oh wei!" The moment was the name of the character Lena Olin. An imperious woman named Lilith ... thin! <br /> <br /> Surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciated that people who find the surgery scenes could not. The horror of waking during anesthesia at first went well. You see in emotional agony when Christensen screams inward through a chest incision and rib dilator. The moment of irony from the trailers comes when he is one of the few unlucky people who do not sleep during anesthesia, and he is also lucky that it helps him to know that his surgical team is planning to kill him. <br /> <br /> The big turn, however, is very predictable and makes the film go deeper into the plot and his memories of the small signs that were there, but he, like us, initially missed. <br /> <br /> In the end there are two more turns concerning his relationship with his mother. One of them is Olin’s impressive gesture, which seems unimpressive due to poor writing. Another is the secret of the family’s past, which looked very confused and meaningless. <br /> <br /> The initially well-made drama of anesthesia awareness is lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama. There is one last attempt to bring him back, which failed, taking with him the entire film.
