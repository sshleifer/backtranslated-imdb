Lou's gospel was a great disappointment to me. I received an e-mail from the theater, which showed that it was a great and inspirational film. It was neither great nor inspiring. The cinematography was rather dubious with the entire film. Many scenes were flashbacks that were made in such a way that sometimes they could not tell what they were about. Voices were often distorted for no reason. Also, many people in the film were contrived. The relationship he has with his ex and son is never cleared up. In addition, the entire film has the most of his one path, and then suddenly BAM, he healed and inspires people. The whole film seems to show that boxing is one of the things that badly affect his life, forcing him to live as he lives, but when he changes, he does not leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. Thumbs down.
