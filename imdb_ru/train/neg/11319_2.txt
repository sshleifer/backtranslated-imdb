Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use people's blood as fuel, but there will be a change of power thanks to the renegade android (Chris Christopherson) and the female warrior (Catley Long) when they fight against Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (who plays cyborg in film). Of all the questions left unanswered by this terrible film, the most pressing is whose idea was to present country singer Chris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior, capable of giving as much as he gets, No, don't get me wrong, I could see Christopherson as a vigil or something else, but not a cyborg. It is strange to suspect that it was written for Dolph Lundgren, however Lundgren should have had the wisdom to avoid this. However, despite the catastrophic actors, Christopherson is the most enjoyable thing in the film. He gives a presentation much more humane than the inexpressive Katie Long. (And Christofferson plays a robot), despite the blunder, Christofferson provides some interesting points. Lance Henriksen slumbers, and Gary Daniels is wasted, but mostly knights confuse failure. You step back in horror, wondering who the hell thought it was even a good idea on paper. (This is a film where the dismembered Christofferson fights with the robots in a backpack). Worst of all, it ends with a continuation of “what if,” fortunately, this has not yet happened, although I still have nightmares under the assumption of the probability of such an event. ” br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
