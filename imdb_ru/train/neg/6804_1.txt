It must be one of the 5 worst films ever made. The plot looked intriguing, like Passenger 57. But with the last film, he somehow worked much better. The plot was designed in the worst possible way. Just a few of the horrible moments in the film: a flight attendant standing in the open doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being pulled in by the wind 250 miles per hour? After that, the plane lands from a distance of several miles, starting at 8,000 feet, which is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. On the runway (of course, right) she is instructed to pull the flaps, OH! Come to flaps to ensure lifting at low speeds, when on the runway you use reverse thrust on engines and give maximum power! I can continue to talk about small and mostly big mistakes in the film, but then my answer will be the size of an English dictionary. This is the movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
