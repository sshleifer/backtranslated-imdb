Question: How does a bourgeois director relate to a topic like immigration? Answer: turning it into a parable about existential estrangement. <br /> <br /> Yes, we returned in the early 90s, immediately after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the subsequent flood of immigrants in the European Union, and what better way to solve this problem than making a film about an existentially alienated middle class journalist , existentially alienated politics of the upper class, his existentially alienated rich wife, etc. <br /> <br /> In the background Immigrants seek political asylum in an unnamed Greek village near the borders. I suppose that in this way Angelopoulos may show some social awareness in dealing with existentially concerned upper classes. I mean, honestly, the scene where a high-ranking army officer curses his fate for sending his daughter to study in London is enough to throw up. <br /> <br /> In any case, it cannot be so bad. In the end, Angelopoulos is a master of cinematographic art, right? Wrong. It is at this point that his manners become too artificial, like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks appear: blurry windows, blurry lights, a strange wedding, a walk along the river bank and people with yellow water-cloaks. Mastroianni also opens up new opportunities for most sleepwalkers. Avoid really. Go to his early films.
