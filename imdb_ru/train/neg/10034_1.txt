If there is one film that is the worst this year, this is TASHAN. The first promo showed that the movie would be a boring Dhoom 2 movie, and I knew first that it would be a bad movie, whatever it was because It was a Yasraj movie. Or maybe I saw a stupid promo. But this film shocked me, it was even worse than Dhoom 2, and what I expected was the introduction of First Saif, which is boring. Then meeting Saif-Kareena. oh dear, what is he doing in such a strange film? What is this role? What is he doing? His first scene is fine, but then his action becomes repetitive, and he replays. Then Akshay appeared, who provided some good scenes, but then the film became more boring and with all outdated things. Children's novel, overdose of children's scenes in the style of Rajnikant and all boring scenes. The ending is another joke. <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would get 3 more films for directing, if this film worked, that’s the strategy of Yasraj, only money, nothing more. So Vijay is another addition to their list. Crap filmmakers Music (Vishal Shekhar) ordinary <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar’s performances appear in the film as a breath of fresh air, he actually gives some interesting moments, annoys Saif Ali Khan, Karina is equally bad, Anil Kapoor is outrageous and spoils the show even more
