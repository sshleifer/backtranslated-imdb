This is a normal film, but it lacks any depth emotionally or in terms of storytelling. <br /> <br /> History is based on real events, and it practically does not limit the number of actions, and also does not create real expectations. <br /> <br /> Washington is plausible in the lead, but he sleeps walking through it, there is no way to bend any acting muscles for him or the cast. <br /> <br /> The story simply collapses a small apartment, without even hearing about the title character, the ending was obvious, but unlike other films about such injustice, this film has no emotional influence, it does not care, and those who help from outside seem more academic than to worry about his well-being. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy, whom the hero worships Carter, but this seems forced. <br /> <br /> This is a normal film, but instantly forgotten,
