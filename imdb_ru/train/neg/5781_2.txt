Roman Polanski has made many, many films that are exceptional. His fame confuses me. Nothing stands out like Chinatown (I did not see the Knife in the Water or the Tess). Any contribution he made to the film was made more than twenty years ago; his work is simply awkward, safe and / or boring (“Pianist”, “Mad”, “Oliver Twist”, “Ninth Gate”, “Pirates”). <br /> <br /> “Child R” was supposed to mark the end of the institution at the time of its appearance. of. This is a luxurious and rather high concept for a 1968 horror movie (never show a child). But this is just the wrong horror juice. Everything is to such an extent that the storyline becomes hopelessly clear very early (hmm, thanks for this destructive headline), and on a clear day you can see how the end of the spin comes in a few days. This did not support my interest. I find that, whatever this film may be, it is completely ripped off by the femininity version of the 1960s. Farrow is such a chronically distracted helpless housewife. Her weakness is oversold ... she is annoying to the extreme. There are no real ideas in this ... there’s nothing to think about except being the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> Dakota is almost never used due to its eerie potential.
