Bodrey Demerill (weak Peter Fonda, who also led), an aging player, defeats the young teenager Wanda “Nevada” (pretty, but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together, the unlikely couple (of course) begins the search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is a story, and there is no need to look for a deeper meaning in it. It's just not there. The acting game is also very weak, which was quite unexpected, given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this film, take a look at the beautiful scenery and some beautiful looks of the young Brooke Shields. However, her character is so annoying (especially at the beginning) and dull that she never looks so sexy or attractive. It is a pity, but, given the story, I doubt that anything else can be done from this. I wonder why Peter Fonda starred and starred in this film? He must have even persuaded his father (Henry Fonda) into a (useless) cameo of this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, it was their only film together. Can't Henry be in EASY RIDER, for example? 3/10
