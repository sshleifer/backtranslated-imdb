Interestingly, the novel without a plot became the basis for two films. While the “Heiress” was a good, if not completely accurate, adaptation, Washington Square is tough and poorly played, except for the role of Dr. Sloper, a film that could be much better. <br /> <br /> The director’s attempts to make “beautiful” scenes were so obvious that I actually cringed. There is not one understated and simple beauty that a film without a plot can have, such as Onegin. I agree with other comments that Lee portrayed Catherine as an idiot, not naive and shy; she made me despise that she does not feel for her. <br /> <br /> Katherine’s transition from children's trust in adult cynicism, the whole point of the story, was learned as it was in the novel. But we lack the narrative voice to say this in the film! I think someone missed an adaptation lesson in film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director’s attempts to make a touching and beautiful film from complex text, but it simply didn’t work.
