I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things that I thought could be improved; acting skills, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the authors had no idea what was related to the film. Obviously, in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy an ultramodern stealth bomber that could become completely invisible for $ 75 million. Currently, these things cost about 3 billion dollars, and they can not remain invisible. Apparently, you can fly from the USA to the Middle East within an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I did not mind, but it looked like an unsuccessful attempt to attract more guys to see it. The camera will randomly magnify the actors and move on to random scenes. Oh yeah, since this is a film about Steven Seagal, it is predictable as hell. Overall, I rate it right there with Snakes on the plane.
