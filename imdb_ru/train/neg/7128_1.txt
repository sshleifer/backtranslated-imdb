I'm a dumb person for renting a REDLINE DVD. Chicago Pictures that filmed this stupid film never paid the Palisades Media Group to buy web advertisements on various automotive sites, including mine, on ALEXA 16K rating. They pulled me off a deal, and now I lost $ 16,000, and they wasted most of my personal time (Peter Rapport from Palisades Media), you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this movie !!! It sucks, and the people behind it are robbing artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a group of losers and bad actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
