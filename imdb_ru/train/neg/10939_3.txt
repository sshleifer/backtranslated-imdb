In this film, one of the worst acts I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as nails going through the floor. This nail trap catches these bad guys. The rest of the film gets worse as you go. I can not believe that this film is not even included in the hundreds of best films of all time. I also can not believe that there is a continuation! The next crappy movie I want to see is R.O.T.O.R. Can R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than that? <br /> <br />
