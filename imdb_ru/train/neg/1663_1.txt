First of all, this conspiracy is too exaggerated - the girl wants to do it, everyone loves her, the snobber intervenes, everyone looks lost, the girl pulls on herself, everyone loves her again, and so on. D. The heroine, as well as problems with one parent, and this is so it is predictable that you can practically read it together. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they continue to ignore classical music. They send out a message stating that everyone who is involved in classical music is excited, snobbish and not far away - in fact, I don’t remember exactly the quote, but I remember that in one place of the film Holly says: “Why are they so alarmed .. so classic? "It's really insulting when I call classical music that way. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I went through it dozens of times, but the only reason I can come up with this film is the promotion of Britney Spears. it just doesn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> And yes, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure if it was really her singing or not) had a good enough voice, it wasn’t that amazing as they did, especially when she was on a belt. She always supported. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
