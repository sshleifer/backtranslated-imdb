This movie is terrible! He competes with Ishtar in the number of embarrassingly unsuccessful moments. I would rate it below 3 if not for a couple of funny lines; but, in general, this film was crap! Looks like they did it over the weekend at some bankrupt resort. Joe Roth must join Elaine May forever!
