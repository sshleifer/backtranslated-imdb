I actually paid to watch this movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> He would get 1 rating, but the fight scenes between the robots are fine, and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I understand that some films have a larger budget than others. I have no problem with this. Unfortunately, science fiction films are likely to suffer the most with a small budget for obvious reasons. But one of the reasons this film fails is that almost every part of each set looked stupid and cheap. I mean, couldn't they make him look good? <br /> <br /> Another main reason this movie is terrible is the game. If I watched the movie now and knew what to expect, I could just enjoy it because of the cheese factor, but at the time I was expecting a good movie and had no idea how horrible it really would be. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this experience ended in just 85 years. minutes
