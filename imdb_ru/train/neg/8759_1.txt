What for? Why did they make this film? If Timothy Olyphant had not been in it shirtless several times, there would have been absolutely no reason to watch this movie, ever. Um ... earth? Nope Clearly defined characters? Nope The only time I laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of all this bangs. Postscript Andy Dick? Nope
