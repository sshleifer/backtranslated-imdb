I did not feel as if I had been raped, as I did with PRE-CHRISTMAS, but BELLE'S MAGIC WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY and Beast. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, although not to that extent. It's ugly, uncanonical, idiotic, and the letter is terribly bad. None of the stories work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB, but a bunch of people. I wanted to disassemble it, but after a few minutes I gave up, because no one in their right mind would take this hassle seriously. We have three stories. The “Perfect Word” is a powerful, hard study of forgiveness. “Madness of Fifi” only works if you can accept that Babette is actually called Fifi and that she is a secretive James Bond and Lumiere is an idiot against women. The Broken Wing (or Broken Wind, as I like to call it) is probably the most disgusting of all. Does the beast hate birds? Since when? Do not watch this shit - every copy of this video deserves cremation. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and the human soul.
