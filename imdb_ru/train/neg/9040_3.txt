I agree that although this Melville story simply cannot be revealed, it is not even a credible attempt. Carrying history into the 20th century simply resent the intent and nature of the original history; Perhaps you could transport it to England, but it should be a historical work. Even our narrator - the owner - tells about it in the memories, going back further, somewhere around 1800. By the end of the 19th century, a strangely disobedient worker would have been thrown out without thought. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me an abusive remote break !!! Even around 1800, this behavior did not work very well, considering the end. And the end of the movie? I do not know what it was, because I did not watch the whole parody - I had to stop. It was like the production of A Streetcar Named Desire in Elizabethan England.
