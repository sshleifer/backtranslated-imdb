San Francisco is a big city with great acting titles. In this film, the creators did not try to use the city. They did not even cope with the most basic realistic details. Therefore, I would not recommend it to anyone because it is a film from San Francisco. You will not think "oh, I was there," you will think "how did a two-story fire trap / stinky armpit become a quiet hotel lobby?" Some of them used speech styles and affects of the east coast. It is a distraction, but acting has always been competent. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed to be shot in three different styles, at least in the beginning. The history of Chinatown was the most spectacular and interesting. The plot is weak, jagged scene behind the scenes from cool Hong Kong action movies. The originals had much more tension and emotional resonance, they were decorated and developed better. But the game is fun, and we see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the white boy was pointless. I think the filmmakers didn’t know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and shortened it. The father is a strange attempt by a liberal from Berkeley - really, guys, everyone knows that living in the ghetto is not “cool”, but its segments are the funniest. They threw away some good opportunities. Formed and embittered on the West Coast, the yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they do in New York. They are equally unbearable, but always distinguishable. It would be interesting; it was not like that. <br /> <br /> The introduction of “The Hunter's Point” was the most disappointing. It was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco. You saw how it was done before, and you saw that it was done better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite a common non-local and pointless scenario, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting is starting to break through in an awkward direction ... about ten minutes before the final. Good concept placed in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.
