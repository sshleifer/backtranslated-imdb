ALL FOR LOVE (as it was called when it was broadcast on the weekend) is a romantic historical drama featuring Captain Saint-Quince, a French officer in Napoleon’s army, captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where he meets and falls in love with a young girl who visits a prison. There is also a murder storyline. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and admit that the film didn’t carry me away because I don’t really like periodic dramas and the script feels a bit episodic, but I’ll say that it was well played by all the participants and he has a good cast with Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The costume design, as you might expect, is also excellent. <br /> <br /> I would be very surprised if this film did not receive any complaints after the BBC2 broadcast on the tea party. Captain St. Ives lies in bed with a prostitute, where her nipple is completely exposed, and there is a bathing scene for French prisoners, which includes the full frontal naked body of a man, not to mention the murder scene, where blood is clearly visible. You really have to worry if the BBC planners have any key to understanding what they are doing.
