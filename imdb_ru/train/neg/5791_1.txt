As a professor of Russian cinema, I can honestly say that this is probably one of the worst films with native content I've ever seen. I would rather get a root channel than watch this movie again. The use of stereotypes, non-creative attempts to use fragments of traditional stories about coyotes and bad cinematography has only been exacerbated by an indecent plot and a bad script. The author and director demonstrated the worst sides of the colonized approach to portraying indigenous people and communities. If this man is dear, he needs to go home and apologize to everyone he knows for being an apple, as well as for their racism and bad sense of humor. If this person is not a native, he needs to seriously review his white privileges and ask himself whether they are exploring uninvestigated, unintended racism or intentionally uninformed. My only hope is that the local actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to watch good native movies, check out: Christmas in the clouds, Dance in the street, Healing river, Pawou Highway, Smoke signals ... and these are just some of them.
