Nicole Eggert was named as the star of this, despite the fact that Michelle Dorn and Stacy Keach were much bigger stars than she. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a bit cool in the film “Aliens Earth on Earth”. Eggert plays a girl who regrets that the military are stalking the Alien and accepts the hiding creature in her very sexy disguise. A bit of nudity and partial nudity, a meaningless sex scene - it all happens throughout the journey. <br /> <br /> The film tells about several obvious scenes and jokes about showing photos. I really liked the jokes from Star Trek when Michael Dorn was captured, and he got a really cool death scene. <br /> <br /> It was quite obvious that Stacy Keach was going to be captured, and the film had a rather weak end, it would be nice to show what kind of talent the newcomer gave to Eggert.
