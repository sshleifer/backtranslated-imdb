I am not going to approach and criticize RAW theories. I mean, this is a site about films and about whether the film is well shot or well done, and not the philosophy of discussions on the site. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this video really explodes. This is one shot from RAW after another. Some of this is archived video, so you can see how it has aged over the years, and this is pretty cool. But, for the rest, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous. <br /> <br /> This is a strange comparison, but I kept thinking about the Sunday, when I watched the star car Barbra Streisand (Funny Lady * (another very bad movie)). After some time I was so obsessed with Barbra that I continued to wish that there was one scene in which she would not appear: you know, â€œin the meantime, the other characters in the film were busy with something else ... "Moment. But it was all about Barbra. Well, this is a RAW video * Funny lady *. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to have a good time, look at several points of view and perspective of the person RAW, while he chatters with his theories, collected in a lame structure, which does not cause any interest. or understanding, then be my guest. For me, I could not take it after 20 minutes.
