A perfect murder breaks down when the wife (played by Mary Ellen Traynor, once the wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who led this episode), kills her husband with the help of poker, has the misfortune to take a visitor when she is going to move the body outside .. escaped a mad madman, dressed in a Santa Claus costume (played by the cunningly disgusting Larry Drake). She is fighting for her life, trying to find a way to hide the body of her husband. She decides to use the ax as soon as she knocks down Santa's killer, who misses several chances to chop off a woman's head in order to substitute the killer for killing her husband. Santa's killer locks her in the closet and pursues the woman’s daughter when she tries desperately to free herself to save the child. <br /> <br /> This episode of TALE FROM CRYPT simply recycles tired material, including the old “Santa Killer” theme, while also adding the often used (add nausea) woman-murder-her-husband-for-man-she-cheating -s-a routine. In fact, Trenor is trying to find a way to avoid falling into the dead body, which she kills, and at the same time keeps a safe distance from the maniac. There is nothing refreshing or new in this story, which largely goes through the movements. Not one of the highlights of the show.
