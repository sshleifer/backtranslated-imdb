This sad little film bears little resemblance to the 1971 Broadway revival, which was such a “nostalgic” hit. Keep in mind that when Bert Shevelov presided over this awakening, he carefully rewrote the book. I have a feeling that this screenwriter has also changed a lot compared to the original 1925 version. I played "innocent philander" Jimmy Smith on the stage in 1974 and thought that this $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. No chance. Even the expected enjoyment of Roland Young playing “My” role of “Topper” was a great disappointment. There are three songs left from the performance, and they are written very badly. Even the classic duet "Tea For Two" is a virtual solo. Many familiar faces in this fiasco of 1940 are not at all proud of themselves, and the star Anna Neagl is simply embarrassed. When I feel cheated by spending a dollar, I know that a movie must be bad. Another commenter mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called “Tea for Two,” and is dedicated to staging the play (of course, the original), so those who are looking for a real No, not Nanette, can find a more recognizable version. there.
