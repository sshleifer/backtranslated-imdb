The text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to penetrate our home, but I think the more appropriate word is entropy. My God, what a dude, these two! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive house in Tiburon, and his wife and child in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke in the role of Jackson and Colleen Camp in the role of Donna) knock on his door, asking for directions. Well, it rains and they tremble like two drenched kittens, and they are not sure of the address they are looking for, and that with one and the other, George invites them to come and take part in his pizza by the fire. All three fall into George's bath, and within about five minutes undifferentiated nudity mostly occurs with double exposure, triple exposure, four-fold exposure and dodecatch exposure. They spend the night together, and the next morning the girls prepare breakfast for him. But something became a little impertinent, because Georgie’s guests squeezed everything with their fingers, poured ketchup and syrup all over their laundry, and “You eat like ANIMALS!” George exclaims and tells them to go out. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an unusually beautiful young blonde with cobalt-blue eyes, and Colleen Camp bounces like a superbola. You have to say that they breed their mighty, handsome ones there in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke is from, and they also breed them with vigorous jerks that we cannot but notice after the first five or ten minutes. /> <br /> But when girls go crazy, then the movie, too. After that, the film is flooded with bright green light. The couple does horrible makeup and makes gargoyle faces in the mirror. They are brains courier, and then drown him to make sure. They scold the storm and smash the windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from each other, licking food and then jumping into each other's dice. <br /> <br /> And george? First, they put Georgie in an unconscious state with the help of a mace (in which there is nothing you cannot find in the little red bottle of Macaglény Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cupboard), tie him up, pour the flour and milk on him, put him to psychotic testing. with one of those semi-executions of Tolstoy, slap him in the face, put on strange costumes, then jump out on him and his almost destroyed middle-class house and send him with a delivery van out of the car. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it’s as if someone told Georgie: “At first, behave politely with these girls, then panic after they bind you.” And to the girls: “At first, behave yourself shyly, not wanting to impose anyone, and then behave like a madman.” And it's all. <br /> <br /> photos and place of work is straight from the 1970s porn movie. I'm not sure that this implies a complete lack of skills. It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco into a deformity. The score gives us two keynotes. Georgie is a pop melody with the words "be free" and "give up." Jackson and Donna are a memorable thing called "My good old dad." <br /> <br /> Though I endorse the moral lesson underlying the story. There are some things that you just should not give in, although at first glance they may seem very funny. Everything is very informative.
