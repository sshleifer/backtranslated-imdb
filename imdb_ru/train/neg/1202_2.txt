The dog found in the local kennel is associated with Satan and has litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family that has just lost its previous dog due to hitting and running. The puppy does not want to roam like Donald Trump, and dismiss the Mexican housekeeper, as festive. Only the father suspects that this canine is bigger than it appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic dog. So dad has to say day. <br /> <br /> In the late 70s, made for a television horror film, little would come of it, except for an inappropriate feeling of nostalgia. When I saw it in my childhood, I discovered that it was a tense nail puller, but, having looked at it to adults, I now understand that this is just lame, boring and not very good behavior. br / My rating: D
