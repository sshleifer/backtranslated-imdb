Like all horror fans, we all know that blind renting is crap. Sometimes we find a real jewel, but we often find that the film on which we just spent our hard earned money is nothing more than a putrid steamer, aggravated by completely undeserved enthusiastic reviews and awards of film festivals listed on the box. This is the case with “Five Eyes” (I’m sure that this double intention, which concerns both the budget of films and the coercion of anyone who watches it, can use all five fingers to stick their eyes out). <br /> <br /> The story, or at least what the authors of “um” think, goes at one end, talks about a group of teenage girls who unwisely decide to go for a walk in the wilderness late at night after coming out of a football match and attacking a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as a punishment for what, in her opinion, the girls found in her car after a slaughter on the roof in the parking lot of a gas station. <br /> <br /> In fairness, this is an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have very simple plot lines. It is in the performance of Five Across the Eyes that this idea fails. The film is trying to be something in between the Blair Project of the Witch with his shaky camera work and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in her bare approach to the material, but there can be neither one nor the other. Instead, we get redundant scenes of chase, torture, liberation; Pursue torture, release, in this order, for 94 minutes with long intervals of boredom, moans and rambling vagrancy, acting as a multitude of packings between chase episodes. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is incredibly grainy and dark, which in the best film could increase tension and realism. Here it is just annoying. Characters are not developed, and it is difficult for the viewer to find something to empathize with them. One character stops to get a first-aid kit, and begins to scratch her face, while shots are heard in the background, indicating that her friends are being killed. Another girl mumbles stupidly stupid phrases like "Don't go there, she will catch you, if she catches you, she will kill you, and if she kills you, you're dead." <br /> <br /> This was an award from Fangoria and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box that made me check it out. Talk about a fake orgasm! Perhaps my expectations would be met if it were in the comedy section. I'm all for a low-budget indie horror, but this pancake. Miss five eyes (or FATE; get?) Pass. <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 blow out of five /
