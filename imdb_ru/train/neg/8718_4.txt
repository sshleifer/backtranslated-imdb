In the third edition of the Carnosaur trilogy, there is a group of military commandos Keystone Kops trying to kill two velociraptors and T-Rex. I give him 4 of pure sympathy and my proximity to dinosaurs. The film is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really should not be taken seriously. More importantly, however, while watching this film, I cannot fail to notice some interesting parallels between the trilogies of "Carnosaur" and "Xtro". The first part in both franchises is a dark, disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an “alien”, and the third is a mocking, almost slap in the face (intentionally or not) film in which you roll on the floor laughing. Also, as in the Xtro franchise, all Carnosaur films are completely unrelated to each other. They carry only the name of the franchise to arouse interest in the “continuations”, I suppose. Obviously, there are two different production groups in Carnosaur and Xtro, but if you have seen all three films of both franchises, you find yourself switching from one to the other.
