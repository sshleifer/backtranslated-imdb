this film is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more visual than both, and not as good as both. It is also slow and rather predictable. He also has Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus shades, we get the effect of a new era added to the mix, and some of these scenes act as a motivating / inspiring sermon. in fact, this film is a jumble of almost everything. Even though it's terrible, the effects of the makeup do not look very realistic. in fact, they look pretty cheap. Besides all this, there is a really awful clich√©d dialogue. And I will not say when, but there is a moment when the pair of actions of the character was not genuine or believable, given the circumstances. No one in their right mind would do that. As soon as you watch the movie, you will understand what I mean. There is also some unwarranted nudity for the sake of nudity. It just wasn't necessary. The good news is that the acting was actually pretty good. Better than this film deserves s.so, after carefully weighing the evidence, I can say that this film was tolerable, but not good. My sentence for The Tooth fairy: 4/10
