This film starts very VERY slowly, but when the action finally begins, it is followed a little. I could not understand why certain events took place, and many events occurred before they were explained, which confused them a little. The only thing he has is a huge amount of blood / blood, which is, although in most cases there are not enough special effects. The blood is like a red Kool-Aid. The rupture of the skin sounds like someone stepping on a bunch of sticks. Again, the story has a kind of amateur feeling to it, as the author did not take long to perfect it. I feel that the film could be much better if the effects were made better and more time was spent on the script. I sincerely wish that I did not watch it not because of blood, but because I feel that I wasted 90 minutes of my life. If you like horrible movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
