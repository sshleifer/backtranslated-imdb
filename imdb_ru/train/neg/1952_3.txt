Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important and most disturbing thing in this attempt to rethink Scooby-Doo and company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy’s voice is raspy and doesn’t sound like it’s ever sounded like Scooby’s previous incarnations. They also changed the outfit and classic way of walking from the original. <br /> <br /> I’m not sure yet what they are talking about at the villain’s angle, but of course he doesn’t follow the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very fancy and distorted. I like it, but it's not a real Scooby-Doo type animation. But the weird animation used for other WB shows has grown on me; it can too. <br /> <br /> Worth a look - once - if you cope with the lack of a correct shaggy voice. This right is enough to break out of the enjoyment of the show properly. In addition, I try not to be an inflexible, picky fan. Develop or die, as they say. Let's see how it looks after two more episodes - by that time I will have a much more solid opinion.
