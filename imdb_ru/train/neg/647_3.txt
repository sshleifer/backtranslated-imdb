The acting was terrible as the script. It was poorly composed and made you almost want to laugh at several horribly staged murder scenes. The ending was even worse. Everyone was still dying, but somehow because of the final, everything looked as if everything was all right! They did not give enough stories about the obsession of the teacher, etc. The film took more time to develop the storyline. The only reason I put 3/10 is that I feel bad because of the young actors. They needed the best training. They could really make it a good movie, but the script and acting was failed miserably.
