Contrary to my principles, let me first come to a conclusion, because I just saw this work of art and still am deeply impressed. Readers are asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this film is absolutely terrible, and I would never write a word about it if it were not for the fact that “44 minutes” I feel sick to death, which rarely happens to me. The fact that I paid for it does not quite help me to feel better, and also the fact that the film deserves the appreciation of the users here. <br /> <br /> So what’s wrong with the movie? He has a fashionable name - "44 minutes." At first they remember “15 minutes”, which, by the way, is a much better film, but still bad in my book, and indeed, they can be compared to some extent. But, fortunately, the things they share are their worst characteristics. They both show Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who, with his strong Russian accent, apparently meets people's expectations and prejudices. His goal is to appeal to the mind of the cold war. Ah, we miss the good old days. I do not mean that he is a bad actor, I still have to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a real person here, he is more like an archetype. The way someone else can do these things is completely beyond my comprehension. We can recognize modern American xenophobia here. The meaning of the film, when Taktarov explains to his companion that the Romanians are not Germans and that they are in America, is really laughable. Do we have to assume that the craziest duo's greatest desire is to become “real” Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there is a problem with the media. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director was supposed to make us feel the rhythm of the supposed 44 minutes. Instead, he tires us with an interview throughout the film, as in a cheap TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel. After 15 minutes, the media question is central. The essence is stated as the teacher addresses a stupid student, but this deserves a separate comment, now we will concentrate on 44 minutes. So, I tried to define the purpose of this film. What is it? To provide a good time for the audience? Glorify the weapon? To glorify the police? To portray violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to a minor criminal. So should this contribute to peace and understanding in the end? I do not think so, but do not ask me. I only know that I did not like it. <br /> <br /> Oh, Michael Madsen. I admit I'm a big fan. I hoped it would be bright, but I was wrong. It's not his fault, though. <br /> <br /> As a final note, comparing “firepower” with “willpower” at the end of the film was one of the worst lines I've ever heard. scale 1-10, I give it in pure form, 1.
