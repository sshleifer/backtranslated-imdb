The documentary revolves around Eva Moses Cor, who survived the Holocaust, parts of Mengele’s twin experiments, consisting mainly of her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of other surviving twin experiments. The film clearly had great reviews. This is one of those topics about which no one dares to express the opposite opinion. <br /> <br /> I, too, most of the film, fell into the emotions that the director so clearly wanted the viewer to focus on. In one of the user reviews of Eric Monder on IMDb (it is obvious that there is nothing critical to talk about it on the public forum) you can find only the sweetest nectar. "In one of the many dramatic episodes when a group of Jews argue with Kor in the Jewish center, the meaning of the word forgive is even discussed, but the isolated and numerical Kor holds his own." But by this time, the Sacred Confidence that the film was in my sleeping emotional repertoire had been released enough so that I could clearly see again. After “strong-willed” Eva Kor forgives her “Nazi kidnappers”, the film begins to delve into what forgiveness is, at least in terms of Kor. The film tells about her after her public statement about the forgiveness of the Nazis and the new territory. For me, this was the main thing in the film, surrounded by the inedible fat of her "act of forgiveness." Obviously, it was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal the wounds of the past, she goes to the "promised land" to meet with some Arabs, to discuss with them the problems they face and cannot see whether the dialogue leads to a better understanding of the situation and is largely interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the United States about its act of forgiveness of the Nazis, including the Jewish center in Chicago. Since then, anyone who is not so tearful, that does not see the screen, hardly misses the obvious contradiction in her statements. <br /> <br /> First, you immediately notice her body language, defensive. and unwillingness to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. Her comments on how she was afraid that they might kidnap her show how much time, effort and money were spent on the whole act. Dr. Sami Adwan, a rather annoyed (professor of education at the University of Bethlehem), understands this correctly when he tells Koru about the statement she is making about how to sleep better in her apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, the debate at the Jewish Center in Chicago, where she “roasts” about the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so in the light of those who continue to suffer injuries as a result of these actions. <br /> <br /> I will shrink to chase. By the end of the film, I hoped that I had not decided to watch the film. The film was poorly made, unable to penetrate deeper into anything about Auschwitz, except for the purely trivial, just enough to make sure that the Holocaust was updated in the memory of the audience and cause tears. It showed that Cor, the subject of the documentary was unable to participate in a fair discussion. Her debating ability came down to reconsidering her attitude towards forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate. <br /> <br /> Finally, is everyone so backward today that they cannot notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? To quote another IMDb user: “I do not consider her forgiveness weak — on the contrary, she just wanted to rid her of her soul, she wanted the suffering to stop, so she let them go.” This would be the perfect definition of “MAKE THE WORLD” for the layperson. <br /> <br /> I believe that in the world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness there is no place for questioning those who "went through something more than human." the mind can understand. "PS The Dictionary, of course, must be included in all these lists of books that everyone continues to compile.
