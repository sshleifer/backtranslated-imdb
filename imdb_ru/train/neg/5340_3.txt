*** SPOILER WARNING *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, really, and he does his best with an incredible role. I see how this is a movie that may look good as a script, but it is confusing, unlikely and ultimately stupid. I saw the fake death ending a mile away. Ren√© Z. tries her best with a signature, as does Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can't remember (whose name is not Chris Penn) sweats heavily over the actor. See if you are not smart enough to distinguish between films that are so clever that you cannot see them, and so confused that you cannot understand them. See if you like the tender camera that makes you sick. See if you like to watch Tim Roth work with a bulky script. See if it will be late at night for free. Otherwise, rent the usual suspects.
