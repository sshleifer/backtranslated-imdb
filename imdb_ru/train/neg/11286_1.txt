Where do you start with such a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Did you mention the incredible heroes? Supernatural action? Scary script? <br /> <br /> No. You simply say that anyone who pays money to watch a movie so poor as this one should look at its head. I know that. I respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no preliminary word from magazines such as Empire (usually a bad sign if the preliminary copy is not available to high-quality films). However, cinemas really should think about a refund if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after it opened with two other partners. The only person in the cinema who was alone in itself. <br /> <br /> And it was a cheap night. <br /> <br /> Either the advertising campaign has failed, or rumors have spread to the majority. countries of what an abomination. <br /> <br /> Since Avengers (1998), I have not felt so short since I watched the movie. If an assistant comes to this video for several months, make sure that he pays your electricity bill while watching. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not breaking into and leaving the set; Keith Allen retains some dignity among the cinematic slaughter; Barry Foster was supposed to be arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans does not make his career uselessly after the success at Notting Hill, and only Danny Ber is halfway cute as a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> Bear in mind, considering She used to be in Word, and all viewers expected her acting skills to be rather low. <br /> <br /> The production figures are not bad, considering the obviously limited budget, but this scenario is terrible. If you want to hear a bunch of incredible characters, say “Fake!” within a couple of hours, this should be right on your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise barges are required. <br /> <br />
