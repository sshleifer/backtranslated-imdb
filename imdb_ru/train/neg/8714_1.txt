I just could not stop laughing !! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But never mind, this is very interesting! In this movie you do not need to pay attention to anything! Acting is the same - Lame! Dinosaurs are the same - GUM (Oh my God, I could see a stick that holds T-Rex for a moment.) Predators are the same as Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... In some scenes his head It looks nonsense, and it looks like a failure in a kindergarten project. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, in fact, I'm talking about quick editing, they edited it so quickly that we can not see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPS! late they are rubber! Well, here it is interesting only to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... do not rent out ... watch on TV with friends, it is much more entertaining!
