Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Add a couple of cute animals, some awful puns and a couple of rollerblades, and you’ll find yourself almost like a replica of this film. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it when I was younger; I made my mom rent it in the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not so bad. Just Marxists probably have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you don’t like America, you don’t like this movie.
