I entered the theater, intending to spend a pleasant 90 minutes, having fun, if not enlightened. I left neither entertained nor enlightened. This film cannot decide what it wants to be, and ultimately means nothing. There are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretentious references to films (“400 strokes for this character? Leave me alone!”). Although none of the characters are treated with great respect, more than thirty gays get the worst of it: all predatory, fat, sad, sloppy. If you are in the mood for a movie about a gay relationship, watch “Parting,” “Old Companion,” “Trick,” “All Guy,” “Red Dirt,” “Maurice,” “Philadelphia.” You thank me. <br /> <br />
