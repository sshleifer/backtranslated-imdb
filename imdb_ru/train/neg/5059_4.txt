If you want to watch a movie about two completely unsympathetic characters, this is one of them. The game is gorgeous, and from John Cassavetes as from a mad paranoid who, as they say, they REALLY want to get it, and from Peter Falk as his best friend for life, to which he turns for salvation. It’s a big mistake, but since they are both immoral bandits and misogynist bastards, it’s hard to decide who to look for in LESS. Only writer / director Elaine May could get away with it. It seemed to me interesting that in a long interview with producer Michael Houseman, included on the DVD, he said that the two stars had “very different ideas” about the script, it was almost impossible to work with the director, with the director the photograph had impracticable requirements the crew was constantly angry at being forced to sit idle, and so on. This mood of one big VERY dysfunctional family is clearly visible on the screen.
