One day, a big militant star, fallen from the face of the earth, finds himself in a small town with the problem of drug dealers and the body of a federal agent. Reuniting with some former colleagues to clear the city. <br /> <br /> Restrained, often to the limit, comedy "action" basically just does not work. Part of the problem is that Chris Klien was a former militant hero. he is not bad, but he is really implausible, like someone who is considered a tough guy. As I said, he is not bad, he was simply mistaken because of his past history. The real problem here is the combination of a scenario that is not really funny and sometimes seems artificial, and the direction that is pedestrian to the port of dullness. There is no life in the way things are arranged. As if the director had a list of pictures, and he went on this list. It makes for an unattractive film. And yet the film sometimes comes to life, for example, in the final show, which ends the film. This sequence works, but due to the fact that in the earlier parts of the film she lost most of her strength. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend the movie. Its worth a try if you're a fan of actors or a big fan of independent cinema in all its manifestations, but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
