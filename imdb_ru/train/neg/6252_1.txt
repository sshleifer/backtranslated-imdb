Ronald Reagan and a group of American soldiers in a North Korean prisoner of war camp. They are tortured ... We learn that the North Korean communists are bad people ... We learn that the beards of Americans grow very slowly in the days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to put it down, but finally burst out laughing at this movie. This was the scene when Mr. Reagan tells the communists that he wants to be on their side. Then he asks for a bottle of brandy. Then, acting sober, he takes a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean Communist Guard is as stupid as they are. So, drunk distracts the guards, and Reagan walks up to the box, which stands next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure there should have been something in the boxes; but, of course, Reagan makes them shake enough to show that they are empty. I have to laugh! I think “Prisoner of War” will be liked mainly by the family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise it is wasteful. <br /> <br /> * POW (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
