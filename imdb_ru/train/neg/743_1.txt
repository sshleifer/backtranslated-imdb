Holy, damn it, God damn it, almighty. This film was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. Bad ... Playing characters is the poorest thing I've seen in a long time. This film was more like Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (this is a real movie). Most of the film seemed to be made on a terrible green screen. My favorite part was when they were in the carriage, and you can say that there is no horse there. They run away from alien monsters and accelerate at the same speed as a quick run. Then he switches to a long shot with a funny CG horse. And CG as a whole, it seems, does not correspond to the level “Beyond the mind” of 1992. I mean, come on, really. It was like a horrible episode with Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo to save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever
