This film serves as a timely warning for anyone who thinks that he can both write and make his own film. Get over it you can't. Because so no one will tell you when you are hacking big holes in your plot, you have meaningless transitions, a banal, not memorable dialogue and can turn a pretty cool Korean legend into a smoking pile of celluloid. <br /> <br /> I wanted to make this movie like a popcorn popcorn movie. I love a lot of shit movies. But once I was forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and WHY, dear Lord, why? I really can't stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> I would also like someone to explain how Los Angeles became Mordor for the last scene.
