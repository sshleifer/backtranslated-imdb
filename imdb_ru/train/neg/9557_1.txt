I really did not have high expectations, and I must admit that I was not disappointed. This film is so terrible that I felt obliged to register an account here on IMDb, just to warn others not to waste their time. The plot is terrible, and throughout the movie you keep asking yourself: “Could there be something worse?” Yes, it can! somehow they manage to make it worse by the minute, and you end up thinking, "I want my hour 35 minutes ago!". Someone must pay for it! <br /> <br /> I dare you to find a film that is worse than this ... <br /> <br /> I really didn’t have high expectations, and I must admit that I was not disappointed.
