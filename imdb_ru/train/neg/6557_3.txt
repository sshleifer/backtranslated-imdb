In fact, they wrote this to BRAIN in the credits, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they didnâ€™t have a budget for spell checking. All the money production went to the big old cars. There are at least two packages here. One of them is Darin's convertible. Beautiful yellow Packard convertible. <br /> <br /> Film studio scenes show that money was spent on the costumes and decorations. There were old cameras, the appearance of Shiro, street signs and everything needed to create a visually pleasing picture. Poorly written and directed. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it runs for about 104 minutes. It was more like 85 minutes. It came to an end without reaching a conclusion. There was a clash, but no conclusion. The film just crashed on loans. 99 cents for that. I paid 99 cents for this. I could buy 3 cans of cat food and watch my cat's face when he was even more excited. <br /> <br /> A few seconds on Shiro's stage after the call to Darren McGavin seemed possible. .. this film would have an unexpected turn that would make for an interesting film. Then he just sat there. <br /> <br /> A young Latin actor performed by Stephen Bauer (Tony Montoya) could play a much larger role in everything that happened here. This cast could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they would reduce the role of Brian and use Stephen Bauer instead, change the script, leave the Packards, lose the band and add the sound of Johnny Otis. group, then they have something. <br /> <br /> Here is Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
