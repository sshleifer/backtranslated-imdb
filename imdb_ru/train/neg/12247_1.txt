This film is really terrible. terrible, since it's a waste of 84 minutes of your life. The special effects are so terrible. The game was not convincing. <br /> <br /> This is a crocodile attack on tourists who make a documentary about the "blood surfing". Blood surfing is when they swim around sharks, but it becomes terribly wrong when a 31-foot crocodile interrupts the party there. Sharks do not look real. The crocodile is even worse, and it becomes even more miserable when they run away from the creature, but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it. Death is fake, and the pirates just have to fill the time. <br /> <br /> Senseless, terrible movie that is not worth watching !!
