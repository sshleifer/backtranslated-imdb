I just finished watching this movie, and WOW was so bad. In fact, the only thing that made me look was that it was SO MONUMENTALLY bad, it was kind of interesting. The characters act funny, from the hyperdramatic way they fall before the shooting, to their incredibly bad game (were the bad guys just ripped off the street, or were they really actors?), To the incredibly bad delivery of strings to their inexplicable actions (if you If you try to shoot someone through the doorway when they enter, it’s obvious that you just need to shoot right at the door handle !!). This film should break the record for the worst lines written and delivered. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera was also really bad - you can hardly see what is happening in the fight scenes due to the switching of camera angles and camera shake. <Br /> <br /> I would vote "1", except that I like Chiba and girlfriend Sue Shihomi, and I was entertained by several scenes: 1) to break the villain’s hand so that the bone jumped out of the skin (this should hurt ) 2) a drug baron who eats an animal with brown hair (monkey ??), cracking the carcass with a meat grinder 3) the son of Chiba performs some kind of improvised eye surgery with a finger. > <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this one really does not cost anyone any time. I watched about 7 or 8 of his films and came to the conclusion that the only ones worth seeing (and they are great!) Are the TV series Street Fighter and The Killing Machine. I also heard that Hangman and Golgo 13 are good. I recommend sticking to those.
