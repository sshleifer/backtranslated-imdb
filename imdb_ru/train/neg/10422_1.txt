First, it’s not so easy to scare me ... Everything, except for my several phobias, but this film is absolutely terrible. This is not at all suitable for children! I kept my mouth open all the time, and it just shocked me. I could not believe how terrible it was for a children's film when rabbits were brutally killed! There is no need to be so terrifying and have a G rating. I recommend being over 8 years old to see it. But don’t get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I hadn’t been mentally ill as a child. I can't believe a parent would let, say, a 4-year-old child watch this. It is just intense and difficult, not to forget about grief, for small children. I am more than 4, and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
