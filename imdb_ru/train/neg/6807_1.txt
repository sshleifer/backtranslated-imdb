Spoilers? Maybe a few details, but nothing too plot related. Not like it will make a difference with this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage frankly separates the Executive Decision room from penetration into the air. Ice-T leads a team of four "elite" commandos that wear baggy black shirts, which, as we can imagine, must hide an invisible body armor, because their idiotic tactics (similar to the one used by 3 graders when playing in " Star Wars "on the playground), forcing them to absorb a hail of fire. <br /> <br /> What struck me most in this film was the use of similar former actors. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reilly as a person who once starred in a movie that you really liked, although it was so long ago that you probably would not be able to shoot it (it was Porky’s movie). Here, Cyril plays a decent fake character of Bill Paxton. The most fun is the bastard Jill Gerard, who is so fat that you will never recognize him as Buck Rogers on television. Instead of recalling the past of his slightly heroic character, Gerard gives us the tolerable role of a character from a fat tough guy who was clearly invented by John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a great hybrid game in the style of Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. In the 10 years since New Jack City, the Ice-T game has deteriorated markedly. This is not so much the regurgitation of lines as he could remember. <br /> <br /> One of the elements that plays in this film is a secret information CD. It is transferred manually, and, obviously, is incredibly unencrypted, despite the aura of Gerard’s character savvy. Well and a joke. I strongly doubt that information intended for placement on a CD will ever ever be collected in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the plane is in a closed plane without silencers, shooting is almost as loud as in a canned air, and does not make a person start, so apparently he has no problems. The selected range of weapons is quite funny. Using a stewardess with a coffeepot is the most realistic depiction of violence in a film. When she intuitively refers to a mini-Uzi pistol, which should be one of the worst pistols in history, this is too stupid. A real elite team would wear MP-5 for this type of thing or maybe SOCOMM .45s, or even tuned Hi-Powers if they were really old school, or maybe 5.7 FN if new school ... The lame 92Fs standard release is absolutely unbelievable, losing most of his composure after Deadly Weapons I. The bad guys, supposedly experienced fortune soldiers, have a mixed mix of absurdities like the aforementioned mini-Uzi and Tec-9 pistol with the infamous functional extension cord trunk that is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was one touch of realism in which I would like to correct other reviewers: the flight attendant and Ice-T lowered the unit to 10,000 feet for "breathing air" before they opened the door. And I also got the impression that the stewardess was NOT able to close the door, that she simply refused it. As for landing, there was no mention of flaps about 2 seconds before landing. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the “Dukes of Danger”, excluding Roscoe P. Coltrane on the “pass”, could shame this film for using the footage. Obviously, they chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71, because they could not get stock F-117. Besides the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001, let us forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not an invisible aircraft in the sense of B-2, and that the flight range is focused ... Well, I am not an expert, but I have doubts about whether it will be invisible on the radar. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the repeated references to the F-15, when they showed the F-16, were laughable. Details 747 were pretty dumb. No airline would start so few passengers on the 747, let alone everything that was idiotic about it. Note the use of unprotected electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Catch it on the Stars or something. Don't pay the rent, but look at that laughter. In the fight for the worst film ever, right there with No Holds Barred, which at least had some originality.
