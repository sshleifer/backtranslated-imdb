As a rule, I like horror movies, but unfortunately it fell out of the basket for a pound into the hands of my friends. We sat down to watch it, ready to get scared, and ended up spraying food wherever we laughed so much. The concept is not so bad, but why they decided that the number ten in the series, lucky, I do not know. The worst in the film are the actors. The filming was bad, the special effects are actually quite good if I am generous, but on the whole the story could not connect at any levels, because the actors were as effective as a small lump of poorly charred elm. They were wooden without measure, especially a young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any other government agent. In fact, he was more like a boy from a public school. There was a really funny sex scene where he looked as if he was swaying for apples when a busty lady was riding on top of him and later his diaper-sized panties were hysterical, but then I remembered that it should not be a comedy. I desperately break my head to find something positive to say about this film, apart from occasional flashes of the chest, but this is simply not true. Hopefully, ten was a lucky number, and they do not do another, I'm not sure that my ribs might take that.
