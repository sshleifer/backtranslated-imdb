I saw this film, and from time to time I was nervous, believing that this film "saw me." Manchi dulls the "farce" for many years. Review Star Wars, Don't Watch, Manchy. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I speak to those who are now parents), I (you) would not allow my (your) child to ever take part in this video-festival of pseudo-occultism. Hinting that Manchi is a satanic attitude, since one of the spectators is likely to fake a cold "spirit." He is a monster, alien, relative and utterly malicious — like a bogey man who made flesh invisible to adults, tempting children in such a way of life that they could never afford (without income made possible by years of self-denial and careful management). He is a peddler of simple answers and false ideals. He is all that the morally conscious viewer is not. He is Ron Popeil's own devil. <br /> <br /> I pray (I mean it literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the first) that this film does not make the format go to DVD. I hope that this type of “making yellow films” died a cold death of 1994 without a mourning death. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention this. It comes a lot.
