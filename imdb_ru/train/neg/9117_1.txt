... or maybe it's just so bad. The plot is a cheap rephrasing of the first, which is strange, since it is assumed that this is a prequel, not a sequel. Almost the entire film seems to be a cheap remake of the first, with scenes imitating what happened in the first, only much more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first one had a great cast, it consists of B-List actors and rejects. The game is basically terribly bad. Half of the good lines in the film are taken directly from the first, like almost all the main characters, including those who were not in the first movie. I understand that this was done in a pilot episode of the series, but this is no excuse. They did not need to turn (bad) frames into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and that is erotic sequences. However, since they are not nearly as good as the first, even this does not raise him above level 1. If you have a chance to see him for free and you are an honest guy, it may be worth checking out if you want something erotic, that this is not porn. If not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
