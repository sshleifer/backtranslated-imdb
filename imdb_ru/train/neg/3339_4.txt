Barry, a medical transcriptionist, reflects on his work, coupled with memories of abusive upbringing in the hands of his stepfather Barry (original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). He turns into madness and eventually a serial killer. Good (in the form of gay) and evil (in the form of a bald dumb guy) are fighting for control of their soul. This film is canceled by some poorly acting and unintended humorous scenes. Not to say that this is terrible or something like that, you can just say that it is known as well as because of the rabid fan base of Bruce Campbell (which I am), which will probably see something with whom he is connected or in some way connected. <br /> <br /> My rating: C- <br /> <br /> Additional information on the DVD: Commentary with Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second Commentary by Callio and Sound Designer Joel Newport; “I Hate Every Minute” 17-minute documentary; remote and extended scenes; alternative doubles; excerpts, frames world premiere; Poster and photo gallery; Talent bios; and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom: script in .PDF format <br /> <br /> 2 Easter eggs: select your eyes for a laugh (left eye) and one minute only the Easter egg itself (right eye)
