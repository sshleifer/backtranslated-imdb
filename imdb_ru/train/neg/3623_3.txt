(aka: BLOOD LOCK or DEMON'S CRY) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This was the entry function, jointly paid by VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian joint production in which several women in the village are killed at about the same time that a local count named Janos Dalmar is seen riding a horse and riding with his cannibal dog behind him. <br /> <br /> Citizens already suspect that he is behind all this, and they want his castle to burn out. The killing began for the first time around the time when Count János's elder brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was badly burned and killed in an accident in a laboratory. <br /> <br /> Then the woman Ivanna (Erna Schuera), whom Igor hired before his death, to help him in his experiments is revealed. Janos agrees to hire her instead of her brother, and together they are looking for formulas for the recovery of dead cells. Janos wants to bring back Igor’s charred corpse to life. <br /> <br /> But, of course, Igor is still alive (albeit badly burned) and stalking and killing women in the village. We see his face grilling on coals appearing in different parts of the film, so we know that he is still alive, because of which all this seems too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with Janos because of Ivanna, when burning candles fall on the same bed, on which Igor stumbles, meeting another final end with roasted charcoal. <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks rather grainy and bad. Besides an even more scratching trailer, no other add-ons are included. Although he has a good, spooky Spanish castle and a good atmosphere, I found it rather boring and predictable, without any worries or riddles. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
