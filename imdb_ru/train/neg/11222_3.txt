Sybil Richards directs yet another erotic masterpiece Full Moon / Surrender Cinema. This time, Jacqueline Lovell (dressed in a rather attractive silver outfit) should destroy all signs of sexual activity. However, she cannot stop herself from watching the tapes, and she seems to love them. Sex scenes are well filmed and have an excellent soundtrack (at least for this kind of films). The actors are mostly terrible and mostly very average. Jacqueline Lovell is her extremely attractive personality, and between watching her sex files she manages to bare her breasts and fumble a little lower. She also fits into a small lesbian activity. Honestly, Lovell deserves much more than this kind of fare. Here she looks gorgeous naked, but in fact she is much more attractive in her silver dress, telling of the “drama”. A completely useless movie with Lovell and the soundtrack to the only real redemptive features. Mediocre even for the release of Surrender and, obviously, the new budget minimum for them.
