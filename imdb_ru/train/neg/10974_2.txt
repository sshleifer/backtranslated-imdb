I am Irish and I lived in Denmark for a while, so I was looking forward to returning home last week to see the Intermission. And I will officially declare: <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS TERRIBLE. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as “The Most Fertile Man in Ireland,” but it definitely doesn’t stand there with other Irish films such as “Commitments,” “I Gone,” or “Michael Collins.” <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are actually quite funny, for example, Colma Minis’s American “Garm”. But the film itself was shot completely wrong. Bouncing around the camera and constantly zooming in and out are trying to give the film a sharp look, as if it were a tough drama. But it is not. This is an Irish castle, a drain and two smoking barrels, and it should be shot like this. He should have a smooth movement from one shot to another. The film looks just sloppy and collected. <br /> <br /> The performances are fine, given the terrible scenario. My friend told me as if they were just following Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He demonstrates the decent reputation of the Dublin Dirtbag, but this in no way compares to his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Buoth. Dirdre O'Kane played the best performance, who plays the sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who had just been abandoned by her husband for the sake of a young woman. I think she should leave her terrible position and focus more on her game. <br /> <br /> In general, this is by no means in keeping with the expectations that the Irish press imposes on it, or deserves to be even considered one of the best Irish films ever. <br /> <br /> I expect a response from these comments, because most of the people I spoke with said it was great. But before you answer, ask yourself: will this film be highly appreciated if it is shot in England or America?
