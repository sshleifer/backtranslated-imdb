One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was terrible to act, both for children and for adults. Most often, the characters showed no, few or few emotions. The lighting was terrible, and there was too much unrest during the day when the film was made (on the river scene where they just destroyed their boat, there are 4 shots; the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat, Gillian and Molly swim in the evenings, the rest the children in the afternoon *, when it should be in the evening * on the river bank, and Dr. Beatrice and Simonton at night, but not in the evening, get off the boat.) The best role in the film was probably from the sheriff, Cappie (though when the pulse detector deals with the character * Whatever it is, when people die, it beeps * indicates that Cappie is dead, he is still moving while he can still hear a beep, and while the nurse additionally checks his pulse manually, then he again shows the pulse, and THEN he finally dies.) I think he will not be perfect because it is an independent film, but it could still be better. Honestly look is not worth even the children. You can also see something good, for example, "The Lion King" or "Toy Story", if you are going to see something that you remember.
