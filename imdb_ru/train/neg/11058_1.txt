The unsatisfactory and undoubtedly dull true crime film, which the cast actor character Jeremy Renner languidly mumbled his way through the lead role Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most recognizable degenerates / serial killers of the last century. Released right at the beginning of the video in early 2003, “Dahmer” is a frankly talkative, boring, poorly functioning and practically bloodless snoring festival with a real crime that never truly delves into the monstrous and insane psyche of the late mass murderer as if he there was very good potential! However, what he is trying to do for reasons unknown to me causes the viewer to feel some sympathy for the person, portraying him to those who are ultimately a lonely, impolite and highly socially inept homosexual loser who just looks for love in all the wrong places. , unlike the cold, prudent and depraved sick and crazy, as he was! Overall, the 2003 Dahmer is something that true crime lovers could miss everywhere, because I'm not joking when I say that this is one of the worst biographies about serial killers ever made! It's even worse than other pretentious and exploited video tracks, such as Gacy, Bundy, Ed Hein and The Night Stalker! (Turkey-zero stars)
