I would like this film to be liked, yes, this is SAW, blah blah blah, robbery, but I like these films. If everything is done well, it has all the ingredients to be good, not brilliant, but a good film ... unfortunately, these components have disappeared! The action was terrible, and it was first noticed when prisoners were introduced to their invader one by one (hoods were removed), comments and one liner are terrible, yes, I know bad writing .... but itâ€™s more than that, it was bad write in combination with a bad acting game. Two of the captives were in a relationship with each other and did not even recognize it until they delved into the film ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I even wonder why I am trying to watch this movie for everyone. <br /> <br /> I will end up with holes, holes and more holes! DISAPPOINTMENT!
