Below is a spoiler that can spoil the surprise of one unexpected and truly funny scene in this film. There is also information about the first film in this series. <br /> <br /> I made this film on a DVD that someone gave to my roommate. It was released with the first film from the Blind Dead series. <br /> <br /> This film was certainly a lot worse than the first La Noche del Terror Ciego. In addition, many features of the first film have been significantly changed. To begin with, the film was dubbed in English (the first one was provided with subtitles), which, as a rule, makes me puzzled. <br /> <br /> The concept of the series is that in the distant past, the local branch of the Templar was involved in hideous and secret rituals. After the discovery of these crimes, the local peasantry killed the Templars in such a way that their eyes could no longer be used, which prevented them from returning from hell to take revenge. Then we move on to modern times, when, due to some event, the Templars rise from the dead to take revenge on the villagers, whose ancestors first of all spoiled them. Of course, since the undead knights have no eyes, they can only find their victims when they make some kind of noise. <br /> <br /> The Templars were a secretive order from about the 12th century, emerging from the crusades. They were only about 150 years old before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others. Since they were secretive, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, especially for consecration. In addition, because of how society was organized, church officials did not necessarily follow things, which meant that they did not have an inner person when everything was heated. And because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured in confession. The Order was the strongest in France, but existed in Portugal and Spain, where films are held. <br /> <br /> In the first film there were victims of virgins, and the knights drank blood directly from the body of a virgin (shots to the chest here, of course, this is a horror movie after all), and then, when the knights return to life, they attack on their victims, eating them alive and sucking their blood; in this sequel it all disappears. You still have the same scene (reworked, not the same videotape) when they sacrifice a virgin, but they pour blood into a bowl and drink it from it. That way, when they come back, they just chop people with their swords or pin people to death, which, I must say, is a far less effective means of disturbing your audience. There is also a problem of time: in the first film, the date is much closer to the Templars, where they now say that this is the 500th anniversary of the peasants who burn these guys on the fire, which dates back to 1473. the fact that the Templars lose their eyes is also much less interesting. First, they were driven out by the crows. Now they just burned out, and pretty ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, maybe it was just me, but it seems that a lot of people from the first film appeared in this film (despite the fact that he died). In fact, this is not a problem, since the film is completely different, and is not a continuation in the sense of continuation, but nonetheless strange. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is the rich man who uses the Child distracts the undead while he takes a break for the jeep. The child's father has already pulled this child into an attempt to get a jeep, so he goes out and tells her to find the father. This is somewhat unexpected, and this is perhaps the funniest scene in the film. Of course, why the child does not die at this moment is beyond me, and I am disappointed with the horror lovers. <br /> <br /> I could not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad that it becomes funny, so it's just a mediocre horror movie. The main part of the film consists of several people who are hiding in the church, each of whom is trying to do this one, in order to be saved from the blind dead who have surrounded them. When the film ends, you are not at all surprised by the result; in fact, quite disappointed. If you like to watch a Spanish horror movie, watch the first one in which, at least, there are some innovative ideas and not very expected results.
