This walk in Charles is decent, but this is a rather modest performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a story with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland, who forgets to develop, and it hurts the film a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change her name. Every movie with Charles was pretty bad.
