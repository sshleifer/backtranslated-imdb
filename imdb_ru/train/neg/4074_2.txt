I expect the same excitement as I spit on your grave, but I was let in just rubbish, as you can even call this movie (its kinda mini porn). I felt sick when the guy was forced to have his own business. It does not have a storyline to which he quickly resorts from every murder. If you, as the woman sees, are naked or even parts of men, then there is a place in the movie for and there is even a masturbation a place in the movie that makes it porn and not a movie at all. I saw some silly movies in my time, but this is number 1. I want to watch it again altogether. The actors even look at me bored during the film, so they probably needed a lot of money to make this film.
