How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the similarities with this other best Flemish film Congo Express (1986)? In the Congo Express, there are also characters who are not related to each other: Jean (de Congolis), a worker, two taxi drivers, a street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucien and Gilber. Of course, Tom Barman is a star, but Luke Gubbels is not. This should not be a reason to forgive the flaws in the scenario (if there is a scenario) in any case the wind blows. A joke (the only one!) At a party about ice in the fridge, taken from that great Flemish film De Witte (1934), where De Witte puts too much salt on potatoes. Some accidents occur in the film, but after that there is no explanation. Tom Barman offers us a film that looks more like an experiment on watching on television than a movie theater. Another missed chance for Flemish cinema.
