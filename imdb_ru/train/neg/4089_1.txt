Attention: this review contains a spoiler. Wow. Almost impressively bad. Notice, I said "almost." This is nothing more than a multitude of random scenes stretched over each other in a free story attempt. The main characters (you CAN’T call them “heroes”) shoot innocent bystanders for food, and rob them for the same reasons. There are also tons of homoeroticism that was a turn for me. (SPOILER: It seems that villainy (which is only topless and not naked, as other surveys claim) kills early, but recovers miraculously, adding an additional 70 minutes of torture to the audience.) I can't get rid of the feeling that the animal has a lot time violence occurred. If you are in the MST3K mood, you may find it watchable, but for the most part you can forget about it. Instead, rent the original Conan DVD.
