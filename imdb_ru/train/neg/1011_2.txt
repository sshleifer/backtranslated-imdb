LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard Carey Elvis. Roslin Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And is he a star? I should have known better than renting an EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But at the moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have such big names as Freeman and Spacey in STV, you know that this is one of two things: indie or dog. As in sat-on-the-shelf. Who did it. And for good reason. The plot itself includes a detachment of corrupt police killers in the spirit of MAGNUM FORCE, and the “journalist” Timberlake is the only one brave enough to reveal them. He is focused on his efforts - or maybe I should say for his terrible game. I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot in the forehead, and I still had the opportunity to think to turn to my arrow and smile before collapsing. Just awful. The real warning about how terrible this film is is that Freeman is wearing a naughty beard that looks like a stroller on the cover and during the whole film. You just know that the director did not control the situation. Freeman is obviously dormant.
