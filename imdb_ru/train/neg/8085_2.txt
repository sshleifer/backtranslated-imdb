Oh, cheerfulness! Oh, joy! Another movie that is so bad is good! Or I thought so. In fact, he misses the “so bad, it's good” phase and, unfortunately, goes straight to “it could be so bad, it's good, but they screwed up and made it bad.” <br /> <br /> For a start too long. Shorten half an hour, and it could be longer. Then insert such ridiculous plots as “a person sabotaging the mission to save the Earth, because he has all the food supplies, and he will be rich if the mission fails!”. Duh! Or the plot device "talking bomb", which was last seen in the Dark Star. Guess what ... just like in Dark Star, the bomb has a crash ..... hmmm. Add the line "we can not leave the game in kindergarten," and you briefly described the "Solar Crisis." <br /> <br /> Easy relief in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we called him in this film), whose only purpose in the film is to drive a child through the desert and call his father to pick him up ... Eventually. Between driving and talking on the phone, Jack distributes meaningless nonsense, giggles a lot, but contributes little to the story, such as it is. In short, he is the best movie. <br /> <br /> My reward for “The most ironic line with straight faces” goes to Charlton Heston, who, having first met his eldest son for the first time in his life, comments that his son looks a little “out of shape” while he he stands there with a bowel sticking out of his belt and badly needs a captain of Kirk's corset. <br /> <br /> It's also funny that the bad guy is the Chief Minion, who has a bright white hairstyle, for some reason forcing me to think about Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> In addition to this fun, there is little to recommend this film. The end is a sequence copied from (but, fortunately, in short) the final sequence of 2001. <br /> <br /> Tips to enjoy this movie more, if you are stupid enough to watch it like me: <br /> <br /> 1. Every time a bomb says, imagine what it is called Tarquin (believe me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on the screen and is about to speak, anticipate him by pronouncing a line from “Planet of the Apes”, such as “Remove from me your dirty paws! ”or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever the lead woman looks tense (this happens in most cases), keep hoping that she has aneurysm and will soon die. <br /> <br /> 4. During the endless scenes of “the ship broke down again”, continue to hope that the guys from the technicians / engineers will throw up Scotism, like “You can change the laws of physics!” or something like that. <br /> <br /> Also, do your best to get through it. I dozed off halfway and woke up to realize that I had not missed anything, and the plot (albeit ridiculous) did not move forward. So do not worry about setting up for a few, you do not miss anything.
