First, there was nothing in this film that could really capture me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said “Well, it wasn’t anything special,” after I watched it. It was probably drama and stuff, but it just didn’t get me, but a little boring. As I said in the title, it looks very cheap. The quality of the film itself (images) looked like a poor quality and reminded me more of a cheap movie than a respected English director. The angles of the camera and the pictures were very amateur, as in my opinion. In fact, there were no close-up shots or similar effects to create interesting scenes. I have not seen many English films, and those that I have seen have not really impressed me more than this, and they seemed similar, made with camera work, colors, and the like. The “game” tried to be more cool, fashionable and clever (see My review of “Lola Rennt” about this, if you like), but I also failed. In general, just a small, indifferent film that was not something special (at best, I'm afraid) and, unfortunately, wasted more than two hours.
