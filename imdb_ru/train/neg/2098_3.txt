I was hoping to get some in-depth background information about the Apollo 11 mission, and I received some decent material for an interview with Buzz Aldrin Jean Krantz and other people involved in the mission, related to an over-promoted sensational voice with disaster prediction. in the worst tradition of television production. <br /> <br /> If you could turn off voice over and change the course of the program to positive evidence of how people can overcome setbacks in order to achieve a goal from then it could be great - but I feel I wasted around 45 minutes of your life, watching the 60-minute program. I want to return these minutes.
