This movie is worth seeing if you like to be amazed at the special effects. There are some interesting visual effects. <br /> <br /> Beyond this, this is a typical Hollywood fare of the nineties / August years without dazzling content. True to the title. <br /> <br /> Do not highlight the story. This is similar to surgery on a dinosaur brain. There is not much to start with. There is nothing original and not very special. So don't do history at all. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, at the end he became a bit screaming, diluting the purity of the magnificent handling of FX to an invisible (and sometimes half invisible) person. However, if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, this is a spectacle (or not a spectacle). <br /> <br /> In general, this is a decent FX film that is worth seeing for this purpose and only for it.
