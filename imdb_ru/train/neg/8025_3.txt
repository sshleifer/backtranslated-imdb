Yes, even being a fan of such shows as a survivor and a student, this show is pretty bad. I didn’t mind the first few shows, but then I realized how pathetic it was to go to the show in the first place after all. The jokes Alex and Aaron give the man a bad name for the way they cheated or threw their choices at the first opportunity didn’t really look good for the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can take three hundred. She had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on TV, and she was definitely not the smartest girl (very media-savvy, but I doubt there is much more). <br /> <br /> I haven't really watched any of the shows since then, except for random replays on daytime television. I think the reality of the reality show is to treat it like an "entertainment litter". Treat this as something you can laugh at and you don’t need to think too much (I don’t watch CSI, it’s like a weary reality show and clichéd, but you still have to think too much while watching). <Br /> <br /> A few thoughts for a number of reasons going on the show. At the very beginning, “The Woman Tells It All” A woman, such as Amy (she had many lessons about her), commented that she tried every scene, such as a scene in a bar and a club, to meet a guy, and it did not happen for her Hi, Amy, how about joining a club to get a hobby, do some charity work, change jobs to where you meet more guys, and all I know is that going to the bar is not the perfect place to meet with a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls seemed to be obsessed with meeting the “perfect man.” Hint to the ladies: it does not exist. There are, however, a lot of great guys who could be great husbands, and some of them might suit you! they may not earn six figures a year or be like a younger one, but they are still great guys. The shallow woman on this show is absolutely incredible. I'm still young, and he was led to believe that a woman gradually grew out of her pettiness, as they got older and became more realistic about their future partner. This show proves the opposite. <br /> <br /> In general, this show helps to confirm many stereotypes of how women treat men in society. This is really a terrible show, and I think all these types of shows should just stop. The best dating shows per country mile are “Blind Date” and “Fifth Wheel” because it’s fun. Between pairs there is nothing better than an ordinary night. A bachelor, unfortunately, takes himself too seriously.
