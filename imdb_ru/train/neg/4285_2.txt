If you want to watch a good film about Jason Scott Lee, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: the story of Bruce Lee <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> "Timecop 2: Berlin Decision "awful movie. Terrible production values. Awful game. Awful script. I would not recommend watching this movie to anyone who seriously believes that such jokes are quality entertainment or raise awareness of Asian Americans in Hollywood (this film does neither the one nor the other). <br /> <br /> I would at least tell me that this film is a passable entertainment on a rainy day, if you have ever come across it while watching channels. If you're curious, maybe a rental from Netflix, but this movie is definitely not for parties. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few who watched this film as a means to increase your awareness of Asian-American films and left disappointed, then I recommend the following films for personal viewing. These are well-written high-performance films that featured talented actors from Asian countries in America: <br /> <br /> Good luck tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
