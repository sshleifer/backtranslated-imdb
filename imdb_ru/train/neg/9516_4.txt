Frank Sinatra plays a former wretched soldier and an upset, hardworking and drunk writer who returns to his hometown in the Midwest and reunites with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), who is now widely known with an uninterested wife and stubborn daughter. Frank contacts player Dean Martin, the uneducated Shirley MacLaine, and has some run-up with the law, but he really wants to write and negotiate with a good woman. An oversimplified drama, bordering a soap opera, with a role for McLain, which in turn is overly “colorful” and embarrassingly sentimental (however, its drunken roar “After You Gone” is the highlight of the film and is skillfully handled). Directed by Vincente Minnelli is watching this direct way, but he has a surprisingly dark spirit, and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The picture looks incredibly beautiful in widescreen mode, with good attention to detail and composition, but the plot and these characters are stuck in darkness. ** from ****
