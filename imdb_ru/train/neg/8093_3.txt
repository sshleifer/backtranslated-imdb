Based on the satirical novel by Tom Wolfe, who was appreciated by everyone (I have not read it), Tom Hanks plays the role of Streeter, who accidentally kills a black boy lost in the bad part of New York Willis stars, as a reporter who starts Hanks with a downward spiral ... The characters are very thin, and it seems that no one is sympathetic to anyone in this film, and comedy or satire is also not a lot of laughter .. Melanie Griffith made her breasts during the filming, so itâ€™s funny to see if the size of her boobs changes in different parts of the film. It will distract you from other things, such as lack of script or humor. On a scale of one to ten.
