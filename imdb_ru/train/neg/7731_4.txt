The comparison may be unfair, but inevitable. Those who are attracted by the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly frightened to discover an American-style musical - an awkward, unnatural dialogue with inexplicable song and dance numbers. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so weak that he was replaced by the terrible work of duplication (as you remember, the duplication was almost perfectly done in Umbrellas). Translation of French (for versions with subtitles) also leaves much to be desired, although this can not be attributed to Demi. The film also has a few moments of self-awareness that are confusing, such as references in the songs to LeGrand himself. And the costumes - well, the combination of tight pants and white boots and oddly unnatural colors is reminiscent of one of the films of Austin Powers. . <br /> <br /> But Demi rewards the viewer with hints of umbrellas; notice, for example, the suitcase that Maxens carried when he left Rochefort - this is the same suitcase that Guy carried when he left Cherbourg. Also pay attention to the “Comfortable resolution brunette” - Madeleine in “Umbrellas” and “Josette in young girls”. <br /> <br /> In general, those who expect a natural feeling from Umbrellas (except for the scene with a floating bicycle) or are looking for the same deep questions and ambiguous endings as in the Umbrella scenario should probably go through this . Those who are looking for the French version of the fine American musical of the 60s will be quite happy.
