The story of the film was as simple as the moral: find a girl, marry her, live with her happily ever after. Although there were some wonderful moments and turns in the film, most of it remained on the surface of what could be shown in the film with the same storyline. <br /> <br /> The struggle of the Baptists and Mormons was only affected superficially and was mocked, probably intentionally. A more interesting story would be a mixed couple. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that does not need too much concentration, which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values ​​(besides modern tolerance ;-)), you will be fine with this movie. Can be shown on family home evening ...
