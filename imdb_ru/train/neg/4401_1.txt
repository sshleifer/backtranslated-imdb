We went to the cinema with the group, because the play we were about was canceled. Without a doubt, this is one of the worst films ever. Not that I dislike the cult films that I make. But nothing happens in the movie. No one feels any connection with the characters at all. endless times without dialogue. And the car. How do you carry a huge tent, beds, chairs and clothes for every day in this car? This is a double! I have to say that the landscape is beautiful, but not in the film, the director had to do a photo session of the film so that we could miss about 80 minutes of useless time, in any case nothing happens. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it, since it is a waste of your time
