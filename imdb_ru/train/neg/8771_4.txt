Well, I was bored and I decided to watch this movie. But I think that the main thing that influenced this film was that it would be filmed for an hour, and then the same hour repeated 4 times. It consists of: 1. Collecting troops and discussing an attack plan. 2. Memories of the wives of men. 3. The approach of troops marching along the long line. 4. Men run uphill and shoot, as a rule, the first to get a shot in the head. then 3 other men save him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call to the base to tell about success. 6. Men flash back to their wives and sing 10-minute songs. It was the main film, and the same order of events occurred about 4 or 5 times. and each time he remembered his wives, he showed the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 or more people who had a memory, so it took a ton of time. In addition, people could not kill their enemy, except with the help of bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and there was a lot of action, although the action was repetitive. In general, I probably will not see it again, but it was not too terrible.
