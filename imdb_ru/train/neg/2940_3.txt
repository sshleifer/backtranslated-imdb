I saw this movie when I was very small. This is definitely one of the strangest films I've ever seen. Now, usually, I like weird movies, but it was too much. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot in the film. In any case, it begins as a Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Reggdy Ann and Andy set off on a journey to save their new friend Babette. From there comes madness. There is Greed, Looney, a sea monster named Gazuki and a group of pirates singing the tunes of the show, and all this only makes the film more strange. In addition, I can not help but feel that Babette is annoying and crying a little. She definitely did not help the film. <br /> <br /> Now, although I didn’t like this movie, there were a few pretty roles. I liked the camel song. Despite the fact that it was a song about loneliness, it had a friendly feeling. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most of Looney were just nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting, and probably the most ridiculous. King Koo Koo was just a little bag, because of which Dr. Evil looked like a serious villain. Also there was the song Ragdy Andy, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for little boys who wanted to be tough. But honestly, even these things have not made the film better. (But remember, this is just my point of view.) <br /> <br /> Although I personally would not recommend this film, I must even admit that it has its own charming moments. See if you are interested, but only if you are set for something “really” unusual.
