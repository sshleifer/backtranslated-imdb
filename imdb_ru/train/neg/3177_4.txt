I have to admit that "Over her dead body" was not really as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see him, so I rented it. I decided to just go ahead and see the horror before my eyes, but in reality it was not so bad. I was just expecting this horrible movie, but the writers didn’t seem to have done any harm, but the casting of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), she seems a little unprepared for the movie. I think I could find her a little better without her, she just annoys me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry, which made the film somewhat likable. But you have to admit that there was no point in this film, it was one of those quick salaries for acting stuff. The film could be funnier if someone really paid attention to it and played better. <br /> <br /> Henry just lost his bride, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day, But when his sister leads him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls in love with her, but Kate pursues her because of graves Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move so fast, and she will make sure that Ashley does not understand him, torturing her day and night with her chatter, believe me in Kate’s voice, this is scary. <br /> “Over her dead body” is a good film, not sure if it is worth the money, but I would rent it if you want to watch it or you are interested. Eva Longoria just does not have enough stellar power to make the film work, no offense to those who love it, she is just on a small screen above the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, she still seems not too cute to everything she pulls, or her “cheerful” friend Dan, just again, not very pretty. Just with some rewriting and proper attention, this film might be better, but instead we get an average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
