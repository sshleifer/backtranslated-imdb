I have seen almost no expiatory qualities in this film. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino’s seemingly insane obsession ... There were several attractive women in this film, and perhaps it’s a decent quality. Overall, however, I found this film surreal and funny. Manual film making in combination with slow motion and other cinematic tricks that I found awkward and dizzy, even nauseous. In general, music everywhere was terrible and repetitive to the extreme, and also reminded me of the psychological war of the American military against various disgruntled people. <br /> <br /> The various vignettes that make up the film are disorderly in their location and unsatisfactory are unsolved in their content and “conclusions”. A dull film (not a real film, a term that I leave behind true art), which left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe various people who are trying to unleash it as a "romantic comedy", although in this film, of course, there are some elements that deny any connection with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest staying away, despite the seemingly overwhelming positive attitude towards IMDb and other rating sources.
