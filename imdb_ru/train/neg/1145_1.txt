For a brief statement, there is nothing special to say, except for the fact that this is an example of J. Edgar Hoover’s constant attention to maintaining a good “PR” profile. They do not make films so bad very often, especially with such as Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles in this mix. Very bad. <br /> <br />
