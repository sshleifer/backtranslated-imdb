the only value in this film is basically to laugh at how bad it really is. with a plot that makes your regular writer in high school look good, and with acting, which is almost as good, he gets my lowest score. one of Tom Hanks's very early films, where he clearly did not have the pleasure of being truly discriminating. The best special effect of the film is that the guy, dressed in an incredibly fake gum, consumes a monster.
