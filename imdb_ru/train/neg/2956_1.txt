What did she think of? file: Whoopi Goldberg in the future plays a policeman who teamed up with a talking dinosaur (!) in a criminal case involving a madman who wants to start another ice age Weird confusion straight to the tape is embarrassing and ridiculous, the high concept in search of himself. Apparently, it was a labor of love for his writer-director Jonathan Betuel (who was also one of the producers); unfortunately, the end results are anemic to be charitable. The mere presence of Goldberg on the screen can often cause goodwill and laughter, no matter how bad the script, but here it is sinking, and you can see unfamiliar results. NO STARS from ****
