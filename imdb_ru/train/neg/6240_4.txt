I think that a hint can be compiled by various comments on this topic. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the number of people who liked this film, who want to make it “obligatory” or “obligatory”. <br /> I think it gives us a little understanding of the reason why this film and the problem underlying it are so polarized. <br /> <br /> The problem of global warming is very popular with people who want to make others “do the right thing”. This is especially true of the more “liberal” minded people, because it has nothing to do with the morality in the bedroom, which is usually sought by conservatives who want to make you “be good”. <br /> <br /> And this is a problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And very successful at that. He simply cannot resist turning to those people who want to make others do what they want. Political attraction is too great. <br /> <br /> And here we are left with a scientific problem that can make a huge difference, which comes down to a political problem that appeals to those involved in politics, with a tendency to make others “do the right thing”. <br /> <br /> Another interesting question: how did such people capture the Ecological Movement?
