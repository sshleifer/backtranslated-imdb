<br /> <br /> I recently saw this atrocity in my film program, and I thought it was terrible, as I said in my slogan, it was pretentious, banal, petty and phenomenally important. <br /> <I consider myself a fan of the film and everything that a film has to offer. If I want to watch a documentary about the Cannes Film Festival, I will watch A & E .... and they are likely to be more objective in this. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this, period. <br /> <br />
