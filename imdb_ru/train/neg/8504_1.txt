Semana Santa is terribly bad. This is so wrong in many ways, I do not know where to start. So let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge of her husband was shot dead during her defense, is sent from Madrid to Seville to work at the police. During holy week (Semana Santa, you know? ... everyone starts to fall asleep ... they say that in many moments it was bad, even from the very beginning), the killer executed his victims like bulls in the bullring arena. She teams up with a chauvinist dog Olivier Martinez and cute Fyodor Atkin. Soon she will discover what will be the next target of the killer (who wears a red robe). Why, oh, but why? <br /> <br /> Why ..., here is the question that was in my head the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did I go to see this? I love Mira Sorvino (I even excuse her for this shit AT FIRST VIEW) <br /> <br /> Q: Why was there only 8 of us on this Saturday weekend on the first weekend at the theater? A: aaaa. Spiderman received a response that day. But also the fact that the film was a blast with good reviews. <br /> <br /> Question: Why was this film made? A: Money, I think. But the boy needs the money of the World. <br /> <br /> then ... why ???????????? Firstly, there is always something wrong with European co-production. Here you have the French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then he wants to play on the same playing field as American thrillers / slashers / vagrants / secrets / whatever. Even VALENTINE, although it was unnecessary, poorly written and shot, was much better in anticipation and fun. <br /> <br /> Then, to pay tribute to the story, the screenwriter wanted to add a political look to the story. Wrong: done in flashbacks in a photo like traffic, this is definitely the most interesting thing in the film. One could adhere to this, would not have to sit through the entire movie. Better go straight to Guillermo del Trosu "DEVIL'S LANGUAGE" (El espinazo del diablo) to wise up a bit. <br /> <br /> Then homophobia. Little apple! The first victims are gay twins who are addicted to drugs who have been slaughtered. Annoying Olivier Martinez is sent to a dating agency that holds a badly shaved, heavy-haired crossdresser with a blonde blonde wig. The character of Mira Sorvino all the time calls a big dam. Do we need such things? Nope Just unnecessary offensive remarks, as before. <br /> <br /> Then wait. Yipee. No apparent motive. The first killings are a simple illusion, as they represent a famous picture. But no. And the killer’s revelation (of a terrible fascist, of course) could have been made from the very beginning, as it appears at the end of the film, because, I think, the director had to say, “well, it’s time to finish the devil take. Let's find out right now who the killer is and why he is killing. "<br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he is the director. Wrong: no sense of expectation, no feeling of the director, no knowledge of tempo change. Giant, mega-boring. Holy Week scenes are not needed (maybe the rule of joint production, saying: OK, shoot in Seville, but show some merits of this beautiful and historic city with the celebration of Easter. Here we are: a mysterious film for tourists!) /> <br /> Then actors. All mistakes. Mira Sorvino is bored to death: she has practically nothing He wants, moreover, that she is stabbed in the right hand. Everything that she did best (Replaceable killers, Mighty Aphrodite ...) looked like they had never been. Olivier Martinez ... hello, here Does anybody have any? When producers find out that he is not an actor, but a mannequin who has no speech or feelings? Fedor Atkin is soft and transparent. Only we have great respect for Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses of this last century. (and I hope for a few more roles in this present). She is the main attraction here, as she is the only one who gives life to her poor lines. I will not mention the other actors, as they are one-sided characters, uninteresting and superficial. <br /> <br /> Inconsistent leadership, inconsistent actors, implausible plot. Incarnate idiocy. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
