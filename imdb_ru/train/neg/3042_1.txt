I am allowed to write 1,000 words about this film, but one word is enough: strange. My husband and I did not laugh so much at this truly horrible movie. We continued to look at each other with our best "What the ...?" expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this film. The killer tomatoes were funny, but it just hurts. What type of mind creates such images and then films them so that others can see them? What type of mind includes innocent children in this strange, strange film, and then packs it up as if it suits the children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, don't let him / her watch this movie. He can watch the guys - probably with "What the ...?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to impose this film on others, you may want to raise their presentation. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.
