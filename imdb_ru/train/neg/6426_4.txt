I found the documentary “Fast, Cheap and Out of Control” to be a rather interesting documentary. The documentary contained four “mini” documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these people was extremely involved in their work, showing obvious love and pleasure from their work. <br /> <br /> The sad part, I must say, was to be the topic in which these people worked / studied, They were interesting for about five minutes, after which they became boring and lasted too long. <br /> <br /> Although the video was shot very creatively. I really liked the movie about one thing with voice duplication over another. He played well, and also well coincided with the music.
