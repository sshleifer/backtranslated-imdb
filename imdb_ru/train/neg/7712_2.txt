<br /> <br /> Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a “parody” of bad monster films, which in the end turns out to be worse than the films that it fakes. The (very scanty) story tells about tomatoes, which rebel against those who treat them badly. In fact, they rotate and growl (yes, they growl), and the next thing you know, a person is covered in ketchup. Actors are nameless names that have never been filmed after this, so it would be pointless to call them. There is a guy the government hired to try to stop the threat from tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black guy who is a master of disguise, as well as a girl and a guy who dives. In any case, there is another woman who is spying on the first guy who works for the government. if it doesn't make much sense to you, you understand. In fact, this film would never have been very good, but it doesn’t even have enough fun to laugh at the silly scenes of the attack. The film is terribly foolish, which, although it makes sense, is really very painful, which could be (reasonably) an entertaining film. At some point, a giant wax tomato slides over an unclosed wooden plank with wheels on it! Perhaps I would recommend the film if it had a pleasant value for the camp, but even this is not enough in this terrible film. 2/10
