This comedic film with a very low budget is only successful with a low budget. The dialogue is overwhelmingly stupid, the chase scenes are equally boring, and most of the money on the screen seems to have been saved for a series of accidents and explosions in the parking lot during the last five minutes of the film (a brief look at the pot) at the beginning of this scene will surely be shattered and spewed the villain of the film - there is no support without a goal). The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those who sometimes left Roger Corman’s studio when he gave a new director a few dollars and a camera — but without the discipline that Corman would impose.
