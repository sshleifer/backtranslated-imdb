This is probably the worst zombie movie attempt I've ever seen. Awful, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the director, the family of filmmakers, or a friend of the director. How does this movie suck? Let's calculate the ways ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Brutal. I will not give up effects / blood, as I understand that this is a low budget. But was there at least one non-obese zombie? C'mon! And for a movie set in Rhode Island, why did this truck have a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, find a little. <br /> <br /> The girl is dancing, and the soldier "stands still." Please do not put your ex-girlfriend or boyfriend's sister naked in your movie. It was an ugly film filled with ugly people, and he doesn't even mention Romero on the cover. The next time you decide to make a film, do not.
