Unforced leadership leaves a decent cast who are stuck in a beautiful, but sluggish adaptation, in which the dialogues seem narrated rather than soulful, and the ghostly appearances of ghosts do not allow one to gather a feeling of fear or magic in oneself; Edward Woodward, like a ghost of a Christmas present, swings on stilts and seems to give the impression of Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George S. Scott is too twisted, and he never seems to believe that, which deprives him of the effectiveness of his effect. The scenes in which he shows his past have the same influence as if he hesitantly flipped through his family album. No one else seems to be making any effort other than Frank Finlay, who chronically replays.
