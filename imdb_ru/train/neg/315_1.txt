Watching this bitch is a cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of Sandler. Really slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> 'I bought a DVD in my basket for $ 5.88 at Wal Mart. But the thought that continues to sound in my head goes like this: “How can I get my money back?” <br /> <br /> The most unforgivable thing in the film is that the boat simply does not sink! <br /> <The best constructive proposal: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know this show on the channel SciFi, in which a guy and his appetit machines fake the most incredible horror films (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY, unwind comedy program and show this movie. I am afraid that without a good joking parody of this train wreck, viewers may begin to follow Sandler with ice pickaxes and chainsaws. <br /> <br />
