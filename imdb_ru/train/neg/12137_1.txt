Oh my God! This film insults everyone's mind. I mean really, who thinks that three children can fight from 30 to 40 ninjas and win. Not to mention the brainless humor. This film is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad. The film is a foreshadowing, the only thing for which it is good is a time killer or an unintended laugh.
