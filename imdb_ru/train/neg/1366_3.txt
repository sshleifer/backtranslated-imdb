** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The truly graceful Sean Young (who in some scenes with flowing hair looks like Elizabeth Taylor) impresses with its discoveries in this film. Sitting at the back of the police car, waiting for the bust signal, her face and body are tense and distracted. Unfortunately, as soon as the bust is over, Yang's tense behavior never changes. This is one deadly limited actress. <br /> <br /> One has only to compare Young with the performer who plays her colleague and best friend Arnetia Walker in order to understand what is missing in Young. Walker is always open, emotional and at ease ... in that there is no visible barrier between what she can feel and her expression. She is an open book. Young, on the other hand, behaves modestly, shyly, and you can expect your neighbors to act if they are suddenly cast into the main role in the film. In fact, she has no clue. <br /> <br /> With this main void that appears in the center of the film, we can only think about the implausibility of this story. For example, after Miss Young was abducted by a criminal who she pursues and locked in a closet, she breaks the door when she is left alone. Of course, she is only wearing a bra and panties, but in a similar situation with a psycho-thief who can return at any time, you will go to the door ... or take the time to go through his dresser, get some clothes and get dressed? I assume that this and other scenes are trying to offer some kind of mixed emotions that the character of Miss Young is experiencing, but Young cannot convey this type of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are several influencing moments in the film. For example, short interviews of police with past victims of a criminal, but on the whole this is a purposeless attempt. It is unfortunate that Miss Young was replaced during the filming of a couple of comic-style films that may have used her limitations with some humor (Batman and Dick Tracy), because her hesitations when trying to play real people are strangely touching. Watching Miss Young try to play, at least in this “thriller,” is a sad sight.
