The plot is believable, but banal, that is, the beautiful and neglected wife of a rich and powerful man suffers from psychosis and tries to hide it when the psyche pursues and blackmails her. But what develops from there is amazingly illogical. Despite the resources available to a regular couple who have money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seems to have only one servant, their lawyer and the local police (who say they canâ€™t do anything) until they fight against the unknown and terror. They do not have private security personnel (only a bizarre security system with which they are mistreated), domestic or ground staff, drivers, etc. Even it seems that there are no means to hire private 24-hour nurses to take care of a hero suffers. life-threatening injuries, leaving the man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is depicted as having the brains of a doorknob, and our hero, the tycoon, behaves in the most incredible and irrational way. The performance is an insult to viewers who spent their time on this nonsense and crime for wasting the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). And shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this tasteless offer.
