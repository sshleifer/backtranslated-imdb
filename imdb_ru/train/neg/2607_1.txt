I recently watched a movie, and it hardly resembles the book on which it is based. I blame it on the bad script and the direction. Some parts were forcibly introduced (gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. I actually read a book after watching a movie and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. It was hard for me to read and a little awkward. Too many scattered ideas presented without any benefit ... except for sensational parts for time. Because he covers things that were considered “sensitive,” at least during communism, I can see the admiration he made at that time. But this is no longer the case, or maybe I see things differently or a little of both. The film tries too hard to cover many aspects of the book, resulting in a mixture of scenes, which may have some meaning for the person reading the book. However, this is a film that is difficult to watch and, perhaps, never to shoot.
