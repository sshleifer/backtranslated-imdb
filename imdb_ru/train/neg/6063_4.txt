“Masters of horror” has proven to be a bad arena for “message episodes,” and although you can make certain arguments in favor of “Screwfly Solution” by Joe Dante (one of the series’s best episodes, period), most attempts to do so have come across a hard anvil and not impressive (nothing weakens the horror more than a soap box). And Pro-Life simply combines reactionary views with ultra-violence; Young Angelica (Caitlin Wax), running through the woods, almost suffered from two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuel Vaugier), who simply come to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelica's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is an extremely right holy roller who will do everything so that his daughter does not have an abortion. If nothing else, Pro-Life has had some buzz for its controversial issue, but John Carpenter views this whole venture with astounding indifference — it seems he is even less interested in making the film than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); slow stimulation does not create tension and simply confuses the already ambitious plot. Even when Dwayne and his sons stormed the clinic, flashing a weapon, this is an amazing event; later, when doctors are tortured with a “male abortion,” the scene turns out to be unreasonable and unnecessary — an attempt to supplement the signed film. Poor performance (unfortunately, Perlman is lost here) becomes the result of the script, and Carpenter’s management seems exhausted, as if Pro-Life is the source of his next hot meal. By the time a human-headed spider creature and a guy in latex suit roam the corridors, you're just wondering what the minds behind this mess were thinking ...
