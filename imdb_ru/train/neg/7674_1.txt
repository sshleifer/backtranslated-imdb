True, there are many films that are much worse than this film. This film was not “Manos: Hands of Fate” or “Troll 2” (yes, I saw them both ... twice), but at the same time, this film is not Alien, Predator or even Alien vs.. Predator (Yes, even this film has surpassed it). These movies make Battlefield Earth like Star Wars, it's so bad. Razzie Award Lookout, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This movie I'm talking about, of course, is Alone in the Dark. I will try to show you why this film was so bad. <br /> <br /> At first, I’ll start by saying that it may have been the best component of this film (next to the final credits that played “It’s a pity I didn’t have an angel,” acting skills. Christian Slater should be , proud of himself, he successfully proved that you can behave decently in a film worse than drinking antifreeze, although all his terrible dialogue he had had was speaking, it made me wonder why he just didn’t leave the stage halfway down. due to the fact that Stephen Dorff also starred in the film (someone whom he would like to be but failed to u in it.) Tara Reid is a bad actress, but she looks good, and that’s all that really matters in films like this. It doesn’t mean that the acting was perfect, although it was average, bad, and perhaps the only thing in the film, not very good. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - Except for “I wish I had an angel”, the soundtrack is a meaningless and heavy heavy medal pumped into the ears of the audience, perhaps before disguise a horrible story ( that I will get soon). The long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now available for those who have music difficulties. <br /> <br /> The director is the director of the beloved Hollywood director Uwe Boll, who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us: “Yes, films can become so terrible, and this is only the beginning of my deadly story about horrible films.” At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Boll. If I had not been told, I would have suggested that the monkey had been kidnapped from Congo, brought here and forced to form an opinion on how to make a film under the threat of shock. The director of the photo was probably a video camera attached to a skateboard and pushed forward until it hit the wall. In scenes where the camera should remain motionless, it constantly moves, not allowing us to stop somewhere, and when it should move in action, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> Producing - Who on earth is stupid enough to invest in this bomb? I'm sorry for the fool ... sometimes. Sometimes I am glad that he or she was taught such a lesson that never investing money in the trash is worse than a dog droppings tied in a bag. <br /> <br /> “Writing / Storyboard - trying to analyze”, the story is more painful and then an ice pick stuck under the thumb and hit the soccer ball as hard as I could, right after that, but I’ll still try. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby fled as a child from an orphanage, where there are 20 children, where to go on scientific experiments. He runs away and hides in an electrical outlet, where he is killed by current (at that moment everything became so bad that I started laughing loudly). Then many years later, he became a paranoia detective. He is attacked by some kind of zombie, which can not be shot, he kills him and leaves with life. Later, he is attacked by some crazy looking monster, and he reveals secrets that no one knows. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, really very bad. The film expects us to read in about 10 minutes, which seems like a 100, random text about an unfaithful civilization called Abskani. The film does not have one turn after another, more than the audience can stand, more than the viewer wants, more than the viewer can ever worry about. This storyline is terrible that even Double Dragon does it better. <br /> <br /> In general, skip this movie. I gave him 1 out of 10, but this is because there is no 0.
