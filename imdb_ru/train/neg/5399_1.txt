SPOILERS Too often, Hollywood film versions of Shakespeare entertain parts of the movie. Beautifully shot, they are well executed and true to the text. Films, including Henry V Brann and Much Ado About Nothing, 1993 are powerful works. Therefore, looking at "Love's Labour's Lost", it is such a huge disappointment for expecting him to be so badly thrown into the empty. Unfortunately, "Love's Labour's Lost" is terrible! The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends for three years refused to drink and women to focus on their studies. However, plans begin to crumble when the mysterious princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her entourage arrive. Soon, love is in the air, and philosophy leaves the prince's head. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning you understand that this film is not exactly Shakespeare. Skilfully transferred to the Ken Branagus musical of the 1930s, the plot is still there and the script remains, but now it has been sacrificed for a terrible musical taste. Classics such as “What you look like tonight,” “Let's look into the eyes of music and dance,” “I am in heaven,” are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feeling that they simply do not belong here. <br /> In addition to weak singing, we are also attracted by the increasing number of awkward performances of permanent stars. Ken Bran and his friends may be happy to make this film, but they provide us with an amazing collection of roles. <br /> <br /> All eight main actors (four men and four women) are equally scary and the only positive ones on their behalf - a huge improvement in really terrible Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one person leaves the film worthy of all praise, and it is the ever-magnificent Nathan Lane. Over the years, Lane has proved that he is a comedy genius, and in this role, he again adds humor to the clown Costard. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is little to say. Love's Labour's Lost deserves easy praise for Bran’s original perception of the old story. Unfortunately, the positives end there. Poorly performed, performed, sung and constructed, Lost Labor of Love is perhaps the weakest adaptation of Shakespeare in the last forty years. It should be avoided like the plague, and should never have been done. Bran's bad, disappointing choice, and here we hope that his next effort will be better.
