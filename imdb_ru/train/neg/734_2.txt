This movie was shit with a capital "C". The opening scene showed a promise. But this “promise” was broken soon after the viewer knew where the plot was going. <br /> <br /> And the wooden statue of Morty, who was rather creepy in the original film, looks silly in this film. Obviously, it was just a guy in a cheap plastic suit. (And by the way, who else thinks Morty is one of the worst names on planet Earth? He stands right there with Jimmy or Fred when it comes to horror. Or why not just call wooden the statute of Henry the devil-Kissinger. “Run, this is Dr. Kissinger!” That would be as scary as “Morty.” <br /> <br /> And then there is a scene where the “hero” hits his father's Tombstone with - - “a sledgehammer?” You can guess - “two by four?” Someone can take a risk. No, he angrily beats his father's gravestone with a branch - a damn branch. But Worse, when the characters leave t, the tombstone is actually and inexplicably bleeding. Oh, brother! <br /> <br /> There is another Indian guy who lives with the main character's grandparents, but obviously does not do anything other than Care for Morty. He perpetuates the terrible legends of Morty, warns those who laugh, and even corrects Morty’s hand when she is injured during childish pranks. But with all his respect and tenderness for Morty, does Morty give the rat a hairy back? <br /> <br /> The film is delayed, and in the end several people die the way it fits their worst fears (sort of). This film is a real yawn. Do not give up.
