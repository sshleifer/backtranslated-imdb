This movie is terrible. Everything in it was done before. There is nothing original. I hate it when the writers do not invent their own stories. <br /> <br /> A girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, that sounds very much like an 80s movie called Big. What is even more annoying is the acting game Jennifer Garner. She doesn't act like she is 13, she just acts like she is stupid. <br /> <br /> From this point on you can guess the whole plot. She gets a good job, and it so happens that her friend is 13 years old working with her. Wow, how cool! But no ... her friend is bad and turns her on trying to get a job. But, of course, she wins in the end when she gets a “great” idea. <br /> <br /> There is a dance scene in the movie that I saw a thousand times before. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
