This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers this to you for free, tell them NO. This film makes you stupid, knowing that you watched it. The plot is not even the worst part of this film ... it's a game of actors, camera work, lighting and sound. There is absolutely nothing to love in this movie. Whoever paid to make this film is now broken. I hope the director will never get the green light for another movie. In his defense, this film was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual capture of the BTK killer, but I saw the film of weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to that
