This film is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is funny, like a bag of hammers. Her harsh behavior from "Law and Order" is carried over by a failed comedy attempt. Charlie Sheen - the only one who remained unscathed in this terrible anticommedia. The only positive thing that can be learned from this mess is the marriage of Charlie and Denise. Hope this effort will give better results.
