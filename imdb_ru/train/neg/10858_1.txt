I did not know if I would laugh or cry when I saw this. Only addicted Danny's dirt fans can try it. It should be a horror movie, but there is only dirt in it. The coolest scene is a car accident with real special effects from the best works of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. See it just to learn how bad a movie can be ................
