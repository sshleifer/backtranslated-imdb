This film is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half, it seems to be close to 4. I have never seen a movie moving so slowly and without a goal. This is also a horror film that happens during the daytime. My friend and I laughed a crazy amount of times when we probably should have been frightened. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible film was released in many countries. This may not be so in high demand. <br /> <br /> Supermodel Nicole Petty has to stick to the model, because, despite the fact that she is beautiful, in this film she lost her accent so many times, sheâ€™s British half the time and half American.
