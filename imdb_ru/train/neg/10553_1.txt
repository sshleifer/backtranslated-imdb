I bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it was. I thought, “Hmmm, the film“ The Man-Mutilation ”should be, if not very funny, at least filled with blood.” It was not funny, good. It was anxious. Very anxious. And I don't mind disturbing films, but this one simply meant nothing, except that child abuse is not a good thing. hmmm ... the image quality was terrible. Acting ... there was no acting skills. Just some jerk who mutilated himself more than 90 minutes. This is probably material for a madman when he is in a hurry with strong blood. <br /> <br /> Don't look. It is not worth your time. It's just awful. I wish I had ever bought this. <br /> <br /> They must disfigure the guy who did it.
