Suppose you have been on a desert island for the past ten years. Did not hear about Scream and left when Halloween Part 1 entered the cinema. Then this film would be a blast and a completely new look at the horror scene. <br /> <br /> At the moment, the IMDb rating is 2.7, and it does not deserve such a low rating. Cutting through all the way, like, “I know what you did,” and someone — that when I came to the end, convinced me of who and why. <br /> <br /> Not a big surprise, just a good movie to watch with coke, popcorn and without the desire to get a complex plot, deep characters. If the rental video is not included in the top headers, you can take it without risk, but do not expect a masterpiece. I have seen much worse.
