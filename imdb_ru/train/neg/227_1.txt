Was it a comedy or a serious drama? This film begins with carefree banter between three women. Good. It conflicts with women when one of them meets a man. Good. Between them there are several antics. Good. But when the plot thickens and finally turns black, I began to wonder if I interpreted the first part of the film incorrectly. This continues in the same vein for some time, until, finally, he tries to return to the original carefree banter. But it's too late now. It is difficult to understand why these women were still talking to each other, and the final is not convincing. Indeed a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) on how not to shoot films. Itâ€™s hard to understand how the producers convinced themselves that this film would work. And the box office showed that it was a real failure, because I had never heard of this movie before this weekend (four years after its release).
