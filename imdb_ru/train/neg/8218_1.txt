I have never finished this film for the reason it was terrible, and it is just an action. I wasn’t even sure that the film was that it didn’t make much sense, and the violence was terrible. I mean, I usually like some naked figure in a movie (laughs), but she just hurt because of what was happening. ALL characters annoyed me, and it was just full of loud cries, and the camera shook piecemeal, and it looked like a continuation of the game with the project, but without any good qualities. This is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time and would like, please, go back. I would not recommend this film to anyone and would not even think about it. (N)
