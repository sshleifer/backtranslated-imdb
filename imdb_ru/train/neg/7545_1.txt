Unfortunately, you can’t go below one star. Before watching “The Wicker Man,” I thought that “Aliens 3” was the only film that actually deserves negative stars. In fairness, The Wicker Man does not detract from the pleasure of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative pleasure from watching the film has decreased due to watching it. <br /> <br /> There is a cheap trick. often used in Hollywood, when producers are too stingy to hire good writers, or too hasty to allow them to bring the story to a satisfactory result: a slap in the shocking end and the hope that the public will take it for something artistic or meaningful. This is a gambit, which is rarely successful, and in this case, he can only splash embarrassment on a great actor and make fun of producers. Moreover, the “carefully thought out” (or, as they expressed it) conclusion does not seem to follow logically from the plot (which, naturally, I cannot clarify without introducing spoilers), but instead nullifies what the plot deserves . up to this point. <br /> <br /> This is a film that can logically please psychopaths, pedophiles, and perhaps inflexible Nicholas Cage fans, but only a few of the mainstream audience. If you really want something in this spirit, I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalan's “Village”. Not having any memory-erasing pill, I suppose I need to look at something better, to get it out of my head, say, "Attack of killer tomatoes" or "Pee-Wee's big adventure"?
