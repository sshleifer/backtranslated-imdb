Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the comedy film was a good acting game - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell - it simply was not a fascinating film. The shogi between comedy and tragedy were awkward, and sometimes not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the support cast is different in the two halves; I thought about how everything was set out in the opening scene, that the people around Melinda would be the same people, just reacting differently (rather, in the message “He said, she said”). However, we have two completely different stories and two completely different women who both played Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> Two playwrights in the debut scene - a comedian and a tragedian - presumably take the same premise and get out of there, but these two stories are only slightly related. They do little to support the topic of discussion, which is that almost everything can be seen as a comedy or a tragedy. Good cast, but disappointing movie.
