If it were not for "Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malta, this B-film would not be worth one sector of my Tivo disk space! At what low rental warehouse, in the rear section, did the proposed space port take pictures? "People of continuity!" This is the main principle in the creation of real films! At night, the expected space port, and in the daytime (day and night on the space station?) Warehouse! ??!? People please! The only thing for which I will recommend this film is the wardrobe department. for the constant maintenance of Natassia in these tight-fitting figures exposing clothes! Even the women who saw this bomb should appreciate the outfits in which she apparently spent some time, every day of filming! A science fiction channel would be better to show the SpaceBalls! At the very least, there would be real humor when I watched something incredible. <br /> <br /> PS Michael Ironside, please dismiss your agent as soon as possible! You are so much better than an actor that you are even associated with this level of film making.
