I just watched this movie last night, and I had to warn everyone who wants to watch this movie. In a word - no. I seriously feel that this is what the writing student would have written in the Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, that is, every other word was a dirty word. I do not have problems with abundant curses, as in "The Hunt for Goodwill", provided that it helps to delve into the characters. In this case, it was just empty talk with an attempt to cause a random * sigh * or audience laughter. All three protagonists are their own unique stereotype, Wall Street moron, moron in a coffee shop and “I'm not gay, but just to the touch, with my female side”, a little bit less in their snatch. You just do not care for any of them! All of them are small, irrecoverable losers, whom you WANT to see losers. For those who dare, this film has a couple of fun moments, the very beginning and the very end. The scene in the toilet / vibrator is funny in a sense, "Yes, yes." True, I would recommend this film only to his worst enemies.
