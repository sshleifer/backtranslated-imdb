This is only a response from Yahoo, which says that this film is more realistic than the classic genre that defines MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, the cerebral, great white (and other species of sharks, bulls, blacks, oceanic whiteheads, tigers) are known to inhabit areas where easy prey is found. People do not often get on this menu, but the shark in the film has repeatedly pointed to abnormal behavior. It is not like it ever was. The probability that the killer whale will destroy almost the entire city, chooses a man-sworn enemy, drowns several dozen dense fishing boats in the North Atlantic, and understands when certain people, all friends of the “sworn enemy” mentioned above, are close enough to the water to achieve , so thin to be funny. Just like this turd is a fake jaw. Ridiculous. Great white sharks are known to chew boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, because they look like seals from below. A Bruce-sized shark (if you don’t know, look at it) will be more than capable of sinking a boat similar to Orc (hey! This is the name of a crying robbery that we are discussing!), Since it will weigh over 6000 pounds. I could go on, but I do not need. The jaws are amazing (the best game, the best effects, the best music, the best composition), Orca is crap (BLAGLING jaws, lousy writing, disgusting effects, the most ridiculous plot on this side of Olson Gemini). It is not necessary for masters from Columbia University to see this. Watch the best movies.
