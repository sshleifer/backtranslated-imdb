I just want to say that this production is very one-sided, violates the impartiality required if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> The people they interviewed have no merit, so you can’t have an idea if they deserve to be heard. <br /> <br /> Tells the story from only one point of view. It is very dangerous to do this, because the next generations teach a bad idea, and therefore wars continue. I know that this is not the only reason for wars, but that does not help either. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary, but you’ve read it a lot before. The Balkans are as complex as human history.
