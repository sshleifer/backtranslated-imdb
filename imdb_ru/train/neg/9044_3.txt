I really wanted this film to be liked, but most of it was stolen / borrowed from another work - some borrowings cry out in agony. The review of the New York Times noted that their singing frog terribly resembles the one shown in the famous Warner Brothers cartoon (“Hello, baby, hello, my dear,” hello, my girl ... ”). But I call everyone who watches Fox / Blue Sky Robots (2005) animated films, and does not find the absurd similarities in: the storyline - the young inventor is growing up, and one innovative corporation spreads all the great inventions. cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture very similar futuristic urban conditions. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - The servant robot in the Robinson house is very similar to the ones in Robots, and both films use a kind of retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> It all seems to be in stark contrast with Disney’s disgusting quote at the end, implying that the company was a steady innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s, which were largely clones of each other, with some minor changes in the storyline and ethnicity. The filmmakers seem to be unable to let the stories speak independently, and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction, as though we have no concentration on anything less. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well designed and brilliantly animated, and pleasant to watch. Most of the rest of the film seems thrown together. Some landscapes Looks like the mid-90s CGI. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Mickey Mouse's classic short film, and by the end of this cartoon we were reminded that Disney was never interested in innovation or good storytelling - they seem to think that simple appearance of something big m screen is sufficient proof of their advantages.
