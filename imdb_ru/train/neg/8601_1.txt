Ok, where to start with this little pearl? Mutant slugs begin to seize the small town of New England (?). Only one person can stop them ... and this person ... is Mike Brady! Now, if it wasn't funny enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> Video of slugs is what is known as stock video. Regardless of who attacks the slugs or where they are, the same shot is shown of heaps of slugs that trickle everywhere. Keep in mind that this special shot takes up at least half the film. <br /> <br /> In the film, they filmed, pulled out, stole a purse, beat a girlfriend, killed a dog, BAD. I'm sure there is worse, but it will be difficult to find it. The only gem was ... you guessed it .... Mike Brady! He must have taken some night classes at the YMCA, because he was the best in the group. <br /> <br /> As for horror? This film can not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They are bullets for crying out loud. The entire rebellion could have been avoided with the help of a salt shaker or two. You can watch this film only in an environment like MST3K, otherwise I see serious brain damage.
