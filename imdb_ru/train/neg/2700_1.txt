Despite or perhaps partly due to the clever use of music to emphasize the motivation and ideology of each of the main characters, stereotypes are present, and likelihood and characterization are absent from this not too subtle cinematic tie. <br /> <br /> One gets the feeling that John Singleton indulged in poststructuralist literary theory because it was the scent of the day, and “Higher Education” was a biased result. The bottom point of the film is the “world” rally, in which the symbols of the “free love” movement of the 1960s are reassigned to something that more closely resembles the “Return of the Night” rally with lively, astute, personality-conscious musical acts. towed Perhaps, in his stiff revisionism, the director is trying to argue that identity politics is new Vietnam? Oh, how his Adrienne Rich and shooting Remi in the crowd is a nice touch if you are into Rich's political posturing. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this movie negative stars. I can recommend it only to those who are interested in the 1990s as history, a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race, class and gender into popular culture and declared hatred of man "a viable and honorable POLITICAL option." Where is Camilla Palya when you need her?
