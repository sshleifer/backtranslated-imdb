Dreyfuss plays the Mafia boss, who has gone mad, but now he's "fixed." Lane - his girlfriend, who is idle with his number one (Goldblum), who should do something with his sister Lane (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With the fact that anyone can be considered an actor supporting all the stars (Bert) Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even Richard Pryor’s performance) cannot help this plot, since Dreyfus proves that he not "fixed" and trying to kill almost everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know, it doesn't seem like you didn’t know what will happen. The first ten minutes were nothing more than the guys who were trying to tell Goldblum what awaits him when Dreyfus comes out, but I will spare you the trouble: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The actual reason I chose this film is because I was recently hit by Diane Lane and tried to see all of her films. This disappointment for me was not only a horrible story, but also the fact that it did not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the film (although we hear about it throughout the film). Even being a fan of more than half the actors, I will not be able to enjoy this film. The parts where the superstructure was supposed to be made me laugh at what was really going on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
