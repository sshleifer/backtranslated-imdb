"Web" is an example of many examples of films that show strong, sometimes noteworthy performances and bright moments, but, unfortunately, are destroyed and dramatically slowed down by a dark plot and interest the audience very little. In the role of Richard Widmark - a doctor working in a psychiatric hospital, whose life becomes muddled due to family problems and rather ridiculous and overloaded with conflict, which in fact does not look so big. The time has come for the institution to get new curtains for the library windows. One old woman wants to put her curtains on them, but many patients want to make their own. And somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally crazy conflict grows to such an extent that lives are endangered and families begin to disintegrate. This is more like a conflict that can occur between very small children. <br /> <br /> The question of the logic of the plot and whether this can really happen is so great that the question arises: can a real madman? buy it. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the game. The cast following Vidmark includes other great actors, many of whom are Oscar nominees and winners. And sometimes there is a moment in a movie that works brilliantly, but it always excludes the silly story about window curtains. Unfortunately, too much about draped draperies, and therefore the film slows down. Many pictures are long and taken from one camera point of view, keeping to slow stimulation and lack of interest in viewing. <br /> <br /> In the brief analysis, “Web” is an unrecognized film, and it becomes obvious why the audience basically, as soon as the story gets into focus, happens quite quickly. In fact, it’s not very fun to watch, and I tell you that it’s not so fun to watch.
