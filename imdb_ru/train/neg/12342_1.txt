Anyone familiar with my reviews in the movie database on the Internet will know that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time. There are a lot of films that I donâ€™t like, and for some unknown reason I have a desire to reconsider. However, if anyone is interested in finding out the title of the worst movie I've ever seen, look no more than Transylvania 6-5000. Without a doubt, this name for all time is not. 1 terrible movie. I can not believe that I really did it from the beginning of this clanker to the finish! <br /> <br /> This is clearly intended to catch the scent of Young Frankenstein Mel Brooks, but where this film was a funny take in the tradition of horror films, it is a desperately tense and erroneous attempt to mix laughter from embarrassingly weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr. look embarrassed that they are here as a couple of journalists in modern Transylvania (they may have realized early that they are doomed to this nonsense). During their research, they encounter all the major monsters from past horror favorites, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who manages to endure this film to the very end can pray to wake up through their hearts to relieve them from the agony of boredom. This marks a nadir career for all participants and proves that when comedy fails to a large extent, it leads to horribly ominous entertainment.
