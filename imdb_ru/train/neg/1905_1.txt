I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably watched more Buster Keaton films for IMDb than any other person. Every film he made from the beginning of his career until the early 30s, with only two exceptions, I reviewed, so you can say that I am a big fan. It is because of this that I found this episode so painful and difficult to watch. I loved the films of this man and kept thinking "Buster, how could you?!" Well, now that I think about it, I think I understand why Buster Keaton appeared in this horrible episode of the Twilight Zone. He lost most of his fortune after a dirty divorce in the early 1930s, and his film career as a leading person has also been long gone. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed money, and he liked his revival of popularity, so he became the property of everyone who wanted to pay - appearing in the films "Beach" and in this mess episode from a wonderful TV series. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the episode is that it’s just badly written, and Buster deserves much better. The show should be fun, but it’s not, and instead of respecting dumb films, it’s just painful to watch - especially when Keaton puts on this stupid time-traveling helmet, as well as all poorly executed farces. Do yourself a favor, miss it - this is a pale imitation of greatness that once was Keaton's career !!!
