This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I cannot, with a clear conscience, allow me not to watch this movie. People need to be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in “zero”) <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weiss and Christopher Walken, and yet I hated This movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there is no script. The dialogue is unreal and boring, the situation is far-fetched, the course of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are not sympathetic and uninteresting, and the story, although based on a good premise, is stupid. This film is part of a poop. <br /> <br /> Do not forget to spend money on this film, it is not even worth your TIME spent on watching it. Please do not see this ... I beg you!
