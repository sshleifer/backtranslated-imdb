I liked the first movie, but this is an example of a sequel textbook, which is best left on the drawing board. The general idea in the first film was, if not great, then at least very interesting. This sequel tries to build on the idea and characters of the first film, and although Christopher Walken is still as good as Gabriel, the idea suddenly becomes a little ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these films yet, then take the first film and forget about the sequels, they can throw all the joy out of the original.
