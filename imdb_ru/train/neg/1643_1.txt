Whipped is one of the worst films of all time. This is a disgusting, hated piece of rubbish that made me stay in the theater more than any other 2000 film, except maybe Grinch. This is not, as people call it, an insightful portrait of modern relationships. It would be a little movie called “High Fidelity”. While this film was honest and sympathetic, “Whipped” is a hostile, cynical, misanthropic cinematic poison. Avoid this, as well as many other disasters, if only you do not want to see how truly “comedy” can become bad.
