It is difficult to say what was the worst in this show: bad game, bad acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, inappropriate for this period of staging, bad script. It would be nice if the script followed the original story a little closer - there is enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a lot of good material and a better storyline than the writers could have come up with. <Br /> <br /> And why introduce a new strange weapon, such as a crossbow, which shoots from explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I see that this film was shot in just 21 days. This is manifested in a lack of quality. I'm starting to think that this is a general (bad) attitude that the Sci-Fi channel (and others) has been following when it comes to making films from classic stories over the past few years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
