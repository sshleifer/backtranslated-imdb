I don’t know much about Tobe Hooper or why he got his name in the title, but maybe he shouldn’t have to worry. As another commentator noted, there really is not enough horror or eroticism to attract fans of any genre. The plot is inconsistent, Shade's sequences are free, and most actions are so-so. Englund tried his best with weak material, and Zoya Trilling has a really big bottom, but neither one nor the other is enough to carry this film. This is a ribbon. Rating: F
