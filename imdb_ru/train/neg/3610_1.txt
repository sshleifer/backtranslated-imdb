The patient escapes from a mental hospital, killing one of his guardians, and then a university professor after he gets to the local college. In the next semester, the replacement of the deceased professor and a new group of students must deal with a new party of murders. The dialogue is so trivial that it is hard to believe that I could predict strings in quotes. This is one of those cheap films that were shot in the mid 80s. Despite the murder of the heroine, it is just poor-quality garbage. Awful game, horrible script, terrible effects, terribly awful awful !! “Splatter University” is just dirt to put in your VCR when you have nothing to do, although I advise you to watch the tape for cleaning your head, it would be more exciting. Skip it and rent a "Girl's Nite Out". <br /> <br /> Rated for strong graphic abuse, profanity, short nudity and sexual situations.
