I thought this movie would be much better than it was. It sounded like a hoax from a spy general, and the beginning reminded me of Pleasantville, but this film failed. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia opened a spy school to train their spies on how to behave like Americans, but the city they created for training is a bit outdated, so they take two US bars to spice things up. I do not know, but it seems to be only there. It is strange to be strange when no one in this Russian city speaks with a Russian accent. Someone screwed up on the casting. <br /> <br /> Also, for comedy it is painfully dry. There is one, two funny tops, and they have nothing to sing and dance about. In the end, the film is likely to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> And, like a perverted blow to the face, this film is so about the USA that it makes me sick. The film says again and again that the USA is God, and Russia is the devil. This kind of smear campaign was carried out against the Japanese in World War II. It is these films that make everyone think that the United States is full of itself. <br /> <br /> This gets 4 out of 10, and I'm kind. It really should work, but the dance scene was funny, but on the other hand, it stretched for a very long time to be really funny.
