.... because if I were, I might wish to be crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to define the plot of this film - and I am “generous”, that for a start there was even a plot. As mentioned earlier, the DVD cover incorrectly states that Richard Dreyfuss is actually a star. He was barely in the film. And if he really was “upset”, as indicated on the back cover, then probably it is because he said YES to be in this catastrophe of the film and could not get out of it! It seemed that the film was really focused on Jared Martin, and the fact that his role in the film should have been, apart from extreme close-ups, was not such a big mystery as Gene Barry actually was - or not, And speaking of "big" ... whoever had the brilliant idea to dress Gina Barry in Humpty Dumpty clothes, demonstrating that his pants are literally pulled up to his chin, he should be sentenced to difficult times, having watched this sober film. I could go on and talk about how terrible this film was, from a dialogue that does not coincide with the mouth of the “actors” (for example, “Clutch Load”) to a random jump from stage to scene (again, being generous, even causing frames of pictures "scenes"), due to the lack of plot .... However, if you are in a bad genre of the early 70s and if you are in a cottage in Michigan, where there is nothing except this film and a box with pictures of children and cats I, before going to this strange way to the cinema, recommend yourself a good bottle of wine, because you will be grateful that may not think about it the next day!
