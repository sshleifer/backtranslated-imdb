This is certainly one of the worst films ever created and released by a major Hollywood studio. The plot is just stupid. The dialogue is written in a clich√©; because of this, you can complete the set of sentences in the script. The game is ridiculously bad, especially the role of Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is stupid and completely non-erotic. One can only feel sorry for the reviewer who saw the 23-year-old Yvonne's dance as sexy; it's just a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is especially funny. If you like bad movies and you like to laugh at some Hollywood turkeys, this is for you. I bought a color version on VHS, which makes the film even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when she is painted, all the time looks like a clown. And she is the best part of this movie. What a way to start a career.
