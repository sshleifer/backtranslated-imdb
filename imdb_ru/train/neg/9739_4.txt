This is not so much that SPONTANEOUS BURNING has little potential. Indeed, the insufficiently studied title phenomenon is quite intriguing, and, at least in the first half, this effort Tobe Hooper promises to entertain in such a way that only the cheesy horror of the 90s can.

Of course, the average guys do not long remain average in horror films, so after a well-made initial outline, we see how different parts of Samâ€™s body begin to ignite. Soon, he sets fire to other people, much to the dismay of Gal Liz, played by Sentius Bane. Unnoticed. <br /> <br /> Although the name of the film implies a fiery happy monster at large, director Hooper decided to make Sam an involuntary killer.

We can only think about whether it would work better if we would undertake a direct struggle of the villains in the spirit of NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. <br /> <br /> Self-ignition is quite a nominal force when all is said and done. This will attract additional attraction for Duriff fans and those who cannot get enough of the horror of the 1990s, be it good, bad or in between, but only at a slow night.
