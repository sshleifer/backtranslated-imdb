Full House is one of the worst TV shows ever! Why? Because all the characters are so annoying that they are impossible to bear. The best hero is Joey, although sometimes he is very annoying. This DJ girl who wrote her character? I want to kill myself every time she speaks. mention when Danny starts with his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: a DJ won about ten thousand dollars or more at a casino. However, she is not eighteen, so she should not gamble in accordance with the law. ready to pay her money, but then Danny, her father caught her and did not let her collect this money, because she is not eighteen years old. C'mon, give me a break, right? Since I saw this stupid and childish Scene, which I instantly turned off. Some things that are said in this series, even the child would not have bought. Who in the world would have thought that Full House is interesting and fun? this. Except that Shakespeare knew how to write, and besides that he would not be childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for a full house! <br /> <br /> For all those who have a bad heart, poor health, will to live or a sense of the real world, I strongly recommend “Do not watch a full house”! The episode as an experiment. Avoid this series. Rid yourself of stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst television show ever! I would prefer to watch teletubbies, whereas this. "Don't watch this."
