This film is a waste of time and money. For the whole hour and a half, I kept waiting until everything was better, and it never worked. It was a slow movement, the plot was bouncing, it was not scary or interesting, and really never meant anything. The credits at the time of the introduction were long and drawn out, which was basically like the rest of the film (long and drawn out). Numerous parts of the plot did not make sense. Several times during the film, I thought that maybe I “disconnected” because the inconsistency of the plot, however, my companion had the same problem, and assured me that I was not “disconnected” from boredom, but this there really was a film. Actually, I have never written about a film here before and for many years I have been actively watching films on IMDb. Therefore, the fact that I actually spend time writing something speaks about how bad this film is, and that you should not waste your time or money on it.
