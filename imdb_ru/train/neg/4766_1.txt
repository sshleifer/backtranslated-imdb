You can say they spent $ 5 doing it. It's a waste of your time ... phew ... there is nothing remotely good about this movie ... ... I don't know why I kept watching it ... chick is not a hot, horrible game .. you could do all that Anyway, it's better to use your time ... like watching TV, playing crappy video games ... I feel robbed. just robbed .. of my time. I have never done movie reviews before, as you can probably say, but in this movie I felt that I needed to save the poor souls who are going to look at it and look at IMDb before looking at whether it is decent and looking at the comments . - there was no action - - no hot chicks - - no budget - - damn it, actress - it screams about a bad movie. **** ALL movie in the room. ***
