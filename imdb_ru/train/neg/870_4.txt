By the end of this thriller, the haggard image of the last days of Ellie Sheedy is creatively used to create more than one sinister, sinister image. She convinces one that if a nasty role like Bette Davis comes on her way, she will be able to cope with it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons to see this. If you are wondering what Shidi looks like in old-fashioned glasses (but why would someone?), Then that's your answer. Otherwise, the crazy mad woman Sally Kirkland is really tiring, and even if you like these things more than me, you have to admit that the tension in these scenes is greatly reduced. Savage's drunken livestock insurance agent is equally unpleasant, but at least it's a small part. From leading actors Nicholas Walker does not inspire any sympathy for the plight of Paul Keller, and his acting is wooden. Dara Tomanovich is better, and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises a little. Shediâ€™s meticulous, discreet work (although she often appears on autopilot) is amazing in itself, but out of context with the rest. The kits are dim, camera work is unremarkable.
