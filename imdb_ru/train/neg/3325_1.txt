Hated it. If you think that everyone in the south is stupid, morally bankrupt, stupid, cruel, religious, or child molesters, then this film may be for you. All are poor and seem ignorant. In one scene, two older men talk in a department store, and one mentions that he molested his sister before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other clearly perceived it as a normal part of life. Very good. A teenage girl walks along a country road in search of her sister, and no one offers to help her - despite the obvious lameness and lack of food or water (without a backpack, etc.). Strathern's character is not only disgusting and slimy, but he is shown to be a religious believer who (typically in Hollywood) reflects the vile nature of Christians. The scene in the film is very reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (the scene with De Niro) - the bible verses show off the bad guy. I am from the Greater Northwest, but I found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
