I watched this movie for a love project. Please tell Nicholas Cage to find out what it is like to be his character, and then re-read the words he says. My life cannot go on ... I accidentally cut off my hand ... my brother was near. Obviously his fault. And since then, when the happy ending included a nice guy who cares about his mom sad and lonely. No closure, bad script, and insufficient extension of minor characters. Save yourself, if you do not laugh. The costumes were done properly, and the extras did an incredible job. I’m sure it would be a funny movie, but I have to recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it’s not an intelligent movie. This is not a chick. This is not a strict romantic. And I can not show children because of sex and questions to follow. In general, just not a good movie.
