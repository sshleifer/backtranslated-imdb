First let me say that I am not a fan of the dukes, but after this film the series looked like Law and Order. Worst of all was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not the Boss Hogg, and MS was even worse. Geyni as Roscoe, If they ever watched the show, Roscoe was not a tough cop. He was more like Barney Fife than the role he played in this film. <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with normal errors, the machines break and continue, as if nothing had happened. The worst example of this is when the General gets together with Billy Prickett and the General encounters a dirty hill, clearly slowing down to almost stopping, but continues to win the race.
