This movie comes straight from the dark dungeons of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and fortune in the first half of the 90s, creating terribly bad and stupid horror films. The most famous disasters in their work are "Subspecies", "Seed" and "Transvestites". None of this is recommended, and Dr. Mordrid, in fact, also. The hyperactive director Charles Band really came to the right company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is surprisingly dull, gentle and almost completely devoid of humor. I just saw it, because it stars Jeffrey Combs. I learned that he may have several flaws if you are a fan of him. It seems that for every good movie he made the 5 worst. In any case, the story of the battle between the two ancient sorcerers. One good one that has been here for 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey, Dr. Mordrid), and one evil one named Kabal. He wants to destroy all forms of human life for some reason, which I have already forgotten. Combs receives his instructions from a mentor. This "guy" exists only from a pair of eyes in space. Very, very cheesy, that is! From time to time a dazzling flash of light is shown on the screen, but this is the only form of special effects this film has. All this is just a piece of whining and whining, and when the two wizards finally collide with each other, it's all over before you know it ... I would expect that the wicked wizard to fight back a little, but neaaaaaaaaaaa ... In some scenes, you can actually discover some originality and creativity (for example, Jeffrey’s lecture on the influence of the moon on criminals), and if you really pay attention, you may even find some very small but pleasant aspects (for example, a crow). which is called Edgar Allen), but overall it’s a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Geoffrey, and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes ... but he is sure that you do not need to wear silly letters.
