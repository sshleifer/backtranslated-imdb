I really don't like this movie. If you read Puzo’s books or at least watched the first two films very carefully (especially the first one), you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the saint of Corleone, presented by Poozo novel, the script of this film is sometimes even laughable. The characters and the relationships between them are distorted. The story ends with the fact that it is not going anywhere, although it seems to be moving in some direction during the film. <br /> <br /> It is clear that we should expect different times for the Corleone saga in the 90s, and that we are not going to find things as they were before. But, on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some of the dialogues from other films in cases where they did not fit. Why is this? This is similar to those poorly made sequels that are simply trying to copy the qualities of the original film. <br /> <br /> What will never be clear is that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have teamed up to do it. The man who put on such plays as Apocalypse Now and The Godfather must be forgiven for almost everything he does in the movie until his death. Just like Al Pacino for being an actor. But Mario Puzo should not have written it. How so? He damaged all his previous work. What a shame, my friend. Roman Puzo “The Last Don” is the story of the 90s about the crowd, and it's great. We can never say the same about the conspiracy for Godfather III.
