This is another one of those disgusting films that you will find on Lifetime TV, which depict the disgusting behavior of some disgusting woman with sympathy. Along with other such dirty films as “The Burning Bed”, “Enough” or “Monster”, this film shoots a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why she is not such a bad person. Give us a break! Here is my question to the filmmakers: if Leturno was a man, and Willy was a 12-year-old girl, would you make a picture that sympathizes with and sympathizes with this man? Answer: No, damn it. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you have changed sex in this film, and then you will understand why I and others here consider it as useless rubbish. If the genders had changed, there would have been no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we will most likely be treated with an image of a monstrous and disgusting man who hunts a young girl, his depraved behavior, who put him in prison, and his brainwashed victims, suffering from Stockholm syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same appeal in this film is because of its gender. <br /> <br /> Let's call a spade a spade. Leturno pedophile. Simply and easily. No, if and or but. She is a criminal who is in prison and deserves our mockery and contempt, but certainly not our pity or sympathy.
