Summary: Ron is going to marry Mel. They are deeply loved and confident that they are perfect for each other, even if they met only a few months ago. Todd, Ron's future son-in-law, is not so happy. He fears that marriage is a threat to his comfortable work in the family business, and decides to arrange a Ron bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromise situation, get evidence and smash Ron and Mel. <br /> <br /> Comments: It is assumed that this is a continuation of the classic comedy, but it is not at all funny. This is basically a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse to show poorly dressed women. In fact, in a sense, it is impressive that many of them can be inserted there, because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, this is also one of the hallmarks of a film that cannot sustain itself. It's just not good enough. <br /> <br /> He has three points of redemption or three actors who are worth a better script than this one. This is the main actor Josh Cook, who really manages to give the impression of some common sense. Sarah Foster, I know, has great talent than making such films, and Emanuel Voigier seems to have more talents than in this film. <br /> <br /> What is suspiciously missing is a good joke. Actually, there are few bad jokes too. It's just not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
