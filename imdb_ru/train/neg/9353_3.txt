The name lured me ... I was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and boring story about a wandering Scot. <br /> <br /> The main character is not given a lot of psychological depth if you don’t want to classify tender teenage poetry as psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because the essence of the story could be good, with the best efforts to portray the inner feelings about a person who had to live with alcohol and violence from his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be more like: “I am what I am, because I am.” And a ridiculous unsuccessful attempt to give a poetic advantage to a person from a lower class is even worse. By resorting to the overuse of the "poète maudit" cliche, it quickly fixes a cheap way to make a boring movie seem smart, elaborate and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But “16 years of alcohol” is not very smart, arty or significant ... The main character does not evolve at all, and a weak attempt to change is unsuccessful without a good explanation. Just as the initial attempt was rather unexpected. <br /> <br /> The film borrows heavily from such classics as “A Clockwork Orange” and “Trainspotting”, but ultimately it is not able to regain their greatness even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson paid too much attention to the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest, giving us a film that is pleasing to the eye, but tasteless to the brain.
