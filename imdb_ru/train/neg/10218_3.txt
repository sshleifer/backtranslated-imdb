** Spoilers contained ** <br /> <br /> I heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending, in particular, was terrible. What I did not expect was a complete change of tact in about twenty minutes. What begins as a typical cowboy / Indian western suddenly turns into a very boring romantic comedy about Honus (Soldier Blue with the title performed by Peter Strauss) and the Cross (Candace Bergen), who avoid the onslaught of Cheyenne cavalry. Most of the film then focuses on these two inappropriate people, hence the romantic comedy. Then Donald Pleasant appears and kidnaps them both for no apparent reason. Then they run away and both appear (separately) on a cavalry base on the eve of the attack on the Cheyenne base. Since the Cross used to be married to one of the leaders of the Cheyenne, she escapes from the base of the cavalry and joins them. So far, all the usual. Then comes the end. After working for more than an hour of bad acting, including a clichéd plotline that they / will not receive, the film turns into over-exploitation, including, among other things, beheading and wounding the child in the back of the head. Similarities with Wild Bunch can be seen at this stage of the film, but Wild Bunch retained the same tone and did not resort to extreme unreasonable violence. In a sense, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry’s last summer, which also completely changed tactics for the shock final. I did not hate Soldier Blue and did not find the ending particularly disturbing, but simply found it rather boring with an unjustifiably cruel ending. If you want to watch a movie with truly anxious murder of innocent people, I would recommend “Come and see” Elema Klimov.
