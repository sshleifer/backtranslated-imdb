As a longtime fan of all Star Trek TV shows, I found this episode disappointing, and I wonder if the liberal use of “flashbacks” with the exploits of Will Riker, both positive (and mostly romantic) and negative (a lot of pain and death of a member crew) was a device for saving money, like many of their "show with bottles" (episodes in which all the scenes take place on the "Enterprise"). Diana Maldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final look than this one for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the world of Star Trek, is there another kind?) Were also deceived. This was the last episode of the second season; Thus, the season ended "not with a bang," and "whimper."
