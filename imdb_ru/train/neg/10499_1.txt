Well, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You have been loved by many fans. Now ... this film was not a film at all. It was the Crocodile Hunter TV program with bad play, bad scripts and bad directing between Steve, who shot us or told us about animals. He was engaged in the search for animals / specialist. Millions will miss him. But the very idea of ​​the film was a big mistake. The plot was so disturbed that it almost was not. Casting was terrible. Acting was not even worth elementary school actors. The direction must also be erroneous. If you can't get decent performance halfway through your actors, no matter how bad the script, you shouldn't be so good in the first place. I could write a better script. I wish I had never seen this movie. Of course, I watched him for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son) while spending time with friends who insisted on seeing it instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so picky, liked the movie, but he never asked him to watch it again. If you need fond memories of Steve Irwin, buy his TV series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I would not want to be remembered in this film. Respect him: avoid this movie!
