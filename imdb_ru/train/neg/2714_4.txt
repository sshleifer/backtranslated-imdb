60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smithitch, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released on video / DVD as a full-length feature film) about the insidious 1960s, seen through the eyes of both the white and the black family. The first half of the film is based on Dutton's superb role as Rev. Willy Taylor and evenly distributes the storyline between families. However, Dutton's character was killed halfway through, and the black family was completely forgotten in a boring, rambling and utterly terrible second half. RATING: 4 out of 10. No rating (later PG-13 rating for video / DVD release).
