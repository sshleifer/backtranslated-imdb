Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I first started watching the show, I thought it was good. But the plots only worsened. The storyline was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes he behaves silly. His jokes overdone. His mom is the stupidest character in the series. As a mother can relate to her son, well, if it was a daughter-in-law, but it was her own son. I give it a 4/10 show just because the first few shows were a bit funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do an excellent job. I do not know how these shows play for so long. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored, like me, and you have nothing more to watch, I would advise you to watch it
