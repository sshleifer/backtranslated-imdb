Now I am alone to watch movies that have received bad reviews, and say: "Hmm ... it's not that bad!" I loved “The Cable Guy” and thought that “My big fat independent movie” is great. Keep in mind, I really didn’t start looking at it with high hopes, but I thought that maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad if I could laugh at it. I was wrong. In no case during my sufferings in this “film” (and I rarely use this term) I was even close to being entertained a little. For starters, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap, but as far as I can tell, an Amish priest would probably be a better rapper than him. The main character is just annoying, and not a character who easily likes it. Frankly, I would rather eat a fat turd from the bloody sores of the Harlequin fruit than watch it again.
