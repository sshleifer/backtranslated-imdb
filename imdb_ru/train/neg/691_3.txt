It probably doesn't fit in the bottom of the barrel of Slasher's mediocre films, but it's a damn bad movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of the “Holiday” made it quite interesting, but after the first scenes the film shows that it is bad Production values ​​and a blunt plot. I mean, the subgenre at the moment was devoted to an invisible maniac who was cutting down teenagers to no avail, for no apparent reason, but this one has gone too far. In the events there is absolutely no consistency or add anything. <br /> <br /> Cliche is more than boring, blood is minimal and mystery too. <br /> <br /> This is a rather mediocre slasher entry that should not be promoted, even if it has a video shortcut. <br /> <br /> I’m really disappointed with this overpriced trash.
