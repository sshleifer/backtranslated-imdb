I just can't believe people compare this to the first movie. This prompted me to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the first film. The dialogue is terrible and does not look like an authentic or irresistible, as in the original film. <br /> <br /> The storyline is ridiculous, the laughter of the French police and Doyle's character mile from the first movie. <br /> What do you think, how many drug bosses will personally come to the docks to see how the cargo comes? The ease with which Doyle finds his boyfriend is just pathetic. Like all French policemen, they just drank coffee until Doyle came from America and did a real police job. Well and a joke. Try to go to a foreign city and unearth the biggest machinations in this place with a travel map and some tourist brochures. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A really horrible sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise, is crazy.
