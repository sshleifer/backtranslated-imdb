A scary film that should be independent. Needed some dependence on something. <br /> <br /> This completely pitiful film tells about the interaction of the Irish. They tried to emulate the wonderful film "Crash?" If so, then this movie completely collapsed. <br /> <br /> There is too much going on here, culminating in a little fool running around and throwing stones at buses and cars that obviously cause chaos. <br /> <br /> The film is too volatile to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years, while her younger sister loses her fiance. This causes the ex-sister to become bitter wicked and wear clothing that is not worth believing. The elder sister is also angry, but soon finds romance. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes awry, but the scammers seem to have no punishment. Perhaps the punishment should have been on writers for failing to create a coherent film.
