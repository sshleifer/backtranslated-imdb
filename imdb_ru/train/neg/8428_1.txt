Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating, this is a terrible movie. It's terrible enough that I feel obligated to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the last period of the Rajah, during the Indian struggle for independence. What follows a ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist in that era. <br /> <br /> For example, can a young married Hindu housemaid from a local village start a romance with her married English master, knowing full well that revealing this story would most likely mean total social ostracization and shame if not death penalty ? Hardly, but still possible. However, can the same young Hindu housemaid in the conservative society of that era behave like half-naked Britney Spears in the heat, take part in hot sex on the street in the daytime outdoors, where they can be discovered at any time? This is not only damn unlikely, but is a belated storyline. <br /> <br /> Such nonsense in combination with a bad game made me leave the cinema for an hour to the cinema, so I did not watch the second half of the movie. One could only hope that the final would be more intellectual than what I saw in the first half.
