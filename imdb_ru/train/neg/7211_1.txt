I grew up watching the inspector gadget. It was and remains one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the Field Trip Inspector Gadget. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective in history. <br /> <br /> But the film has destroyed the reputation of a wonderful cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential was definitely NOT a role for Inspector Gadget. First, in the movie Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the movie, the Gadget solves the mystery mostly on its own. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, Brain and a terrific book (I still want her book!). If Gadget revealed the secret, it was an accident. The gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective story, but in the cartoon he was pretty dumb, from which came the humor. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that there are too many “good guy versus bad guy”. in film. This is not just a stupid cartoon on Saturday morning. In addition, the Gadget should never have a love story, but Disney is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> I also lack the real gadgets that the Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the film, it was a gorgeous convertible. In the cartoon, it was a police car sedan and could turn into a van. He also had almost no gadgets, and he was mainly in order to deliver it from place to place. <br /> <br /> But if anything, the film was scary that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon. The film was too serious, too exaggerated, there was too much plot in it and it wasn’t even that funny. <br /> <br /> Advice for those who did not see him: NEVER saw him. EVER. Look at the cartoon, this is a real classic.
