Okay, what the hell am I watching now? The Mountain of Witches must be one of the most disjointed and craziest Spanish militants in history, and at the same time it is also strangely compelling. There is absolutely nothing that would make sense, and I even doubt that there was ever a script for work, but for some reason I could not turn it off. Scratches on the head with confusion begin immediately, with the introductory episode of the evil little girl who killed her mother's cat. So you think this movie revolves about children possessed by evil forces? Heck no, because after this entry, the girl and her villainy are simply not mentioned anymore. Then go to the guy with the most impressively trimmed mustache of all you have ever seen, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather clumsy way. When she asks him to take a vacation with her, he immediately calls his employer, asking for any appointments from him! Great move. The film finally begins now, when it travels to isolated mountainous terrain to photograph some peaks. Although not before he picks up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and photographs her topless! Throughout their journey, various strange events occur, did you guess ?? never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, everywhere loud petrified music sounds, and someone even steals a jeep! Really, witch witches? Apparently, the Sabbath of silent witches owns the mountains, and they practice voodoo on violators. This is as close as I describe the plot, but is there a good chance I'm far away? Here the atmosphere is more important! "The Mountain of Witches" is sometimes very creepy, with its creepy music and interesting cinematography. Supporting characters look weird, and adorable Patti Shepard plays a good heroine. This is a type of European horror film that could become legendary if someone bothers to write a structured script.
