Depressed housewife (annoying displeased Angie Dickinson, whose body twice treats us with a terrible close-up of her delicacies) sexually misses her husband and decides to leave. This directly leads to a series of murders, in which high-class prostitutes soon participate (Nancy Allen, obviously, I am not doing that if IT can bring home $ 600 per night) and her psychologist (Michael Kane). If you're going to watch De Palma go off (sorry, “pay homage”), Hitchcock, see “Sisters” instead. "Dressed to kill," being loaded with style and technical skills, is one of the most tasteless thrillers I didn't like to sit with. The plot is absurd and tired. It has amazingly effective scary jumps and unpleasant graphic killing sequences that should please any horror fan, if only they can overcome the stupid plot line that must have been dated even in the 1980s.
