In this film, presumably a thriller, there were about five subsidiary scenes that developed simultaneously to a climax at the end, but in the end it was more like a yawn. <br /> <br /> The writing was commonplace, the pace was slow and fragmented and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he needs to enter the gym, Matt Damon shoved him, and the rest seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film was that it was carefully thought out to be politically correct, and in the end nothing was said about big business, oil and the Middle East. I have seen documentaries give more excitement. See it only if you have nothing else to do.
