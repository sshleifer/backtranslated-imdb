In this film, beautiful landscapes. Unfortunately, he has no plot. To have a plot, there must be a conflict. This film did not have one. He spent two hours drawing a beautiful scene, and could not do any activity in it. The picture tries to be artistic, but does not pay attention to the basics of storytelling. <br /> <br /> If you love Montana’s landscapes and fly fishing, you’ll find some value in this movie, just don’t expect a story. There are none.
