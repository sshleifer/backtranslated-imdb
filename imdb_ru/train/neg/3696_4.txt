Normally I would give this film 6. It touches a very important topic and does it relatively well - despite Katie Wright, which in itself is an achievement. <br /> <br /> I have no idea if she was actually instructed to play such a character or it was naturally annoying, but she did an amazing job, making it impossible for me to take care of Lexi. For her, there is no other dimension besides how confused she is, helpless and ignorant, and how well she whimpers. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for losing her friend and whose eating disorder got out of control will be distraught, frightened and in pain. However, Wrightâ€™s entire work is based on incessant howling and whining, and the rest is nagging. I could not help but feel that the problem of this particular girl was not caused by a demon that is Bulimia, but by the fact that she does not have a spine. I very much doubt that this particular film was intended.
