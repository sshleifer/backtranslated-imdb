In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can make westerns other than Warner Bros. Some times when they try, it is always funny (except, perhaps, the fact that They died in their boots - this is a cavalry western). I read that Humphrey Bogart, seeing James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said that he looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, too twentieth centuries to be worthy of trust in a western film. This story was not surprising, and it did not help. I believe that every 10 minutes I see Bogart and Cagney throwing their little pistols and putting their hands into the machine gun to get away from the set in a black car of the 1930s.
