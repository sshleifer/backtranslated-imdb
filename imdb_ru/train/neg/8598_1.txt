Just kidding! It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was so bad that it was fun. My friend and I specially rented it, because it looked so bad. Cheesy old horror movies are always good for laughs. The plot is smelly, some voices were duplicated, the quality was terrible. But I am sure there was a blast watching it!
