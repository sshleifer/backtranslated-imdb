Despite his stereotypes, practically nameless cast and obviously low budget, I thought this film was fine; much better than i expected. At first I was skeptical - the idea of ​​a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ridiculous to me. But in the end, I thought that the film coped well with the concept (even if some scenes were slightly mediocre). <br /> <br /> The cast was pretty good, and these two roles seemed to take their roles very seriously. I could not help but think that Janine Turner is a bit like Jean Davis. Maybe it was only her face or makeup, hairstyles and clothes that she had in this film, but this always tormented me in the head. <br /> <br /> Although it’s not a “must see” or a great movie by any standard, Fatal Error is an entertaining movie that will keep you going.
