Raising Victor Vargas is just a bad movie. No denial or advertising dollar supported advertising with the change of this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Peter Sollett saw that he had no money to make the film he wanted to make, and decided to follow the simple way of making a bad film that cynically adheres to the principles of the current “sharp film industry”. Maybe he just does not know better. Hard to say. <br /> <br /> What is not difficult to say is the result. With the exception of a few viewers who will intellectualize poor filmmaking in an attempt at pseudo-realism, few will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know that I did not. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and pass this movie.
