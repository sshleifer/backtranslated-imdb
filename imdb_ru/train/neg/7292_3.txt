Sunshine is a European import, established in Hungary from 1880 to 1980. This is an epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschain family. This name literally translates as Sunshine. The family has modest origins, then it thrives, becomes mobile, changes its name and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so that future generations can develop professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the Second World War and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschain’s approach to life is not very successful. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is perceived as an artistic success, but this is an opportunity missed. The storyline dominated by world history is predictable and transparent; This is backed up with sound and newsreel footage. Family "plot" swings from one predictable event [i. Habsburg, World War I, World War II, fascism, communism, etc.] with little continuity, depth or detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is not focused, and important sub-themes [“secret” diary and family philosophy], which could give a family character and authority, have not survived to the very end. In addition, the filmmakers ensure the continuity of generations, using common themes of incest / unfaithfulness. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes shows flashes of brilliance, but his work is far from the award-winning material. The 3 for 1 casting format distracts the audience and is more like a cheap movie stunt than a good theater. Sunshine is a material of the Hungarian "Historical channel". This is similar to Winds of War, transformed into Forrest Gump and Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
