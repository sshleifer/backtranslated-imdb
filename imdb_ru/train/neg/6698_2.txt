To say that Funky Forest: The First Contact is a bad movie is an understatement of an unbelievable scale. I really can get into a good art home movie, even a surreal and perverted fight, such as El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because there really is something in these films that is worth discussing when the captions are rolled . <br /> <br /> FFFC is trying to be so deep and intelligent on every path; in fact, there’s no point in this film. This film is poorly made, the visual effects in this film do not inspire, the dialogues are worse, the musical numbers destroy this film ... I laughed at GUITAR'S BROTHERS, but this was immediately destroyed by something completely unnecessary and inappropriate. I think he was trying to be deep and meaningful, but this is just pretentious, disoriented nonsense. First-year students without a camera can create something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and routines for getting up between the scenes get 1 point, everything else is just a bad tempo, pseudo-creative, tough attempts to be as good as films of other REAL directors such as Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Yodovorski. Give me a break. I am convinced that people who are delighted with the FFFC, do it because they have no idea what they saw, because it was just soft, relevant statements, mixed with stupidity and mixed, until you tear your own shoes. <br /> <br /> This film caused extreme disappointment. He went beyond the framework of “Survive Style 5+”, a film that really matters, in combination with excellent use of scenery, cinema, memorable dialogue, funny moments, a good soundtrack, great performances, a fantastic pace and flow. FFFC is a completely opposite in every way boring scenery (20 minutes to stare at a soft beach at night - a completely white scene - alien balls floating in empty space - an elegant school corridor, and then ... school corridor?), Awful cinema, unforgettable dialogue , nothing funny or humorous, except for the fact that you have wasted your life for two hours, the soundtrack? amateur performances, uneven, fragmented and often simply detracting rhythmic stimulation, zero flow in general. <br /> <br /> There are those who claim that this is what makes FFFC a great movie, that it is so unconventional at every turn, that its pure genius. It seems to be just a way to hit your own ego, because “unpredictable” can be good quality for a movie if it is not combined with “boring”, “insane” and “terrible”. Personally, I talked to two people who confessed to me that the FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but the overwhelming delight of the art house elite made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with ... "Hey, that was pretty good, I liked it. " <br /> <br /> I'm going to put my foot down, this film sucks, I don’t care if Roger Ebert will say that this film is the best thing he has ever watched since he lost his virginity. "The Emperor's New Cloak," I say, this film in no way testifies to other psychedelic / trip films that have appeared in Japan over the past 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better films (even with a small budget), and none of them can honestly compare to Survive Style 5+. See FFFC only if you are interested in creating an ambitious heap of anything with a limited budget.
