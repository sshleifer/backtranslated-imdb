This anime series begins superbly: an interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully drawn and performed. Not everything is explained right away, hanging a carrot from proverbs before the viewer, seducing the viewer to watch each subsequent episode. But imagine the disappointment of discovering that the sci-fi thriller / giant adventure robot is just the backdrop for psychos and quasi-religious preaching. If you want to hear: â€œYou're fine. Good to be you. after you are afraid of negative slogans and negative emotions of the characters, then this is for you. If you want a good sci-fi film that is just fun to watch, forget about it. Both the original and alternative endings were very disappointing to me. All this, And this film was too preaching.
