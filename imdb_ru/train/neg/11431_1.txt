It is important not to be offended because of a lack of logic or common sense, and those who have some "gray questions" will agree that this film simply does not work. <br /> <br /> Problems lie in the same direction. choice and lack of depth in the construction of the character. The word comedy was very difficult to say when I expect to laugh, when these words are used. Let's look at the problems in the direction / scenario. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister about 30 years old seem to be well adapted. They meet a complete stranger in the park, and the character Heather Graham comes up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half-sane people will run the other way or at least shout about the policeman. Then he awkwardly approaches and makes some silly statements, and she falls in love with him. Then, after ONE date, when they all go out together, he falls in love with her and decides to marry in Vegas in a week ???? Hello, does anyone else feel stupid? He meets with thousands of women and meets this man, who speaks about 10 words that WE see on the screen, and he wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, it just does not make sense. Of course, this is a romantic comedy, and I want to believe that this is possible, but the direction has made it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now Heather falls on her heels and with her when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (a very superficial character) kiss or more, it was the most sloppy kiss when chemistry CAN be there. I found it unromantic and unfunny, and although many say that Heather cannot act, I think the reality is that Heather was clearly not suitable for this role. <br /> <br /> This was Sue Kramerâ€™s debut as a director, and for me it was too much for her to chew. For this film to work, it would take a lot of skill, and IMHO it could be done with the best writers, actors and directors.
