I am a big fan of B5, having gained popularity only at the end of the third season. I conscientiously watched all previous seasons when it was syndicated, and came to the conclusion that it was one of the most thoughtful plots that had ever been on television. Even the filler episodes were interesting. The films were also well prepared and as interesting as everything that could be seen in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the River of Souls. Naturally, after seeing everything else, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen seems to be in Ed Woodâ€™s movie, not a serious science fiction story. The plot itself may have looked good in general, even got to the storyboard. Nevertheless, he suffers, obviously, when it is time to fill this idea in a two-hour film. There are no special effects to entertain us in the complete absence of a convincing story. There are places where they clearly lacked time and simply improvised a dialogue to complete the story. If it did the regular season, it would be ranked among the worst episodes.
