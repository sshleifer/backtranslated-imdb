Saw it late in the evening on cable. At that time I did not know that the girl account as “Shannon Wilsey” was actually a porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often, thank God) that I actually sat through this brain-rotting nonsense . I like stupid clicks just like the next guy - actually more than the next guy - but this was far beyond the cheesy and more into the rancid. A truly annoying replay of a mad scientist and the almost complete incompetence of directors, writers and special effects distracts from unwarranted nudity, which is the only saving grace of the film. Savannah, before she turned into a plasticized Barbie doll, she became like a porn queen, really interesting to watch - she is amazingly gorgeous, bursts uncontrollable giggles at times, glances from the camera and laughter and only generally seems to have a really good time which is more than can be said for the audience. And although Savannah and her colleagues are spending a fair amount of this picture naked, she still cannot hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, poorly made and annoying film. If you know someone who has it on video, or if it goes on cable some night, check it out, but don't waste your money on rent.
