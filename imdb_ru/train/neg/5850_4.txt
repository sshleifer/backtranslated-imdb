Nell Shipman tried to conspire to lead to the final chase in “Returning to the Land of God” the previous year, and she failed miserably. This time she does better, although it seems pointless. “Something new” hardly has a plot that lies outside the chase. There is a short message in which the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) has to save a girl (played by Shipman), and then this is just an exciting, implausible chase from there. Of course, it looks like an hour-long ad for Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is ridiculous. It seems that she has not learned a lot from the last D.V. rescue films. Griffith or his parodies made by Mac Sennett and other comedians she imitates. <br /> <br /> One interesting point is that Shipman writes and directs himself to the film as the author of the plot of the film, in which the main character is a writer (again Shipman), although she doesn’t do anything more clever or humorous with her, although trying. Again, the others became pioneers of the writer’s jokes in intertitles, for example, Anita Loos with Wild and Wool or Francis Marion with Maiden Foolishness (both 1917). At least, Shipman has the impression that she does not take herself or the film seriously - and I do not understand either. "Something new", despite his claims, offended.
