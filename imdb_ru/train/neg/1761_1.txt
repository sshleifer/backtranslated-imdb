First, I understand that a rating of “1” must be reserved for the worst of the worst. This film received it from me, because, as one reviewer notes, it is not bad in self-awareness, an excessive way that may allow it to have some comic or cult value. He simply misses his mark on each account. ** Contains possible spoilers ** The dialogue is completely insincere. The continuity is so deliberate that it hurts. Daniel has just finished talking about his lost love, and the flamenco dancers begin with his last word. Shocking, what is her name (you see? I don’t even remember her character’s name, let alone the name of the forgotten actress) when her husband (Baldwin) first tells her that her friend is a bad guy. The car and motorcycle chase did everything right. Vegetable carts flew away. Cars crash into each other. Motorcycles down the stairs. They almost hit people, but it's great that no one is Oh, that's right ... except for one guy who was stabbed several times, apparently stumbling along the roadside with knife wounds, and the approaching car obviously didn't notice him there. Hmmm <br /> <br /> It is becoming more and more remarkable for me that such films can be made. There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money that you might think that someone in Hollywood will think about making good films that are worth seeing. Now there is a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not watch this movie. Do not rent a DVD. Do not watch it over cable. There are many other things you could do that make you feel more satisfied.
