I really must have caught the film, different from the other commentators on this site, because the audience at the screening of the film last night was so exhausted by the dialogue that I didnâ€™t even joke) by half. Filmed as if the director thought he was approaching some bold new territory, introducing the homosexual story of coming of age, the film uses visual effects inspired by David Lynch with an acting game inspired by Fassbinder. The performances in this film are so boring and boring that I thought that one of the actors was about to faint due to how boring they seemed to be on the script. Worst of all, he is painted as an episode of Miami Vice. I don't know who this director thinks he is; perhaps he has claims for surrealists, such as Bunuel, Jordovsky, etc. But the problem is that all the above-mentioned directors demonstrate a level of knowledgeable sensitivity, which is extremely lacking here. I could understand the meaning of this film about ten years ago, but when we have such masterpieces as Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why bother about cinema shit? There is nothing new here.
