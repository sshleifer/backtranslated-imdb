DON'T LOOK THIS BAD, READ MOVIE. I wasted my time and money on this, and I am very sorry for that. <br /> <br /> The game is comparable to games in high school. The script is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes after the end (which, I believe, I should be rewarded for what I achieved), I had a headache from all the screams, crying and crying of five girls. <br /> <br /> Most violence cases (rarely for a film these days) were suggested, not depicted graphically, but I found that the characters are so damn annoying that I wanted to see them, and indeed every person involved of this piece dies in the most terrible way possible. <br /> <br /> I spend another ten minutes of my life saving you from your very poor 100 minutes. Do not do that.
