This is a problem I have with movies that go on TV, when there is nothing more to watch. I somehow sucked into really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was pretty watchable. The idea of ​​being the only ones left on Earth after the comet, and then finding zombies around makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie 2 instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but in a way, it makes you laugh (too stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I only watched him because the guy from Star Trek was leading. I was surprised to see him as a young boy ... and he was the only funny character.
