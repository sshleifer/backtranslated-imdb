A few years ago, my friend and I went through the stage of choosing the dirtiest horror films in the video store for evening entertainment. For some reason I ended up buying this one (probably against the cheap one). <br /> <br /> A cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some very funny scenes. Among them is the scene where a person is attacked and defending himself with a lot of implausible objects, while it made me laugh (in retrospect it doesn’t look so funny, but like that). <br /> <br /> Also, this is complete nonsense, mind you. But probably worth a look if you like movies like “Chopping Mall.” Yes, I saw it too.
