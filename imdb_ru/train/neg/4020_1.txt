I will never become a member of any club where I am, especially this <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreff is a single mom / stripper who is being attacked. <br /> <br /> The vampire woman has left and died. She begins to thirst for blood <br /> <br /> and meets with John Savage, it seems he <br /> <br /> wonders where he left Michael Cimino’s phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wants Andref to join his little vampire family <br /> <br />, which consists of a British vampire, a blond vampire, <br /> <br /> attacked on Starr and the green-haired dwarf (I'm not going to push it). <br /> <br /> Starr’s family doesn’t want Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starr <br /> and Starr’s baby. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that it was a drama. He <br /> <br /> spends most of his screen time demonstrating more face ticks than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant on the Jolt Colc caster, and he reads all his lines as <br /> <br /> he makes a film of the Farrelli brothers. Andreff is trying to do <br /> <br /> most of the poorly written role, but scriptwriter / director Ruben gets <br /> <br /> for all the clichés about vampires like Starr’s eating her son’s favorite hamster <br /> and buy a lot of raw meat to fight the thirst for blood. The little one <br /> <br /> is also in a lot of fuss, because those who think that violence against children is very exciting. <br /> <br /> but not in the wild, like Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue. Here the blood is rough and never justified, it just happens. <br /> <br /> This is only a budget. Most of the “R” rating goes to Andreev’s employees <br /> <br />, who go through embarrassing striptease programs amid <br /> <br /> conversation scenes. The budget does not include vampire fangs <br /> <br />! All vampires here must slaughter their prey to eat. <br /> <br /> Great idea, if only you haven’t seen <br /> <br /> “Martin” George Romero. <br /> <br /> Even after 77 minutes and after throwing Ruben’s attempts into <br /> <br /> a sly direction (skewed shots, blurred scenes), this will be a tedious, boring and dirty ride. Get out of this club and take a shower, <br /> <br /> you will need it. <br /> <br /> This is a rating (R) for severe physical abuse, gun violence, sexual violence <br /> <br />, strong blood, profanity, nudity of women, sexual links, drug abuse and situations in adulthood. <br /> <br />
