The premise of the film has been explained, and if you have come this far, you should not pretend that I am a film critic. At the same time, my opinion about the film is rather low. I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but this falls into the category of his not very good works along with DOA 2 and 3 and some other (many). <br /> <br /> The film seems to be free to go through, because this is Takashi’s film, and Takashi’s nothing can be wrong. This is the approach of high school students to the cinema. For the rest of us, we find that a child and a half who screams for no real reason is completely annoyed (and yes, it takes the movie), the pace of the film almost reaches the level of rigoMortis, and acting ... well ... Mmm. <br /> <br /> If someone is a Takashi fan, you will see him no matter how interesting your interests are. He lacks any originality (see “The Infinite Story”) or any character development from the main character in the face of conflict, except for a very superficial one. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, this is the first film in which Miike is credited with co-authorship, but this does not mean that what we hope for will not be the same as Miike’s personality. on the screen. All we get are some of Miike's famous photos taken by the photo director. <br /> <br /> The film can be something big. The premise is not difficult to run. But this one seems confused. <br /> <br /> My suggestion, if you only get into Miike, is to adhere to some standards, such as Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then add the film to his works, such as “Harp Blue”, “Fudoh”, “Rainy Dog”, “The Avian People of China”.
