It was shown on the biographical channel and was about as informative as a children's comic! I gave him 2 out of 10, because this is attention to detail, because for the most part he felt in the 70s, and the three women who played the original three angels looked like them, so the makeup was good. <br /> <It should have been a biography on the biography channel, but it was deprived of everything that is usually / usually seen in one of their biographies. No interviews with the surviving members of the film crew, the film crew, the film crew, etc. Or their friends, families and any biographers of these people. In fact, now I know about the program as much as before I watched this film, based on a (supposedly) biographical book. As for the actual study of the fact that no one knew about the program and was not well known, which never happened.
