Well ... the movie was fun to watch. The main problem of this film is the fact that it goes against everything that is observed in most vampire myths. Like vampires who walk in the sun. Although there are parts that make you enjoy the way society makes films. The scene where the vampire is stabbed and he shouts, "Oh, it hurts ... It really is stuck." Then it may seem that the scenes may be missing, but you will get used after a while. And there are random sequences of dreams that really do not help with the plot. If you think about it, it didn't really make sense, but I just gathered a bunch of friends and looked at it twice to get the full effect. If you think the fight scenes were terrible, the zombies were just fun to watch. Gradually, when I write more about it, I like this film more. But you know, in general, you can't expect Schindler's list, but this is a fun watch.
