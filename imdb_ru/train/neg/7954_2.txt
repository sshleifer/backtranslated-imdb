Well, this film was really "unique", let's say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the film, although it is said that she had problems with coke during the film. but she said she cannot remember much of it. Well, this is her excuse, but what about everyone else ??? I can't imagine that they all had a problem with Coca-Cola. Whatever it is not so bad, I mean, the plot was fine, and he had some pretty funny moments. although the part where the guy stuffed this thing in the head was, in my opinion, too cruel. Oh, well, I think I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher is so cool, and this film did nothing for her.
