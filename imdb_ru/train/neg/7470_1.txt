In São Paulo, older middle-class teenagers Cristiano, Chico, and Gabriel have just entered the university, and on the eve of the primary class they go to a party with drugs and drinks. The next day, after their classes, Cristiano’s date last night comes to his house, and three friends rape a girl. The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother comes in, gets scared of Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaking her neck. The trio decides to throw away and burn the corpses in the garbage dump, but other tragedies happen at night. <br /> <br /> The controversial and shameful “Cama de Gato” is an overpriced, pretentious nonsense about the alienation of young people, and, of course, the worst Brazilian film that I have seen in many years. Small, tragic and dark story - in fact, comedy with black humor bad taste. The script is not funny, with silly lines and dialogues, boring, manipulative and silly scenes from interviews with teen morons at the beginning and at the end. The game is terrible, obviously, with many improvisations, but without talent, and I was disappointed by the presence of the promising Kayo Blut in this bin. Camera, framing, cinematography and publishing are amateur and of very poor quality. The sound is terrible, and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are talking about (this is probably a plus, since this film sucks). Gangbang is very realistic and is used to promote this mediocre film in very bad marketing of sexual exploitation. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cat's Bed")
