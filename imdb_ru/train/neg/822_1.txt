Actually there are two sections of this film. Firstly, there is a funny prologue to the film, which is so hysterical and a cornball, that it would be almost appropriate for Troy McClure's Simpsons to do the narration. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the film begins (starting with the title song, which really does not fit into the rest of the film), which, although technically sound, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but and characters that don't make sense. br /> <br /> This is especially true for Spiventa Mickey Rooney, who allegedly participated in the conspiracy and participated in the "organization" all the time, but still, what would happen if Hackman made a seemingly arbitrary decision to take him with yourself when to break out? In this case, he would be a completely unnecessary and unnecessary character, which, in the end, he is still. <br /> <br /> The general problem of the film is that I donâ€™t want to describe in detail who or what is behind this conspiracy. It was as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to believe that a certain part of society would be able to create such an organization, but instead based on the hope that a lack of explanations would be enough and the audience would draw their own conclusions. Simply put, the film falls through at all levels.
