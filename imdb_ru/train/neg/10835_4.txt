Great cast. Great acting game. Unpredictable storyline for the first half of an hour or so <br /> <br />. I really wanted to know what was going to happen with each of these unrepentant characters, and how their interconnected, seemingly incomparable lives would be intertwined. But when <br /> <br /> the authors took glue to start connecting players, they mistakenly used super glue and brought the film to a standstill. <br /> <br /> in the last two hours. I kept thinking that it would be better, but only <br /> <br /> it got worse. Do not believe the reviews. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise has gone bad - why? Magnificent <br /> <br /> fat barman in braces - why? I know that this is related to the <br /> <br /> plot, but without them, at least, there would be one attractive <br /> <br /> cast.
