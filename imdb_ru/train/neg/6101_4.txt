The game is almost two people, and as such the dialogue and actions of the presenters will be important. None of them are particularly good. In fact, perhaps it would be stronger if it was first created as a play for two people, and then turned into a film. <br /> <br /> In any case, an irritable vampire who seems slightly autistic is a stripper’s passion (as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy house). He wants her to tell him about the daylight. It would be better for him to find someone with a day job or someone who paints pictures perfectly with words like a poet, but then they may not have a hot body. <br /> <br /> After he makes her do whatever he wants (and he is not very good at it), he intends to feed her at 6 am when the sun rises. Much has been done from this period, although he also says that he can do without food, this will only make him hungry. In addition, he claims that he cannot let a stripper go because she knows about him, but he allows many other people to find out who he is. There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Why does this vampire prefer to live in a house so badly boarded up that the light from street lamps and neighboring buildings is pouring as if it were during the day, I'm not sure. In time, one might think in the world that he would do a better job or correct a place a little. He is clearly not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly a remake, and I’m curious to see the original version of Dance of the Damned. Although it was directed by Katt Shea, and the other films she directed for Korman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were pretty bad.
