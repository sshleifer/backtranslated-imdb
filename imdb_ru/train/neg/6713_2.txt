But this film was a bore. Part of the story was fine, but the musical part was not. Not a single song I cared about and there was no soundtrack to be heard. <br /> <br /> If “Sweet Jesus” was supposed to be a comic relief, then it never worked. they tried to overthrow him in every scene. <br /> <br /> Hancock and Jefferson were the only portable characters in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Historical quotes and debates about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough, but not sufficient to overcome the lack of music in the musical. <br /> <br /> If you didn’t sing songs after the musical, with the exception of a few sounds, nothing else was worth your breath.
