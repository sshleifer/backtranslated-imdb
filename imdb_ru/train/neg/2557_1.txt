I actually love films about asylum. I made it a habit to see as much as possible. Even the robberies they did were cool, like exile and a killer. It just sucks. I can't believe that the same people who shot DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE also made this movie !!! This is not even ridiculously bad, like Jolly Roger or Alien (which, by the way, is pretty bad). This is just bad! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive a bad game or limp the special effects in an asylum film, but this film takes itself too seriously. I really hope that the snakes on the train better. Now this is a movie that I canâ€™t wait to see.
