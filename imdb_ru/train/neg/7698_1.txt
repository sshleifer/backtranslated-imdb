Can I give it a minus rating? Not? Well, let me say this is the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in several sublevels of the nebula. I made this film with a friend, and after thirty minutes of hope that it would be better, we decided to “rewind” a little to see if something would become better. It never gets better. This film about the kidnapping of some dude by these two girls sounds interesting, but in fact it's just boring. Nothing even remotely interesting happens. If you ever have the opportunity to see this, do yourself a favor, try “PLAN NINE FROM OUR SPACE” instead.
