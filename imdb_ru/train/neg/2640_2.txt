Attempting to present something as tasteless as THE SENTINEL would be quite a challenge. There are a lot of problems. The result is terrible and full of holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas acts as Pete Harrison, a secret service agent who “took one” for Reagan during an attempt on his life. Years later, we find Pete, assigned to the Whitehouse family, mainly the guard of the first lady (Kim Basinger, LA CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete’s close relationship with the First Lady and a sudden threat to the President himself (David Rush, UNITED 93). When Pete fails a lie detector test, he stands out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 episodes). <br /> <br /> As the presidential plot unfolds, Pete is on the run from his own people. His only confidant is the first lady, and she does not want to tell anyone about her attachments to each other (this is why Pete failed the polygraph first). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he just trying to gain time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent an attempted murder while escaping from the secret service? <br /> <br /> The only, big, insurmountable problem with this film is that there is no reason for the cause of the presidential threat. Isn't that what a movie should be about? It would seem so! But the audience is never given to understand why the killers want to kill Prez. Hm Did someone forget to put this in the script? <br /> <br /> And what about the new partner David Breckinridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA's WAY)? It seems that she was placed in the film strictly as a piece of candy. What was her purpose again? Did she do anything other than look good in tight pants and a low-cut blouse? <br /> <br /> With the main message of The Sentinel there are so many problems that it is funny. The action is too easily blocked. "What the ...?" Answers will surely be uttered by those unlucky to watch the movie.
