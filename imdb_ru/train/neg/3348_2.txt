The 1963 version of "The Haunting" was one of my favorite horror films for many years, so I waited for the release of this remake of 1999 with great trepidation. It hardly seemed that any continuation could surpass or even compare with the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my fears were well-founded: this film stinks. <br /> <br /> I don’t know what the people involved in this film thought. Jan De Bon, who seemed to have had an accident when he directed the superb "Speed", is doing as badly (or perhaps even worse) here, as he did with the highly promoted failures of "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise -control". “Hey, Jan, stick to cinematography, isn't it? Liam Neeson is adequate in his role as a psychologist-pretending-asleep-psychologist — I don't think he can turn a really bad performance — but even he can't save a bad script and a weak The story of Catherine Zeta-Jones proves once again (as she did in Capture) that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that she receives. The main character, who played well in the X-Files episode, looks lost here like Eleanor insomnia, soaring on the verge of sanity. And this blond guy, whoever he is, is more wooden than funny funny figurines of children carved out of wood in the house. I don't think he changes the expression on his face once during the entire film. < br /> <br /> (Spoilers ahead) <br /> <br /> The reason why the first film worked so well is that we were never sure whether the house really pursued or whether the manifestations were due to an unreliable mental the state of Eleanor. In fact, not a single spirit can be seen in the original, and much depends on the imagination - a distinctive feature of other great horror films, such as The Changeling and The Project Blair The Witch. In this updated version, of course, we get tons of CGI ghosts, which basically (in the face of a weak script / plot) make the film absolutely not scary. F / X is not so great, considering that they were made by ILM. Frozen breath looks especially fake. The effects in Peter Jackson's underrated film “Frightening”, which I saw before that, were much better. Wooden drawings of children who should look creepy just look silly (especially when they scream), and CGI monsters have nothing to tell. Instead of ridding oneself of bad play, bad direction and bad writing, the effects only add to this clutter of the film. <br /> <br /> Some particularly stupid scenes: When three other characters rush into Eleanor’s bedroom and none of them seem to be surprised at all when they see a huge, gloomy demon hovering over the bed. The scene where Eleanor "sees" the former owner of the house, hanging on the rafters ... is especially bad here. And last but not least, an unintentionally hilarious episode in which “The Wooden Blond Guy” utters a dull cry for what must be painful, jumps on a piece of furniture and begins to slash the picture of the old evil guy who built the house. We actually get some satisfaction in this scene, because a few seconds after the attack, Blond-Guy is attracted to the fireplace by the ghost of an old guy and quickly cuts off his head with a chimney. It was the only part of the film that I liked. <br /> <br /> In general, stick with the original 1963 Ghost. 3/10 stars
