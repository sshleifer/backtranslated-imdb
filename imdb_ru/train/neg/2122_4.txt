Despite the fact that in some aspects Seven Pounds are solid and interesting in a certain narrative style, the project Gabriele Muccino is rather mediocre. As we move toward the end, the film becomes more and more sentimental and manipulative: the hearts are human and emotional, the eyes are physical and metaphorical. Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Amores Perros by Alejandro González Inarritu and 21 grams with a lot of memories. The problem is that the story is quite predictable from VERY easy throughout the entire movie. This is very bad, because “Seven Pounds” could be just as “good” if Ben and Emily fell into the right hands.
