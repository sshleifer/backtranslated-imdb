This is the worst movie I have seen since I Know Who Killed Me, with Lindsay Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that if you decide to go and see, only disappointment and disappointment await you. Hi Tim Burton, I was your big fan ... did you even show this film? I mean, seriously, what the f% # k? <br /> <br /> Without giving anything, here is the story in a vague word ... Nine wake up, he does things, his actions and decisions do not matter. .. and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes the spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Beware, spoilers! At the end of the movie .... it's raining. I think part of my soul died while watching this movie.
