CQ is incredibly slow, and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film tells about a young director who makes a film in the style of Barbarella. After that, the film began to lose me. Deep and deep? Not really. The movie "Dragonfly", shot in CQ, has no end. This is very similar to CQ, which also has no end (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky to get into this film at the SxSW Film Festival. I had high hopes that I just watched Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great films. I also looked forward to Jason Schwartzman speaking. But it was a difficult film. If you don’t like sci-fi or slow movies from the 60s that don’t go anywhere, skip them. <br /> <br /> CQ is a student film. If you want to rent a recent sci-fi indie film "Donnie Darko," it will not put you to sleep.
