I had some expectations from the film, as he had a good cast, and this is the return of the duet Akshay and Saif. Well, I did not dare to watch the movie, because it was done by the same person who wrote the story for the Dhoom franchise, because I hated Dhoom 2; but if you compare Dhoom 2 with Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the captions at the very beginning, I felt good, because they were well presented. Well, the very first scene infuriates me. Then the main drawback of the film is the sequence of actions. I and my friends laughed at our courage, watching these crappy fights. It was like Akshay against 30 bandits and everyone, and the bandits even had machine guns! Phew ... you have to see this in order to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the film is a too predictable story. It reminded me of some movies from the early 80s. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing that costs the film is about sexy Karina, who looked very cool in this movie. And for this, I give a rating of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please ... please ... don't think that this is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to laugh at the terrible scenes of the battle. <br /> <br /> That's it.
