Today, Bea Arthur is dead, so I traveled the IMDb website and somehow ended up on a show called Gloria. All In The Family was a brilliant show for the first four or five years, and I bet I watched each episode more than once. However, I swear I did NOT know that the show called "Gloria" exists. Maybe this is good. Maybe this means that I was a young man, and did not watch TV. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it’s a pity that the “All in the Family” franchise has deteriorated so much that it has given birth to a show that I have never heard of - and one that was rated by previous reviewers is very bad. <br /> <br /> I rated the show for 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to vote without a vote, and Authors and television performers should be convicted for starting a show that had no business broadcast and blurred the memory of one of the biggest shows in the history of television. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
