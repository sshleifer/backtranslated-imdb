The only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline ... Otherwise, this film was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the scenery was crappy and very sticky. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to watch because of the whole terrible game. I would not recommend watching this ... The only quality of this film is that the actors were somewhat attractive ... Especially Ryan Bower, the man who plays the star of the soap opera. Part of the editing was well done, but there are continuity errors everywhere ... I'm just starting to get tired of watching bad gay movies ... Can we get a good one soon?
