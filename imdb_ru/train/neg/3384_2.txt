Judging by one film, the committee that gave the stage line musical Choir the Pulitzer Prize, and the Broadway audience that held the war horse for 15 years, were all on drugs, because one particular sensation was not the film. <br /> <br /> What made anyone think that Richard Attenborough is perfect for this material completely confuses me, but he does a musical that is almost entirely dedicated to movement, just sit on the screen like a piece of clay. <br /> <br /> Not content with the original score as it was originally written, someone decided that the film really needed a new song in order to give the film some popularity. Thus, we are attacked with Oscar-nominated (!) “Surprise, Surprise”. Well, surprise, surprise, the song stinks, and the film, too. <br /> <br /> Rating: D
