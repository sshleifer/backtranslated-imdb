I never thought that a movie could be so terrible, but, alas, I was wrong. Awful game, terrible plot, terrible consequences. The crocodile was terrible, and as for the stupid sex / killing scene in one, it was a bad move from the start. It was really shocking, and it is not a compliment! How can someone make this film, watch it, and then say: “Yes, this is a good film. People will watch it. ” If you have not seen him, I ask you not to bother :-(
