This film was so ridiculous that I didn’t even finish watching it, I really thought that someone made their own version and copied it to DVD from the movie store. This film made me sick, not because it was terrible, but because I spent 2 50 on it !!!! It seems that my brother and I entered the house, made the film ourselves and edited the footage of the slaughter in it! I’m so annoyed that even the BTK Killer deserves more respect than that it wasn’t even accurate, I mean that the cow’s head was clearly made from a game test or BUMBLE GUM OMG I can’t even put all the words to explain it. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!
