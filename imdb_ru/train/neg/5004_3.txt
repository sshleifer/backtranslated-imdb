Wow, this is ironic, since this movie was released for a while, and I think someone else just watched it a couple of days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched this movie simply because he has Nick Stahl for recording. br /> <br /> The movie was funny. The characters drove me crazy, they were SO cliches and STEREOTYPED. This movie was one of the worst conversations I've ever heard. It had too many plot twists. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is ONE scene worth seeing: “Hot Heart, Cold Gun”, where Nick Stahl kills a disgusting girl in the shower. (Well, they were all really disgusting.) But his play in this scene was excellent. By the expression of his face, he recalled my American psychopath (good movie). The stage is worth a look, but you shouldn’t watch the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and don’t watch it.
