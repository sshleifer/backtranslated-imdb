Your mind will not be satisfied with this budget doomsday thriller; but pray who will be? A young couple spends the real end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens disguised as church people. <br /> <br /> A small _apocalyptical themed walk, END OF THE WORLD has ingenuity and lack of both brio and style from purely 50s of similar films. And this is not only that EOTW plays like a hybrid - not only the end of the world, but also a convent. The villain in the film is a famous actor. <br /> <br /> This completely shameless nonsense seems to be a part of everyday exploitation, a genre of the 70s, which today looks so funny obsolete. In any case, the secret laboratory of the monastery is some unpleasant detail of a futuristic deco! Christopher Lee - the pride of the End of the World; but the end of the world is not his pride at all!
