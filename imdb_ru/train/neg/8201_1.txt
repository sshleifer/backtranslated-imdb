Sit on your favorite chair and turn on the game console when you throw it into the waste management unit. Spend a useful 90 min. live your favorite game. Scattered - poorly filmed - not directed garbage. He takes pieces from several other fiction films and strongly tries to put the pieces together in a pathetically weak story. There is nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to understand that providing simple entertainment will make it possible to achieve a cash game, but in order to turn it into a good film, lightness and ingenuity are required. Any money spent on this is a waste of time, and I personally would like to return my 90 minutes of life.
