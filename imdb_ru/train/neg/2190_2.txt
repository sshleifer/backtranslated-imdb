** Possible spoilers ahead ** <br /> <br /> Jason (a.k.a. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with his wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the dimmest car accident in the world. Leith is beheaded, and the doctor takes her severed leg back to his mansion and rejuvenates her head in her laboratory. The exterior of the mansion was allegedly withdrawn at Lindhurst’s estate in Tarrytown; laboratory scenes were obviously filmed in someone’s basement. The bandaged head is supported on “laboratory equipment”, which for Ed Wood looks quite cheap. Some of the library music — the high point of the film — later appeared in Andy Milligan's BODY BENEATH. Late's head has some heavy metaphysical conversations with another misfire of Ever, a mutant chained in a cupboard. In the meantime, a good doctor is looking out of the joints for a body worthy of his wife's noodles. The end, in uncut prints, shows some spat and splitting ahead of his time when a monster with a zucchini head comes out of the closet to bring the film closer to the desired end. This thing took three years to be released, and then, the audience gave her a bad reception that she deserved. Between this, PLAN 9 FROM EXTERNAL SPACE and several others, 1959 was to be declared the Year of Turkey.
