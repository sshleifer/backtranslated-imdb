“Transylvania 6-5000” is an insignificant but sometimes amusing and charming parody of the horrors of the mid-80s with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to laugh in the script. Two silly journalists from the newspaper Gossip Girl are sent to Transylvania, very against their will, to tell the story of the alleged return of the mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some charming little tricks and details that can be found in the film on the left and right, for example, a small hard-boiled egg guillotine and laboratory tubes used to add cream and sugar to the breakfast table. However, a useful film is not as successful as it could have been, with jokes and parody situations that are too long. Roger Korman's performance “Transylvania Twist”, released four years after this, is much funnier and much more recommended. The film especially parodies the classic universal milestones of the early 30s, so you had better make sure that you saw them, if you want to understand all the tiny jokes and links. There is a rather original twist, showing that the character of Frankenstein behaves like a mad evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. It also turned out that he actually looks more like the messiah of Father Damien, who is concerned only with the condition of the exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the quirky guy who plays Cramer in Seinfeld, plays the role of a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I am pretty sure that the character of John Turturro in the movie “Mr. Deids” was inspired by the role of Richards.
