I read this play by Thornton Wilder last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to see this weak translation on the screen. Let me tell you that this is not an amazing game, it is easy to beat, but the man deserves a much better throw. Acting was really not enough, and, frankly, before God, he looked as if he were designed from cardboard by a group of three-year-old children. As if it couldnâ€™t get worse, the sound quality is lousy ... there is this staggering 'buzz' whenever an actor says ... and I also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, does not exist. All the actors seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white that would be nice, but it reveals the lightness of it all the more. In any case, I think that if you are going to watch this film, which I really do not recommend, do not direct your hopes too high. A game as resistant as it is probably better.
