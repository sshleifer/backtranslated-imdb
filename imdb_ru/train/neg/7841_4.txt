I really liked A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return was played as a typical sequel. Everything in it — the budget, the script, the plot, the casting, and the acting — were inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as a moose woman, the elders of the yellow-hand tribe, does not look like an Indian, nor do half of the other “Indians” played by Italians, Mexicans, and Hispanics with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the leader acted more like a fat old squash than a cruel warrior leader. He even used onions as a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such an excellent job in the original, this time seems out of place. I think he could not resist the easy salary he received for re-playing the role of the Horse. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are several interesting moments in the film, such as the Horse, undergoing the painful ritual of cleansing “to find his own vision” and rally yellow hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but overall, the return is uneven , boring, trite and predictable - like most sequels.
