Not sure why this movie received such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> One night I watched “The Explosion” on TV, and it seemed to me to be a boring, meaningless random plot that takes place on the screen. The whole film seems to be nothing more than an exercise in a meaningless, fanciful farce by the director. The fact that the director / writer bears the same name only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. <br /> <br /> For those interested in indie films, it’s better to look for something better written and, I dare say, more exciting than this complete waste of time.
