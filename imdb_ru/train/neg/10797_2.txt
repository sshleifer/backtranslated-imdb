There was a gin that Shaq played. His name was Kazaam, and he was insane. His rhymes were commonplace, these lines were bad, some stupid child was crying because of his stupid dad, bad actin, bad casting, bad special effects, what next? this film sucks Prolly did not earn 20 bucks, he lives in a boombox, and the lamp does not hurt, like a cramp, like a wet food ... <br /> <br /> Yes, you know, stupid rhyming genie that can stupid film with terrible special effects. Oh, and it's confusing as hell. I'm not even going to continue. Let's just say, he falls into the category of "this is so bad, this is ridiculous." Watch it once with your buddies and laugh. But do not expect anything spectacular.
