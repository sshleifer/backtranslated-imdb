I saw this movie last night, and I have to honestly say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Acting is fair, but the plot is completely ridiculous. A killer is born because of all the “energy used to create the film,” and if the film is burned, will the killer die? How incredible is that? The characters were underdeveloped, if not more ... for example, the man suddenly mentions: “You are not trying to finish the movie because your mother could not?” So we have to agree with that? We had no idea that this was her daughter, until in the middle of the film. The film really didn’t attract anyone, we didn’t know anything about the main people who survived, except that the character of Ringwald was a Chnikan actress, the guy was on the set when people were dying, and Raffi wanted to become a director like her mother, Not at all dive in to find out who they are. It seemed that things were in a hurry to just get to the killings. The whole plot is too weak for my taste, and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who likes this piece of shit obviously needs to learn one or two things about filmmaking. I can not believe that someone will agree to roll or even work on this picture. This is not funny, it was not scary and there was a cliche throughout the film. I found that I anticipated what would happen before each scene, and I suppose it was not at all difficult for me to do this. This is a shame, and I'm very sorry that I spent an hour and a half watching the mess. 1/10
