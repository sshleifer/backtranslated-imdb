This is supposedly a film about multiple grief. As such, he must move the audience and make them sensitive to the plight of the main characters. However, his annoying postmodern style makes him almost incomprehensible. The camera constantly switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to another, creating an intermittent, disconnected effect. Most of the characters seem to live a purposeless, unstructured life, united by their professional commitment. (It also increases the credibility of the fact that a man who has just been given what constitutes a possible death sentence will gladly pamper himself with sexual prank with the woman he just met). The storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. Overall, the overall effect is rather disappointing. Despite all this, acting is generally good, and some scenes are quite powerful.
