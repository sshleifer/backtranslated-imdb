He had an amazing plot! ;) I saw movies with less plot (I donâ€™t want to mention Asian movies, but ...). I thought the camera was not bad for such a cheap movie, and the atmosphere was not too bad. Most people have no real reason for how they react to what is happening. Although I think about many films, in this case, of course, it was awful. <br /> <br /> Some films were VERY poorly broken only for certain scenes. The game was bad, but I saw worse. The film was bad, but I saw worse. Watching this movie is an experience between boredom, laughter, desire for death, sadism, excitement and low-level entertainment. <br /> <br /> So, if you like bloody films with silly plots, this film is what you need. <br /> <br /> I gave 3/10 because it CAN be interesting if you do not expect to see a good movie and you are in a good mood.
