This film may have a weak production value, but it also makes it so good. The special effects are rough and well done. My favorite part of the film was to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is very hot and she has a nice naked scene. Robert Pritchard as the leader of the gang of oars, like other members. This film is actually trying to emphasize by saying that nuclear plants are bad. 4/10 Fair comedy films.
