Remember the name of Kevin Lyme - and please, please, never let <br /> <br /> indicate it again. Time, pace, editing: everything is hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time guys leave the set <br /> <br />) can do nothing to save this film from amateurs such as Alice <br / > <br /> Evans, and those production standards that you expect from <br /> <br /> children's teen shows on British television. <br /> <br /> Greatest mystery: music. The assessment is so inept, inappropriate, and irrelevant to the filmâ€™s tonality that it seriously surprises whether this <br /> <br /> is a case of sabotage. Add a speaker system that sounds, apparently, <br /> <br /> not developed from a single microphone, and a director who only <br /> <br /> periodically recalls the addition of aural action behind the scenes, and we < br /> <br /> to have what should be from the highest ratio of money to the result <br /> <br /> of recent years.
