Many comments have already been published about what I feel about this film, so I will be brief. <br /> <br /> “Grinch”, it seemed to me, was amazing - Jim Carrey is a truly talented comedian, and to be a versatile intelligent actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers, on the other hand, laughs, annoying. I used to like him very much in the days of his “World Waynes” and “So, I married an ax murderer”, but I never liked Austin Powers, and “The Cat in the Hat” just finished me off. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible - the gags were terrible! not suitable for children not only in adult content, but also in the fact that some of them were so outdated that they did not entertain anyone for 50 years! The plot was dirty, dirty, dirty! This is really a shame, because the children were very cute, as was the "mother". Probably they could have chosen a better villain than Alec Baldwin, but he could have done it if it were not for the ugly Myers, the hideous, perverse image of Kota. <br /> <br /> I mean - did Myers even look at the script? Was one written? Other actors seemed to have one — but the Cat seemed to do just that! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to point out that the sets and supports were amazing !!! But, unfortunately, they cannot save this film. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Suze - this man was a genius! Do not destroy his reputation by adapting his work in such a lazy, dirty way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
