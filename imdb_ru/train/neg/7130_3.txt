This film was to be called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played Need For Speed ​​games yet, this is mainly about hot cars and beautiful women and practically no plot. This fully applies to Redline. The only thing in this movie that was A-Level were the cars. Actions seemed forced and scenarios, the premise was fragile at best, and the plot was almost non-existent. I only really watched this film to see how bad it was, and although it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was interesting. I wish they would show Eddie Griffin smash Enzo somewhere in the film. In general, do not pay for it, do not try your best to see it, but if it is on Showtime or HBO, and there is nothing else, it is a worthy distraction.
