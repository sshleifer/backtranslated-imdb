I found this film to be rented based on packaging. The zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you go to the movies, and these are women in rak-to-face masks. zero special effects ... and even in battle scenes, you can see how they miss 2 feet. The funny thing is that Lommel himself is briefly filmed in the film and worse than the rest of the shitty actors in the film. the only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people call him a "cult classic" ... however, I can't imagine anyone thinking this except one of the worst films ever made. the real horror in this movie is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed that I rented it, and I swear never to see another Lommel movie again!
