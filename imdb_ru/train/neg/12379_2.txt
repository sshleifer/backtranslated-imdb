Relying on the positive reviews above, we saw a free preview of this last night. Now I KNOW that the filmmakers create positive reviews, because an objective person could not write them. "Intended to become a" cult classic "?? The theater was overcrowded, apparently with the friends and families of the film crew, because only a few of us came out by the first hour. <br /> <br /> The songs were the most literal that I ever heard in a musical ?? "Do not fight, dear, there is a wolf in the forest ...". Debi Mazar’s eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most tunes lasted only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, whoever plays the wolf in this tale, he must be charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, a former N'Syncer, who lives by last name, since he didn’t age well. He is not very flexible with his extra 50 pounds and high school quality cosmetics and inappropriate singing. Seriously, was this guy in the vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate, but there is little that can be done with the unimaginable scenario. Do you know if you can write for adults and children at the same time ?? see Pixar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the virtual scenery looked good and was well integrated with the actors. And it was not as offensive as Crash.
