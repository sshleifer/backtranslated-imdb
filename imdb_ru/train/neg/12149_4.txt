Located in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses is trying to satirically look at the role of the media in government. At best, this can be applied to how the US is trying to control the media during the war in Iraq, but in the end it looks empty. In this story there is never tension, and acting is never very good. Worst of all, the movie is terrible, focus more on strange camera angles that can not convey anything except â€œIsn't that a strange way of holding a camera. The special effects are pretty bad ... at some point, the video of the explosion is covered with greenery over the city and is ridiculous at best. <br /> <br /> The film has a couple of bright spots ... namely, advertising for post-zombie services (including land reclamation and a party bus). But it is too small to make a film worthy. <br /> <br /> Try Hide and Creep for a better zombie movie. He has the same weak production value, but behind this is much more intelligence, humor and talent.
