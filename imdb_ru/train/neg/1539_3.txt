I am a big fan of Westerns, but this ... fuh, what an abomination! I think that almost immediately turned me off, there was a meaningless dialogue. I think I could have written a better dialogue than this one when I was in the eighth grade. And poor actors! Given this terrible dialogue, none of them came across any ridiculous looks. Actually, I'm not joking. In part, this is a little better than what you would get in the Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably the “big” star in this film, which, if you called him B-Western, you would praise him. This is what can be called a B-minus western, perhaps. The pity is Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times along with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other major talents. For him to appear in a vehicle, this poor must have been trying to downplay him for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> In this film, annoying is the fact that all men look as if they have not shaved for a week and their faces are all fat. I know that in the old West, the guys were not always well-groomed, but for a man this film makes you want to just say “EWWWW!” Indeed, this is a sluggish western. Denver Pyle also had to survive this, especially after appearing in many great westerns. Bad bad movie.
