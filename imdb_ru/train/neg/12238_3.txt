A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but ... <br /> <br /> Rudolph’s glowing nose didn’t require the “explanation” offered in this film - just like “The Power to the Movies” wars "did not need an explanation of" doctors in the bloodstream. " But basically the movie left me cold because of the overly complex Winterbolt conspiracy to destroy Santa. He has the opportunity to make suggestions to people's minds, so why does he make such workarounds? Destroying the magic of Rudolph's nose, substituting Rudolph, threatening to melt the family of Frosty ... Comically exaggerated scenes of "Pinky and the Brain" and "Doctor Dofenschmirts" Fines and Ferb (which are made in this way specially and played for laughter) seem simple and straightforward compared to Winterball which we should take quite seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly (and funny) weird moment when a character throws two pistols at a bad guy like boomerangs. I understand that if they don’t want a weapon in a family movie to shoot a weapon, then why even a weapon?
