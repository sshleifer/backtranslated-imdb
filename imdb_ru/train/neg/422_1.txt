A lot of death happens in the wild. You do not need to be a scientist to understand it! But should it be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this craze of horrible death? Should we see an adult elephant torn to shred by a pack of hungry lions? Or a cheetah slowly grabbing a gazelle by the throat! I thought it would be a family movie about nature! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show the terrible violence in the trailers of the film? Are the filmmakers afraid to lose money? <br /> <br /> Then, in a typical, ridiculous manner of relief, we see how the magnificent Paradise Birds perform mating rituals with the most annoying and stupid narrative of all people. It was surreal! As if the filmmakers believe that they only turn to one room with first-graders during a school trip! Blimey! From average to idiotic in an instant! <br /> <br /> If any of the future documentary filmmakers is waiting in the wings reading a film review, why not focus on: the animals actually copulating; give birth to; egg laying; bathing; sleep; wash each other; communication; play; emotional manifestations other than fear and anger; unusual behavior, such as thoughtfulness in the mouth; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what people call culture); communication skills; raising children, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or demeaning beauty, and why not become more versatile - instead focus on joy and inspiration?
