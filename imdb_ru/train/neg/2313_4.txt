Shintarô Katsu gained a lot of fame by playing the wonderful character Zatoichi. Zatoichi films had a strange and incredible concept - a blind guy - the greatest swordsman in Japan, who spends every film correcting mistakes and harsh retribution of villains. He's a damn good guy, and the movies are exciting and addictive (in fact, I've seen every movie). It is because of this that I saw the latest edition of the Hanzo the Razor series, since I thought it would be very similar ... and I was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo's films are extremely sexy in nature, and they also contribute to the rape of "women who deserve it." You see, Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period, and he regularly takes into custody evil women and interrogates them, forcibly forcing them with his “penis of steel”. The way he made his member so strong is what you have to believe in, but this, of course, is NOT for squeamish people. <br /> <br /> In general, I just can not recommend anyone to watch these cruel and misogynistic films. However, looking at other reviews, I see that they are still very popular ... and this is pretty scary. Despite some decent acting and terrific fight scenes, the films are just like brain pollution - and I don’t want to imagine how films could have contributed to violence against women.
