Margaret Landon’s annoying musical version of “Anne and the King of Siam”, filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunn and Rex Harrison, forced Deborah Kerr to play the role of a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to get a job As a mentor to many of the king's children - and perhaps teach the royal one or two in the process! The staged picture begins well, but quickly loses energy and concentration. Yul Brynner, repeating his stage triumph as King, is a commanding presence, but is used - according to a fictional story - as a jester. Kerr retained her class dignity and became better, despite the fact that she had to synchronize the vocals of Marnie Nixon. Perhaps, having already played this role to death, Brynner looks as if he has nothing left to broadcast the screen, except for Bombast. The second half, with Anna and the mopetas delivering the musical version of Uncle Tom's Cabin, is quite ridiculous, and the songs of Rogers and Hammerstein are mostly clumsy. Brynner won an Oscar for Best Actor, but the wicked Kerr is holding this trinket over the water. Too long, heavy and “old-fashioned” in the worst sense of the word. ** from ****
