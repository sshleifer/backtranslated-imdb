This film is so terrible that it is difficult to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> At first, the story is so ridiculous. A narrow-minded person can write the best story! Actors are boring and untalented, perhaps they were forced to play in this cheesy film. <br /> <br /> Filming in the National Forest is the only advantage in this whole film. I should be ashamed, because I paid for this lousy picture. <br /> <br /> I hope no one will continue or make a similar film with such a worse plot :-)
