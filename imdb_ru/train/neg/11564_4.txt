An Italian horror / suspense film about a rich English lord who travels to pubs and taverns for girls with red hair, like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know, he must have really loved his wife, because he brings them to his house — a huge, rotting lock — and forces them to undress, and then tortures them, beats them and kills them. The strangest aspect of this film for me was that somehow towards the end of the film we see this guy, played by Antonio De Teffé, as a HERO of the film. Anyway, soon after the advice of his playboy, Uncle Roberto Mulder de Teff settles with the girl he meets at his uncle's party. It is coming, and strange things are starting to happen with De Teffe's fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and, finally, well, just look at the name if you're still interested. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashion. Poor Aunt Agatha (she seems to be even younger than Deffee, and they are sitting in a wheelchair and trying to look old), appears to be in a foxish manner. Another person is introduced and then buried alive. And, of course, there is a full explanation of why / how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some things pretty well: the settings in the film are well suited for this film, although they are trying to make us believe that England is ridiculous at best. None of the actors looks in English. Many with dark black hair and Mediterranean complexion, dressed in the clothes of an Englishman, will not be caught dead. Cars driving on the wrong side of the road. But despite all this, the crypt scene was effectively filmed, and I also liked the stupid resolution. And, of course, any film with a sultry, red-haired Erica Blank is always a plus. There is a strip of sexual perversion; however, what I found somewhat horrifying with the idea that torturing women was quite normal and useful in order to free one of his psychic demons. C'mon.
