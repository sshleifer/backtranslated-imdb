This ambitious film suffers most from the megalomania of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. This clumsy elephant, derived from much better material (Almet Nashville, Lumet's Network), takes too long to go. Several erroneous workarounds (awkward musical interlude, biblical plague) do not help. Also not uneven level of performance. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and storyline could be completely eliminated; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing fear. And how many times should we see John S. Reilly's “sad bag” (“Chicago” and “Watch” will be enough)? Does tom cruise come off well compared ?? his woman-hater, Tie St Roller was pretty funny. Speaking of dirty mouths, the script was so loaded with “F” bombs that they lost their influence in an instant. Don't even talk about this terrible soundtrack, full of Amy Mann's tasteless and annoying vocals. Her extended performance of “One,” numbers from Maudlin to begin with, made me confused at the beginning of the film. I had to listen to the handwriting on the wall and save myself another three hours, and by that time I was on the verge of hell. One of the useful features that I did not mention in other reviews is the best game in the group of unknowns Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged coke demon, prone to self-destruction. Her authority far surpassed all others. This film took himself too seriously and simply did not know when to finish.
