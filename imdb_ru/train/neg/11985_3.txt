Ever wanted to eat worms? Here is a “documentary” to show you how! Yeah ... Baby eats live worms! And this is about the most interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> Previous reviewers have pretty well called this movie boring. I totally agree here. The film is simply not going anywhere .... unless you like to eat a worm! This is one film for which it is almost impossible to write a spoiler, because nothing much happens. <br /> <br /> Now about the technical side: they should cut this baby. Whom is he trying to look like anyway ... Bozo Clown. It was almost comical ... I almost expected him to turn into a shaggy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> And on top of that; the baby was too stocky to look hungry! It was necessary to keep him from junk food for a couple of weeks before shooting. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie almost put me to sleep. And my children could stand for about 15 minutes before they left the stage for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I recognize that the scenery was very impressive. And if there was a decent story to go with her, she could be a hit. <br /> <br /> It seemed safe enough for the children to watch: the scenes of the bear and the crank’s eyeball were too weak for most children to frighten, and the short scene of a weary fall showed nothing. <br /> <br /> I gave it a very generous 3.
