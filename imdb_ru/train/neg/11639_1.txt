SPOILERS: I always wonder how many people gave good reviews to this game. It was terrible. Only the script and voice destroyed it. Gabriel and Grace are the most incredible characters in the game. You almost pray for their death. And worst of all, there are fewer vampires in this game than werewolves in The Beast Within. <br /> <br /> The absence of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you're expecting some kind of story about Anne Rice vampires, forget about it. The history of this game has little to do with vampires. You will not even see anything until the very end, and even then you will not be able to fight them. <br /> <br /> History has radical and largely blasphemous views on Christianity. I am amazed that it fell from the drawing board. I am not even a Christian, and I found it offensive. The story mainly focuses around the search for the Holy Grail and buried treasures. The kidnapping of the royal child, which was supposed to be the center of attention, is really repelled. Gabriel does not need to urgently look for a child. In fact, he almost never asks anyone about a child after the first few time blocks. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty bad. Characters move at the speed of a snail even in the best systems. They are stocky and outdated. And from FMV The Beast Within it's hard to move on to this horrible game engine for the Blood of the Sacred. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace is also taking a terrible turn. I really do not know why it is so terrible urgent, but they sleep together. And this is not fun. Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Moseley how he thinks of Grace as a bigger sister, and he doesn't think she is for him. And he seems really dumbfounded that they slept together. But it is so unlikely throughout the game that it almost does not bother you. His dialogue was the worst in the game. And he was constantly making silly sexual hints at anything feminine the whole game. By the end of the game, Grace leaves him a letter that looks like Dear John. I believe she was fed up with them, like most players. <br /> <br /> I found this story annoying and boring. I was expecting to play a story about a royal child who was kidnapped by vampires. And I expected to see and fight vampires, perhaps even Gabriel or Grace would turn into one. But no. Instead, the story focused on the authorâ€™s distorted vision of Christianity. What a disgrace. Here they had elements for a great adventure, and instead we got it. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting parts of the game were at the very end. At the end we get some action-packed puzzles. But it was not worth suffering the whole game to get to them. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this game. I got it back when it came out many years ago, and I hated the game engine so much that I put it off for many years. I just recently brushed it off to see what I missed. And now I am very sorry that I did it. My favorite characters were destroyed. I hope there will be a fourth game to buy back the series. And I hope they get it right the next time. It would be a shame to finish the series with this part.
