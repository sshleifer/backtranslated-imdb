Just good, a horror movie about a good suburban family, connected with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement, which they continue to feed the people they pick from the street. Of course, there is more to this, but to talk about something more is to say. <br /> <br /> For me, it just didn't work out, because it tries to do it in two ways, both in family drama and in horror. film. The film is trying hard to keep up between the two genres, but it seems that it is coming across more and more, trying to be shocking, which is never the case. It does not help that the final revelation is not so much a panic as “o”, as in “Oh, is that so?”. Maybe if I hadn't watched so many horror films lately, maybe it would be better, or it might just seem like that, because I wouldn’t compare it to so many. <br /> <br /> I would take to pass
