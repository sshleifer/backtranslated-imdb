Iberia is good to see on TV. But why see it on a silver screen? Lots of dancing and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, this could be your dating movie. But otherwise, an hour and a half is too long. If you like to see skillful dances on a silver screen, it's better to watch a Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breathtaking dances with a long film. Directed by Carlos Saura can shoot dances from the old experience. And from time to time it looks really good. but when a movie is one hour, it should be at least interesting. There are many types of art, not all life, and this film is not too big.
