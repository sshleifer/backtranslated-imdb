History: Young Gong is a girl whose family suffers from a mental illness. She goes to a mental hospital after she starts to believe that she is actually a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-san, a young man with whom she has connections. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But “I am Cyborg ...” is a big departure from familiar and (unfortunately) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any movie or story that is trying to do something different. God knows, we are all exposed to enough shit in our local cinemas. The main thing that I want to say about the film is that it does not say anything about mental illness or the creation of characters that concern you. <br /> <br /> This story has to be one of the strangest things I've seen for years ... but strange is not enough. There is no heart in the film ... only surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. All the characters try to figure out their problems, but Chang-Wook Park itself turns out to be the most confusing of all.
