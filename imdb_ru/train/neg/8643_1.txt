The Blair Witch War movie, which is just as disappointing as Bwitch! The name speaks for itself, save your money and your time and spend it on a good film, such as “Once Upon a Time in America”, “Escape from the Shoushenk” or “The Enemy at the Gates” (if you want to watch a GREAT war movie) . d. <br /> <br /> This film, if it was a baseball team and a major league was top, and the single A was newcomers, then this film was a high school ball. It was filmed as if it were a school drama club that was filming the old dad's camera. Of course, they entered a hostile area (to make a film), but I don't call it brave, here we call it stupid! This is a pass all the way! Now go and see, and then tell me what you think.
