You can not imagine how I was looking forward to the king of ants. As a big fan of Gordon, I waited for the European premiere with an evil anticipation. Especially since I loved Dagon so much - Gordon's latest achievement. The King of Ants premiered here in my country, and it was Gordon himself. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate him on this later. "King of Ants" - his most boring and mediocre film to date. Indeed, the level of quality never exceeded the usual standards of a TV thriller. The outline of the plot is terribly common, and, with the exception of a few bad scenes, Gordon’s typical touch is never recognized. In addition, the already weak scenario has more holes than a Swiss cheese plate! This concerns a young imitator-cheater who was hired to commit a murder. So he does. And, of course, they do not pay him. And, of course, he falls in love with the victim's wife. And, of course, he is taking revenge for himself ... Only the sequences in which the guy descends in a spiral of madness are worth mentioning, and they are the only ones who remind you of the fact that you are still watching the film by Stuart Gordon. Acting below average: McKenna is a heroic hero, George Norm Peterson - Wendt is a plump bastard, Kari Urer is a kind-hearted sex bomb. Extremely illogical things happen all the time, and the sadness of the story very quickly becomes annoying, while the effects of the makeup are not enough to even satisfy horror fans. I read a few other comments about “King of Ants,” claiming that this is the best Gordon, as this is finally a thoughtful and mature film. Well, if so. lot. Well, okay, I think every good director in the end does not have enough strength and inspiration. Too bad he beat Stuart Gordon.
