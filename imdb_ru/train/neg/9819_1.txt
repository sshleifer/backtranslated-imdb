I read another comment about this film, and usually I try not to be harsh in my criticism, because I try to be a good person. Nonetheless, this film is one of the worst films I have ever seen (and it is at the head of many bad USA Network plus Cinemax nights.) Anyone who has thought about this film should be prevented from ever making another. This film disgusts me like no other film. I really think these people are insane. Just save your time and donâ€™t watch this movie. Please - I wish I had. The game is terrible, the plot (which plot) is stupid, demeaning and insane. I really do not think it should have been turned into a film. But this is my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from wasting time.
