In less than 10 minutes, I wanted it to end, because it was painful. This whole horror movie was that a group of whining bitches was doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Do not let the positive reviews fool you, as this is really a terrible movie and you really should not watch it. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film may be something great, but it just does not happen. One day, a group of five teenage girls go home when they are being chased by a crazy female driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes in the film, and the characters are already arguing, and that does not stop. All that we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls who cry, cry, scream, "play" and argue. None of the dialogues are even remotely interesting, so you can't really recognize or enjoy these characters. <br /> <br /> The game was terrible, and I was shocked to learn that these characters are meant to be teenagers. None of these women looked under the age of 20, and one of them easily looked as if she was almost 30 years old. At the very least, get people who look older. None of them gave even remotely decent performances, and it seemed that they were chosen from the street or were friends of the director without acting ability. The “actress” who played the role of the killer overdid it, but at least she showed what the other girls didn't do — a bit of talent. <br /> <br /> Characters do not help, because these girls are a bunch of tearful, stupid bitches. This is all I can say about them, and it did not help that they ALL survived. If I need to go into details, in one of the scenes the murderer pursues the girls and knocks them down a lot. One girl hurts herself and whines about it ... four of them are not wearing seat belts ... what do you expect? One of your friends was brutally assaulted by the killer ... did you just happen to be “too painful” by accident? Howbeit. <br /> <br /> Shooting a movie is absolutely terrible. I don’t care if this movie had a peanut-sized budget, the shooting was awful and it looked like watching a pirated version of the movie. The operator was clearly in the car with the girls, somewhere pushed her to the window, and the number of times when the camera blurred, shook and came into contact with the "actress" was terrible. It was also grainy, and sometimes you could not hear what the characters were saying (not that it was something worth listening to). <br /> <br /> Presumably, the killer car in the film (which supposedly got hit, although we only heard about an accident) is actually a car director in real life. Not surprisingly, they did not show that the car came under attack! This film is so cheap that they don’t even show how a car is a little scratched. Oh, I should mention the soundtrack ... if so. It was awful ... sad one second and then hard rock. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, “Five through my eyes” just seems like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the road at night when a bunch of silly girls screamed and argued for 90 minutes. It doesn't help when the script is terrible, scared / tense / unknown and (there is hardly even blood to make up for it) is missing, the action is terrible, and the quality of the image and shooting is terrible. <br /> <It was a terrible low budget movie. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
