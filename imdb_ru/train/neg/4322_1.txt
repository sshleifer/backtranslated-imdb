Read on and take note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (that's all!). <br /> <br /> Ruthlessly, this film is intended for the production (I guess) of a modern small town. American Christmas Fable in the style of Capra. If you fail ... completely and absolutely fail. I tried to come up with one good thing about it and I can not. Let me mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People donâ€™t die, they spend eternity as immigrant workers in the Santa factory. Angels are actually former cowboys who sit in the trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a good letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot .. I will not spoil it, but in the films there must be light to contrast with the darkness, but there is not. Even the picture is gloomy - the snow shown at the end of the frost looks cold, damp and unhappy everywhere. <br /> <br /> As you can guess, the film has a happy (black) ending. What a relief!
