I did not know anything about this film, before I was convinced to see his friend, who heard that it was “a non-stop epic battle scene from beginning to end.” It could not be further from the truth. It was one of the most boring, poorly written, unprofessionally shot, badly played films I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I would rate it there with a film that I consider the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no story there, it’s hard to believe that the creators of this film thought that this crappy soap opera shit would be taken seriously as a factual historical fact. It also shows some of the worst conversations I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... The guy says to the girl "You smell like the moon." The girl replies, "How does the moon smell?" OH MY GOD! Are you kidding! The scene where the guy pulled and quartered caused a good laugh to the audience, because it looked so ridiculously cheap, and the sound of the FX of the guy torn to pieces reminded me of someone who made a quiet sound with his mouth. If this is a game in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This film is so bad that I actually made a decision after 45 minutes that I needed to fall asleep ... and I did. Awful.
