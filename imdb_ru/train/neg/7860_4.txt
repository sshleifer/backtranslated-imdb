Martin Weiss, the director of the solid Rohtenburg, will, along with Wes Craven, take the heat off for another battered “The Hills Have Eyes 2”. The memory of the legendary original, which had an incredible storyline and a dog that has a memory, will forever be erased by this more technically honed remake (only in words). A group of national guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one, weekend soldiers are selected. That's all. There is cruel violence and a rather cruel rape scene, but there is little more to be glad about. The “heroes” of the film are a common group of clichés and mutants, quite distant from Craven’s original “family”, mostly resembling Brian Thompson from Cobra in combination with some creatures that Stan Winston left after shooting The Wrong Turn. Most of the action takes place in caves, ala "Descent", and is well shot by Sam McCardy. The ridiculous aspect is the addition of a sympathetic mutant to Wes and Jonathan Craven, who is hiding around his cave, like Leatherface, in Hooper's original Chain Saw. Weiss will be accused of this boring fiasco, but in fact he is not guilty, because he is doing everything possible to keep the tension and squeeze the freshness out of contrived situations. Unfortunately, not a fan.
