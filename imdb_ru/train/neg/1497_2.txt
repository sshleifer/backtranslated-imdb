Understand, I watch a movie that I saw. I understand that almost all naked bodies and blood were cut from this film, thus completely neutralizing it. When I saw the names of people like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson, I knew that I wouldn’t get the horror classics, but at least I expected causeless troll and bloodshed. But no, this must be the most murdered modern horror film, I mean, it's easy to say that there are much more specific scenes, ”but they suddenly cut off, or the scene just ends completely as soon as it starts. How one screw up to cannibals and porn stars? I mean, this is a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the director slept with some manager's wife or something, because it is literally amazing how much was cut from this. Reading about it a few years ago in Fangoria, I was excited, it looked like a funny movie, but unfortunately, the real movie is somewhere locked in the vault, and we have to endure this piece of excrement, entitled Evil Breed. I hope someday the film goes unnoticed, as I think there is a good film in this mess, but until then it’s best to take twelve packs of Bud, because this is the only way you can get through this film.
