This film is one of the most wildly distorted images in history. Terribly inaccurate, this film does nothing to commemorate the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous slaves whom the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built “over the bodies of the white man,” as stated by the chief Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors perpetrated by the Japanese invaders are the source of the film, in which the bridge itself does not even closely correspond to reality. The actual bridge was made of steel and concrete, not wood. Which of the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the film and all that it has to represent. Their friends were starving, torturing and killing cruel sadists. Those who have not died from dizantria, famine, or disease are deeply wounded by the film that illuminates their dark times.
