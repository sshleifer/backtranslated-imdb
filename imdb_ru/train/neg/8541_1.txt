Welcome to the movie 17 on the frightening classics 50 pcs. Where we will see is true. Another movie that makes absolutely no sense. Seriously, this film finally embarrassed me so much that I thought I was watching the movie “They're sleeping at dawn”. The plot seems simple enough ... well, is it up to 3 seconds in the movie where the girl allegedly killed the cat, and then ... um ... explodes? I have no idea what happened. and it was BEFORE THE HEADER SCREEN. It is very sad when I can’t even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> In any case, a photographer with a big mustache is shot in it, who finds this girl after throwing his second friend along the way to take pictures. something somewhere. so we get there, but not before anyone steals his jeep to drive 200 feet to the city. suspicious? Nope so they decided to stay in this deserted village with one old lady. and then blah blah happens and bla bla bla speak. The guy with the mustache somehow goes out into the fog, although the old woman tells him not to do it. He got lost, and then he finds his way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention that this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes in the house of a guy who looks like this crimson guy from Casablanca. Then they leave. There really is no point in this scene. It really is just stuffing. if you cut it out, no one would notice or take care. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately it was the best part of the movie. Wait. let me rephrase that. Indeed, unfortunately, it was the best part of the film. because the rest is so confusing that I had to look at IMDb to find out what happened. But of course nobody knows, so I am SOL. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most dizzying moments I've ever seen in a movie. They dressed her in a dress, he was kidnapped, then released, he ran back to the house, and then, finally, in the witch's house, and it ends? seriously. I have never been so confused in the movie. I mean, movies like “War of the Robots” are so bad that at least they FEEL. this film does not even attempt to be consistent. the final was as confusing as the end of “They're sleeping at dawn”, and the plot was much duller. This film gets 1 only for his "I have no idea what happened in this film." “The Mountain of Witches” gets 1 intricate movie viewer out of 10.
