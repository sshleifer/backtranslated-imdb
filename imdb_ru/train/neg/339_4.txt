Unlike “The Adventures of Bacaru Banzai,” or “The Big Trouble in Little China,” or “Conan the Barbarian,” which are terrible films that have a certain composure and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult feelings, “The Golden Child” is just badly. <br /> <br /> The room itself is not inoperable, and there are some funny moments. But here Eddie Murphy’s “upside down position” simply eases any sense of tension or danger in history. And the special effects are stupid enough to cause more damage to this voltage. The “mystical secrets” of Tibetan Buddhism are stirred up rather than attracted. <br /> <br /> Without the feeling that something is at stake, or that the characters are facing a real danger, why should we care? br /> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Eddie Murphy's big fans who can't help themselves <br /> <br /> - I can't think of anyone else <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 4 out of 10 for the random joke that worked.
