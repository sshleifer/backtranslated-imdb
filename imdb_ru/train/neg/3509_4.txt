Somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode from the Twilight Zone trying to get out. Considering that Cube was tight, well-made, claustrophobic and exciting, I'm afraid Cypher is a bloated, tedious rephrasing of a few weary topics that just don't add up to a whole lot, especially if you have seen almost any other half decent science fiction film. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to push all of his relatively short 95 minutes to an incompetent finale. None of the characters burn away from each other, and for a film made in 2002, this technology is really stupid. It is difficult to associate this tired and boring film with the director Cuba. This is not a bad movie, but it is definitely not a very good one. <br /> <br /> When you watch the grass grow, dye and dry, and you are bored with your stick insects, then by all means watch this movie, but other actions are likely to be more stimulating.
