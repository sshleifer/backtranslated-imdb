Weak, stale, tired, clich√©; wants to be a basic instinct, but misses the opportunity behind the opportunity for new perspectives, new ideas. Tasteless, banal, grotesque, without short-term value; oh wait ... it was only 90 minutes ... it must have * seemed * much longer! I'd rather clean the toilets at the bus stop with my toothbrush than I would have to go through it again. I express an opinion here: I think it means that I did not like it.
