I love Clash music, and I love the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this film, hoping to find out about the man behind most of it. But I left the theater, not knowing about Joe much more than I learned after reading the record in Wikipedia. The film never reaches the person, his thoughts and feelings. They collected a little material that they had, a shaky blurred video and interviewed some people about Joe Strummer around the fire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all, and that the director just wanted them to be in the film, and a few more celebrities to say, "Oh, he was such an inspiration for all of us." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (whom they apparently asked to keep his pirate costume in order to benefit from his current success in the Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not even wait for the body to cool down before he jumped in to sell his version of “the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart,” which has ever existed, sanctifying a person without knowing enough about it. > <br /> Of course, being a fan, I liked to see the images of the group, hear jokes behind the songs and the like, but in the end I felt what was left, as Joe Strummer's portrait could easily have been said in the 60s. -90 minutes <br /> <br /> Watch a movie if you are a fan, otherwise listen to the music of Clash or better yet undeservedly unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death, connecting all his rich influences together into one amazing sound.
