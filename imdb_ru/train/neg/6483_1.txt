It was not good. The characters were underdeveloped, and the only person was from the memories that I had in the previous film that contrasted with the “new” personalities (or their absence). I seriously thought the starting scene was Ariel's nightmare because of how absurd it was. It was serious. It only reminded me of all the annoying characters on the Disney channel - everyone is hyperactive, and the story shifts from action to embarrassing scenes without any real connection. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part was terrible songs - not catchy not surprising. In the original, Ariel had an amazing and powerful voice, and all the songs were memorable and fun. You remember them and you want to sing them. But the songs in this film were by no means creative; as if they are speaking in an annoying singing voice — rather weakly, disappointingly. I do not have the desire to sing to them that you usually get from a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> As if no one wanted to appear in this film, so they barely made an effort. This film needs a new storyline, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without annoying “Look at me! look at me! I'm so annoying! ”The mentality of this generation of Disney. : '(
