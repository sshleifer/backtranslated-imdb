If this film were written by a director and producer with the intention of creating the cult culture of bad cinema, it could (I would say) could become a hit. Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so terrible that it became exciting in terms of its shortcomings? Well that's all. Each cast must be nominated for the worst performance awards. It would be hard to find another film with a production budget that contained so little value. The whole point of opening scenes defies logic. The dialogue is absolutely incredible and illogical. The same applies to the behavior and the general plotline of the film itself. What is truly staggering is that some of the jesters in the meeting room have actually decided to spend money on this piece of garbage. Wow.
