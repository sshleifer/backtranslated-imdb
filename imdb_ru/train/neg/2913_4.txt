Of course, it is very nice to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, but I would expect something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. starting with the script, which I think was not wise, as some might think. especially the frivolousness of dialogues that put viewers in such a position, as if they were not smart enough to understand the situation, which in most cases makes the film unbearable. it also has an obvious ending; You can easily guess the killer from the start. the weakest part of the scenario is that the inability of seriously mentally ill patients to behave like normal people, like professionals right away !!! have they ever looked for the possibility of patients who receive heavy medications, act like professionals and use all medical terms that even normal people cannot use ????? !!!!!! also in the scene where employees were looking for the most dangerous patient, without any weapons to protect themselves, was another strange point of the film. and this scene was so suitable for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! These are not the only weaknesses of the film. The film also had a lot of problems. the image of the most dangerous patient was an exact replica of Hannibal, and the appearance of Togan at the very end was obviously the most terrible mistake he could make in his first film! the fuss about the greatness of the film and the interviews that the actors gave just made people show curiosity and make them see it. Gen is a complete disappointment. I would be interested, if Sahan was not so famous, could Togan make this film with such a large amount of budget? I hope that Togan will understand that playing the role of a director, as he said in an interview, is not fashionable. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely, and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully! he should know that he is not yet Hitchcock and not Shyamalan !!!! hoping that next time he will be more careful and creative in this big industry!
