There were great episodes in the series, this is not one of them. This is not a horrible episode, it's just hard to trace “The Man Who Was Death”, “Throughout the House” and “Dig This Cat, He Really Gone”. <br /> <br /> This episode is about a couple who just married Peggy (Amanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Schellen). In the first five minutes, you will find out that Charles married only Peggy because of her money. They go on a honeymoon trip, and their car breaks down the dirt road, and they have to take refuge in an old abandoned mansion. Soon Charles will know the secret of the Peggy family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the other episodes in the first season.
