I have to say that I am a fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - perhaps his best films. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. I cannot logically think that he put any effort into this, as he did with Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to look at it from the point of view that it is not like a movie. It looked as if someone else had directed it on one side. I do not believe that Carpenter put any effort into this. <br /> <br /> I just listened to the soundtrack to his old school H2 / H3 / The Fog, and it was awesome, especially for those times. > <br /> He used a style that nobody had, and he worked so well for his films.
