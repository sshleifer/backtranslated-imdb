Cafe Lumière is a beautifully photographed zero. Not familiar with the work of the director, I am well acquainted with the director, whom he allegedly pays homage to - Ozu Yasujiro. Even without approaching Oz in greatness, Hou did not report anything about the depth of emotions and Ozu’s concentration in a closed space. One thing that he completely misses is Ozu’s attention to the character - we didn’t even “present” his lead character (the perfect blank page). There are no medium or close shots of his people. One of the additional materials on the DVD offers interviews with actors and gives us exactly what Hou does not have - a good look on their faces. <br /> <br /> Bardem’s wonderful Spanish film Nuncha Paza Nada, which translates into something like “Nothing Happens.” This would be a much better name for this meaningless exercise. Throughout the film, we are given clues about a little-known Taiwanese composer, some of whose works we hear on the soundtrack. But clues, like everything else, add up to nothing. If you are not a train lover, this film has nothing to recommend.
