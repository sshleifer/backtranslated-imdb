Well, I watched it last night, and the only thing that didn’t make it absolutely terrible was that it was straight forward. There was not a single word around the bush that this child was the Antichrist. However, the film was simply poorly written. For example, they never explained how they made the incident at the dentist an “accident” or, eventually, how the policeman just miraculously ended up in the house in time to save the child without even calling the police. The scenes of death were simply very bad and not at all entertaining. The child they chose to play the Antichrist was boring and they could really choose the best child. Just do not waste your time watching this.
