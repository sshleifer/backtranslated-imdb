There was nothing in this film that I liked. It was so obviously low-budget with poor lighting and camera work (almost like Project Blair Wich, only it shouldn't have been like this). There was nothing special about the plot, and the film is just a drug over and over again. I actually quickly crossed the last 1/3 of the films, but that didn't help much. It looked as if it might be good out of the box, but I have to say it again: nothing in this film even looked good. There are no good actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was awful, and the dialogue was awful awful. On my personal scale, I give this film 0 out of 10. Yikes!
