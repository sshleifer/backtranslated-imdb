Given that the original version of the film “Ghosts” is among the top ten of my best films of all time ”, I approached this adaptation with trepidation. I was right when I showed caution, since this film is a poorly written and poorly executed load of the old game, all these I should have been ashamed of. The original was terrible for me as a child for one reason! You see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera work and excellent lighting to create fear, which is why he works. The shame of the new version is that it relies on smart special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, however it’s sad that there were ingredients (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones) to do that something different. !
