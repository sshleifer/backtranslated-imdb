* MANY MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW * This film was terrible. I'm a big fan of baseball, so I thought I would watch it, and I was very disappointed. It all started well .. When I saw the bad influence De Niro had on his little son, I hoped that he would become the best father throughout the film or something like that. In any case, in the beginning it seemed that De Niro was supposed to be the main character. He was the only one who believed in Bobby, and he had a delightful son, whom he was losing custody, which made me feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo, when out of nowhere he cruelly stabs Primo to death ... Not to mention that fragmentary repeating song "I WANT YOU ****! !!!!" at random inappropriate moments. <br /> <br /> Later, when De Niro rescues his son Bobby from drowning, I hoped that the film would be able to save himself. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby’s son. But, of course, this is far beyond the film, because all he cares about is to get CREDIT for the murder, and does it by kidnapping his son, Bobby’s car and dog and holding them hostage - Bobby just needs to hit the house and announce that DeNiro is a “real fan,” showing off his image when he bites a knife. <br /> <br /> In the end we got to a completely unreal scene ... It pours a damn, and we are expected to believe that the game was not named. Then, in some magical way, DeNiro appears on the field in the judge's costume and calls Bobby at home, pulling out his knife and starts hitting everyone who runs on the field. It looks like there are no officers on the field (but the police are on the way), so De Niro steps on the embankment and is preparing to file a knife to Bobby when they shoot him. But don't worry, this funny and enjoyable movie has a happy ending, because Bobby finds his son. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a sports movie. This is not about the fan. As far as I know, the fans are not mad psychopaths who threaten, rob and throw knives to their fans. This is probably the most painful film I've ever seen in my life. The plot was shallow, the soundtrack sucks, the film did not make sense at all. I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a movie.
