Although it is “better” than the first mulva (which says little anyway, I would prefer to watch the paint dry out), it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these low budget guys. I was forced to buy a few DVDs to support some Indian directors, and I regretted it. Some have not even been officially “released” (not bought by bootlegs from the cinematographers themselves), and I cannot even list how bad they are all. Avoid everything related to Teen Ape or Bonejack, as they appear in other small films with which they are friends. If you are friends with these guys, most likely, you starred in their films and enjoyed making them. But for those who had to watch them? Never. Bad video, bad audio, bad game, bad story ... etc. And so on. It's not even funny. I gave it 2 only because it has Debbie Rochon, and that’s it. Maybe he doesn’t even deserve 2. About 1 1 / 16th star, to show that she was a little better than the first (which I would like to evaluate in negatives). If you want a decent non-budget movie, go and get something from LBP “friends” at Freak Productions, such as Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. This is actually decent.
