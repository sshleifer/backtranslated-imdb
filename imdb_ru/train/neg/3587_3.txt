How can they go from Joe Don Baker (like Buffford Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Swenson (like Bufford Pusser in the second sequel). Why did they do that? and did not change it, because in the first sequel it was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and what I wanted to see in the second sequel. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 7 points out of 10, and I would give it 1 out of 10 if the story had nothing to do with Buffford Pusser’s life, but that was the case, and that’s why I gave Movie 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend to anyone who plans to watch this cheese, I advise you not to do this, but instead watch the first sequel.
