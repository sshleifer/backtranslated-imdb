I would like to give this movie zero. Cheesy effects and acting skills. The only reason to watch this movie is to see how bad it is. Let's start with the child who plays Brian. What a geek! I could not believe mullet! Then there was a conversation with himself. I think they could not just silence the film, but still. Of course, they also had to do skinny, and not what I wanted to see. But Jared did a great job compared to the special effects department. Everything, from the bear to the accident, was something that I could have done better myself. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production, since the film was not even called “The Ax”. Finally, I don't think a writer ever read a book, because nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this film smelled like a stinky goat!
