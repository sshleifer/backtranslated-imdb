From the age of eight I was a big fan of wrestling. No matter what federation I watched. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, this is all I watched. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. It was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge, and I was just expecting another pay-per-view. But at this time. I was wrong. Instead, it was the evening when one of the best wrestlers from Canada came out of life, because of the wrong stunt a real person died. Not much you can do to make a difference. But what happened after the death of Owens made me very angry. <br /> <br /> Instead of stopping pay-per-view and doing the right things, like people, WWE decided to protect what comes first, and it was money, keeping pay-per-view going as if Owens died never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but this was by far the stupidest decision he had ever made. <br /> <br /> And this shit with Owen saying that the idea of ​​a paid bench continues. Give me a break. When someone dies on a paid bench, consider its general meaning to stop it. This is similar to how a policeman killed a robber or robber, and then just left the person to die so that he could go home and call it daytime, as if the life of a man never mattered. <br /> <br /> But no matter what happens. Owen will be bored, and thanks for the memories of all the time you gave us.
