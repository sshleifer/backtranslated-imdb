My friends and I went out in 15 minutes, and we were not the first. After that we tried to get our money back. The cinema authorities would not allow this, but they agreed to let us see another film. The only time we worked was to see Dickie Roberts: "Former child star." As you can tell, it was not a memorable night. Perhaps one of my worst movie nights. A close second should be when I saw the double heading Internal Violations and Robbery. In conclusion, for the sake of humanity, please do not watch the Order.
