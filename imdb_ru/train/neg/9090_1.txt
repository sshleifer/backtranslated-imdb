A propaganda film about the Palestinian "business". If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you need to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or just an anti-Zionist, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with defending a country, is it?) It is worth spending an evening of entertainment on campuses in the UK and the USA. However, any informed and intellectually honest person will be outraged by the large number of lies presented in this video. I just hope that those who do not really know about the situation will not be spoiled by this anti-Semitic mud.
