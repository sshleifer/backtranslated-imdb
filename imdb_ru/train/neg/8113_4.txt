Papier and big leg **; THE ENGINEERING ENGINE COMPANY **; GETTING COPIES OF POPES ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I used them in my childhood, but after catching an episode from a series of three cartoons, now, that is, a few years later (they preceded a theatrical show of pirate yarn SEAS ”[1953]), I see how badly they hold! The character of Popeye is not quite cute to begin with, Olive Oil is clearly overbearing, and didn’t Blue’s antics also arouse much interest ?? In short, the scripts were frighteningly thin, rather awful and, as a rule, not very convenient for loading. This is especially teenage fare, but I doubt that today's children have enough patience to stay with them! Moreover, the animation style is unattractive. <br /> <br /> Taking each short circuit by itself, I think it improved from one to another: after the initial shock, did one adapt to his mediocre quality, so that the third cartoon easily turns out to be the most pleasant of all? Popey is entrusted to an army goat mascot, whose huge appetite does not cause him any harm (I know this is not original, but always a funny trick). One interesting element here was that the shorts were booked with Popeye, delivering moral pieces of wisdom to children in the audience.
