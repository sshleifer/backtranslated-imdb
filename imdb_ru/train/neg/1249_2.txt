What a disappointment, especially in the light of the budget provided, the technical resources available and the talents gathered. Is this not the fundamental rule for science fiction / drama to create a voluntary suspension of unbelief in the audience? POA 2001 creates a believable start, drawing us in, but after that Mr. Burton forgets that his film fans have a working brain. The excellent libertarian chimpanzee Helena Bonham Carter, the futility of human castles, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary riding skills (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding at full speed), a massive and immediate human uprising is too unbelievable. Mark Wahlberg has never projected any sense of real fear, danger or accident in this world upside down. Compare with the original, in which the nakedness of Chuck Heston metaphorically caught his complete helplessness and surprise at his turn of events. Wahlberg in uniform retains his modesty, but also his apparent sense of control and control in a stupid situation, and we never think about his well-being. Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real danger. Tim Burton should have used part of the budget for the literate scenario. In fact, after this unfortunate fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers generally bothered to allow writers and directors to strike. Let them walk. Trained monkeys could do the same as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001. I bet there will be no repeated ideas about this effort. It could be a new franchise and a wonderful new step for the imagination. Another opportunity missed.
