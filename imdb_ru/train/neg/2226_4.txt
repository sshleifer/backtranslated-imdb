DD movies were damn banal, damn stupid and had a plot that seemed very thin, but in those days they were at least a plot. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a comedy, but a mixture of melodrama, romance in all <br /> Each dramatic scene swelled disproportionately. <br /> <br /> Comedy is funny, but also banal. And yet the movie entertains you, in those days Govindaâ€™s films were loud, rude, but at the same time funny moments that people liked <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does his job well Music is in order <br /> <br /> Govinda plays well in comedies, and the drama Karisma is decent in parts and annoying in parts, Kader, as usual, Gulshan, Prem Chopra is a type of Shakti, funny
