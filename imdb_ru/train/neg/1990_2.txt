This may be a strong candidate for "The Worst Movie Ever." Perhaps, without the presence of John Hurt, this could be perceived as a children's film. However, the TRAGEDY of all this striving lies in the fact that John Hurt, one of the greatest screen actors, diminishes himself in this ... I gave him two points just because Mr. Hart WATCHED ... because he did not run away this is fast enough. As for the other actors, they are just awful. Jenin Turner, no matter how beautiful she is, cannot act to save her soul. And the lead actor, for all intents and purposes, is terrible. If you can rid yourself of this embarrassment, please do it. This is so bad, it almost hurts.
