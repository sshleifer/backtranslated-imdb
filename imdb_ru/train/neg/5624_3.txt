In his short 40 years on earth, the author of Jack London managed to squeeze in as many adventures and incidents as it seemed possible. This 90-minute film, presumably the biography of a person’s life, but clearly invented, does not even scratch the surface, and remains a story that is very mature for a modern retelling. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, portrays London, and his performance is both rude and responsive. He is not a problem here. Also not young and very beautiful Susan Hayward plays her future wife Charmian, whose biography about London is the “foundation” for this film. The life of London here was broken into a series of episodes through which the film is slightly skipped. Thus, we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the Bering Sea, a miner in the Yukon and a correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War ... colorful events, of course, but hardly anything like that . And the direction of Alfred Santella (he also directed one of the first films of Susan “Our Leading Citizen” in 1939) is at best inadequate. Making things rougher is a very poor quality DVD, with a dirty, looking print source and a hissing sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie, for me, was one of the additional features of the DVD: a catalog of all Alpha movies showing hundreds and hundreds of full-color posters. Let's only hope that these films are in better shape than Jack London!
