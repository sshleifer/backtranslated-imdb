Well, admittedly, as an Orthodox woman who lives in Borough Park, I'm going to be a little biased against this film. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin’s sole purpose in creating this film was to beat the Orthodox. With our wigs, modest clothes and individual chairs, we are already quite an easy target. Yakin never came to the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi dissuades Sonya from loving him more than Gd or their parents. Then he deliberately disobeyed his father’s order not to swim because of poor health. 2. Sonya glances at her son's son. Why is Hassidy from Monsie having such a strong reaction? It is hard to believe that she has never visited before. Let's face it, even Jewish reformers today hold Bri Mila ceremonies. 3. Did Mendel sleep during his classes with chosson? He must satisfy his wife’s passion in bed and not kiss her on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Borough Park! 4. Did Sonya and Mendel have been married for more than a year, and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other? A small hint - arranged marriage does not mean that the girl should take the first guy with whom her parents arranged it. The community also will not avoid it if the marriage does not work out. 5. If Sonya very much wanted to do the jewelry business, she did not need to go through her depraved son-in-law. There are Orthodox women doctors, lawyers, teachers, and so on. Sonya declared that she was more tearful than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she leaned back in her chair and waited for something to happen, and then complained that she did not like the result. It does not counter the environment; it condones the stereotype. Honestly, I think she got what she deserved.
