I was about 7 years old when the movie “DIRRE MONSTROSITY” was released. In Britain, he was advertised on television in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it was some kind of incredible blockbuster film. It was actually the first film I ever saw in a movie theater, and I was postponed for many years. The following week I was invited to watch the new Star Wars movie, and I refused. Until now, I have never seen this in protest against having to watch Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I could say that I was watching the trash. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Crazy nonsense that NEVER should have come to the cinema. However, all these years I was surprised to read that the director never again directed, as it seems to me. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!
