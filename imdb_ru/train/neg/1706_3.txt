Wow, it was a very bad movie ... as read in other comments, this movie has no plot, no character development, they may have had some kind of scenario, but this is hard to say based on the actual end result. <br /> Editing of this film really did not exist, it tends to move from scene to scene without any connection or anything to help the viewer determine what is really going on. <br /> <br /> All this This is just a low-budget film about a zombie that was not thought out at all, has a bad game, a bad dialogue, everything is bad. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this film from 1 or 2 is the blood factor. I think that it was there that they spent all the money they had to try to justify it. <br /> <br /> If you (like me) have not devoted yourself to searching and watching all the zombie movies you can find, donâ€™t watch this one. Period.
