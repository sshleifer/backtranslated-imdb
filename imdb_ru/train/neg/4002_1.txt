Social commentary was too bloated, and the mystery itself was built and revealed through a series of incredible coincidences that were completely incredible. Nothing has changed in the personal life of Fitz over the past decade, which makes it remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> I even found it difficult to understand why he complained about his stay in Australia compared to the possibilities of unraveling his secrets in England. Does he not hint at the Australian police? It looks like a very artificial plot to get him involved in a crime investigation. <br /> <br /> The last episodes of the original series were rather melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on nonsense, and this one removes this gown instead of returning to the focus of the first series. Sad.
