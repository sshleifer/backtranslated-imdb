I liked the original premise for this film, because of which I tracked it down, but the problem I quickly discovered is that it is well known what will happen during the first 20-30 minutes (twins will appear from behind the mirror and take over everything). <br /> <br /> There is no real turn (which is good), but the final disclosure also does not make much sense (how can it be covered by uncertainty and fear for the entire film if it is an evil person because of the mirror?). <br /> <br /> Admittedly, the scenes “behind the mirror” were frightening when they first appeared, and the killing of the blonde is also rather creepy, but ultimately it seems the film is in search of a story or a more engaging script and an overly scary soundtrack for 80-90 minutes doesn’t really shorten it, in fact it is getting pretty boring.
