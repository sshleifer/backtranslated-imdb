“The guy” is trying to catch the feeling “There is something in Mary” or “Meet the parents”, but it is more like it was edited because of the rejection of these two films. Fortunately, I rented it for a 5-day rental, because I could not sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The room is decent, and I liked the scenes where other guys automatically hid Paul's Mistakes (the check in Save-mart was great), but the script writing is absolutely awful. The dialog box in most cases fails, and as soon as you think that everything will finally go back on track, some unnecessary spectacle is stuck without any good reason. Also, how many toilet jokes does a single movie really need? <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the farce humor is great when it's done cleverly, like in the other films I mentioned, but this film just doesn't hit the target. I wish I loved Julia Stiles (ten things I hate about you were great), but even this could not help me get into this terrible movie. Save your dollars and rent "There's something in Mary" again.
