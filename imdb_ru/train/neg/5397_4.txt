I think this is one of the weakest works of Shakespeare Kenneth Branagh. After such big efforts as “Much Ado About Nothing,” etc., I thought it was bad The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhon ???), but my biggest trouble was that they mixed up Bard's work and cut out some pieces to put in music / dance sequences. <br /> <br /> You just do not play Shakespeare, and then you connect with the play. Sorry, but this is just wrong. I love a little Cole Porter, like the next person, but damn it, don't mess with Shakespeare. Skip this and see the Books of Prospero if you want to see the brilliant Shakespearean version of The Tempest.
