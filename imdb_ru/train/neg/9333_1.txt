Awful !!! I don't want to be too negative, but this film has a stupid monkey's IQ. What a disaster. I just could not believe how bad this film is. Dialogues are just very strange and off topic, the camera sometimes works Just awful, the music sometimes resembles the soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this film to see how much worse it could become. Some of the “actors” of the side impact are a complete disaster. which can hang down on my body falls to the ground. Harvey Keitl is a great actor, but who knows, maybe he is in a financial crisis to take part in such a fiasco film. This film should have been introduced to all students of all film schools simply to teach them how not to shoot a film.
