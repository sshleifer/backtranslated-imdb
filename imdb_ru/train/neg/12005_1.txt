We all saw endless epics in our time, but this one really surpasses them all! The film is so long and so slow that, just to look into the future, I felt much older when I left the cinema than I entered it. For almost 4 hours, it could be turned into a television series. <br /> <br /> What begins with a promising comedy gradually loses pace. Nikhil Adveni wove the plot around 6 love stories, and he cannot pay tribute to any of them ... There is no relationship between them, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes just seem to be related to the story. <br /> <br /> The situation is exacerbated by silly dialogues (most of which are repeated in Hindi movies for years) and stupid cinema. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not understand that she really needs to play her role, and not just a glamorous view of the screen ... a complete waste of beauty without acting ability. <br /> <br /> And then - Govinda with a loud sense of humor and turning in the face - better than Jim - Kerry Akshay Hanna, who belches with all his strength to annoy the already tired viewers. <br /> <br /> A good role in the film is the love story of John and Vidya, as well as the great acting / comedy from sohail & Isha. But they are so good at their roles that only these two couples could justify the film without mixing it with other characters. Their brilliance is lost among other substandard plot lines. <br /> <br /> I assume that the director has shot two separate films (maybe more!), and some new assistant has confused all the recordings, having dealt with them outside the point, the director has no choice to show everything it's like one movie ... <br /> <br /> You can watch it only if you want to test your patience !!!
