Your attitude towards prom II will determine what joy you take away from the movie. If you expect a masterpiece of horror, look elsewhere. If you like hiking movies that are quite interesting to watch, you will like it. Lisa Sragee plays Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd throughout her life, and the channels of Srage's anger blend beautifully in her “obsessive” time. <br /> <br /> Not a classic movie, but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending. <br /> <br />
