I saw this movie in the distant past when its premiere. <br /> <br /> It was based on the fact that autistic children can communicate with printed messages with someone just by helping them and directing their hands. <br /> Then all of a sudden these children, many of whom did not even watch the keyboard or the screen, when the messages were printed (in some cases they could look at the ceiling), but their moderators looked at the Keyboard and started typing the allegations by their parents and others, sending parents and child welfare agencies into agitating, left and right. <br /> <br /> It all turned out to be wrong when the third person submitted the folder, opened it to the child and said “print the picture you see”, and then, when the presenter turned the folder to a moderator, the fold would fall, opening another different picture . <br /> <br /> So while the Child may have seen the dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Every time when they bloom, the name of the printed picture was what the moderator was watching, not what was shown to the child. <br /> <br /> So who typed? Never baby. <br /> <br /> In this film, there was a catastrophic turnaround, because, as stated by the Australian poster, the person who mocked the child in the film was in a situation when he tried to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert had never placed her son in this place, he wouldn’t be bothered, the film says so. He was better under her supervision. <br /> <br /> If I send my child to your organization for help, and instead they are put in charge, do you think I will be interested to hear everything you need to say after that? Most likely not! I think it is safe to say that all these accusatory messages that these children printed on which this film is based have never blamed anyone for their operation, as happened here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recall that the film showed Gilbert as the mother of an autistic person very well, but apart from this, the film really did not give much. <br /> <br /> The worst of what the child typed on Patty Duke’s end, and we hear the mechanical voice read what he typed. , , , , "we won!" This kid was molested. If you cut off my leg, and I take you to court, and you are found guilty of harming me, attacking me, or something else, then this is legitimate justice, but it does not bring my leg back. <br /> <br /> In best of all, in my condition, I will regard it as an empty victory. <br /> <br /> Any chance that this child had in what is perceived as normal with autism alone is further damaged by harassment. <br /> A “normal” child has enough experience to fight such an experience. <br /> <br /> It is completely superficial to think that you should look at any situation and say “we won” if this person is found guilty. in a court. <br /> <br /> Just a poor management of the situation and circumstances here.
