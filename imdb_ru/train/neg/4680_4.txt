If I were asked how I would define the word “petty,” I would answer: “Watch the production of Jerry Bruckheimer.” If I were asked how I would define the phrase “Wasted potential”, I would reply: “Watch the production of Jerry Bruckheimer.” Bruckheimer's productions are almost always confident that they will go to the cashier, but almost always receive critical hits from critics. Above my head I can only think that the OFFICER and GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN receive many critical reviews. <br /> <br /> Crimson Tide also received some commendable reviews from critics; this is undoubtedly one of Bruckheimer's best films, which, alas, say little. The problem I faced is the scenario that creates history: Russians fight Chechens, and the conflict spreads throughout Russia, which leads to the fact that ultra-nationalist Russia seizes the nuclear missile base and threatens the West if they intervene. Perhaps the end of the Cold War was related to this, but I think this is very unconvincing. Some errors in geography do not help, such as the French carrier Foch, located in the Mediterranean (wouldn't Foch be better positioned in the Black Sea?) Or that the illustrative newsreel consists of famous cadres showing conflicts from the Balkans, Vietnam. Once again the adjective "Very unconvincingly" crawled into my head. The story really improves when the real story begins - the Battle of wills about orders between the commander of a nuclear submarine and his second number. Directed by Tony Scott is doing everything possible, like the actors, but the problem still lies in the unconvincing script. Worst of all, if it were made in the mid-1980s, when WW3 was a real opportunity - no, most likely - this film would scare me, but after the end of the Cold War, the danger of nuclear war, which means that CRIMSON TIDE little influence.
