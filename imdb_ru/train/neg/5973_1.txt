This film is another excellent example of the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer, beginning in 1997, seems to be the best to show the film a year before its release, but does not make a quality film. I am not a film critic, but this film was as predictable as they are. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a touching moment and a pathetic attempt at a love story was exactly what I had predicted in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this.
