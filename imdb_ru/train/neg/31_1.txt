This is the biggest insult to TMNT. Fortunately, Venus does not officially exist in the TMNT canon. There will never be a female tortoise, it removed from the tragic tale of 4 unique male mutants who will never have their own family, one day there will be no more. The biggest mistake was crossing the Power Rangers in TMNT with a terrible episode; The turtles' voices were WRONG, and they all acted not by character. They could have done such a better job, better design and animatronics, and there would have been no VENUS. <br /> <br /> don't worry about these people ... this is worthy material. lip flap was slow and unnatural. They absolutely do not respect the crusher. the main villain, some dude of the dragon overlord was corny. turtles looked trite with things hanging from their bodies, what about things around the hip of Raf? stupid looking sculpted plastrons!? <br /> <br /> If they looked normal, acted in character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the silly sounds of a children's cartoon ... and it would be better to write it would be good.
