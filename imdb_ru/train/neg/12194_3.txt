The film begins with a voice telling the audience where they are and who the characters are. And at that moment I began to dislike the film. With all the endless possibilities that any director has, I really think this is a very simple and cheap solution to express the situation in a voice that tells everything. I truly believe voice overs is a betrayal of the concept of film making. <br /> <br /> I don’t like to hear a voice that says where we are, what date we are on, and especially what the characters feel and think. I believe that the director should find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after a bad intro, a very striking film begins that lasts a long time. The lives of the middle class family and all members are individually depicted in a perfectly realistic way. I think that the director has a talent for shooting real situations. For example, a father who has to make personal calls from the bathroom may seem abnormal at first, but life itself leads us to some situations that may seem abnormal, but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer about real life. <br /> <br /> But it is. After a while, realism in the film begins to sacrifice storytelling. I really felt that I had a severe headache because of the non-stop talking characters. As if the actors and actresses were given the subject and allowed to improvise the dialogues. In fact, this is realistic, but characters who always ask each other “is it really so”, etc., or characters who say no or you listen to me ten times when I say this only one once, enough for me to have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that the scenes with gaming practice and reading books are more than they should be. I understand that the play and the book in the film are very connected with the plot, but I think the director missed the moment when he should stop showing these scenes.
