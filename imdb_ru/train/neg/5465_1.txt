This film holds a special place in my heart, like the worst movie I've ever seen. This is about as much fun as hard manual labor for stomach cramps. The film starts off badly (I would rate the first few minutes of the movie at 1/10), and then it gets worse every minute. The only way to evaluate it would be some kind of bottomless spiral negative number that grows over ninety long minutes. The unfunny is not a real word, but it best describes the humor in this video. Somehow, the video can even make pretty, scantily clad women and sex look grotesque and unpleasant. This film is strikingly bad. I would say that it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over again, and with the Bushemi character from ESCAPE FROM LA playing in your ear than watching this movie. Sequels are not so bad. If you need to rent a movie Troma, take Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I would prefer to watch 5 Tony Little commercials to see the NUKEM HIGH CLASS again. Do not get me wrong, in order to make the film so terrible, some criminal genius was needed, and if the film deserves a reward for being terrible, then this is it.
