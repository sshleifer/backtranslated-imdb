I have this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 at a fairly large video store to do some sort of “indie” film research, since I just finished my own function and edited it. Now that I feel depressed about my newbie director skills, I just sit down with a plate of cookies and chop off. In a few minutes I feel great !!! <br /> <br /> I hate talking to another director, so I’ll just use constructive criticism. 1. Find good actors. time. It really helps. 2. When shooting video, lighter scenes and blackout in the computer later in the post. 3. Close-ups are better for video. 4. When the actor enters the scene, wait a little before <br /> <br /> for them to speak, so that we know what is happening and who is speaking. 5. Never show the back of the door while we wait for someone to open it. Damn it, it costs $ 3.99 <br /> <br /> True Horror will receive the feedback that Sevred has here on IMDb. And you have to pay tribute to these guys ... they really got spread.
