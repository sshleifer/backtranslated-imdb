Wow ... <br /> <br /> I found out about it at a local Wal-Mart by reading on the Internet that it was released before. I followed this on the Internet for some time and I just had to buy a movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think what struck me was the installation, or the lack of it. Again and again, the characters (usually the Narrator and whoever he is) appear to be marching ... and marching ... and marching. I am not an editor, but I know that you can go through someone leaving point A to show that it arrives at point B. There is no need to show almost all the way! Wow ... <br /> <br /> Actually, I felt a little sorry for the actors involved in this. They did not seem to be given instructions as to what to do during other scenes, except how to look scared or look happy, depending on what action needed to be added later. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> Why I decided to use almost all the effects using CG, I do not know. Even ILM still sometimes uses thumbnails. One of the most distracting uses of the green screen in this film is the constant fussing around (according to the final credits) of the same group of people representing citizens of different cities and towns, including London. Sometimes these people come and go, not paying attention to the angle of the shot or the distance from the camera. In one frame in London, apparently, at least two people over six feet tall follow the narrator's brother (he is played by the star Anthony Pian without a distracting mustache). Since in Gettysburg, I have not seen such a fake piece of facial hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know why Timothy Haynes told this movie the way he did it. This is turkey, simple and straightforward. On the positive side (at least for me), he provided some of the most authentic ludicrous pieces of fun I have seen in a long time.
