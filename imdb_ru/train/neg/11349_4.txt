In fact, this is a lie, Shrek 3D was actually the first 3D animated film. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Hasn't Bug's Life also done this? I think it was in Disneyworld in this tree, so I say before they go and use it as a logo. Also Shrek 3d was a motion simulator in Universal studio. They should still treat it like a movie because it appeared in the “theater” and you can buy it for DVD. The film was cute, at least the little flies were. I liked the IQ. I agree with the animsteer, they did an excellent job of making a movie out of something that is just an adventure. I recommend this to families and children.
