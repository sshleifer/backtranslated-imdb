I love the image of the 30s and 40s in the film. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than willing to love this picture. but . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, sir, nothing good about it. The only interesting aspect for me was the character of Colin Farrell - an unsafe writer, and this scenario, despite the solution to the juicy question of racism, approaches the audience in the style of ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> The only person who does not seem to be “playing” is Sutherland, and his minutes were short. <br /> <br /> A stale approach to a weary conspiracy.
