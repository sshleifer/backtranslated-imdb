Almost every detail of the plot in this film is illogical and implausible. There is no semblance of genuine human history, dead and dull. This is a Hollywood parody, with musical trumpet notes reminiscent of Denzel Washington's movie, shaky camera shots and focusing, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and funny frames and gestures of famous people in the clothes of the clothing catalog. This is done to serve a variety of zombies, whose meaning in life comes from viewing celebrity names. The only good thing about the movie is the end credits and the fun song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot for watching this, save yourself.
