This movie is outdated and misses the mark. This is far compared to 89 Batman that he is trying to cope. That singer, what is her name, can not speak, and we see why her film carrier has died. Notice how this film died at the box office, no one saw this film on TV. My uncle and dad were expecting Batman, and the impression from the films is more like Cop Rock. Do not rent out 3/10
