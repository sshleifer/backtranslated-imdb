I saw this director "Woman on the Beach" and could not understand, from good to excellent reviews. This film is very similar to one, two people who have fallen into a relationship with very little dynamics and even less interest in anyone else. As in his other films, you need to listen to empty dialogues, deal with them very little and be fascinated by signed, rather uninteresting characters. If you think you might like this movie, don't let my review stop you. I like the minimalism in the films, but I feel that the films of Tsai Ming-Liang are far superior to me. He has a pretty awesome actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here I wish I liked it, but I do not. Well.
