I have been using IMDb for several years now, but I have never written reviews before. However, this film disappointed me so much (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I could no longer remain silent. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so agitated by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a vigil "Rectifier" and destroys any cars he finds car alarm sound. <br /> <br /> I take the title of the film must be somewhat wrong. Although there are one or two cases of other sources of noise that are considered or mentioned, the only true goal of our main character is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There really is no other focus. When a film tries to link other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarm, it seems to be simply added to justify the actions of the Robbins character. <br /> <br /> Yes, the noise annoys us all. No one likes the sound of car alarms. Of course, we all have an inner urge to carry a baseball bat to a screaming vehicle, and this film uses this fact, and pretty much this fact alone, to sell this film. I say “pretty much” because there are also clearly invented sexual relationships (including a completely unnecessary trio), which are obviously added to those viewers who need such things to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Robin's character, who soon appeared in the film, becomes completely unreliable. It seems less that he decides not to put up with noise anymore, and, moreover, by focusing on this noise, he began to lose his sanity. The first half of the film is essentially a story about how he turns from just an angry guy to a car and turns into the hero of a little guy, Rectifier. However ... the transformation does not occur. He just renames himself. <br /> <br /> I could continue. Irritating generalized social comments appear from time to time to add to the pretentiousness of the film, and a smug smirk that never leaves Robbins’s face does not help either. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it’s quite obvious what this film is trying to present, since it pretty much pushed you into the throat, but in my opinion, it failed to a great extent. Just the opinion of one guy, hooray.
