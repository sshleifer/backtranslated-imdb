I saw this film as a very young girl (I'm 27 now), and it scared me to madness for many years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film, from how it was associated with music to (obviously) violence. My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch this, and both of them say they will never allow me to watch such a film. I think they only say that, knowing that I have such strong feelings about this; 0) I am currently reading a book (out of painful curiosity and the fact that it is a classic), and this is a really great story. However, I do not think it should have been turned into a cartoon. Ever Well, maybe children nowadays find it strange, but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks, and it is still difficult for me to look at rabbits painted in this way. Every time gives me a heartbeat. Yes, I'm a loser, but I strongly recommend to any parent who wants to show this film to their children, instead, read them a book or watch it first to make sure they approve the content. Not everyone considers it as disturbing as I am, but we are there; 0)
