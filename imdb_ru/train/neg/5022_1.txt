Oh, dear, this film was bad for various reasons. I expected to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the total score. Sorry, but appreciate it highly, like many, this is a joke! As soon as you overcome the single-frame / black-and-white movie trick, which was a good idea, the movie drags on, even with a duration of only 66 minutes. The sequence of credits at the start was also so annoying! In the van, the guys tolerate a flat tire and change the wheel, wow, that was necessary in history! How slowly did the guys chase and really manage to hurt Campbell? They didn’t seem to have bothered to keep chasing him ... sigh .. I’m just glad I got it for free with the special edition Evil Dead !!
