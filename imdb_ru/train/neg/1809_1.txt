There is nothing I hate more than self-glorification of pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to be hooked on toenails for inspiring all the whites of the white middle class to make a film about why they shouldn't be put off. I really donâ€™t mind inexperience and low-budget productions, but when writing is so obvious that the cover really burns my potatoes. The money invested in this could go to a real struggling director who actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you watch the Project Greenlight, you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who fights with the system. Anyone could take a camera and make a talkative picture that cannot say anything at all. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and the Uedonett of the world? The revolution cannot come soon enough. See what you are doing for the first time, buying Desperado or looking for friends with profit. Thanks and have a nice day.
