There’s one good thing about this movie: Lola Glaudini’s ass! Sorry to be so stupid, but true. It is a pity that she did not nu. At the very least, it would make this mess tolerable. We see another chick's boobs, but she is not near Lola. And man, Armand Assante is old or what? The man looks like shit! “Aftermath” is the usual B-movie you expect. The story had the potential. It was as if they had good ideas, but they did not know how to implement them. Cinematography is just awful. Nasty! The direction does not inspire, and the result is a soft thriller with unconvincing twists and washed actors. Lola Gaudini is gorgeous, like a fox in a cheap, dissolute form, but even she does not save the “Aftermath” from rubbish, not from ridiculous rubbish, just from old stinky rubbish.
