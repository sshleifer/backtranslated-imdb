I give this pretentious piece of garbage 1 simply because I do not believe that there is the worst movie in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this film, I hate acting, dialogue, staging, writing and directing. I hope that everyone involved in this film burned and perished in the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Gosh, this is a disgusting waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day that this film is just a figment of my imagination. I pray that I have a dream about the film, and I will never again have to see it in my local video store. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
