What a horrible movie. I can not believe that I spent 90 minutes of my life watching this mess. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mekhki Pfifer starred in this film? Mekhki Pfifer is great at E.R., and Ving Rhames probably didn’t know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. The background music I have to say didn’t fit AT ALLLLL to the story, and it’s amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no life in making a well-balanced film. I hope that in the future no one such terrible director will be able to destroy such a wonderful classic film. This film should not have been made in the first place. Advice to all who saw him, please tell me that I am right, because I could not be the only spectator who did not like it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.
