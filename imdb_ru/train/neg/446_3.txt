It was disappointing. It started well enough, but as it went on and lost every opportunity to take off, it fell. The play of Maria Schrader is terrible, she never means what she says, and does not even know what she is saying until she says. She did not show any sincere emotions at all, neither to her favorite goya, nor to the story of her mother. When with Lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's history. It seems that between Lena and her mother there has never been a real relationship, except that her mother seemed to have a good time at the wedding, and that is not much. The supposed parallel between Hannah’s “mixed” novel and her mother’s relationship with her father was just as cliché as they did, and still failed. The wedding was completely unconvincing and stupid. The culmination of the protest was boring, and regardless of what Lena had or didn’t do to influence the result, she would surely show some difficulty in feeling at that time, a ghost, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the film’s heroes had either a depth or a spark. It was very difficult to take care of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Louis was a distraction. (Why did she so deny him when she spoke on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation for this.) If all the links to him had been removed, this would not have been noticed. <br /> <br /> Simple story, confusing bad character development (whose mother again ??), weak acting and directing, because of which everyone looked like they were playing. You could almost hear "silence on the set!". I began to think that it was a decent figure of 7, but when the film continued, it quickly fell to 4, and then earned 3 after the stupidity of the wedding scene. It was about as cold and barren a film as I saw. A terrible waste of a good story.
