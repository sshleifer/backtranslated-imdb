The Pokemon film was a terrible movie. unlike the first, this is not a good movie at all. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama was created in it. in the first, the interaction between the characters was decent. Brockâ€™s subtraction and footprint was bad. Tracy really has nothing to say or do, and, unlike Brock, does not offer comic relief. The only good moments are that you see how Misty really gets upset about the ashes, and her early thoughts about what she called her girlfriend were interesting. In general, this film is not worth renting, and this short film did nothing for me or my wife. and we consider ourselves Pokemon fans. well, maybe the next one will be better.
