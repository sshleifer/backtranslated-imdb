Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just don’t understand why you have to spend money on a movie that you can shoot with your father’s video camera. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a movie, not a group of people who think that it would be nice to spend some MiniDV tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate this movie so much, because the guy in the video store said it was great and it wasn’t. Maybe I hate it because it is cheap, it has the most stupid plot EVER, the most unrealistic characters EVER, and indeed, really, truly, a CHARACTERISTIC SHOW in the history of films. Even Tom Savini can't save it. Seriously, this one is a waste of time.
