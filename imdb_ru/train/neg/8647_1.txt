Amateur to extremes. Working with the camera, especially overloaded - the operators of the documentary cameras should not rotate ALL TIME. <br /> <br /> The scenario is really meaningless, and the action is even worse On top of that, the story is incoherent and tortuous - with some gaping holes in logic. At some point, the presenter wants to be thrown into prison in order to communicate with suspected al-Qa'adah militants and, thus, get an interview with Osama. I found the story to be completely unbelievable due to many flaws. "Filmmaker" / the main role really portrays a rash, idiotic boy. The only interesting point is that the directors shot the film on the spot. It is a pity that they missed the opportunity to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this shit?
