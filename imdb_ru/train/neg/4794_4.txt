Why watch this? There is only one reason - the greatness of John Saxon. I love his game. My favorite performances are “A Nightmare on Elm Street” 1.3 and 7 as the father of Nancy, a policeman, “Black Christmas” as a policeman and “From Dusk Till Dawn” as a policeman. When I was rummaging through my video store at a local mall, I came across a Zombie Death House film, and I quickly threw it back, but before moving on, I noticed that John Saxon was not only an actor in this film, but for the first time I've heard about the director in my life. It intrigued me (also a cheap $ 9.00 price tag), and I and I had to have it. When I got home, I realized that this film did not fit the other works of Saxo, even his actions, which may have been confused by the additional pressure of direction. But not only he, but other actors were lame. It seemed as if they were all pulled out of a recent porn shoot and told Now you guys really should act. The film even looks quality porn 80s. I can't honestly recommend this movie to ordinary viewers, but if you are an obsessive 80s fan who missed the culture that came from that era, being born late into the evening, or shit movies fan, than this one, Also, if you're digging John Saxon like me.
