I tried to restart the movie twice. I put it on three cars to see what happened. Has Steven Seagal's voice changed? He died while filming, and the studio had to duplicate the sound with someone who doesn't even look like him? Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you will finally hear the real voice of the actor. Although for most of the movie it sounds like the sound was recorded in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this film to Goodwill if I owned this copy. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I will check this database before renting his films, all of which (more or less) were good. You usually knew what you were getting when you watched a movie about Stephen Seagal. I think no more.
