Words cannot describe how terrible this film is. This is a series of random, unfriendly clips about everything, starting from a silly parody of Batman and ending with a guy filming an old dead lady (REALLY disturbing). The only remotely funny thing about Underground Comedy is watching Joey Buttafuoko, the best actor in this movie. In addition, he has an NC-17 rating, avoiding the only people who can tolerate it.
