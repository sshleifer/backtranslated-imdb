That's why Jane Shaw will not work. Canadian producers and screenwriters once again can not create a comedy series, without giving it much importance. I think that these people do not watch many television programs from the United States that have a sitcom model. No, here we have to do something else, we have to make history A absolutely absurd, and then have a meaningful history B to try to make up for it. The characters are two-dimensional, and the storylines have gone far: the race for loaders ??? give me an awesome break. Here is a little advice for the writers of the series: do not write funny situations, find funny in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write really funny things, and not just be an improvised monkey.
