My grandmother took me and my sister to see this film when it came out in theaters in 1998, and so we gladly bought tickets, popcorn and soda, went straight to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not applaud strongly, I remember that I heard several people say that they didn’t like it at all, I didn’t like it, I thought it was pretty stupid and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical about it, but apart from him the whole film was bad, I rarely laughed at the roles in it, I also remembered that other people in the theater almost did not even laugh. And what I really thought was bad, made the animals speak, because talking animals exist only in cartoons, in action films, they are completely fools! I said that besides the hysterical turn Eddie Murphy, which he introduces, this film is not worth watching, it is rather stupid. <br /> <br /> I saw Eddie Murphy in several films and I thought he was funny in those I just said he was the only funny part of this film, I also didn’t see Eddie Murphy in really " the magnificent "movie" The Adventures of Pluto Nash. " This film is not the film that I would recommend you to see, because besides Eddie Murphy, you probably will not like it, especially because there are a lot of talking animals in it! <br /> <br /> I will give this film a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars.
