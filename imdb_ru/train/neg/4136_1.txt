I read reviews before I watched this movie, and I didn’t believe them. I like shit movies, and I expected this one to be average. None This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like great ones. The film contains a bad game, bad sound, bad tangled storyline, bad makeup - and I'm so bored that I turned it off. even nudity was nonsense! Did they even have a budget for this film? I do not think they did. You can tell whether you like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. if you want a good cheese film, go see toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood. Avoid this trash - I watched it on TV and felt torn off, so don’t waste anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
