Greenway seems to be in the habit of trying to consciously avert his viewers. This film opens with incest - and meaningless, meaningless, random incest. This is Greenwayâ€™s big problem. He prefers that shocking stunts do something meaningful. Technical skills are not enough. He's just a little perverted for the sake of perversion.
