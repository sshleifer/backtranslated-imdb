On a distant planet, a psychopath was saved from execution by a space monk. He releases several prisoners and is released from prison on a spacecraft. They dock to the ridiculously large spacecraft, which revolves around a supernova star. This massive craft is inhabited by only three people, presumably because the film’s budget did not cover the hiring of many actors. In any case, in short, the three goodies end in a game of cat and mouse with the villains. <br /> <br /> The psychopath in this film is curious that it is annoying. “Irritant” is usually not the term that can be used to describe a madman — perhaps frightening, dangerous, but not “annoying”, but he is. The three people controlling the giant ship are seriously inconclusive because they guarantee such important roles - this ship is almost the size of a city! Considering that the film will be installed in about 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge artificial ship can exist, not to mention that it is used for such a relatively worldly task. Despite the huge size of the spacecraft, all crew members are terribly equipped with tiny rooms, and the dining room consists of a plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty well made, and it works like a sci-fi thriller. But nothing great.
