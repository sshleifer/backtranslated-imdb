This film was basically “Velvet Gold Dwelling,” if the writers of a party of five took possession of it and made it television. movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had - good acting, writing, and everything else. The film was one of the worst works I have seen since the days of the Wild Wild West. This should definitely be interesting. I know vh 1 has become a household name for their musical shows. which is much better than all this, which would have worked if it were behind a musical episode, but it didn’t work, and it looked flat on the face
