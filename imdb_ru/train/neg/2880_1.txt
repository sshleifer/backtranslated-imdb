I have never watched a movie in such a short time. The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD device. It was like watching a badly filmed CBC movie. Obviously, there was no money for lighting, filming, film set, film set, scriptwriters, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story either! I need to write ten lines of commentary ... Bad, terrible, terrible, terrible, painful, painful, choppy, nauseous, nauseous, sentimental, disgusting, sickly this piece of shit staging!
