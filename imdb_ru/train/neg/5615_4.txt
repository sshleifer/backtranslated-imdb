I watched only DVD 1. In the program itself there can be 10 minutes of useful information; otherwise they are snotty insults of religious people. As if director Brian Flemming had only recently discovered atheism and sarcasm, and feels that with these tools he can easily beat his opposition. <br /> <br /> In addition, Flemming is actively involved in his personal problems, and they take on a movie. It never returns to the topic. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to dismiss skeptics when their objections to religion are clearly rooted in abusive education. The arguments from such affected people seem irrational and, therefore, unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will need more data. We do not need to say that religious people are crazy, just as American Jews do not need to tell how annoying Christmas music becomes mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, Superintendent Fleming’s Children's Christian School is quite shrewdly opposing the director because of his reasons. This seems to be the most honest part of the film, and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming were a bit more self-conscious, he could have a good story about himself (past and present). a) attitudes towards Christianity and offensive institutions that inspired him to youth. <br /> <br /> And perhaps he could have provided the material “Christ never walked the earth” to a more serious documentalist. I do not study the writings of Sol / Paul to find out how impervious it is, but a quick look at Wikipedia shows that most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> Bonus interviews are pretty good. Nevertheless, they do not support Fleming’s thesis. Sam Harris is a good representative of anti-religious POV, and he does not cover these other non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easy Google) interviews on Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
