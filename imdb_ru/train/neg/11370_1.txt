This video contains a clever way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. Itâ€™s a pity that the people who did this really believe that Americans are stupid enough to believe it, perhaps as an American citizen, everyone should protest against this kind of crap. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... The Quran is publicly available! You can read it yourself and decide if this is true or not, what they say ... <br /> <br /> The video uses a variety of audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and linking things that are not even connected between by myself. The music used in some moments prepares the public to hate what they see, even if they do not understand what is happening there. They use images that do not match their original content. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to think ... Do you think that you can make the same film with each religion in the World?
