Continuing the film “Cleopatra Jones,” released in 1973, stately black actress Tamara Dobson returns to her proprietary role as a chic, superhard anti-drug agent who here destroys the heroin ring in Hong Kong. The cross-pollination of action films from the films of the Blackspace and Kung Fu is fun from the very beginning, but eventually becomes the flag. The shoot-out finale starts right off the assembly line, and Dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she is still sexy, and she brings a unique twist to her comically-relaxed dialogue, but this environment may have been too much of one thing for her — she Exhausted). Stella Stevens plays the villainous this time; she is good, but cannot compare with Shelley Winters in the predecessor. ** from ****
