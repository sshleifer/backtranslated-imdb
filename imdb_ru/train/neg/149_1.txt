Well, you know the rest! It should be the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Biham had several accounts to take on this role. <br /> <br /> The main role is played (for me) by a completely unknown one, and I would assume that immediately after this this turkey disappeared into obscurity. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee supervised the martial arts in the early 70s, and since then the fighting scenes must either be based on the martial arts, or at least brutal if street fighting techniques are used. This film uses quick cuts to show martial arts, however, even this cannot hide the fact that a woman does not know how to strike. An average 8-year-old boy would have taken it apart at this show. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only mystery on the show here is how it didnâ€™t win the golden raspberry in a year.
