There is no clever review here, because it does not deserve it. Not a feature film. Not even one of these “hidden” gems. You know, like those films that you heard about from a friend who saw this amazing film in the center of the city, where all good independent films and feature films are shown. <br /> <br /> Just pack it in Christmas boxes and dispose of it quickly.
