I am sad that the period of history, which is so fascinating and so rich in the material for the film, can be turned into a noisy event. Wm C Quantrill was hardly shown in the film, probably the most intriguing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, the same as Bloody Bill Anderson, who wept for his murdered sister every time he fought, was completely absent from the script. Instead, we were forced to watch fictional characters who never turned into those we cared about. how sad However, the costumes were great, as were the shootings in Missouri. I hope that Ang Lee will make another film of that period and try again, or some other director will study a huge amount of material for writing the script.
