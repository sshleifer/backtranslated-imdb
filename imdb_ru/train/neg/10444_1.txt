the only thing that is great about the film is its name. In this case, "Snake on the plane" is an example of how the book does not judge by the cover, the title says nothing about the film. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a film that just had fun with popcorn, but instead I got this horrible Roy Liotta movie called Turbulence. The only thing that makes SOAP better is its name. And this is not even an auxiliary name for the film, not even a glimpse of "snake" or "airplane" 40 minutes in the film! What a false advertisement! If not for his title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B-class summer movie. And R rating? It should be the most undeserved movie with a rating of R for all the time! The filmmakers add just a few words to make it the letter R, all the violence is maintained at the level of pg-13. Do you know what is actually R rating? R rating superstar Edge! Look at him in Summerslame, not spend money on a snake!
