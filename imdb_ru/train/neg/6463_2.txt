Last night I watched Free Money, and it was the longest 90-plus minutes in my life. With such an intriguing cast, I really thought that a treat awaits me - especially since I'm a Brando fan. WRONG! What a waste of talent. At times it’s almost embarrassing to watch (for example, a cattle breeding scene), and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous attitudes (why didn't they show how Charlie Sheen's character comes back to haul Brando?) Ugh. It tries to be a farce comedy, but I just didn’t buy it. Skip this. Only for loyal fans of Brando. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10, because I still think that the worst movie ever made was Skidoo.
