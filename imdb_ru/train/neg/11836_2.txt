In the end, too stupid and pointless. Yes, there is a metaphor in a gilded cage, but probably most children will miss it. Forgetting Instantly. <br /> <br /> Animation, as you would expect, super-real. The plot is best described as thin but tenacious. Although the ending seemed arbitrary to me. <br /> <br /> The sewer underground world is a correspondingly disgusting reflection of the world above, and, in one way or another, wealth and money there also mean a lot. Oh yes, and there is a romantic interest in making a woman smarter, smarter and more interesting than a couple - this in itself quickly becomes a tiresome (anti) stereotype. Perhaps your children will like it.
