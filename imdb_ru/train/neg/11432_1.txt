I watched this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanau basically had to carry this awkward incredible scenario for five hours (or no matter how long). From the start, every element of this film is incredible. This film made me laugh a few times, but they were mostly out of shock at the fact that the director / screenwriter really expected us to believe in the many random elements that tried to put this film together. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film Gray (Graham) and its problems with intimacy. Everything becomes interesting when she realizes that she and her brother are TOO TOO much in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story into something plausible and acceptable, the director continues to drag Gray into these ridiculous turns that never make any sense at all. Being an LGBT individual, this film seems to reflect what all heterosexuals believe we are experiencing in the exit process. (I would be offended if the author is crazy.) If it were not for the sweet chemistry between Kavano and Graham (which, by the way, was understandable), I would give 3 negative stars.
