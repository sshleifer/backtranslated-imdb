This film was a real disappointment for me. I was a fan of Graham Parsons for a long time, and when I found out that they were making a film about him, I was very excited, I received a film on VHS when it came out, and was disgusted by the fact that I saw the film was not about his life , and about the consequences of his death. I thought it would be a film about Gramsâ€™s life and music, but they had to make a film about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and films, I wanted a film about his life, not about his notorious death. I was very disappointed. I would like people to look at his life, not at his death. The only thing that is good about this movie is the soundtrack. This film disappoints any Graham Parsons fan.
