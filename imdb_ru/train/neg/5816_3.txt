From the recognition of critics, I expected more from this film and from Tamara Jenkins. The story just wandered and had no meaning or plot. And it's hard for me to believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or not) would be so damned because she lost her virginity "with it." I may be too young to communicate (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no problems with the Shakespeare stories "In Love" or "Life is Beautiful", and I was not alive for any of these installations. The cast is very good, but, unfortunately, the script did not allow them to attract an audience. In general, the slums had their moments, but if you do not want to remember the straps and socks, I would say, skip it.
