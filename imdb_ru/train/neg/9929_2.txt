Watching this was like kicking a big mackerel over and over again. Even when you thought: “This mackerel, of course, can no longer appear,” is a slap in the face. I'm not sure what they think. It was this pilot that I observed and wondered: “Did the actors know that they were on a doomed ship that was never destined to get into the series?” Not only black stereotypes, but also Swedish and Indian. And while Blazing Saddles turned these stereotypes into a mixture of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were simply offensive. There was no storyline, the ending was imposed, but no joke. However, if you study comedy, watch this pilot to see what you shouldn’t do.
