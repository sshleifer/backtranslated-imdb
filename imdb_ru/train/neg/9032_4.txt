I never understood the attraction of Garbo. She always finds herself in her films as stuck, not so seductive, and that annoying voice that could drown out the tuba section. She was also a very limited actress, like Gloria Swenson, much better left in a silent era. In this, her last film, her game is very average and even uncertain. She tries her best, but all this does not lead to anything, because the script is even worse than her game. <br /> <br /> And that would be a diamond that will never be believable and never get off the ground (although Melvin Douglas manages to get into the air at skiing scenes, which really are the only funny thing here). <br /> <br /> There was potential, but the script failed in almost every department, wasting every actor on it. Douglas and Garbo had enough good chemistry together, but this is not even a place on Ninochka, which I also found extremely overvalued.
