I first heard about White Noise when I saw a television advertisement. Before that, I did not even know that it exists. I watched the trailer online and decided that I would go and see it. Now, being a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought this film would give me everything I wanted. He has Michael Keaton in it, and he rocks. Unfortunately, the film did not deliver. He tried to be another Sixth Sense or Stirring, and failed miserably. He has a very promising beginning, but the middle simply reaches out to repeat and ends in a completely bad turn that any monkey could understand. Unfortunately, like most “Scary” films, nowadays it makes the viewers bounce off loud noises and bumps. This movie could have been a lot more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.
