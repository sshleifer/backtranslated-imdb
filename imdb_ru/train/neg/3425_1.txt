I'm going to spend as much time on this review as the script writers did. This is easily the worst continuation that has ever been done. <br /> <br /> They killed Naveen Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's performance awful, like everyone else !! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script seemed to be written by Mongoloid monkeys using the pseudonyms Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbiski. How the producers managed to squeeze such vile cinematic excrement, I do not understand. They even managed to make veteran Ray Walston look like a talentless jester. Director Michael Schulz should be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I want to spend 96 minutes of my life watching this spoiled memory of a brilliant comedy to try to condemn everyone who was involved in this cinematic crime.
