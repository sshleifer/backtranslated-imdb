One previous reviewer called this film "pure visual joy." I wonder if he saw the same movie as me. "High art" should have had the most tirelessly depressive interiors since the time of the "Seven". You can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the clichés of going to B & B for the first time. Of course, before they do this, you need to watch the opium parties where people live who are clearly not working for hire, but can somehow support a thriving drug addiction. Not to mention the icy looks of those familiar types of films, “Girlfriend / boyfriend at the start,” who are well aware that they are going to be dropped somewhere in the next 100 minutes or so. The film also states that the character Shidi has been leaving professional photography for ten years. What did she do, quit at twenty?
