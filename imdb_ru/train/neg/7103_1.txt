This is the best way to describe this film, which tells about the newlyweds who move to the house in which the husbandâ€™s first wife lives, who died under mysterious circumstances. It sounds good, but an hour of pure boredom is played out. In fact, one of the funny things about this film is that at the beginning of the film there is a warning that promises everyone who dies of fright a free coffin. Believe me, no one ever took them for this offer if someone there is not afraid of plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardeners and knocking doors. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant music of the tuba, which sounds as if it was played by some sixth-grader. And you will uncover a terrible secret that is so obvious that you really need to wonder what people in this film think. Someone dies while running and being hit on the head, and the police are never called in to investigate. Yes, in the end, it's a slow pace (which is really bad, considering that the film lasts just over an hour), a boring little story that is easy for the average person to understand. Apparently, none of the characters in this film was an ordinary person.
