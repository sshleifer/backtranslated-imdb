I want to begin by stating that I am a Republican, although I do not agree with many things that Bush did in the office. And I love the daily show and report of Colbert. This should be my two favorite shows on TV. I like the jokes about Bush with Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that U is not the smartest guy who ever walked the earth (I also believe that he is not the silliest). But there comes a moment when it is enough and that is not enough. I see where it can be funny, and that (hey, he makes fun of our authoritative figure, he's funny). Central comedy, although just trying hard to make fun of him. I mean, maybe one special episode, but the whole series is just stupid. It seems that CC just says the same jokes about the bushes that we have heard many times. I really do not see this show taking place after season 1.
