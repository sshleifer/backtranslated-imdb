Max had a V-8, Trace (the last and only hero of Wheels of Fires) has a jet engine on the back of his car, allowing him to make inadvertently funny faces when he launches rockets around a half-empty wasteland. Be amazed when Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) splits and connects like a new film, albeit shot in a dismal manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work. <br /> <br /> Why is WoF placed in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Just, Warrior's Road was! In fact, any questions can be answered: it was so in Road Warrior! With the exception of non-working mutant actors from the original film “The Time Machine” of the 60s, which is being shot at a cameo in order to give viewers some kind of non-automotive action to chew on for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In a typical case of the 80s Fashion, all the cars driven by the bad guys, who collide or push slightly, explode with a huge explosive explosion. Inevitably, all car chases will occur near the comfortable slopes of the rocks, and cars will inevitably fall from them. Along with this, in the 80s cinematic wild attraction is a widespread misogyny in this style of cheap film. In general, I was waiting for Treys’s rocket engine to accelerate and shoot into the fire, so there will be another shot when he gnaws on the face, as if he should be tough, and this is more apparent when he looks constipated. Bad choreographic action in combination with poor acting skills makes this film a real loader. The unintentional meaning of humor even manages to wear thin. <br /> <br /> Rats: Bruno Mattei - Nights of Terror. And this in itself speaks volumes! To this score, 2020 Texas Gladiators are a cinematic masterpiece compared to the Wheels of Fire. The poor warrior on the road who lacks the cheese factor to make the film watchable. <br /> <br />
