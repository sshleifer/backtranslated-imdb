I really can't think of anything good to say about this movie ... not a single thing. The script is a nightmare. The author blurs the line between chemical and biological features and doesn’t seem to understand the difference. You might think that they would at least get a technical consultant. The performances were bad for most actors ... although I don’t blame them ... the stuff really stinks. Editing was equally bad .. I'll just stop now .. everything is bad 2/10
