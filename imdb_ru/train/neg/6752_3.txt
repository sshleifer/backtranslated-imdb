Unfortunately, more ups than ups. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing unusual, but he had a story, unlike other modern horror films. Another good thing was the cast. I'm not saying that acting was good because it was not, but every actor / actress was hot and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the drawbacks is that the film becomes exciting only after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another flaw (or you can think of it as a lift, if you like) is excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their asses for a long time. Not that I'm against nudity, but it was a horror film, not “Dreamers”. <br /> <br /> Unless you really want to see very desperately how a guy takes off his swimsuit and runs naked for a few minutes, or see how a girl gets naked for no reason, or you're a devoted Debbie Rochon fan than this movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
