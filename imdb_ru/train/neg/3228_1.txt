I have seen other guinea pig films, such as The Mermaid in the Hatch and He Never Dies, and although they are quite sick, they at least have a sense of humor (albeit a dark one). The Devil's experiment, however, is nothing more than the filming of a group of punks representing a young girl with a multitude of methods of torture and violence, and there is no conspiracy in it and no expiatory values. It's not scary, except perhaps thinking, but it is definitely disgusting, and I would not call it entertainment. I am not a model of good taste in films, and I like my trash and filth, but it was too much for me, really. I'm all for concern, in fact, I'm looking for things that get in the way when it is possible, but it was a bit. A young woman is kicked, beaten, subjected to constant noise through headphones until she drools, and then she is slaughtered with raw meat and guts and left somewhere in a hammock in the forest somewhere. If you think this sounds great, do it, but it will definitely scare me from watching guinea pig materials. 1 out of 10 is absolutely nauseous.
