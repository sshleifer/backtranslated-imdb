My husband and I were intrigued by this spectacle - a strong-willed southern lady with a dirty personal life uncovers crimes for LAPD. The first season was obligatory for us. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season have become so tedious and unworthy of a strong character that we stopped watching. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were worried about the episode when she was trying to hide from her Mom that she was laced. But breaking the conditions was an episode when she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend, but tells her boss. Why would a strong middle-aged woman do such a thing? The answer is no. In addition, my husband and I choose the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. This is almost always a white man or woman, presented in a cameo at the scene of the murder or in an idealized family. Could writers from time to time do something original? As I said, we are no longer spectators. We prefer shows that do not betray the characters and do not offend our intellect.
