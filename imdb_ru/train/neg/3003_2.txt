We all know that countless losers adorned the slasher genre of the 80s and often do not deserve anything but our deepest disgust. Maybe it's a bit hasty, but damn it, if Slaughter High were not terribly unoriginal, even for a short haircut. Basically, a child takes part in the story who, in high school, experienced similar carry of emotional humiliation and returns to a dilapidated building to take revenge on a group of former hooligans who all come to remember. As was to be expected, on April 1 a crazy man in a mask kills them, killing them with electricity, burning, hanging and chemically changing the beer. I have a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this film, but, given the ending, I feel the need to drop my complaints and just say that this is a waste of time. Do not pay attention to the thought of watching this movie ...
