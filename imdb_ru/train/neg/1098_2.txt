I got this movie in a $ 5 basket at Walmart. I would not recommend watching this move. I could give it to one of my friends if I am angry with them and want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and flipped through the summary and thought it was a war film. I would like to know how boring this film will be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think that something was going to happen in this movie. It's just a group of people going from one training camp to another. Sargents treat soldiers very badly, and the main character tries to help people get out of battle in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Well, here's my talk about this movie: For me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those films that you put on and stuck watching, because you want to turn it off, but you cling to a string of hope that it might come to an end. This is not true. After the film was finished, I went through it for my T.V. because I was angry that I spent almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes to write this review to warn people about it.
