At first the film seemed to work fine, they had character profiles tuned in ... the plot seemed to go in the right direction ... however, as the film progressed, the director seemed to focus on the wrong things. ... or just a lot of things were edited from the movie. The characters of the characters have changed for the worse in the film. In addition, there seemed to be a lot of hidden meaning - in other words - there were things in the film that did not seem to fit the film itself. And the title ... no, where in the movie the title fits the movie ... I guess the title is suitable for previewing .... The actors succeeded in what they had ..... if they had the best director and writer maybe it would work better. But it is not. So now this Friday comes a terrible new movie ... My opinion! .... don't waste your time and money.
