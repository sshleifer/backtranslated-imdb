Why do people who do not know what a particular time is in the past feel the need to determine this time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and Apollo Moon Landing with the sinking of the Titanic, and you will get as realistic a click as this formal soap opera, completely filled with low-level trash. Is this what children are doing who were too young to be allowed to study at Woodstock and who failed to make up the primary school? “I’ll show these old little things, I’ll post my own movie and prove that you don’t need to know about your subject to still make money!” Yes, we already know that. The one thing that watched this movie did little for me to give me a little insight into the thinking of the lower class. The next time I see a whore like Diane Lane in a bar, I run the other way. This is child abuse to allow parents who are useless to raise children. Abuse of the audience - just stick Woodstock and the moon channel, as if it is ipso facto means that the film represents the year 1969.
