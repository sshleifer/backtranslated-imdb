Spoilers <br /> <br /> Firstly, in this film nothing really happened except for the inexplicably bleeding woman. Secondly, it was not scary. Thirdly, it was the worst soundtrack of all films. Let me clarify. Sound edited by Beavis or Butthead ?? I'm not sure what, so let's just go with Beavis. The film gradually becomes quieter and people mumble and mumble, forcing you to turn up the volume (I watched it at home). Then Beavis makes really loud sounds with supposedly frightening / shocking images, forcing you to quickly turn down the volume again. This happens many times until, fortunately, the film ends. I can imagine how Beavis laughs vulgarly from behind a double-sided mirror, watching the test group each time desperately reach for the console. If you have children and you prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep, then this is a big mistake. But then this is still a big mistake. Here's a thought ?? if you're going to shoot a horror movie, at least add a decapitated, decapitated, 19-year-old blonde who screams at the top of her lungs before she can take off her sweater, a shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive outside the camera's view, a cat thrown at a camera to scare the audience, some kind of stupid pervert with a maniacal laughter or a monster that looks like a stage hand covered with aluminum foil (“Lost in Space”). ). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
