There were very few films that I could not see. I did it through Battle Field Earth without any problems. But this, This is one of the worst films that have ever been made. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to play this. I do not blame her. I would be ashamed to have this in a resume. I believe that this is a rare case when almost every gag in a film falls on a face. Well, it happens here. Not to mention SFX, look for a dinosaur with rear control cables hanging on it !!!!!! Halfway through the movie, I was still looking for a plot. I never found one. Rid yourself of renting and save 90 minutes of your life.
