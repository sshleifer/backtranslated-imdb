I love the stories of Jane Austen. I read only two of them (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this adaptation, I reached for “Persuasion” from my bookcase to understand the meaning of the story, and also because I refused to believe Jane Austen could write such nonsense. For me, I thought that if you base the film on the Jane Austen novel, you will not go wrong. By default it will be great. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, where are the characters that you sympathize with and that you like? You must have at least one cute character to get the audience to put their emotions into them, but this did not help. Of course, I wanted Ann and Wentworth to come together, but only because you know what the purpose of this story is for them to come together. Instead, I had to resist the urge to throw my cup of tea on the TV and keep watching it until the end. <br /> <br /> Ann was extremely annoying in everything, and in the end, I really have no idea why Wentworth was so impressed with her that it seemed he had nothing to attract. She was gentle, lethargic, dull, socially inadequate and, like a sheep, looked like she was following the instructions of others, and not her own mind. It can still work for the main character, if you do it well. This was not done well. <br /> <br /> Other characters simply demonstrated varying degrees of narcissism, of which Mary was the worst, with a full-blown narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennett had similar flaws at P & P, she was still charming, and Mary was more like a freak. More disgusting than funny. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was very handsome and looked like a decent guy. For most of the story, I was just wondering what kind of person he was, and why he was in love with Ann, because he is one of those guys who would like a person to be a little more ... alive? Acting wisely, not too much to say, as I reacted more to the characters depicted, and not to how good / bad people were playing the role. Anthony Head was superb, but as soon as I saw that he was in it, I expected no less. <br /> <br /> This story seemed very confusing to me. It was only at the end of the film that it seemed that Elizabeth was not Anna's stepmother, but actually a sister (I am still not 100% in this). Ann / Wentworth's entire story was also a bit blurry. They were together, but then broke up, and they are both bitter about this? How so? I thought about this for quite a long time, and the explanation seemed to be that she left him because someone had convinced her? But in some way it was said that it was almost missing out, as if it was somehow unimportant. How can it not matter when this is the core of the story? There were also many names, but there was no feeling of who the characters were. Is this Louise, for example, who is she? Friend? Family? What kind? It was not clear who the characters and their relationship with each other. Lady Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister, which was very unrealistic because Mrs Croft looked old enough to be his mother. <br /> <br /> Last kiss, yes, it was a bit strange that they were kissing on the street, but I really didn’t think about it, because I was too busy shouting "GET THIS ALREADY !!" on TV, because Anna’s lips trembled, trembled and quivered for what felt for centuries before they really met Wentworth. There are some fluctuations there, but only for a couple of seconds or so, and not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Then there is the problem of the camera. As an ordinary movie viewer, you do not pay attention to camera angles and the like, unless you decide to watch it. I didn't decide to do it here, but I still noticed them. For me, this means that the filmmakers are not doing a good job. Many conversations were with extreme close-ups of the face, which should be used only when you need to make a really important point. In this adaptation, it was used too often and therefore had no meaning. The manual feeling sometimes did not work in historical drama. The shooting work in the running scene in the end also seemed too modern. (Not to mention the running itself.) This was Austin's only adaptation I caught in the Austin ITV season. Makes me think about whether to watch Northang Abbey and Mansfield Park or I just need to read the books and leave it at that. I am sad to say that I did not like this adaptation of Jane Austen. Maybe I will watch the 1995 version instead. After all, the BBC is famous for its wonderful adaptations of Austin.
