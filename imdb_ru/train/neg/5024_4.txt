There is not much to say about it. Gammer is a kind of fire-breathing turtle. He is lost by a nuclear explosion. He heads to the ground and begins to destroy buildings, tanks, and other nonsense (oh yeah, power lines. I almost forgot). One day, at the beginning of the film, he became friends with a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away or crushing him, he lowered him to the ground. Safe. Since then, we have to watch this little chubby Tvir appear and run away, appear and run away, appear and run away. For some reason, Hammer can hear this child at a distance of 20,000 feet. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Hammer to get to the place where he can be put on board the rocket and shot into space. As usual, the monster is awkward and clumsy (the guy in the costume of Gammer). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans) uses enough ammunition and firepower to solve the public debt, and, of course, it does not bring any benefit. They should know this anyway. We saw a lot of stomping monsters in Tokyo. Do not omit them, because they can be fun, but in fact it is not very good.
