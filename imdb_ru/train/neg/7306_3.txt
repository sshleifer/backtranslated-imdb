Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I never spent time writing one of them, but I felt obliged after I witnessed this insult in the movie, and I feel a little offended because I spend my time on such a piece of poop, to be honest . There were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete coincidence and lack of meaning (for example, when would the police ever shoot people with infectious diseases? When did such people ever get expelled in hospitals because of a lack of treatment? Why who noticed he was spying on his wife, wandering the streets in a bathrobe, with a pistol while she rolled on the bed?). In addition, the characteristic - as we almost expected to see in such films - was terrible (for example, how blond - I do not remember his damn name and do not quit in any case - turned completely against his girlfriend and ran to leave her) and I ended up wanting them all to meet terrible goals! The production was terribly fragmented, and the cinema has nothing to talk about.
