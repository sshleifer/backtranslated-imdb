Hey, if you have a little more than an hour to kill and find the paint too exciting, I would advise it. If you like cheap bi-movies like me, that's good for a laugh! In addition, I would not advise you to rent it, I would wait until it appears in the pipe, say, about 4 o'clock in the morning on the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. By the way, the band that played this soundtrack was on the road about two years after this shot, and no, they sounded just as bad as they were live, according to two reviews of small towns I could find on them. So once again, it's good if you find grass very fun, but it's nice to watch, if you like to watch how NOT to make a low-budget film.
