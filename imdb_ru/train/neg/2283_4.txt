And Oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes - Dwight Fry. Seriously, his name should be pronounced with the same reverence as Karloff, Lugosi, and Price, and this film proves it. His character Herman was one of two reasons why I can watch this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed inconsistency an attractive but eerie behavior that made you hope for a bigger role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the comic relief of M. Abern. I, being a doctor, must pay tribute to the expert performance of a hypochondrician prone to pity. Although other "medical mistakes" caused a short laugh, especially when a good doctor tried medicines for his fellow doctors ... "Well, keep giving her to her." Unfortunately, these 2 outstanding speeches could not keep me from waking after 3 attempts to come to terms with this unbearably slow movie. The plot is predictable, with small twists and turns. The filming in which the legitimate eerie atmosphere was filmed was more productive to make me yawn - yes, you can use too much shadow. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - look once to see Fry and Abern - but only when they woke up. and with a lot of caffeine.
