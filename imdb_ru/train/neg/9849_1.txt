This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This is bad, even at the level of TV Movie standards. The plot is devilishly erroneous, and the famous names in this film are in vain embarrassed by vague characters. I don’t know how the director managed to justify this excuse of the film - it’s so bad. Announced as the "Psychological horror thriller" - it is certainly awful. This is nothing exciting. And it can cause you psychological damage! The first initial scenes contained such a promise - the possible beginning of whether the soul is only an aspect of the brain, but complete confusion that followed the scene of the car crash is hard to believe. No matter how hard you try, you don't have to take care of the characters. There are so many ideas that a movie is at best a collage of scattered phrases by Chinese philosophers, and at worst a movie will really make you die! "<br /> <br /> I bought more than 300 films on DVD. And this is the FIRST for which I am going to get my money back. KEEP AWAY.
