Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov are a very unlikely couple in a film that is not very pleasant. <br /> <br /> The film promises that Ustinov will be released from prison for embezzlement. He convinces Robert Morley to leave so that he can take on his identity and start hacking computers at a very fashionable firm run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duet for films. <br /> <br /> Morley sounds just like he did in 1938 "Marie Antoinette". Perhaps he needed to return to this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous at best. It is hard to believe that next year Maggie Smith completely changed her views and gave an amazing Oscar performance at the Premiere of Miss Jean Brodie. <br /> <br /> Ms. Smith here looks like a clearly dull red head, but by the end of the film she is the brain of clothes. It is a pity that the letter did not go with her.
