From time to time, you hear radio DJs inviting listeners to nominate films that the listener cannot endure or have never watched all the time. This is a movie I think about ... a few days later. <br /> <br /> This is somehow related to Shakespeare’s play. Not sure, but I think that I threw this film in about 20 minutes or so ... I think I realized that my toenails were not cut off, and they looked at me imploringly to cut themselves. <br /> <br /> This film seemed boring and pretentious to me. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is the first film to which I gave such a low score (which I really tried to watch), I would not want to take you from the other films of his English director Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that his "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" was a truly great British film, although its content sometimes hung in the stomach - a brilliant movie, but I can understand why people refused to watch it. <br /> <br /> Another greenway film is Zed and Two Noughts. Again, it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but, nevertheless, it was intriguing. <br /> <br /> Another film that I usually think about too late for such a broadcast program is “Brazil.” Never managed to watch it all the time while he fell asleep! <br /> <br /> If you don’t have a taste for complacent films that are disappointingly highly stylized, time consuming and difficult to track, then manage to clear Prorosero books.
