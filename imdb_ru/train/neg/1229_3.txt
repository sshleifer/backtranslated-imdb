Sorry, but besides the fact that Kim Basinger did a good job with his scared work, it was one of the worst thrillers I've ever seen. Logic is thrown out, because 4 young guys terrorize this woman near a crowded shopping center, and then shoot at the guard. And yet no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or rushing back to the mall, she leaves and finds herself in the middle of the forest with the guys in hot pursuit. I can't even describe how foolish it is to see this woman run away from 4 backward thugs, carry a red toolbox, scream for God to come to her aid, and then have sex with one of them after brutally killing others. Please believe me, this is bad and a bit tasteless.
