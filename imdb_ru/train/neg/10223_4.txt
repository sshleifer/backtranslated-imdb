I remembered the name so well. For me, it was a Flora Robson film with Olivier and Vivien Leigh as a supporting role. And he had the voice of Vincent Massey because of his mustache. Well, Flora Robson was gorgeous. Her next signature for me will be "55 days in Beijing." The same role, but with different luxurious dresses. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Was everything done in Elizbeth at night? It was talkative and difficult to understand at times. I could not say that was love interest. Was it Spaniard or Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth I would be a brilliant strategist who would recommend to send fire ships against Armada. Apparently, it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. Historically, this might have been more accurate, but Bette Davis had more attractive scenarios. And I missed the daylight!
