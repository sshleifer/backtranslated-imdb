I saw this movie was launched in the first hours at TCM. Several problems with the film were evident from what I saw. First, adults do not age when children are 10 years old. In several parts of the film there were problems with continuity, and for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked the oldest when 10 years passed. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing for about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge blank with a black screen appeared. This is very bad because, although the script left much to be desired, Bergman and Russell did an excellent job with the role in the film. It's a shame that a large piece is missing, but what can be observed here. <br /> <br /> I just wish everything was intact. Does the script not make much sense in that the character of Bergman is sent when the children are small, but then comes back to take care of them when they become adults? Some timelines also do not make sense. There is a collapse of the stock market, which resembles 1929, but children grow up to fight in the First World War. All support actions in this movie are in order. Just wonder what was in the 20 gaps of the film, I could not see how he was absent.
