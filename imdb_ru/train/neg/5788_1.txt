So Mr. Agrama’s company (which is involved in some dubious business with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) produced a terrible jumble of Mr. Karl Matzek. <br /> <br /> What is this terrible mess I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three completely unrelated Japanese science fiction animated series (namely, Macross, Southern Cross and Mospad), added tons of dialogue - firmly believing that the American public was too stupid to understand the narrative and the artistic power of silence — it was all edited largely due to violent content, added the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, called it, using some of the worst voices from the hell of acting (Reba West’s singing was — and before their long - unbearable and full of indignation, especially when compared to Mrs Mari Iijima) ... The result was a series of 85 episodes with hundreds of problems with continuity and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Of course, the furs were cool to watch (especially in “Makrossag”)) and the parts of the plot that remained unharmed were good. But what was good at Robotech was not the result of Macek’s work or the “voice talents” he gained. This was due to the efforts and efforts (uncreditable - why? I would be too brave to accuse GG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators.
