This is one of those “so bad, it's good” films that you have always heard about, but have never seen! Unlike Troma films, which are deliberately bad and polite (and I'm not surprised), this film is 100% pure. <br /> <br /> However, with features such as the supposedly super-deadly killer robot, similar to one of the Dancers of pure gold on an acid trip and the magical first mate who causes lightning and turns the Good Witch of the East into he takes himself seriously, pushes her so far over the edge of evil, which makes him turn around entertaining. <br /> <br /> Because of this, it is watchable enough.
