Protocol is an incredible film, the only saving grace of which lies in the fact that it is shot in “Goldie Hawn” along with a good supporting actor. The story goes down in the middle of the film, and Goldie’s charm simply does not save this film. If you're not a Goldie Hawn fan, feel free to watch this movie.
