It's funny that many of those who say that this is far superior to the version of Romero, as a rule, are very young (judging by other posts). What we have here is smooth, action, horror and 2-hour MTV video. Crazy editing, working with a pop video camera, "cool" music, blah blah blah, <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not bad compared to other recent remakes (chainsaw massacre was a complete disaster) .. It's pretty good to play everybody's round, completely predictable in the “who will die next” bets and the overall win in the title of Dawn Of The Dead, which will bring a lot of income only to fans of the original, who will go and see it out of curiosity ... <br Isn't the remake of the classics getting on your nerves? Can they really not come up with something original? Why remake Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original feature (the children of the middle segment feel boring should be slow to show how, when you get everything you want, you are still not happy) are completely absent. This action movie, simple and intuitive. The faster the better. If you like action films (and, like this, the 2004 version is well done), then this is fair enough, but for those who love a little substance in their films ... be prepared to breathe (again) ... <br /> <br /> Watch movie theaters over the next few years, when we’ll get the converted Godfather series, whoever is the most fashionable pop director at the moment, and remade Star Wars, where all the kids said the new version is much better than the old version is slow and boring, with a camera shot for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but cher of 10 years, they will still discuss the Romero version, not the popes
