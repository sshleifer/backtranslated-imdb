I got it in DVD 10 CURSE OF THE DEAD. You must love these deal packages. Even if there are no real remasters, restorations and all that, and films in general in the format of full-frame panning and scanning, there is no denying that there are always a few gems in them. And by “precious stones” I mean that you can always see some good nonsense, especially if films from the 70s, like “Mansion of Madness”. <br /> <br /> My copy is called Madness Mansion, but when the title screens appear, this is Dr. Tarr's Tombstone Underground. It doesn't matter, really, because shit is shit, this shit, no? Yes! But to say that this film is completely useless is not at all true. There are some cool elements here and there, and, obviously, the film had a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The opening title sequence is excellent, with a color negative on a cheap TV screen. The dialogue is always cheerful. Near the beginning of the film, the horse and the driver are buggy to move the stump of a dead tree in the middle of the road. "WHAT POWER!" says our hero. It's funny that later this dude will not be able to fight off stupid foresters when they come to have fun. You will completely forget that this guy was even in the film, until it pops up again towards the end. This is how these characters are remembered. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the Mansion of Madness is to be stupid music and hype that the good guys have to stand. It's like bad cartoon music that a three-year-old child would find pleasant. And in general, why all this is a monstrous farce? I would say that my favorite moment should have happened when a horse and a carriage were ambushed by forest freaks, when they pull a stupid self-made ghost with a stick in the middle of the road and make it stop. What the hell? Oh yes, there are a lot of boobies that can be seen for those of you who dig for such things. Boobs, bad dialogue and stupid music. These are the best amounts of Mansion of Madness for me. It costs at least one viewing, and it may be much better if you have a few drinks or something else. I can’t say that I’ve ever been bored watching it, but I can’t deny that this is also a barrel of poo. It seems like Magical Mystery Tour, but with a plot, but no. Hm <br /> <br /> And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.
