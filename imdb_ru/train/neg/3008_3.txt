A group of people are invited there for a high school reunion, but after they arrive, they discover that this was a fraud on the part of an old classmate over whom they played a nearly fatal joke. Now he is trying to take revenge on all those who hurt him, sealing all exits and turning off all telephone lines. <br /> <br /> Dark film with an unusual background. Raising it one step higher, you will see some good performances, some pretty creative scenes of death, a lot of excitement and fright, a little humor and an original ending. <br /> <br /> No ratings for extreme violence, graphic nudity, sexual situations, profanity and drug use.
