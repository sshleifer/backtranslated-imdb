The flames are inside, the flames are extinguished. It looks like this Hammer in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature that can take it and decompose with equal energy. I am not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but ultimately decided to watch all the films from the science fiction DVD collection of fifty films released by Mill Creek / Treeline Films. That's a great price — about twenty-five bucks, so with a price of fifty cents per film, it really comes down to a waste of time watching some stupid offers. <br /> <br /> Gammera suffers from a centuries-long nap by a nuclear explosion, and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, he sends him to Tokyo, setting the United Nations in motion to try to work out a plan to save the planet. They come to Plan Z, the hope of the world, and don't you know, there is a scene showing a huge barn called the Plan Z building; it was a nice touch. <br /> <br /> By the mid-1960s, this country was still not entirely politically correct. One of the American military scenes in the Alaskan air defense sector forces General Arnold to ask a female sergeant to make coffee. I guess there were no privates around. <br /> <br /> The good old Hammer was quite a decent sight: he walked on two legs and went on a throw of flame when he was challenged. That is why I was surprised how Plan Z managed to catch a human turtle in the nose cone of a hidden spacecraft, throwing him to Mars to save the world. High fives around for the American and Russian team that saved, now let's go back to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, Gammer created at least a dozen films, but seeing this rather satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles. Especially since in this DVD package, which I mentioned earlier, there is a “Monster Attack” with the guest shown in “Big G.”. It took me everything to get to the end of both films; it was such a relief to get to the last frame in this one, which said: “Gammer, Sayonara!”
