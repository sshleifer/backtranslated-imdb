The only thing the “First Force” really has is that it gives Jeff Cober the opportunity to play one of his beautiful, diverse psychotic villains, with whom he has coped so well over the past 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger, who specialized in these parts back in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> But this is not enough, “First Force” is a cruel slasher, because of which Lou Diamond Phillips lost the role of a Los Angeles police detective. who specializes in catching serial killers. Kober is his last catch, but Kober is in the league with less force, and they are going to come together and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober was given a gas chamber, his spirit returns in all kinds of guises. <br /> <br /> Michelty Williamson is on hand as a partner for Lou, who meets an unpleasant ending with the demon-possessed horse and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen, as a nun with understanding, is ready to help Lou. Will he be able to defeat forces from outside? <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie you don’t care. Lou really fell into the trap in Turkey. Maybe the devil made him make this movie.
