The premise of this film was decent enough, but with acting at a low level, it was just boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Spoilers The film does not work due to the nature of death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder, it did not look like a guy who intended to do it. Also in some of the memories revealed a secret that makes the events somewhat fair. There are no emotions in this movie. For the first 20 minutes or so, this woman calls her sister and hears her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With some polishing and a better game, this could be very good.
