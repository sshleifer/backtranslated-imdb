It should be the cheapest movie made in the 21st century. This is poor quality, but in the end it falls below ... everything. All cheap tricks, such as flash and darkness, are used to hide these crappy computer effects. <br /> <br /> All the actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmon McInnon). There is a scene where Ann asks: “Why do you look so careless?” The correct answer is because she cannot act. Whatever happens (the world is going to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is being fired), the same stupid smile is on her face. <br /> <br /> This is not only a film, B-quality. This is also the back cover description (at least in Finland). The text mentions such things as Lorica Gray-Wessel, Capital-Wessel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anna) Fletcher. The description sounds like another movie in which there is a character called Fletcher and sea monsters.
