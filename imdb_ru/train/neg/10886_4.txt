I just watched the convention a second time. I enjoyed it earlier and thought it would make a good drunk movie on Friday night, some blood, some style, some humor, and the like. I was saddened to find that I could no longer appreciate it. It seemed that someone had intended to revise cheeseball epics, such as “Night of the Demons”, for a modern audience, but lost the things that made the original worthwhile. For the record, I'm not even a big fan of Night of the Demons, but I really dug up something about that. The monastery makes cheese, but not much good. In addition to the main girl (pleasant performance from Joanna Canton), the gothic girl and cute cameo from Adrienne Barbo, almost all the characters were painfully incredible, repugnant at the lowest levels of moronic, offensive jokes. The film is then seriously hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity, which means that, given the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to watch the characters and it is more difficult to appreciate the good moments of the film. Evil nuns are original in design and get a lot of good scenes, although it's not scary, they are, of course, cool, and the film also demonstrates a fair amount of pure blood. Toward the end, when Adrienne Barbo appears on the scene, the film becomes quite interesting, because all the disgusting people are dead, and the evil nun is frantic with madness. Stylized direction also sometimes gives good results, although sometimes the camera moves too fast. In general, it was a film where for me brilliant good moments simply cannot compensate for what I hated. Those who love this film more can enjoy it much more, but for me it was not the right time.
