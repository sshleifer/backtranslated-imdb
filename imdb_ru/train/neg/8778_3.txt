“White noise” had the potential to become one of the most talked about films since the days of “The Exorcist,” I think. Seeing that EVP is supposedly true, he did have an easy pass, to be a true fact that is feared. There are not many films that really inspire fear in people. As I said, this film could, but did not. The film went down to a terrible low-class movie PG-13. Nothing beats the "Ring" or the "Sixth Sense." Someone really should just take responsibility in the horror film industry and just make a film that not only makes us think, but also makes us jump, scream, all that a horror movie has to do. I, frankly, tired of the horror genre PG-13, because it becomes its own genre. We need the old days, the days of blood and gore, the days of Freddie Krueger, Jason, Mike Myers. Few films can make you think that this mentality is NOT so terrible. So why try to implement it? A few good jumps in this film are just one of the most stupid endings in cinema history without any permission ... don't waste money on this film.
