When you talk about global warming, something very strange happens: science goes beyond, and “faith” and “consensus” become a topic of discussion. <br /> <br /> It is because of the fact that I rate the losers Al Gore Documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting sensible discussions, he kept the debate on the level of “faith” and “consensus”. <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to sell the world, spending trillions of dollars to “stop global warming,” you might think that speaking scientific truth is a problem: we don’t know how much of this warming . Maybe none of this, maybe some of this, or maybe it passed into the next Ice Age, and we were very lucky that we did not boil the planet. <br /> <br /> But the fact remains that we do not know. <br /> <br /> therefore we are asked to “believe” in “consensus”. Never mind that any scientist who deviates from "consent" is ostracized. Never mind that scientific research is about deviation from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in consensus, nor did Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> Why are so many researchers who promoted the field, asking difficult questions, so much neglected? If global warming is so incontrovertible, of course, several people testing this theory cannot be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This is the film I was hoping for that Al Gore would do. Isted, he decided to support his support with the true "believers" of the "consensus". <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
