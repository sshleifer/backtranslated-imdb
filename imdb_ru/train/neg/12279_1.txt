Although it seems to be a rather old show (2002), I watched my first episode last night and I must say that it must be the worst show. ever <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those who post comments, but I was so shocked that there could be a show that was clearly trying to condone, and I just assume that it was their target audience, children under 12 years old or people with an IQ below average. <br /> <br /> The episode I went through last night contained so many scattered plot lines, tried to include EVERY possible plot plot that one can imagine, and all the while trying to preach about friendship. , family, religion and politics !!!. <br /> <br /> The main story that they covered in this episode: the bullying in the House of Brotherhood did not go as it should because of too much alcohol. Death Turns out, the son of a Senator who wants the FBI to investigate the case, Death is actually a peanut allergy murder. The senator believes that it could be his sworn enemy and the best friend of his childhood, who did it because the senator took money for his votes for legislation, but in the end he received a conscience and said no, which means a multi-millionaire millionaire. Everyone has suspicions, but they all have a regular alibi (the former girl fucking a married teacher, so she had to lie, a disgruntled student who the victim reported that she really had life experience, the enemy of the senators did not pay the desperate student to kill the sworn enemies, the son gives a lot of money to the ravaged students). All this time, the heroine of this dribbling makes her niece stay “at that age” and fall in love with the boy, with whom she eventually has the courage to speak with her aunt, but only to leave him, because 'in' girls say that not good enough, and therefore, to keep up with them, she throws him. Do not worry, she will return with the boy after finding out the truth about life, and the girls “at” throw her out, the aunt also explains that God is the only one she really can rely on (I was almost sick at that moment). <br /> <br /> This “drama” gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is. you will laugh at it, i'm sure i did. <br /> <br /> This is one of the Frat boys, who only a year ago learned that he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist, and he tries to impress the real dad by killing the boy and planting a funeral bomb, ,,,,,, <br /> <br /> Characters - cardboard, acting - cardboard, continuity - cardboard, history - cardboard. Anyone who says they like this show has a cardboard for the brain. <br /> <br /> Why the authors of this show, who tried to combine EVERY accident into one show, mean that they clearly do not believe in character development or the ability of actors to withstand a simple storyline. Watching this show is like watching The Last Action Hero, with Arnie killing 5,000 people with a toothpick, except Arnie is the best actor (wow, I never thought it would be the day I would say it !! ) <br /> <br /> According to the Simpsons, the favorite character of the comic book. ,,, <br /> <br /> WORST TV SHOW. ,,,, EVER.
