After the overvalued success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films have spread like a disease in an increasingly sad world of horror films. The result is all in films like El segundo nombre, a television production that is poorly written, but is still acting and directed worse. I did not read Ramsey Campbell’s book, but I’m sure that the author of The Doll Who Has Eaten by Her Mother had nothing to do with this horrible production. Avoid this at all costs if you are not looking for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater. 2/10
