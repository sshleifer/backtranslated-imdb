This is the worst show I've seen in recent years. I believe that it should be removed from the TV. because of his backwardness. It's so stupid that I could lose consciousness when I watch it. (although I never watch him because he is sooooo poor) <br /> <br /> Fools: When Mack says he can't eat sugar, he eats sugar in another episode. Almost all over the world there is sugar !!! In the Eddie Monster episode, when Eddie screams at Terrance, he falls into the box twice, PLUS the second time he falls, he does not fall, he falls to the side. What nonsense. I can't even say the word "Fosters Home." I even wrote a song with my group about how backward this show is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
