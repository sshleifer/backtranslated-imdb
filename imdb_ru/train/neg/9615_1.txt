From this adaptation it is clear that he did not. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he composed his own! What he decided to leave was so incredibly incredible that I was happy that he decided to skip some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was hazy, inconsistent and changeable, to say the least. I don't want to say anything mean about the actors, but they can't act! Dickens, of course, difficult, but it's a pity! Micawber was only a cramer of the mid-nineteenth century, and the less said about Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, see the 1999 BBC's great adaptation. As for the screenwriter, I think he read Cliff's Notes!
