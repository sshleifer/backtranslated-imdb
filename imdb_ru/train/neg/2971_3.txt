Batman Mystery Batman, in a word, stale. <br /> <br /> The plot says that a mysterious female amateur ("Batman") invades Batman's lawn, and while Batman tries to fight the Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorn three, he tries to find out who the mysterious Batman is br /> <br /> There is nothing strikingly wrong about this, but there is nothing special about this, except that it really stood out. <br /> <br /> The Phantom Mask caused Bruce to have long-lost love and confusion in his head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was an important event in the life of Mr. Freese. <br /> <br /> Even the movie “Batman Beyond the Boundary” is unwound, “The Return of the Joker”, deeply digging characters in it. <br /> <br /> But Mystery of the Batwoman has several background plots: a lot of formulas are completed with mediocre staging on a cruise boat. Honestly, this thing is more like Scooby-Doo than the Dark Knight, it lacks the blow that the animated series had in its heyday.
