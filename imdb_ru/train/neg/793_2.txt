I wasn't sure how to rate this film, since it was so bad that it was actually very funny. I am by no means a fan of Gakt, although he is talented, despite the strange pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing with a hairball. I always thought that Hyde was talented, although Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But by topic, guys. This movie is funny. It is so incredible and pointless that it almost looks like a parody of supernatural action films. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost no plot here, except that itâ€™s about vampires with gangster friends. In a sense, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, because there were too many ideas, which led to a lack of time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The scenes were ridiculous, Quickly edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography, which is so ridiculously bad. Although Hyde looked very stylish during action films, but this is just such a film. I am a lover of good action films, but the action was terribly done. Although the final shootout was in order, and the main point of this depressive film. <br /> <br /> He continues to jump between genres, which is not very good. It wants to be a drama, or an action movie, or a horror, or a romance ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review is driving you crazy, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not be fooled, this movie is bad.
