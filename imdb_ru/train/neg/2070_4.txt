After too many bad memories, I missed this episode every time he appeared in the episode of the second season. I recently watched it again to remind me why. I have always considered this to be the worst episode of ST: TNG (with the exception of Grayscale, which is hardly ever considered an episode). <br /> <br /> I continue to listen to the awkward dialogue and think of the script written in red in the author of the book "Writer 101": "SHOW, DO NOT TELL!" From Dinna Troy's statement and constant reminders of everyone else about what is charming, Okon's dangerous outcast, before Ginan explains how her droid joke is funny (this is not so), and there is no way to solve a problem that worries someone. This is not a plot point, which is not highlighted and not emphasized triumphantly for our edification, and in none of these moments is there any believable. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too scrupulous to be considered the center of plot fraud. On the other hand, it may happen that no one but John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from Doctor Who) can extract this signed role role role. <br /> <br /> (By the way, zero points on the data subtitle. Although I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny a few decades ago, he and Brent Spineer had nothing to work with here. Although a little Jerry Lewis was funny silly.) <br /> <br /> Good afternoon, you can think of it as a charming little bow to a smaller episode of the Original Series. I would prefer to skip "Time Squared" or "Who."
