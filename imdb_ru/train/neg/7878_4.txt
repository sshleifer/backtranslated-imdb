I am a big fan of the original book, and this adaptation is just bad. First of all, it was difficult for him to decide whether it would be a kid or an adult, which caused a strange mixture of adult history and some rather cruel scenes with a silly little duck, which initially continues to give "funny" moments. br /> <br /> But this is hardly important, the film is just boring, motionless and does not correspond to the original story. He is simply unable to convey in the picture all the points that Orwell tried to make in his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> The second revolution? !! Didn't they guys learn anything? Who will be the next Napoleon then? Benjamin? !!
