There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's face it, however, the main reasons why someone will watch this will be for Leo and Kate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying that they are not good actors, I say that they stink in this film. The special effects were decent (and I’ll say that the filmmakers did a good job of making the ship a pleasant sight), but IT even has some serious flaws. For example, right before the ship sank, you can see the unfinished image of a blue screen behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of a REAL Titanic, but I find this film an insult to this story. The editing was terrible - there is no reason for any film to last more than two and a half hours (with the exception of the MAYBE biopic), and the script and script were terribly unnatural. <br /> <br /> I’ll say that the music could have been better than I could imagine (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go Go"). There is one scene that stands out for me when the ship sinks and bass music sounds. This may well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood everywhere, it was extremely boring. When Jack died, I felt more relief than sadness, which, as I know, cannot be what the director intended. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I find it terrible that they have turned the beautiful history of the Titanic into an overblown chick.
