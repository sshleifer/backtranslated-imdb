When I went and watched this movie, I had high expectations. But I was so wrong. This film was exactly the same as all other horror films. This is a virus, zombies, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many other films. But the difference with this and other films is that the story is very weekly. These are bad actors and boring music. With the photo everything is in order, and the rest is complete crap. Do not watch this horror movie, go and see "Ring 2" or any other film that tells about many other things. I hope that they stop making horror films that have a virus and a virus, and make people turn into zombies. We have seen enough of this. The only good thing about the movie is when they stand on the roof and film famous celebrities.
