Wow, Nellie! Iâ€™ve heard a lot of mixed reviews of this ... but one of my hardcore horror reviewers really found it disappointing. Man he was right on his nose! In this film, clean lovers filmed. They should have done one take, maybe two on each stage, the film seemed sooo impetuous. The script was also bad ... they had lines that tried to be unique, but could not. Miserably. "Get your hooks off me!" Oh, man, I hate it when movies try to do it. It happens all the time with comedies ... but with a horror movie and below-average actors ... the results are incredibly poor. Lines and scenarios were very predictable. But what made me feel so negative about this film is again a damn game. It was terrible. In addition, from a little Asian guy who worked at the booth. I thought he was great. <br /> <br /> The film tells about 5 stupid tourists who rest in Asia. They are in the wrong place and fall into the hands of a sex slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But watching someone with a severe form of diarrhea is probably more interesting and intense. The only reason this is considered horror is murder. There was no sign of waiting. <br /> <br /> I like that many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little gauntlets from it. But unfortunately, with HUGE U capital, the film was incredibly disappointing. I enjoyed the fracture of the ankle and blood. Flabby chicks were also like that. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie shouts an amateur. This is the first full-length work of Ryan Nicholson, and for the most part he failed. There is no denying that he has a sick sense of humor and a taste for horror. I pray that his next film will not play out as the next horror film "B" ... unless he tells us that it will. Even after this disappointment, I'm ready to give Ryan another chance. From what I saw about him, he is a real, devoted person to the genre. Good luck next time because it was bad news.
