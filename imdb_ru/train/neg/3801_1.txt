A warning! Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is your typical Disney movie. <br /> <br /> 1.Politically correct what happens in a foster family, in which there are even races. <br /> <br /> 2. Insults the viewer's intellect with its simplified lines. <br /> <br /> 3. The boy’s sleepy father is almost directly taken from “Infinite History” 2. <br /> <br /> 4. In a world full of crimes, diseases, corruption, hunger and other problems, about which need to be taken care of, only the losing team is worthy of divine intervention. do not like swearing ?! Where it came from, damn it! <br /> <br /> 6. Helping the team, the angel hurts and humiliates the opposing team. Very angelic! <br /> <br /> 7. Team angels help, called ... you can guess ... angels! Disney at the worst! <br /> <br /> 8. “Just received my training wings.” Brilliant line! <br /> <br /> My conclusion: I didn’t like it at all.
