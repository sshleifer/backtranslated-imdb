Oh my God. Oh my god, I can't get through this movie. It was awful awful awful! Don't even waste your money to buy it in the bin for 99 cents. No, avoid it at all costs, I warn you! <br /> <br /> This was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? Are you kidding me. Become real, it sounds like a new Barbie doll .. Super Women? Are you kidding me. It was such a fake fake. The city dwellers did not even seem to care that the flying blonde was just inspecting the city, saving the fire ... Oh, God! <br /> <br /> Lord, was it just me or did this movie seem offensive ?? I think you need to become a superhero, is it a pair of double D, blond flowing hair, without glasses and a tight leather suit ?! <br /> <br /> If he tried to be romantic ... than .. God, I don't know. It was awful if loving means inviting someone to an art show, and then having sex in bed And in the air ... then they had total love! <br /> <br /> It was a pity, everything was going too fast. First, this guy was single, then he met a girl-girl ... then they broke up, than he met this girl Hannah ... and ... it goes on. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this film made me think .. How the hell did they get it in cinemas ?? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
