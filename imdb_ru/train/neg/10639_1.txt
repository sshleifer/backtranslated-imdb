Thoughtless, ignorant, ill-conceived, killing a career (where is the talented Angela Jones now?), Deeply unfunny trash. It is not surprising that since then reb Breddock did not manage anything else - everyone who has the chance to make his first film by his own rules, based on his own script, using Quentin Tarantino himself, and creates something like IT, everyone feels that THIS was a story worth telling the world that doesnâ€™t deserve a second break. In these conditions, the performances are good - the actors do what they are told, and do it well. They just shouldn't have done that. <br /> <br /> 0 of 4.
