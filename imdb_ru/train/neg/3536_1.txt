I don't think I ever felt that this let me down to the film. After I fell in love with Guy Ritchie's two previous films (I don’t think "Gone Away - He Was Blind in Pussy"), I was looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> The reviews were bad, but I still don’t trust the press. Even more disturbing was the fact that there was something stinky on the Internet, so I passed my 4.80 pounds sterling yesterday with some trepidation. <br /> <br /> I’m not even going to try to explain this film, mainly because I don’t have a clue what is happening, and at some point I was honestly close to getting up and asking, not did it just me! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Richie seems to have fallen into the trap of his wife, taking himself too seriously. It seems that he was not good enough to make films with good stories, laughter, lively dialogue and good characters. It's almost as if he had a checklist of films that he wanted to rip, here are some of those that I noticed: <br /> <br /> Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, Ordinary Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good, and it was really an indulgent story and editing / directing that let the film down. <br /> <br /> So big, thumbs down from me.
