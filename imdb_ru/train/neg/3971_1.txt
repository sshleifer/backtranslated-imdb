Give me my money back! Give me back my life! Give me some credit. This film was worthy of vomiting. Useless and time consuming. What a waste of energy and completely meaningless. Well, I understand the premise and idea, but give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mother's repentance, accused husband! Clich√© yes ~! Get a life! Sorry, but this film was a waste of my time, my money and my existence. I would prefer to watch the eggs! There is no real explanation why this happened. Jail? What for? The loss? obviously, but why? Acting deserves what I do here, Oscar and cinematography. Am I just doing it for a salary? How much did this movie earn? Well, that stupid fool hired a copy. Enough said
