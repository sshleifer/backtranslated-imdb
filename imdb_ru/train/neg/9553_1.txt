Unsurprisingly, it was released directly to DVD here in Australia, without any additional features. The dialogue was hockey, acting, terrible, and the script sucks !! Whoever thought it would be a good idea to continue or continue John Badham’s 80s Wargames film, which is much better, well, they should have thought of something because it’s a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at it as a lover of eyes / love interest, while Matt Lanter was good as another main leader - that's all. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone the Wargames: The Dead Code, see Hackers or the original Wargames movie - both are better than this piece of shit!
