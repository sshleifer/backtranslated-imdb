You all know the story of Hamlet. I do. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase “To be or not to be” (and not the speech itself) hit the ground so many times that it was not very interesting (in fact it was not so great) . begin with). In FACT, I consider Hamlet to be a good but highly overpriced game. This is not even the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo and Juliet" are ten times better, and "Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" are not too far behind. “Macbeth (knock on the table, pull it out of the drawer, the puck will repair the damage, OV!)” It's not that bad either. There are many others that are better than this, Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not particularly comment on the film, rather, I will tell a completely horrible episode of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Good. Mike and Bots win a card game, choose a movie. they ask for "hamlet", pearl sends it to them, yadda yadda yadda. , and prepare for the most boring science fiction episode of MST3K in the entire history (admittedly, I have not seen any of the SS). <br /> <br /> Although Dr. Z’s Blood of Water makes watching this Episode awful, as this is not really a film, but rather random, merged scenes (I recall Mike’s line from Future War: , this is an anthology of short, plotless films ”), SOL Crew has gone down a lot of good cracks. I can not say the same thing here. <br /> <br /> Reefs do not match, host segments (usually at best) are mediocre at best, and when the movie itself (which is not so bad) is actually BETTER (I mean, as a quality a movie, not like a camp, like "Prince of Space") than its version of MST3K, you know, the show must be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw it a few months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried and tried to have fun - but I just could not. Just a random line like "Greetings to Queen Dilbert's boss!" (and when it's the funniest line in the episode, well, um) - and sometimes I mean every ten minutes or so - maybe I even laugh. The second time when I tried to look at it, I didn’t even laugh at a few jokes that seemed funny to me earlier, and just gave up forty minutes before. <br /> <br /> The film is not terrible; This is simply the German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and although dubbing is not the best, in itself is not a reason to hate this film. <br /> <br /> Four stars for Hamlet; THREE, yes THREE for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY, WHY, WHY, MST3K!
