As noted by other reviewers, the film dies in the last half hour. However, before that, he suffers from the predictability and stunningly useless performances of Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found her character and destroys every scene she is in. Connery is as good as Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect, not truth, which completely overlaps with a sense of unreality. And the end is just weird. The filmmakers obviously knew when they gathered this mess together, that all they needed was sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dinner, so they added a “dramatic” point as compensation. Each small jump is accompanied by a crescendo orchestration, to the point that it becomes ridiculous. If you need an example of a bad movie in the big leagues, it’s worth a look, otherwise skip it.
