I was not very impressed with Cinderella 2 and the Jungle Book 2, but this is possibly worse than both titles. First of all, I didn’t like the animation, the very Saturday morning cartoon, only worse in some scenes. I liked some of the characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters like Cruella were mediocre. Cruella was truly villainous in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. What she was talking about was nothing special, and her animation was ugly. Also, her fellow painter Lars was a joke, to be honest, and Roger seemed to quit smoking during the night. The voice talents were very good, although especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jody Benson, the accent spoiled him for me. There were a few good moments, but the whole plot seemed to me bloated and very suggestive of a long television episode. In general, it’s a very disappointing continuation of the most memorable Disney movies of the 60s along with the Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give 3/10, it was not my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
