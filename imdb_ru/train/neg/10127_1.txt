This show made me feel physically ill and completely out of touch with British society as a whole. Such programs as this and Blue Peter pretended that there was no / no class division in Britain. They always said something like; "Go to your attic, and you can find it ..." or "Go to your garden tonight and ..." - how about us, "vile" children from the working class who have never had a "attic" and "backyard" “What was nothing more than a 1 meter square balcony on the 14th floor of the municipal district?” Public broadcasting - yes, that's right! And on top of that, it was terribly sad to see how these stupid, middle-class children who have their own backs mess around with pieces of old plastic that are “having fun” ... do me a favor and why not, go and cut your wrists or Coca-Cola overdose with mom and dad's money ... I'm sick
