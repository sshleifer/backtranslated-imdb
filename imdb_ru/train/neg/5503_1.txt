I grew up in the 60s when I watched the original series, and one thing that I can immediately say is NO comparison. This film was completely ridiculous with a live flying costume. Martian, which took different forms. Special effects similar to what a small child can create. On the contrary, the characters were originally designed, and the audience had a feeling of Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this film, yes, actually, was one, happened when Ray Walston finally appeared at the end. He wore dark glasses and mentioned that he had lived on this planet for 30 years as a kind of homage to the television series. But even the real uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
