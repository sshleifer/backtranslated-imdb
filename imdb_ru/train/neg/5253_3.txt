The name (frau) of the main character is the German word "woman." I do not know whether it was intentional or not, but if it was certain, last year at the Fantasy Film festival, when it was shown, they heard a giggle from a German audience. <br /> <br /> But these were the only giggles the film received. Not that this was the purpose of giggling, it is a terrible film for the sake of all that is holy! A terrible movie in several ways. It is a pity that such a room was wasted with terrible, even intolerable moments for the viewer (definitely not for the faint of heart !!)! And it was not even necessary to show everything that is shown. I don’t even take a moral obligation (because films don’t actually have this kind of task or function) to discuss what is shown here, but this is the new minimum of the whole “torture movement” that has grown in the past few years!
