I see no particular reason to dwell on this film. Sylvester Stallone is again John Rambo, author and survivor of Season in Hell, recruited from prison by his only friend Major Richard Krenna, who is secretly returning to Vietnam, taking pictures of American prisoners, who are still believed to be in terrible situations. camp, and come back without engaging the enemy. <br /> <br /> Great chance. What if he really did nothing but sneak up, take a photo and sneak away? Who will come to see the movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a celebration of Stallone’s muscles. In preparing for our mission, we see his well-oiled muscles grow. (They are greased and bulging everywhere.) There is a ritual of tying black leather, ugly shotguns, and even uglier knives. The black guns are cleaned, assembled with loud knocks and almost as oiled as Stallone’s muscles. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough weight to pierce the enemy forehead. Knife sharpened slippery incisions. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his prisoners of war are dealt with in one or two lawsuits from Washington, cynical politicians who, you could argue, never even participated in a fist fight. grammar school. You know, without courage? Just sit with your feet on the table and drink foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The film does what he intended to do, but what he intended to do is terrible. He deliberately capitalizes on the myth, popular in the mid-1980s, that countless MVDs were quietly kept in the disgusting camps of northern Vietnamese people. Bumper stickers were omnipresent. (Free our Ministry of Internal Affairs.) Why should they keep them? This has never been fully justified, but it is possible to turn prisoners of war into slave labor — in a country that has absolutely no resources other than labor. Or, perhaps, because of their propaganda value as an instrument of humiliation for the United States — a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese keep secret from the world. <br /> <br /> As a prisoner, Rambo refers to the Middle Ages from the north. Vietnamese. Dropped to the neck in pig excrement, and then pulled out from his wrists, his muscles were still on display. Then, not content with the inhuman Vietnamese, they brought a Russian officer to play the role of a Gestapo officer: "Wee-Huff says that you remember." High-tech type, Russian uses psychology and electricity, and not just pig breeding. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until “this country loves us as much as we love it.” raising another myth that veterinarians returning from Vietnam constantly humiliated and cursed, so I think we elected so much to Congress and appointed others to high posts. The last three losers of the presidential candidate were among this despised group. At least the aimless drifting Rambo left the room open to the sequel, which came quickly. <br /> <br /> In the action movies with Schwarzenegger, Willis and others there were dismantling of the wise men, but Rambo does not have humor. He stupidly passes through a ghostly ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. To speak is a sign of weakness.
