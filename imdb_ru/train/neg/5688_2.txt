Short version: Seed is not useless. It is simply derivative and inferior. And soulless. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you have never seen any of the films that include the vaguely defined “psychological horror” genre, this film will probably melt your face. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. An initial montage of animal abuse will be enough to open your eyes to the possibility of cruelty on the video, and (only) a memorable scene of bloody events later in the film may be more than you can handle. The climax will play with your emotions as it may not be in other films. <br /> <br /> But this is if you have little experience with the genre. If you saw the real thing ... "Repentance of Avgustovsky," for example, you, like me, will find it very difficult not to sleep until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Other Reviewers have compared this with the video of the old stuff. I understand this comparison. As in the video filth, Seed is more cruel than the main horror film, and less subtle. But the reason why video shit is still known to us is not only for the above reasons - those who are still popular have something special. Let me be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who got stuck had a “soul”. <br /> <br /> Take this quotation from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "The Mogilnik", in an interview about the new -ish DVD: "... we will never have more of these films, because today the technology has surpassed imagination. And the technology is cold. So many things will disappear, because such small films will no longer be produced. Today we have wonderful, exceptional tricks that are very expensive, but they are cold. Horror today, this kind of horror movie costs over a million dollars. These films were not so expensive ... they are real effects made by our hands ". <br /> <br /> It may be wrong to take comparison with the horror of the old school so seriously. But Crisanti hit his head on the head. Even in his, seemingly explosive, the best of the ugly videos pursued a primitive “truth". And here Ball fails. As if he saw movies and did not understand them. Everything on the checklist is ... BS about the "statement about humanity", about the obscene scene of torture, etc. But this, as Krisanti says, is “cold.” The mountain is in All CGI. It all looks like scenes from different films of different genres. And walk soooo slow. Dude, so slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: the one-screen scene really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough about that. Weak movie.
