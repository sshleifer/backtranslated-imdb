Interestingly, 90% of high-profile reviews all consist of "* random username *" from "United States" (without state pride ??), who all say more or less exactly the same thing with exactly the same grammatical style and all with the same complete lack of taste in the movie. I would go deep into this suspicious trend, but, alas, this is a review of the film, not the reviews themselves. <br /> <br /> Let me begin by saying that I am both a Christian and a real avid movie. fan. This means that I have seen so many films, from good to bad, and I can sincerely assert that “Clashing with the Giants” is in fact NOT a good movie. He has good intentions, but he does not meet many (if any) basic standards, which I associate with high-quality cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Action: mostly terrible, at best acceptable. To hear that most of them, apparently, were volunteers, does not surprise me at all. <br /> <br /> Dialogue: clumsy, trashy, the script is a long version of some kind of silly parody that you would see in a Sunday school or in your youth a group function. The Rave Review robots revel in the absence of "meaningless words," but the cold harsh truth is that such words are part of the real world, and its complete absence is palpable. Let's just say, the average senior coach in a state championship game could have said much more than “HE NO!” When things go wrong. <br /> <br /> Story: stunningly predictable. It was commented that this film is “not a Hollywood cliche,” and yet, as if it was made directly in the movie “Making a sports film for the weak” on him. I do not lie and do not brag when I say that almost all the main details of the plot and plot were attached immediately after they appeared. Only those who have never seen a decent sports film in their entire life would be emotionally agitated by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> Directing / editing: it was also formed almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie Template. However, acting aside, there were not many noticeable nonsense, therefore, at least, “The Clash with the Giants” was technically competent. <br /> <br /> Message: ask Jesus and He will fulfill all your desires. Part of me hoped that this film would end up with the defeat of the team, to really emphasize the whole part “If we lose, we praise you,” because in the real world you WILL fail at one time or another and be well prepared for that . But in the world “Faced with giants”, if you do not succeed, someone clearly screwed up or cheating. Another interesting question is, what if the Eagles will face another team that has received a religion? Will they be caught in an endless cycle of wonderful plays and rescue at the last minute, or will the universe just explode? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: for the tough conservative Christian parent crowd lamenting about the evil of Hollywood, the film “Facing the Giants” will be another mediocre Christian film that will become a pedestal as the preferred model for modern filmmaking. For everyone else, the effects will range from boredom to burning desire to watch something else. And a warning: any attempt to show this to non-Christians will lead not to conversion, but to ridicule. I give it two stars, one for the stage, on which I did not roll my eyes, and the other for basic technical knowledge with a small budget.
