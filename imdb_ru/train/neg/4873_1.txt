This is definitely a stupid bad taste film. Eddie Murphy stars in what is written as a comedy. He is surrounded by his ideal family, full of good family values. If you are looking for politically correct entertainment, this film is for you. But if you do not like the idea of ​​being the only one, so as not to laugh at obscene gags in a cinema full of popcorn addicts, just run.
