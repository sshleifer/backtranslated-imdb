If you like to comment on films whose script is halfway to the film, then this is the one you need. The setting and acting is like in a porn movie, but nothing happens, just some groping and touching of the third kind. Which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy, but inaction. Several actors I saw in real x-rated films, and their acting was much better there. All special effects are made by the great "Rondo", which performs all the magic with his mind. The cult film is written on the box. Does this mean that this film cannot be watched at all ??? <br /> <br /> Get drunk with friends and see this movie on New Year's Eve thanks to it.
