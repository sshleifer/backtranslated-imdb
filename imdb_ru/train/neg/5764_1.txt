Scary Movie 3 is such a stinky festival that it’s hard to put it in words. It makes movies, such as Malibu's Most Wanted, look like Oscar material, let's say. <br /> <br /> The original film “The Terrible Film” was very exciting, one of the best parody films of the 90s, shot by a wonderful team that had previously shocked us. the world with dont be a pose a threat to the south central, while drinking your juice in the hood. But what the hell happened ?! After the tragedy “Scary Movie 2”, I thought that changing the actors and the team would help the cause, but this is even worse. <br /> <br /> In 20 minutes I smiled twice. Not one laugh, jokes were reworked, and originality was clearly not a factor. The fact that at the moment most people on this site voted for 10/10 made me feel physically ill. When there are such great movies as School of Rock out that really have jokes that are * funny *, everyone who spends their money on a prank like this needs a head test. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
