I have seen Gator Bait films, and this is almost the same as those. A woman is sexually abused by a group of degenerate men and systematically demands cruel revenge on each of them. What distinguishes this film from these (though not very) is that sexual content is not glorified. Throughout the film, full nudity appears many times, but not for a second is it sexy. Some scenes of rape may seem a bit extensive, but this is only because the film is trying to reinforce the need of the audience to see how this woman is eager for revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a weak film, there is no other way out. to maintain interest, apart from manipulating our natural desire, for this woman to get her revenge on her attackers. I spit on your grave - this is not the film from which you expect to get a serious moral, but I was glad to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted on a woman, it was not intended for T & A. <br / > <br /> Bi-movies are notorious for being nudged and uncontrollable teenage sexuality, and although “I spit on you, Tomb” is undoubtedly a bi-movie and contains more than just a share of nudity. Nude is not Moves the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is the idle need to take revenge on the group of rapists. These people are evolutionists, just as they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the authors seems to be to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason why a film can never be more than meaningless B-film, because it does not convey any message, but instead simply satisfies the desire of the audience to see how the group of rapists will receive exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only problem with which it is connected is that we have to go through sexual attacks. Oddly enough, the first half of the film is the part that contains the largest number of naked bodies (although not very much), but at the moment it is the most painful to watch. We are even a little disappointed when we see a woman taking revenge, because several deaths were so carefully thought out that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug you turn on the motor on the boat and press his genitals to the propeller, while remaining while the woman screams the last words and pulls the cord), but again, this film satisfies only the desire for revenge, which the first half filled us with. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) You know that this is all that the film has to do, because it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. A woman does not live happily ever after, she does not write her book, she does not leave and never returns to that place of nightmare, she just sits in the boat and moves around the lake while the film just stops. But what else did you expect? <br /> <br /> Have you read this slogan? If you decide to spend your time watching this, try to find any person broken or burned. I really looked forward to those ??
