This show has a UK edition that is less extravagant than in the USA. An interested person will receive a new kitchen or perhaps a bedroom and a bathroom and will be very grateful for what he received. The American version of this show is all that should not be in a reality show. Instead of making several improvements in the house, which the tenants could not afford or make themselves, the whole house is being restored. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US, or if you plead strongly enough, you will. The rather vulgar product placement that takes place, especially Sears, is also inappropriate. Instead of turning a single family in a disadvantaged area into potential millionaires, it would be much better to help the community as a whole, where instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on one house, to build something for the whole community ..... perhaps This is a place where you can rent crafts and power tools along with building materials so that everyone can benefit if he wants. Giving all of this to one person can cause tremendous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same abandoned houses.
