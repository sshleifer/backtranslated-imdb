I’ve seen my share of Woody Allen’s films, and while they’re not always great, you can usually be sure you’re entertained. Probably the last really good ones were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then, the ones I saw were heterogeneous, but watchable. And therefore, when I was invited to watch the new film by Woody Allen “Melinda and Melinda”, about which I did not even suspect that it was released, I gladly agreed. I heard little about it, so I hoped that I would be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen film I've ever seen. The premise is too explained, the actors are terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched, I suppose to fill in what otherwise would have become a 15-minute short film. <br /> <br /> I am not against the concept of this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation can be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and, obviously, the film continues to demonstrate this by playing both scenarios. The problem is that not one of these two films is suitable at all. The comedy is not funny, and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen had a good idea, but then there wasn’t enough time or time to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall level of acting is also very bad - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table, and this is basically Woody Allen’s impression. Previously, such good actors as Chloe Sevigny were just annoyed, and the worst of them is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame because her character is present in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the actors, the scenario with which they work is absent if it does not exist. Definitely far from Allen, whom we know and love from classics such as Manhattan or Annie Hall.
