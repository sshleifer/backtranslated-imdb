When I go to the IMDb boards, I am always fed up when I see the post of the worst film ever. After watching this * movie *, I think I'm going to create my own post soon !! <br /> <br /> Introductory headlines: great, some kind of unconvincing zoom on the gas stove (yes, focus on fire = explosions = great action movie !!) <br /> <br /> Actors: I think Ice T is a cool rapper, even a good actor (sometimes, I insist, “sometimes”), but Seagal, like the cop he plays, ... beyond words. The rest of the cast ... well, I don't know where these actors were hired, but damn it! I bet my dog ​​would be a much better actor than they are !! <br /> <br /> Story: Hijacking.original right? <br /> <br /> Sequence of actions: the first frame of the film is an explosion. I said to myself, well, cool !! At least some good pyrotechnics will be ... I was completely wrong. The rest of the film is mostly filled with low rents taken from the BBC ... <br /> <br /> The dialogs are hilarious, the music is complete nonsense, the end is happy (I mean, I was happy at the end because that the film is over !!!) <br /> <br /> My cousin, who was watching the film, was delighted (I'm 22, she's 42 ... well) .I was on the verge of taking a film and recording it . Maybe next time I will see it ... (who never said ???)
