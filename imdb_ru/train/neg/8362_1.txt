This one is a really bad movie. I puzzled and can not come up with a single positive comment. The game is terrible. I have seen more believable cable access appearances. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, the secret records of the president and the shark, which attacks everything that comes close to him, in the worst case were supposed to be fun entertainment. Shark Night is not so bad, it's good. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written a few seconds before it was shot. And to top it all off, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I am surprised that my ears did not start to bleed from the techno-synthesized sounds of the 80s that someone really bothered to record. <br /> <br /> Of all that I read, the Italian film industry died by 1987. Sharks are like the last nail in a coffin.
