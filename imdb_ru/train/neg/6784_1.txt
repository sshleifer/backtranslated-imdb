I tried to watch this film twice and even then quickly send the annoying parts, but I still could not get to the end. <br /> <br /> I don’t understand how this movie * really * got good reviews. I think these people who give such good reviews are just trying to promote a movie for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem very unrealistic, and this looks like an inside job that makes things more pathetic. Films should receive truly positive comments on their own, not frivolous !! <br /> <br /> The action was reminiscent of a cheesy porn movie, not funny. I do not mind low-budget films with a bad game, if they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> The main character annoys me. His expression and humor were unbearably childish. I thought that this was done intentionally, so that the conspiracy of women seemed more pleasant and reasonable, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very awkward (its superiors overdid it with a business speech) and unfunny sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> I didn’t find anything interesting in this film, except for some attractive women. <br /> <br /> I have never felt that the rating is misleading. I was interested in his premise, but scared by the rest. Of course, look if you want, but I just didn’t want someone else to pin their hopes / waste their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
