I didn’t really like the first movie "Cube". It was a good idea, but an annoying game and characters always prevented me from loving her too much. In fact, I did not feel the need to watch his sequel, but when I heard that they were shooting the third film, it would play a role more like a prequel to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would solve some of the problems of the original and provide us with an unforgettable set of characters. Well, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> “Zero Cube” starts quite well, introducing us to two characters responsible for observing and maintaining the endless maze of traps that people in Cuba suffer from. The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the daily routine of two men. It raises several questions regarding the reason why people go there, as well as the true nature of those who conduct the whole operation. All of which are left entirely to the discretion of the viewer. The acting was a bit weak, but overall the first half of the film went relatively well. <br /> <br /> With the development of the plot, one of the two “spectators” begins to have serious doubts about what he is doing. And later she decides to go and help a group of people trapped. Here, everything quickly begins to dissolve in boring cheese. <br /> <br /> Sent by the people who run the “Cube” program, we are introduced to the character “Jacks”. Together with his two subordinates, they play the main reason why this film is a failure. The beginning of “Jax” looks and speaks more like a third-class villain, taken directly from a James Bond film, complete with a constantly “popular” glass eye that in itself destroys any atmosphere created by the relatively good pace of the first half. Moreover, it begins to be felt rather like a comedy, and not as a serious film. With some incredibly commonplace lines, the screenwriter might have been bored, and he didn’t care. The action itself deteriorates to an even lower level when a former “observer” meets a group in Cuba. Watching all interactions hurts, as does everything else after it. <br /> <br /> Again not to impress on anything except weak characters, the dialogue and the action of “Zero Cube” is a waste of time for those who are looking for a good result. horror.
