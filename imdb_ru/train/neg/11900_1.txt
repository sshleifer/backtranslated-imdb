How wonderful. Another film about America that someone visited here is probably half a dozen times a day, and considers himself a “expert” in the country. Sheesh. I have to go on a trip to Germany for a week, and then come back and make a film about Germany as the “country of the Nazis” or something like that. Wim IL boy, you should get together with Lars von Trier and make a ULTIMATE movie about Americans. Of course, we all know that to create a “real” film about America, a pretentious European “we are the world” is needed. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right. For a continent that started not one, but two world wars, Europe undoubtedly has many opinions about America’s wrong “foreign policy”. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not worry, boy Wim, there are many Americans from Berkeley who will simply love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who consider George W. Bush to be worse than Hitler, and that the picture with the soup jar is an “obvious genius” !!
