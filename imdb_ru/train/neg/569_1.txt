Thank you for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film sucks on many levels, it's pitiful. The first VAMPIRES were fun, but this low-budget recovery made me yawn. <br /> <br /> John Bon Jovi (Kevin Bacon) for a poor man travels to Mexico with a surfboard, which has a hidden compartment that holds his equipment for killing vampires ala Antonio Case for Banderas guitar in DESPERADO. Along the way, he picks up several lame “hunters” (including an annoyingly feminist-infected girl who takes the pills so as not to turn into a vampire), and they intend to stop some kind of female vampire master who has no history. could take less care of her or her search (walking in the sun, stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so). If you saw the first VAMPIRES, you already saw it and made it a lot better. <br /> <br /> Recently, John Carpenter was responsible for a lot of bad movies. Honestly, I think he came out of his peak and is unable to make another horror classic. The only worthy film he made after THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is complete nonsense, right down to the incredibly cheap and belated ghost of Mars ... and now it's a waste of celluloid. Where more great people, such as "ASALT ON 13 DECAST", HALLAUIN (1), "Escape from New York and things"? <br /> <br /> Friend Wallace, a carpenter, proves that he can't get his way out of a paper bag with his paper. Thin script filled with yawns, groans and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention that I hated every character in the movie? There was not a single memorable character in the whole film. How does this happen? This film has nothing to recommend. Even the DVD presentation is not good; the menu looks awful. <br /> <br /> For comparison, Jason X: "Friday the 13th in space" was a masterpiece. This is how you make a sequel and (revive) the franchise, ladies and microbes, as well as create an exciting DVD menu.
