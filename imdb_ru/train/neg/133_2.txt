Well, the reason I saw it in the movie was that it was a preview, otherwise I would never have seen this horrible movie about a teenager. I mean, haven't we had enough of this yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least did not take them seriously! The plot sucks and the game is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, and this is the only film that competes with the fact that he is the worst movie theater I've ever seen.) <br /> <br /> There are so many holes in the story in this story, and the girls are so alike that even now there is no one who was killed and who was not. (and you don't care.) The only one I knew in advance was Denise, and she was the most talented actress I've ever seen in this bad excuse for a film. <br /> <br /> Stay as far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)
