First of all, I'm not a big fan of modern Turkish cinema, because the usual box office success model is getting below the waist. This film is not an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing advertising implies. In my simple opinion, the only purpose of this film is to make money by touching sensitive morale (in fact, in his native country he is generally considered a taboo). Cheap populism can give a brief definition of what I had in mind. <br /> <However, acting is almost perfect. In fact, most of the actors have a theatrical education and have tried their best to compensate for what Altioclar lacked; talent! All the cast members were perfectly integrated into their roles and well prepared to work, even less experienced ones. (Like Janset) At least Altioklar deserves a small word of thanks, simply because he knows how to choose the cast. In addition, he is just a monkey from the media, who considers himself a director with artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that consists solely of communicating with naked / half-naked women. And just because the media is bragging, not a single director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just cover your ears and something really artistic, I look forward to the applause of your next work. I hope this time you will be able to achieve an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> in short; Pros> Good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) Cons> Every thing except the cast
