Much was done because Rohmer used digital technology to “fill in” the background. At times it works well, especially the scene in which Grace and her maidservant see the king's execution from afar, especially striking. In other cases, it gives the film a strange amateur look that resembles a home video. However, the main disadvantage is that the apparent artificiality of the stage scene creates an alienating effect on the viewer. We know that what we are seeing is not real, so how can we feel the characters? Honestly, I didn’t care what happened to the lady or duke. <br /> <br /> Another serious mistake, I regret to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the title role. It is present in almost every scene, and the success or not of the film depends on its performance. Well, she speaks a foreign language, but is not able to express real emotions. Her emotions in the scene where she tells her friend Madame de Mailer (a great performance by debutant Elena Dubiel), who saw her head on a pole, caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience. Also, watch her hands when she expresses emotions! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very disappointing, especially given the positive reviews on this site.
