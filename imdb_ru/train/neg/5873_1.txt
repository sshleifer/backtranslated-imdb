I don't know what they think. they, I mean anyone, even remotely associated with this disaster. I saw such bad movies, I saw very bad movies, and then there is this. But I will say one thing. Things, whoever wrote the script, managed to put on the screen what could possibly be the most senseless dialogue over what was written. There is nothing good in this film, neither from a technical nor from any other point of view. The release should have been launched immediately. There are some pretty famous names in this movie. In fact, I hesitate to use the word movie. This is more like a collection of random scenes that are not related to another and have a meaning of less than 0. I can not understand why someone with any dignity would appear in this. I got it really cheap and I was still broken. Even if I got this movie for free, I would still be ripped off. This is an absolute 0/10
