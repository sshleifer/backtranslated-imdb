Wow. Has anyone ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. ever influenced anyone? This steaming pile of donkey's excrement is a perfect example; it makes the "cruel years" like the "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes Keith Richards' worst memories look like my first night emission. You know, I had nightmares, awakening and sweating bullets that never get close to the inner horror that Santa Claus discovered on the seemingly clean soil of my very being. However, I can remember some parties where this film could end well. Also, if you are looking for the perfect Santa Satan dichotomy on VHS tape, look no further. Do not check this movie, as I was informed that the MST3K version is now available. Move over Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
