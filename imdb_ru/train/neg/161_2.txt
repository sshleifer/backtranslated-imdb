If you can imagine Mickey Mouse playing the role of a New York street pimp or John Wayne as a communist spy, then you may believe that Pat Boone is a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in Kentucky, and you may well enjoy this film. <br /> This film is so stupid that it has nothing to do with the sexless love story of the mid-1950s. And the problem is that Hollywood did so much because Pat Bun refused to kiss the woman, not his wife on the screen before her release, that viewers know that he will not kiss Shirley Jones, so you cannot build any expectations. to "complete the screen" of their love. This is like watching a western movie in which cowboys have no weapons. <br /> <br /> History is meaningless. Even the title track is sung with excruciating enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> April Love is in the worst movie basket with Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
