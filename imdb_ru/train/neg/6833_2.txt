Jean-Claude Van Damme plays the twin brothers Alex and Chad, who are both martial arts experts and unite to destroy the thugs responsible for killing parents, this empty-headed action movie that doesnâ€™t have the plot to use the two Jean tricks By Claude Van Damme. Some good fighting scenes, but this is not one of Van Damme's best works.
