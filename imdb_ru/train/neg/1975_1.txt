Honestly, I have not seen so many Western films, but I have seen enough to understand what a good movie is. This is the worst west on the planet today. First, black people in the wild west? Come on! Who would have thought that this could be a cool movie from the wall that everyone would love, it was slightly retarded, no, no! Secondly, in those days and in the age of the woman, especially dark-skinned, were not inclined to carry or use weapons. Asian chick speaks perfect english? If the situation is western, Asia is not where you go. Finally, the evil gay chick was too big, the movie was just crap from the start. Don't get me wrong, I'm not racist and not white, so don't read the check after reading this, but this film, this film is the worst representation of black people I have ever seen!
