This film proves that a good acting game comes from the right direction, and in “Ask the Dust” this is not happening Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but in this he is minor. Donald Sutherland looks like an amateur. What for? Because the script is terrible, the adaptation is terrible, and the actors seem bored and indecisive. The atmosphere of the film is bad - I could only think when it was over, and I turned it off halfway. The director did a very bad job, and although I did not read the novel, this is definitely a lost opportunity. The atmosphere that this film is trying to evoke, and the message and storyline never reach the audience. In short, this is a horrible movie.
