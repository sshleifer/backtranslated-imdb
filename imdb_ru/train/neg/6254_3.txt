My friend was in the role of the FEDS agent (not the speaking part, as I recall). He brought it on a DVD so I can see it. It was “interesting,” but very much like an amateur movie. Well made amateur movie. Really boring and poorly written. It was probably fun to create and participate, but it definitely did not deserve wide distribution. They may like it in Omaha, but this Californian girl was bored and, frankly, partly embarrassed by my friend. <br /> <br /> If this director has shot or is making other films, he really should try to have a really interesting storyline and good actors. I am sure it was a great learning tool for them. I wish them good luck in the future and hope that they can improve their films.
