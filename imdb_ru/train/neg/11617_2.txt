This film "Joshua" is extremely exciting and completely meaningless. In fact, the thought shudders me that there are people who will enjoy watching this. Without revealing the story, we are talking about the boy's reaction to his newborn sister, and this is only the tip of the iceberg. Throughout this film, the viewer is exposed to the most disturbing of the possible behaviors of children. Adding insult to injury, by the end of this film there is absolutely no real result, except for the fruit of pure evil in the hands of a child no less who outwitted a whole group of stupid adults. There is no atonement, there is no justice, and there is no group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is happening around them. Honestly, I did not like to watch this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who can enjoy horror movies, this movie may be too much. Despite the fact that this film was well played, the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90-minute wait in the waiting room of the dentist waiting for some kind of painful dental procedure.
