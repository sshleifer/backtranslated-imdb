The story goes like this: Netflix was late sending me my DVDs, so I went to an analog rental place known as "Blockbuster Video". They suck, you know. Too bad, they have 150 copies of the latest failed films for your viewing pleasure, but I never want to watch any of them. So I saw BTK Killer on the shelf by itself. I like watching movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I will never understand, so I want to see such things. In any case, I insert this DVD, and suddenly, from the first second, it sucks. I sit there with my ch and we like, "what the hell is this?" Unstable camera work, terrible game - the first scene in which a woman is killed, you wonder if she prefers to just talk quietly instead, then the rat is thrust into her throat. I really wonder if the director has a hard-up on this shit. There is nothing decent about this movie. All I have to say to the director is: “Do you have a damn tripod?” Every shot was extremely unstable. The music was terrible. As if they once decided to make a movie. They probably gathered people from WalMart to appear and "act" for them. Just awful. If you are making a film like this, then directing is your hobby, and NOT what you have to make a living for, you MUST NOT be in the points of honor of a DVD for movie lovers like me. Better leave your friends at home when you are having a party and running out of interesting things to entertain them ... Then you shoot your BTK KIller film and say: "Do you want to watch this crappy movie I once did?"
