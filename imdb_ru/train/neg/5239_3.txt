I watched this movie based on the very good reviews I read about it here. <br /> <br /> They definitely saw something in this film that I didn’t see, that’s for sure. <br /> <br /> The film starts at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting, then it begins to be recorded and twitch, not to mention absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Eventually you will find that you yourself say: “What?!? Is he going to do this too? How far will he go with this thing? ”<br /> <br /> The plot begins with Jeff Goldblum's character, John, entering the grocery store. buy a bottle of wine. During the robbery, a robbery occurs and the seller of the new store, Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> John gets into the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. It seems a little big, but wait, that’s not all. <br /> <br /> John is totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make any logical sense, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful, loving girl, a reliable, well-paid job, a good house, a good car, expensive suits, decides that wants to be a loser, like Auggie Rose, and experience life in low-paying jobs, live in a landfill with a stupid girl, and possibly mess with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> A witty, half-burned film received positive reviews that I will never know. Of course, Goldblum does a good job with acting — he always does that — and his appearance improves with age — but if you don’t have Jeff Goldblum's HIGHLAND hobby and you don’t need to watch every movie he makes, I wouldn’t recommend this turkey . In about two hours of your life, you will not return - and believe me - you have nothing to be thankful for when these two hours are over, except to be grateful that you are still not sitting and not watching this movie! <br /> <br />
