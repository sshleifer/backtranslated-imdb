More mysterious movie with added unreasonable elements of horror; generally mediocre. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a nightmare in which her sex partner gets out of bed, enters her crying babyâ€™s room and kills him. She wakes up. Then this person dies in the hospital, spitting out blood. His estranged daughter arrives, and he manages to contact her through her dreams (I think), and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body completely decomposes in the grave. <br /> <br /> There is not too much mystery about who did it or even how; most viewers understood this long before it was revealed. I'm not sure that the way he was killed would really work. <br /> <br /> In any case, elements of horror penetrate: a terrible autopsy, a recurring dream about a man who killed a boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turns into eyes that are then cut, and a few shots of a decaying person in nightmares, and actually in his grave. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised to see Fulci's dedication to Clive Barker at the end! Interesting.
