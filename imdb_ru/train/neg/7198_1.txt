After the witty live action “Disney” “George from the Jungle” I had high hopes for this film. Great disappointment. Naked plot, bad game, bad visual effects. This film was based on inconclusive one-liners, idiotic (and senseless) product placement and the most unpleasant side impact in this gadget machine. I took two small children to see it, and they went crazy. The only laughter gained from this film was a bad wait when you had to show the laughter to the guy who got it in the groin!
