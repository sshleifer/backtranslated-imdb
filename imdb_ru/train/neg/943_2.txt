Here is a small interesting film that strictly assigns the phrase “low budget” a terrible title. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization." Students are hopelessly killed from fake submarine sandwich matches and flight school supplies. Sounds like the resurrection of classic B-movies from the 50s, right? Nope This is not an example of high fun in the camp, which, by the way, is WAY from the goal. A glamorous demonstration of breasts and buttocks follows our desire for pleasure, resisting the horror that should have been 99.44% more. The best entertainment at its best, backed up with a pint of red blood and dead student bodies. Such terrible films like this would have made the catastrophic GUR BEAR (1970) ultimately the work of an intelligent genius with a master's degree in filmmaking! This is an automatic "F", so rest easy!
