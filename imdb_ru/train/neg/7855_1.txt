I could not believe my eyes when I watched this movie. There is no point in this except blood and violence. Unlike other scary films in which there was blood and meaning, this film is simply blood, blood and murders one after another. This film is not interesting at all, it has no meaningful plot or plotline, and at the same time there is no intelligence in it. The blood looks very unreal, and this film is generally meaningless. Don't even waste time on it. It's only an hour or two of mindless violence. There are many bloody scenes in it that are not scary, but simply disgusting. This is probably the worst horror movie I’ve ever seen from all the horror movies I’ve ever seen.
