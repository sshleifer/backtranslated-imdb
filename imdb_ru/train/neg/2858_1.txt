It must be one of the worst films of all time. The graphics were terrible, the acting was b-movie, and the effects were simply qualified for Nintendo 64. You would think that they would put in a bit more effort. Of course, this is a film with a fantastic channel, so you should expect it to be low, but this one is going crazy. Damn, I'm still laughing. So, shaking your head in a disbelief film is good. <br /> <br /> Although this seems to have “famous” actors and actresses, I find it hard to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this film was worth their time and effort. <br /> <br /> Graphics could be good in the 60s or even in the early 70s, but come on, this is 2009! I will not give out spoilers, let's just say that if you played Jurassic Park on Nintendo 64, you will be very familiar with what you see in this movie. <br /> <br /> It is definitely not worth the two hours to sit
