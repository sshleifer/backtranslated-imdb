If this guy can make a movie, then I certainly can make it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hired me to make a film for you, I promise to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This film did not have one. I think that the B-class cheesy horror films are rented only because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I would not want to let my viewers down. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from creating too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out that this is just a dream. I think there were about 4 such scenes in HorrorVision. And, given that the film lasted only an hour, the ratio of the length of the film to the film was quite high. And, if I decide to make a sequence of dreams, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? <br) by adding satirical references to them in mine. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, the palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they turned him into an evil monster monster before the screen exploded or something like that. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for higher quality in your next horror movie, count on me: an extraordinary director of want-to-movie.
