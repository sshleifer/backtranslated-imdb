The plot does not offer any new excitement, it even begins in the same way as the cube I. At this time there are no other improvements for the cube machines, except for the presence of an additional exit that is not guarded, very ingenious. The characters are also not as well developed as in the first episode, they simply became “flat” as in the soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone gets to the normal exit, he will be asked a few questions, such as “do you believe in God?”, this is not very creative or original, and, in my opinion, does not fit into the mystery of the cube with his traps. In fact, nothing more to say about this.
