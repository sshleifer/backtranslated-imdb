I wish I could get my rental money back from this piece of rubbish so that I can donate it to a nursing home. Total trash! Five people watched this movie at the same time, and there was not a single laugh, although I was yawning a lot. Paltrow is a beautiful woman and she was the best thing in the whole so-called comedy film.
