I am usually not the only one to make a movie. I try to see the good moments, and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case there are almost no good moments. In my opinion, if you are going to do something bad, why bother? Part of the film - pictures of Anna's face, when she breathes deeply, and in the background playing violin music. the other part is filled with a bad and wooden game. Rupert Penry Jones is indifferent. Jennifer Higham plays Anna's younger sister with modern manners. Ann is portrayed as meek and self-deprecating, which is good in the beginning, but she remains the same throughout the film, and you see no reason for Captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. In general, the performance lacks the feeling of a period, too many mistakes that cannot be ignored, for example, running out of a concert, kissing in the street, running around the streets without a hat (why was this scene in the movie at all? The scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes.) To summarize, a terrible film, very disappointing.
