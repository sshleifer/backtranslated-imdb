In my lit. class, we just finished a book, Ax, and this film doesn't look like a book. (1) Brian never ate the worms in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother was cheating on her father in a station wagon, and not in a forest where anyone could see. (4) The man with whom he deceives the mother does not have black hair, he has blonde. <br /> <br /> Now about the unrealistic parts of the film: (1) A 13-year-old cannot punch through a window with a single blow. <br /> <br /> And for the actor, the guy who played Brian was a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I think the scenery was impressive, although I strongly doubt that the director even read the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good, if you have not read the book "The Ax" by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then start a letter complaining about the director.
