Yes, in this film, the children go to the space camp, and everything starts quite well when the children meet each other and learn the ropes. They then represent Jinx, a robot that could not exist in 1986, since they now have nothing with such artificial intelligence. The kid becomes a friend with the robot, and the robot rewards him for his kindness by shooting him and a group of other children in this camp into open space with a very limited supply of oxygen and radio receivers that do not have a signal to reach space. This camp is also not very fun, as these children go through real training, and instructors pass through them for failed tasks or for not doing the right things. Let him rest, they are here for fun, not just to become astronauts, just give them the experience of space flight, not a military camp. However, you can see Joaquin Phoenix in a rather early role. So, in the end, a film that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with an idea of ​​Jinx and other factors, you might as well put the children-combat space aliens on top of everything else that happened in the film, which could would be a movie a little more enjoyable, at least for me. Probably for some others who would like to see Kate Capshaw's face torn to pieces by some strange super-alien creature.
