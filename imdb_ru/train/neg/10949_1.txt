I go to the cinema to have fun. There is nothing interesting in this movie. From beginning to end there is no respite from the gray, painful reality of this woman’s life. This is one step, without changing the mood. I stayed until the end because I was convinced that everything should be better. They don’t, and I don’t think that I was the only one that was evidenced by the numerous groans sounding around the cinema when the film mercifully came to an end. Honestly portraying social defilement is not a crime, but to bore the audience with moans is not a way to win public sympathy. Scary film.
