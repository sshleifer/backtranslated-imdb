Summary: full moon. Creature, huge werewolf, on the hunt. Not for the flesh, not for the blood (not that it seems to be against biting along the way), but for a friend. He hunts for a girl. Not any girl though. Girl. Pure girl (as well as a werewolf, although she still does not know). Three, check it out well, two cops (after the first scene) and an old lady in a bag - all that can stop it, or even know that the thing that kills and eats a lot of people at full moon is a werewolf. This particularly strong werewolf, Dark Wolf, is approaching the girl. If he gets it, humanity is doomed. Now the police must find a girl, convince her not only that someone, however, a werewolf wants to rape her and, possibly, kill her, but also that she herself is a werewolf. And then they stopped him ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is for boys, teenagers. A lot of scenes with half-naked girls are more or less important for the plot. Mostly less. Well, I think you need to fill in something, because the plot (as expected) is thin. And, unfortunately, apart from the girls, there is little that can help to destroy the plot. Each usually addresses two main topics. Nudity. Check it out. And then special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are some things you can call effects. They are not very special though. In fact, to be frank, they are very bad. The film seems to suffer from a lack of funds. They could not afford clothes for some girls;), and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between the werewolf and the human form, obviously made by computer, are really bad. You can skip these things. But the Dark Wolf itself is very rude and you will never see any killings. Just a few mutilated corpses afterwards. And in the film there is surprisingly little blood, which, frankly, should be drenched in blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about actors and characters. In most cases, they are fine, but, unfortunately, mistakes happen when the characters (or actors) just lose it. Some of these errors may be related to the problems mentioned above. How bad effects or bad budget (?). This may explain why there is so little shooting, even if the characters are armed as a small army, and the target is visible (and does not move). But hey, when you're in real danger, nothing will save your life, like a good one-on-line ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this cannot explain the moments when a cop, Steve, is the only one who knows how to solve this problem, a werewolf who runs away when the only thing he can be sure of is that the werewolf is following the girl who is right next to him and that he cannot let it be hers. But, of course, this allowed the creators to stretch the finale a bit ... <br /> <br /> But I donâ€™t mind that none of the leading actors / actresses tried another attempt in another movie. <br /> <Good. To make a small conclusion: not a film that I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
