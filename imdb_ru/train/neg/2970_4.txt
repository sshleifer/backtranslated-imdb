I am a back batman and a fan of television. I liked the show (new and old), and I loved all the movies. But this film is not as good as some had hoped. In my opinion, this is a big disappointment. I think the problem was that he had no drama. Batman: Ghost Mask and Batman Outside: The Return of the Joker had a lot of drama. and Batman and Mr. Freese: Sub Zero also had drama. Also, I think this movie should spark Batman. The only scene that seems a bit gloomy is the big battle with Bane at the end. In any case, this is a good movie about Batman. But I would just rent it.
