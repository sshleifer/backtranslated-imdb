What a wonderful actor in such a horrible story ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production, however, are pretty good, albeit in London, but with an exterior in Bristol. Regardless of ?? Look at one cathedral, you all saw them, in a certain way. <br /> <br /> However, the story ... about a man born with the ability to cause death and destruction to anyone and anything, if he does. wish. With just a passing reference to true life examples of telekinesis, the narrative builds a picture of a person who was misused and misused as a boy, teenager, and finally, as a man; in fact, so much so that it literally requires vengeance. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is on the wrong path and, thus, intends to destroy this area ?? just thinking about it! <br /> <br /> The problem with the story, however, is that he tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental abilities and combine them with quasi-religious rattles to create a jumble theory about all this. Mixing facts and fantasies in such a way rarely works ?? and I'm afraid that Richard Burton had to replay awfully in some cases when he sounded convincing. His best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and her lover verbal bonding when they left his house: a sharp, witty and deadly dialogue, set in the way only Burton could. <br /> <br /> A good cast, however, helps to look and sound better, starting with Lino Ventura, whom I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981), in the role of inspector Brunel; Harry Andrews as assistant commissioner; the very underrated Lee Remick as Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi, publisher, Town, and several other famous characters. <br /> <br /> I liked how the story was presented, like a memory in a memory, to fill the story and thus solve the riddle. about the attempted murder of Morlara (Richard Burton), a suicidal writer. Up to this point it was a good piece of the visual detective work of Brunel and his English partner. However, this was very predictable, as it quickly became completely apparent to me regarding the identity of the potential killer. <br /> <br /> Then they went and ruined everything in the last fifteen minutes. If you need a clue about what it is, think of Samson and Delil (1949), from the celebrated Cecil B. Mill, and how Samson eventually got the bad guys. And the very last scene is just stupid. What for? Because there are at least a hundred ways in which the rampage of Morlar could be stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Actually a shame, because it could be much better than the story and the film. I believe that Burton really needed money. <br /> <br /> If you're a Burton fan, take the time to see the scene I mentioned above. Otherwise, do not worry.
