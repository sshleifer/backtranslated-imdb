As someone else mentioned, it starts with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat. Then the main story: the photographer (Ghaffari) and the writer (Shepard) meet by chance and go on a trip to the mountains. At first they spend the night in a hotel where Ghaffari shouts to a slightly deaf landlord with increasing irritation of the audience. Once in the mountains, they again seek refuge and are invited by a kindly elderly woman who seems too hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?) R. Now, I like Eurohorror, and it would be better if only Artigot (writer And the director) made some attempt at logical storytelling. The background (Pyrenees?) Is an excellent and intriguing place for mysterious and occult events. Green peaks can easily overshadow supernatural forces and those who command them. The photo is good. Just wish it all made sense. You can watch this movie at archive.org.
