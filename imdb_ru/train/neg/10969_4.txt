Perhaps I am outdated or simply do not know what Electra looks like in current publications ... But Electra, which I read, was much more manipulative and, it seems, always had a plan. She used to use others to do her dirty work, and most often a double cross was involved. As soon as you think that everyone has understood, she pulls the wool over your eyes and breaks through. <br /> <br /> This film was rather weak in the dialogue, the action was not particularly convincing, and the action was spotted. I was really looking for something more like Frank Miller’s book Electra Assassin. Which is much darker than anything in this film. <br /> <br /> The special effect, where it's cool, the action was sometimes interesting, but most often the plot and the plot were slow or illogical. That Hand was not threatening enough, and Electra was not ... harsh enough. She is the girl you love to hate ... but in this story I didn’t care.
