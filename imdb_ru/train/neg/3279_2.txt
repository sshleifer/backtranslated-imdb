Oh God ... There are so many other films that I want to see there ... I was stuck with my nephew for the weekend, and this is what he wanted - Yes ... <br /> <br /> I used to watch it was a show when I was in college ... it was pointless, quite fun and somewhat action oriented. The show had a kind heart, though ... and the characters were cute; no one was ever killed or even badly hurt ... it was like a animated cartoon. Transition to 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As others have said, there is simply no cohesive story, and the performances are strange ... almost annoying - definitely not true to the original characters ... it all looks like a crazy television parody and lasts more than 100 minutes! It was one of the few times when I was confused to watch a movie. What were they thinking about? As far as I can tell, this must be for product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is for this one to die a quick death. This makes the original Dukes of Hazzard similar to the Theater of Masterpieces ... <br /> <br /> I think the only remake left from television is Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
