Revenge is one of my favorite themes in the film. In addition, the "futility of revenge" - one of my favorite themes in the movie. Having seen the “Irreversible” Gaspar Noah (2002), I expected an even more topical expression of this topic. Instead, this film is a weak hesitant attempt that expresses nothing but a lack of conviction and concentration in the film. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The ultimate scene, the unreasonable scene of rape / torture between men, came up against nothing more than a fantasy of female rape. However, the film is not even completely through with this. Instead, the stretched scene (in which FAR exceeds the cruelty of the initial rape, both to the extent that it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of Dawson’s face in terms of either regret or “It wasn’t fixing anything,” while in the background continues the rape of her rapist. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not shocking, but confusion about what a graphic scene is. trying to get across to the audience. I mean, do we feel bad for a rapist? Are we happy about Dawson's revenge? Are we not disgusted with the cruelty of all this? Do we feel a moment of Dawson's regret and clarity? In addition to this failure, the film is really awkward, with more style than the essence. The characters are subtle, the dialogues are monotonous, etc. <br /> <br /> I usually try to make films on my own terms, but Descent does not seem to know what it is. Thumbs down.
