Don't let the name of this movie fool you, in fact, Jake Speed's character is perhaps the laziest action movie ever known in the film. When Jake Speed ​​does not save virgins from the evil madmen that he often isn’t, he seriously relaxes. Perhaps this adds to his charm, but, in my opinion, the action movie hero should not “relax” whenever he has such an opportunity. In addition, unlike other bold heroes, who usually have an impressive list of talents, this person does not have one, unless, of course, you call sleep a talent. Be that as it may, this film is basically useless, the script is not true, and the action, when it is, is very unconvincing. (The machine guns on the jeep were not bad, but that's all) So, if you have the mood to watch a movie that cures insomnia, then this fragment is perfect for you - he has a hero who not only lulls, but also his audience.
