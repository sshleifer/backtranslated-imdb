This movie is a farce! The names are grossly incorrect, and the plot is distorted and turned into something unrecognizable by lovers of literature. And they have a desire to give Beowulf a ridiculous gun / crossbow weapon. Beowulf doesn't need such a weapon! In the poem, he tears off Grendel's hand with his bare hands! And I can't believe that the writers did such a thing. However, the image of Grendel is impressive. This and the cast are the only positive aspects of the function. My English teacher would be crazy if she saw this abomination. If you're not a devoted fan of the epic poem Beowulf, avoid this movie at all costs. And even then I would not recommend it.
