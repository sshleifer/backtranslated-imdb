Madly directed, mad comedy that supposedly fakes “classic” alien invasion films from the 50s, but not really any better than them, except, of course, in a purely technical department (good makeup effects). And any deception that is worse than its goal is doomed to failure (Casino Royale, Our Man Flint is worse than almost any James Bond film). After two hours of listening to the shrill voices of the aliens, you will ask for a little peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
