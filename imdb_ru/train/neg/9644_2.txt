The first is first. In this genre film, the first thing you need is good music, and that’s where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> the music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, who deleted the letter “A” from his spelling, did a good job, but is useless for films with a bad caste, like this one. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll used to entertain the public, although it’s nice to look at, but her role in the movie is to dance, in fact she’s dancing in a rock band, and I don’t think that or a rock band has a dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this film is a piece of shit, a piece of ***, see if you want to be deceived.
