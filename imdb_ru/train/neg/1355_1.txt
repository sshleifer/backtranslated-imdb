I saw Crispin Glover "What is this?" at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. Admittedly, the film was at least accurately named, because I had a clear feeling that even the author / director could not give an answer. In a question and answer session after the show, Mr. Glover said that the film was originally intended for a short film to show the benefits of using actors with Down Syndrome. However, the very reason for making a film is not enough The actors, in my opinion, are the building blocks for a larger vision â€” a larger vision, which was confusing at best and absent at worst. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said that he wants to do taboo topics. Well, he does it. But why? The film seems to have no position, no reason to decide anything. Does he feel that these things should not be taboo? The film doesn't even give me an indicator of this. Taboo for the taboo is not interesting. He cannot even afford to break or incite taboos at any level, because he did not care about the audience in any way. <br /> <br /> For a moment, not paying attention to the problems with the concept, I was most shocked by how bad the film was made. Editing, cinematography and other technical aspects often seemed extremely amateur. Glover said that the film took 125-150 thousand dollars, and I feel that the money should have been spent on different designers (Glover really came up with some kind of design - I know that at least I saw the sound design in the credits) . Colored sets are ok (not really), but are used poorly. The parties resemble a photographed play - which would be nice if it went for some purpose, but in the hands of Glover it looks just careless. Other parts are filmed as a kind of home movie, worse in quality than what I first see in iMovie. Cinematographers. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem with "What is it?" I can not even understand how seriously you need to take the film. There are some parts that feel that Glover is screaming at you to think seriously. In other cases, he does not seem to be in his joke. Perhaps he wanted it to be ironic or significant in some way, but I just felt that Glover could not even bring himself to give his film any serious attention. <br /> <br /> Glover said that initially he wanted it to be a short film. If only it were. After seventy-two minutes in the film, the images and ideas of the first twenty end, and it can be argued that the ideas were formulated enough to state that they were even during this period of time.
