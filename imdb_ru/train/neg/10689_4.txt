Cuba Gooding Jr. is an intelligence agent who blames himself for the murder of the US president. I will immediately point out that this is not the role that this very talented actor notes, and this film shows us why, He teams up with the regular news reporter (Angie Harmon) to uncover the plot connected with the death of the president, and so on. blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> Even with the cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding, Jr. Anne Archer and Angie Harmon, “The End of the Game” cannot get your attention, clearly and simply; some actions are good, acting is not so bad, and the story, although it was made earlier, could lead to an exciting and enjoyable film - IT DOESN'T DO IT GOOD! Writing the script and instructions absolutely guarantees it, in no way does it drag you down into history and does not make you think about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This is boring, Predictable and boring.
