Another movie based on the banal, worn-out cliche of a mad scientist who went crazy. The film is about a surgeon whose life ambitions are to bring the dead ... back to life. I know, I know ... you have never heard of it before! Of course, as all these films go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a manic, bloodthirsty creature. For this promising installation, you might think that it would be at least a bit stressful. Wrong. As in many films of this era, the idea is good, but the performance and script are mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I ever saw (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not one of the gems.
