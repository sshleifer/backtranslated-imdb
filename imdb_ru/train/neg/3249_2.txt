Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in the movie today. With his hyperactive spontaneity and harsh face, he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala Ace Ventura) and turn them into decent comedy excursions. Or, in the case of Liar, Liar, make them one of the funniest modern comedies. Kerry also proved to be able to cope with dramas. He was great in Man on the Moon and in the Truman Show. The guy is great. <br /> <br /> Then the Bruce Almighty, the perfect car for Kerry, and the premise that was supposed to work; Kerry, after complaining to God and how his life stinks, gets the power of God. However, the script is pure recycled waste. Now, no matter how bad the script is, Kerry's improvisation sometimes makes the ridiculous scene funny. The problem is that Kerry has very few opportunities for revealing, because most of the comedy is based on silly special effects, only some of which are funny. Kerry rarely can improvise, because he has to bypass special effects. The authors seemed to think that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the film is just filler, giving Kerry nothing else to do except a tearful character who is completely without humor. He looks more like a 5-year longing for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he does is funny when it is really just annoying. <br /> <br /> I always liked Jennifer Aniston in Friends, and she was great in last year's Good Girl. She also has the gift of comedy, but with such a linear scenario, she simply plays the role of a bitter girlfriend. She looks grumpy, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> “Bruce Almighty” was supposed to be a comedy that works. But he does not even have the courage to take up the subject on which he mocks; religion. A few minor chuckles (his Internet Yehweh), but instead he just turned into a comedy superpower comedy. Not to mention the fact that his tonality sometimes moves from stupid to hard and even black comedy. The film fails at almost every level. This does not mean that he is completely devoid of laughter, but it is close. Any film that feels the need to include scenes of a dog writing to get her laugh has problems. But hey, if you have funny jokes, try it. <br /> <br />
