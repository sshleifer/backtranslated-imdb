The fire of Saint Elmo has nothing to do with life after university (for most of us, ordinary people, anyway). Why was this garbage done at all? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I am truly sorry for the actors who are faced with such a terrible scenario. In this “film” there are several talented young actors who have done a good job elsewhere. It must have been a whole joke with them on the set. <br /> <br /> I really found this “film” offensive to my mind. The only joy I got from this is to hope that Sir John Hughes laughed well when he saw this masterpiece of The Breakfast Club in the same year. <br /> <br /> Don't make it the same mistake I made, looking at it, because you like movies of the 80s. This is really offensive to the genre.
