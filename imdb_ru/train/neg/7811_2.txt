This is how you do it: believe in God and repent of your sins. Then everything has to change in the next day or so. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this film just sounds like a bad result of the shitty life of a drunkard. His mother is dying. His stepmother - damn it. His dad is dying. He drinks. He is getting married. He has children. He drinks more. His wife is angry. He disappoints his children. Wife threatens to leave. He calls the monk late at night because he wants to kill himself. Then, after the repetition takes place, we will receive a subtle message that resembles "Left behind". <br /> <br /> “He needs a salary.” I had to repeat this phrase again and again when the credits began to roll so that I did not lose respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen falls to his knees and asks for forgiveness of Christ. As soon as he does this, he goes out and actually says that he sees the world differently. He tells his wife that he has found God, and that’s enough for her. Flip scene for four months, and my wife is tired of going to church. Finish the movie when Madsen walks past the bar and gives a monologue about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Last moment? He waves a bar lightly dismissively (that is, the house of sin) and gives the gay, Miami Vice, a special congratulatory jump after school in the air as a freeze-frame of the camera. See why I had to repeat the phrase? "He needed a salary." <br /> <br /> Man, this movie is bad. The production values ​​of the B-Grade 80 do not help much. The script could easily become the episode of “Touched By An Angel”. It could be stamped out in 30 minutes plus advertising. The game is wooden and never believable. Even Madsen, from whom I am a big fan and the only reason I coped with this, makes it clear that this is his first acting job, and he still does not know his $$ from his elbow to the camera. After 45 minutes, I began to get frustrated. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to put it away and say well, I saw half of it. This is good enough. But no. If I was sitting in a ninja cheerleader, I could sit through it all. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don’t give this thing 1 is two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know this is unfair. But it's great to see the introductory title "Introducing Michael Madsen." Sue me. 2) Some of the dialogs are so bad that it is a classic. In the end I will give some quotes so that you too can enjoy them. <br /> <br /> That's it. To wrap it up, this thing is a piece of shit that needs to stay on par with the rest of the fat tails. But hey! Look Michael Madsen! (See Also TILT, EXECUTIVE PURPOSE, MY BOSS'S Daughter, etc.). Now I have to review Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a cop to regain my respect for him. See you children. <br /> <br /> “It will make me blind, but I will drink anyway” - Madsen’s first taste for cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> “I don’t understand! Everything seems so beautiful! - Madsen went out after confession before God. <br /> <br /> “I’m going to the city center later, I’ll take the Bible and get my hair cut, too,” Madsen, after turning to the dinner table, because Satan is alive in your hair
