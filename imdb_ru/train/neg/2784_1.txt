My husband and I are the parents of a small autistic boy who lives in the same town as the scriptwriter of this film. We were very upset that JCC transports this film to its Jewish film festival because of the way the character with Frankie’s mental abilities is depicted. We went to see this movie in a local theater when it came out. We demanded money back. We would advise the screenwriter to donate part of the funds to the Akhad SCC program in order to apologize. <br /> <br /> We didn’t like to see Frankie, a mentally ill and perhaps even an autistic teenager, part of the joke he constantly throws in order to look at the nurse’s chest. <br /> <br /> There was no point in Frankie’s character other than to say, “Hey, being mentally retarded is fun.” Problems like Frankie are serious. Families like mine really suffer. <br /> <br /> Script writer needs to explain. Does she know families with disabled children? Does she see families with disabled children week after week in the JCC pool?
