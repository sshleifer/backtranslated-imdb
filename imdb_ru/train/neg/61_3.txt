In The Sunshine Boys, there is not a drop of sunlight, which makes the title of this supposed comedy Neil Simon the only ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which is left without accreditation), equates old age with irrational behavior - and, even worse, awkward, galloping, vile, irrational behavior. Walter Mattau is merciless that we play at the age of a Vaudeville performer who wants to reunite with former comedy partner George Burns for a television show (they are said to have been a team for 43 years, and the question is: " case? ‚Äù), Burns, who won the Auxiliary Oscar, had the misfortune to come to the film in about thirty minutes, after which Mattau had already sent the material to hell and back. The noisier the film becomes, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross did a solid job only when he was not involved with one of the scenarios of Neil Simon; Here, Ross makes jokes like a thundering amateur, discarding warlike routines that do not pay off (for example, the semi-cohesive Mattau appearing in the mechanic's audition garage for television commercials). At this point Mattau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensated for this, slouching and screaming. Ross and Simon should have softened the character, put a nuance on his temperament to give the Sun Boys some sunshine, but Walter continues to project as if we were all deaf. The picture looks terribly dull and creeps at a heartless pace; man loses hope of it early. * 1/2 of ****
