I really wanted this movie. I love Kenny Hotz, and rice rice has a charming side for him. Not that I even loved spenny at all. Spynny destroys this movie. He should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend play the film. <br /> <br /> In any case, quite boring, except for the scene with Roger Ebert. There are not many celebrities in this film, and most of them do not seem to say more than one line. Overall, this film was disappointing. I would advise you to watch it only if you received it from the DVD of season 1 “Kenny vs. Spenney” (it is distributed free of charge on the 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out Papel Chase.
