This is a film that is bad in every conceivable relationship. Of course, we like to know what happened 12 years after the last film, and it works on some level. But the new characters are just not interesting. Children's Melody is awful awful! Alas, although the logic that people cannot stay under water forever is preserved, other basic physical logic is ignored. It's cold if you don’t have clothes for cold weather if you are in the Arctic. I don’t know why most of the comments here on Jafar’s Return are worse, I thought this one is worse.
