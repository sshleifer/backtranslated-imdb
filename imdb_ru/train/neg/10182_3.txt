Well, just reading the headline will make you think it will be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It all started well, but it got so boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This tells about a mother who so desperately wants her daughter to become a cheerleader, and she will go to great lengths to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is a girl on the way. She always wins the competition, so she pushes mom to "destroy" her. After talking with the "killer", the mother decides that the girl needs a little shabby. Thus, actions are taken, but in the end they catch her. <br /> <br /> The cast is terrible, and the film drags on for too long, and nothing happens. Do not waste your time watching. <br /> <br />
