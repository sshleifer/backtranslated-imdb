We actually watched it twice in the theater, because we could not believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we missed something ... No, that which was missed was missed from the very beginning of pre-production. I actually went back to Robbinâ€™s novel to see if I could find the problem, and found that what I thought was funny and fascinating at the time, now just so much scattered and fuzzy trash. <br /> <br /> So the original problem with the film was to do it at all, and the rest of the train derailment progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photography has the effect of accidentally placing the camera on the inside shots. All the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks very depressed - with the exception of Rein Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unconscious to understand how terrible her game really is. Dialogue is one, long, unshakable nonsense. Scenes do not make sense from second to second, and there is no connection between them. And yet, the film stumbles blindly, convinced that it says something deep. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to even be funny; it's just painful. Gus Van Zant made other good films that I recommend you watch, and I'm glad that he survived (and seems to have learned from) this mess.
