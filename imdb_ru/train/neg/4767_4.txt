I watched this movie, because I liked the plot, a group of strangers is in captivity, trying to figure out how they are related. <br /> <br /> The situation and background were clearly influenced by the first (and best) Saw the film, and although there was not a lot of action, the story moved at a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> There was a comical relief in the form of two quarreling Alpha Males, and it was a pleasant surprise (for me anyway) to see how Melissa Joan Hart was not yet disillusioned with acting skills. <br /> <br /> A few things let me down; 1. Pedophile was strongly characterized, forcing him to start everything, from children to corpses. <br /> <br /> 2. MJH talks about how her policeman “pulled her into it,” when in fact he was the least decent person to be there, he was not known to contribute to the events that led to catch them. <br /> <br /> 3, Ending ..... Which movie just ends in the middle of something going on? There was no resolution, no cliff hangers, no obvious end ... it's just the end. <br /> <br /> And just for that, I lost two stars from my rating. The first 2 points I would have missed, but not the end!
