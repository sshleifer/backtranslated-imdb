Renouncement. The film was just not good. It has a sense of humor, which is 5-year-olds, who will not even giggle. I mean, of course, some parts were funny, but most are not. Lindsay Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer), and she has to work on the best films. The film was supposed to be shown as an original film on the Disney Channel, this is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was well done in this film is music. Nothing like a converted rock soundtrack to beautify your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy Song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I gave ten, 9 of them would be music, and 1 would be a film. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
