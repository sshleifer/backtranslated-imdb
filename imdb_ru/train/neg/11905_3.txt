Having a tendency to repeat, Wenders has been constantly disappointed since he achieved great success with "Paris of Texas". <br /> <br /> “Land of Plenty” is no exception. Taking into account the fact that I was expecting a medium-mediocre film before it entered, Wenders' ambitions always seem to overpower him. Now he is being taken off the ground, his films are heavy and pompous. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I was watching a comedy that mocked Central America or some kind of thriller. Exodus character Dilya quite predictable. Vender’s perseverance in laying many scenes on rock songs is also very annoying. He covered the holes in his script and direction, publishing scenes. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many people will find this film important and resonant, but, to be honest, this clumsy and didactic efforts only speak in a bad direction. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Wenders said that during the filming of "Paris Texas" he was very helpful to Sam Sheppard in writing the script. Yes, it was the best result for Wenders, and now he must understand that he needs a good screenwriter. His films from the past 15 years have been a mess.
