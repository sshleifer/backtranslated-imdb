As carefully as possible, I truly believe that this film is a waste of time. I have not found this “warm, emotionally satisfying” film that others have made. I was bored with music that distracted me from the film. The story was thin, the characters overworked, and the direction of pedestrians. <br /> <br /> Fuy. <br /> <br /> Now I’m going to write a little more about this movie, so I’ll make the minimum 10 line. There is nothing more to say, and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minima, so here. <br /> <br /> A young impatient child finds an emerging talent looking for time with aging, an embittered mentor, despite his father's cartoon homophobia. A mature, embittered mentor, it turns out, drinks a lot and teaches little. conflict arises. Although I don't think this is a spoiler, I added a warning in case someone thinks that too much information is too much. <br /> <br /> Basically, I found the film boring and pretentious. A waste of my time. I honestly do not understand what a small fuss, mainly on this website, about the excellent quality of this film. I think it is really worth avoiding. But as Dennis Miller said: “Maybe I’m wrong.”
