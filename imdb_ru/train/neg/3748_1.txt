... but it just does not work, and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what grounds? There are a few hints here and there, but all the material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch films tend to be intriguing, because they cause a feeling of confusion, but they are very playful. There is some visual sense, there are some plots, characters, ideas, etc. But this is boring and yes, meaningless. Because all that needs to be investigated is either “small”, or too contrived, or simply said earlier in an excellent manner. It's just Lynch is studying DV, and nothing more, so it should be treated like this. 1/10
