I read reviews of this film, and they were generally pretty good, so I thought I should see it. I'm a big fan of frankofilov and feature films, but I believe that this is another case where critics turn something “clever” or “intellectual” into something that it is not. I will be stupid: it contains scenes of sexual perversion that I never wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some serious psychological problems, but I really didn’t want them to be displayed so clearly. The film is, in fact, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a dream, I was beaten off by the last scene with Jennifer Connelly, but it was not at all the disgust and disgust that I felt in this film.
