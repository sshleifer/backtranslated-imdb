Is this the worst episode of Star Trek TOS? Perhaps at least my vote is rated fifth. I mean, this episode has absolutely no crazy meaning. See something that makes you go crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feeling, the music is strengthened, almost forced to reinforce the feeling of distress to the extent that it sucks. Give me a few Klingons, Horns, Tolians, Romulans, higher beings such as Triskelion or anything other than Meduzin, these are very boring aliens who make an episode around. McCoy begins to pronounce his famous phrase "He is dead, Jim." Spock puts on goggles when transporting the ambassador, but Kirk does not. They pass this terrible "barrier" for the third time, as far as I remember, is boring. At the very least, the next episodes of the third season will be “Ghost Pistol”, “Day of the Pigeon” and others that follow him, which will make “Track” worthy of a show for viewing in a syndication format, where he will be interested in people like me, like avid the fans. According to personal observations, Track liked to use the color purple, a kind of pinkish-purple, such as when they are in the corridor outside the compartment, the gangway, which is usually gray, is now purple. We never had a purple bridge, but it is interesting to see it, I noticed it in several episodes, it was made using a light filter and it works very well, but in this episode in the ship’s corridor is rather lame.
