I was really looking forward to seeing Nana after Renoir’s amazing debut Whirlpool of Fate. I read that Nana was generally considered his best silent film, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it was like a huge step back. <br /> <br /> Katherine Hessling is the main problem of this film. Her acting excellence surpasses even the silent film. Her game is more similar to what one would expect in a film from early teens, and not from the late 20s. She usually has the same face that reminds me (excuse me) of someone with pain in constipation. It was also very hard to believe that any man would fall in love with this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her. <br /> <br /> The film was also shot for a long time, camera work was uninteresting (except for shooting the races), and the installation was boring. The story reminded me of Pandora Pabst’s box. It is interesting to compare them, because between these films only 3 years. Pandora's box just clogs in every level where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This film is intended only for Renoir, or for very serious fans of silent films.
