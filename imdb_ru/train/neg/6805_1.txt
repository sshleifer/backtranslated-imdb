I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago ... Yes, I still can not believe what I was watching. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the worst movie ever. If I listed all the flaws in the film, this review would have taken me a lot of suggestions. (Very funny flaws, because it’s so bad) <br /> <br /> You should be amazed at the commando skills assigned to save the plane. they didn't even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and I don’t understand how the director wanted him to be a hero, but he is zero .. <br /> <br /> Of course, landing will be the main drawbacks 747, for which you only need 3 or 4 tips from the guy in the gear to land the plane ... surprisingly .. as well as dead bodies that had almost no blood .. <br /> <br /> But I highly recommend to see this film, because it is very interesting to see how badly something can get
