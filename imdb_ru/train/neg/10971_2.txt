How Irish critics are delighted with this film is beyond my power. Overplayed by a regular group of Irish actors who are drawn out for every Irish film. A terrible scenario, with forced fads of character (brown sauce). Romance of all the bad in Dublin. The attitude of "oh, this is a dump, but of course, it's still great." Many tidbits exclusively for the American audience (the supermarket boss and his terribly forced phrase) And the nail in the coffin was the character of Colm Mini. The great actor forced to play this role, which could write a five year old child. Suitable material. The best in this film is Farrell, and it's bad when you have to say it. Well, at least he didn't put on his terrible American accent. Warn international audience: stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You will be better. Antract lane
