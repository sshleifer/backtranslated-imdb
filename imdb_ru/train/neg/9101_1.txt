This film was like the Disney Channel after dark. Remove the language and the themes “Are we not disobedient,” and you will have interactive and plot devices that insult the intellect of anyone who does not describe “Saved by a bell” as high-quality television. The dialogue, so ridiculous and obviously dirty, you might think that the script was the result of locking Aaron Spelling and Joe Estershas in the room with orders to create an amalgam of every bad script everyone has ever tried to create. If this was the intention of Roger Camble, the mission is accomplished.
