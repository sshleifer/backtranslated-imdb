I am usually a bit of a fan of films about the bad eighties and early nineties, which are now involved ... but this film is so incredibly awful that it was a real test of endurance. Guys dress up like girls to death - but never so pretentiously. Corey Chaim's work was terrible, as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. It does not have the redemptive qualities, even if you are a fan of the No. 1 actor / actress in this piece of garbage - stay away!
