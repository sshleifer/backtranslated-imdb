I would not call it terrible, but in this film nothing shines, and it is burdened with some kind of incredibly serious plot development. Everything starts well, but after the main hit is made, it turns into a long storyline around a young girl who is not irresistible, and some fighting scenes that are the theater of the absurd unreal. For example, at the airport there is a long firefight, in which all lighting is stroboscopic. No explanation for this. How plausible is it that in the storage area at the airport the lights will be confused to burn and turn off, and that is enough for Snipes to make his incredible escape? This is one of the too few action scenes, accentuated by senselessly stretched scenes that are simply not able to draw them into false faith. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole premise is that the US CIA team can shoot this place, but get away with it, saying to the British "national security." This trick is based on a stereotype that is far from reality, to be satisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are much better action movies. Better formulated, better done. Sometimes it's funny, but the bone just lacks meat, and after a while it becomes boring, which should not happen in a good action movie.
