I really want people to really make it funny when making comedies. This is a movie that you can watch, but there is nothing special about it. After viewing, you will say that everything is in order. It was not boring to watch, but the audience was not joking to laugh. Entertainment should mean that you actually get more than good. story. This film wanted to be Tootsie, but instead it failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 out of 10.
