I saw this movie when I was much younger, and I thought it was funny. I saw it again last week and you can guess the result. Some funny pieces in it, very few and too long. The beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want to get a full b-film, this is a good choice, but donâ€™t expect too much from the alien size of the dwarf
