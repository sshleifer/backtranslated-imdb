First of all, let's look at a few things here: a) I AM an anime fan - it has always been this way (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer all the time in preschool institutions). b) I really like some B-movies because they are funny. c) I like Godzilla films - a lot. <br /> <br /> Continuing when the movie first appears, it seems that this will be your regular B-movie, up to the crappy FX, but all of a sudden - BOOM! anime is coming! This is when the film goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY down the slope. <br /> <br /> Animation is VERY bad and cheap, even worse than I remember from the SPEED RACER, for croissants! In fact, this is so cheap, one of the few scenes from the film that I remember vividly is when a group of children run out of school ... and these are the same children again and again! FX is terrible too; dinosaurs look worse than godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action and animation is not organized, the dialogues and voices (especially English dub, which I watched) were terrible, and I asked my dad to remove the tape from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that helped me survive was to joke and comment, for example, robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). To be honest, this is the only way to enjoy this film with ease and to relive it at the same time. <br /> <br /> Damn, I plan to show it to another otaku buddy from my friends on Halloween on B- Movie Night. Since it is stupid, it is rather painful to watch and at the same time unintentionally ridiculous, I give this film a 3/10, an improvement over 0.5 / 10, which I was originally going to give. <br /> <br /> (According to my rating scale: 3/10 means pretty boring and bad. Being funny to count to three, if you don’t find a way to make fun of it, then it will be as funny as the score to 15. )
