One of the other commentators mentioned that they were almost out. If I had not been with my wife who wanted to stay, I would have left. This is also a shame, because I think it could be a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst adapted scenarios I have ever seen. It starts nowhere and nowhere (I would say that it does not go anywhere fast, but it really does not go anywhere slowly ... painfully slowly). From time to time there are hints that something interesting can happen, or that under one of the characters there is potentially some depth, but that is all we get - hints. There is not a single win or revelation in the whole film. Not that I needed a tricky plot for fun ... I love a good learning of a wandering character just like the next indie lover. But these characters add up to nothing. Throughout the film, you don't care what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost begin to hope that they will die, because, at least, death may be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable, that you think that this in itself will be convincing but it is not. Instead of quirky, noir-escaping characters acting hard-horned, you just immediately know what it is: a group of talented but erroneous actors, raising their eyebrows pensively, reading strange dialogues without a hint of the appropriate context. All this for two long, painfully slow hours. Awful.
