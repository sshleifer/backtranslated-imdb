This “movie” is one of the most horrible things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent fabrication. <br /> <br /> Shake the camera and force its actors The adoption of sullen hands is not considered the “direction” that this film needs in droves. It was not that everything was great in the writing, but rather we had a whole bunch of completely artificial characters, managed in the same artificial way (pseudo-documented "style" appreciated by those who do not know how to manage). <Br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it was made cynically to attract critics who do not know anything about making a film (and this is the majority of them). <br /> <br /> Just awful. It says a lot about Sundance and what became possible when Victor Vargas was introduced there.
