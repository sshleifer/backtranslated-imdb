Well, I removed it from the TV and missed the very beginning. The film was about 10 seconds from the title (I guess), so if something happened before I missed it. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Mark Hammill is in this, I have not seen him. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis, and, obviously, Stephen King, who did a terrible guard job at the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Alice Krieg looks great, except for scenes where she has a cat face or is completely alien. - <br /> <br /> Even with the introductory names, it was not possible to explain what lunatics are and where they come from. From the title, I assume that these are cat bipeds, which live by extracting life force from people. I guess they live a long time, and these two, perhaps the last of its kind. <br /> <br /> Add to this a very large dose of incest (Yes! I also thought it was a little suspicious), changing shape, killer cats and invisibility, and you have lunatics. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad story, in which there are no real explanations of the main 2 characters and too many cameos to try to distract from the simple fact that it was not sufficiently explained to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
