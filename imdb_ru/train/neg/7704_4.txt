Well, there is no real story to talk about, it’s just a reason to show some scenes of extreme violence and unreasonable sex (which can sometimes be funny, but it’s not). What else can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is inventive, and there is a cool scene where two characters fall from a skyscraper (one must be a few miles high), but in general there is not that much to recommend “Kite”. Check it out if you like, but you will not miss much if you miss this one ...
