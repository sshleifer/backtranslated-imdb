It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually praise any movie for some aspect of its production, but the highly annoying behavior of more than half of the characters prevented me from appreciating any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> The most common conclusion was that the guy who designed the building was guilty of an avalanche destroying it. Er ok. <br /> <br /> In addition, an attempt to ski in the style of avalanche-like slalom will not work. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. Alas, it is here. As mentioned earlier, the innate folly and utter nonsense of some characters are ridiculous. Indoors with a limited amount of oxygen, a four-year-old child can tell you that kindling a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> In any case, about 5 minutes of the film justifies itself and receives a certain rating. However, if you have at least some intelligence, it will also be difficult for you to perceive much of this film. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that so many quality stories remain unproduced, and yet someone will pay for such things to make it happen. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? In order to catch you on the hook, you must be careful to see the latest techniques of avalanche fighting. Absolutely priceless.
