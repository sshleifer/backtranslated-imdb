Anyone who loved the two classic novels of Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film. All the magic and romance were modernized from his original story about a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious elderly woman, and gave them “three” in return. Three what? Not three wishes, but three trips in a shaky elevator in the 1800s ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is “Time is Above”. The second is all on time.
