While William Tent can always make me smile in everything he appears (and I especially love him as Danny Crane at Boston Legal), in general, this is a show about the glitz and the girls dancing, how they scream And jump up and down. <Br /> <br /> There is no Millionaire intelligence, no “Deal” talent, and “No Deal” in it. <br /> <br /> This is a show about dancing and stupid things that need to be filled with time. <br /> <br /> I watched this, of course, just to check. I watched it for more than 45 minutes, and then I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best part is William Shatner dancing on stage. He screams !!! Unfortunately, this show is NOT MADE. <br /> <br /> This is a given
