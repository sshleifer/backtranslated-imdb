In this film, in particular, “SlapChop” Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and filmed) and Joey Buttafuoko are not exactly names that shout about “quality”. And with upbeat parodies like “Supermodels taking the dump” (that's exactly what it looks like), the guy who robs the sperm bank (“Rifmer”), the necrophilia with the rotting corpse, the black market germs (with the guy who draws they must be from a can), lots and lots of funny jokes, a parody of a giant phallus, a superhero and forced abortions. The parody is terribly unfunny (for example, "Batman and Reamer"), the game is not good enough to be considered amateur, and the film is rude just to be rude ... and stupid. I sincerely believe that a group of 8-year-olds could EASY make a more funny film with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this film led to Vince’s suit against “Safoot Shot” against Scientologists. Honestly, I do not know for whom to root in this case !!! Apparently, he claimed that in some way Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank the film. It doesn’t matter that the film from the very beginning to the end is disgusting rubbish and 99% unfunny (for comparison, Ebola is funnier) ... and this is the best thing I can say about the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, that Bobby Lee (from Mad TV) is wearing a diaper and participating in a silent fake porn movie. Surprisingly, his career was able to overcome this.
