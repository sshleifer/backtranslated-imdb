This film, in fact, represents two hours, during which the character Defoe drinks himself - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you did not have enough evidence or knowledge of the characters to be surprised. It was just a dark, sad waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Defoe is a great actor. Peter Stormare is a great actor. But this film just sucks. Slow does not make a movie bad, it was just bad. The sketchy plot, mixed with artistic sketches of anamorphic details, is not cohesively combined for the plot, with the exception of highlighting some blood, which is illustrated from several points of view, finally, at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it puts me to sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and I had to review the film - which was even more disappointing.) <br /> <br /> As a rule, I donâ€™t like to give negative comments or feedback on the work of others, even when they suck, but this film justified. It is a pity that these great actors are ashamed of this end result.
