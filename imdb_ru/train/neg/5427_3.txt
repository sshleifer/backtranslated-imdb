A typical gothic chick (Rainbow Harvest, similar to Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) meets people who, in her opinion, offended her, with the help of an old haunted mirror she finds in a new house that she and her mother (horror) support, Karen Black, the only remotely good thing about this parody) buy. The action is rather ridiculously bad (especially when the Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror), and there is no panic or expectation to be had. This film inexplicably spawned in this way 3 sequels each a little more fierce than the previous one. People looking for a similar thematic, but far superior cinematic scene, it would be nice to just look for the episode "Friday the 13th: Serial", where the caller finds an old damn compact mirror. It's 40 minutes colder than this whole franchise in 4 films. <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spredling provides mandatory T & A
