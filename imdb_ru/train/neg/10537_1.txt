Well, what can you say about the adaptation of Barbara Cartland? <br /> <br /> There are amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they are clearly raising money. <br /> <br /> Lizette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in two other Carland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks confused, respectively) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the “watchable” adaptation of Carteland, Bonham Carter is the one to follow (“Danger of Hearts” - what a name!). Gilbert is a weak link in this, but Bonham Carter is quite beautiful and, of course, can really act, and the rest of the actors play him all the way with tongues in his cheek (Edward Fox and Diane Rigg)
