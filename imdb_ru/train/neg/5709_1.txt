Nick Cage is Gates, the treasure hunter (oh, excuse me ... "treasure defender", whatever that means), originating from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors learned about the whereabouts of a huge treasure, which our founding fathers, most, if not all Masons, decided to hide, because they simply did not want to finance their independence so much. <br /> <br /> The first hint is in a long-lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his team, consisting of financier Jan (Sean Bean), the film Dork Riley (Justin Bart from the immortal "Gigli") and a pair of faceless lackeys, are included in the cargo hold of the ship. They immediately pour tons of gunpowder all over the floor, but this does not matter. Finally, they find a clue (a skeleton hangs over it), and it turns out the tube with the inscription ... on it. It seems, as it were, something like. Do not ask me to explain. <br /> <br /> This is a mystery, and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly dissatisfied with the fact that he did not find real treasures, Gates wanders around, mumbling to himself about the meaning of the mystery, in this frozen cargo hold, while the team just stands with a relaxed jaw. I mean, come on. Someone had to say a little loudly about his disappointment at having traveled all the way to the exciting Arctic and found nothing interesting, but they just stand there when Gates enters his own world, solving a riddle. <br /> <br /> The next key is the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is shocked. Different characters give a completely obvious exposure (get used to it). All this leads to the fact that Ian lackey pulls a gun to Gates, and the powder explodes as a result of the big bang. (Oh, that's why they poured all the powder! Ha! !!) Ian and his henchmen run away, and Gates and the Cinema Riley go nine miles at sub-zero temperatures to the Inuit village to stop them. <br /> <br /> To stop them, Gates concludes after an attempt by the FBI and Super Hierarchist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley must steal it themselves. Then Riley tells Gates in great detail why they cannot steal the Declaration, because it is so protected by metal and laser eyes and high-tech security, blah blah. Then Gates tells Riley that there is an opportunity to steal him from the storage room. Gates asks, does Riley know what a “conservation room” is? "The place where they make jams and jellies?" I am not kidding; this is the actual line. Bart is also not joking. So, Riley does all this research on the Library of Congress and the Archives and on water and sewage, fercryinoutloud, but does not know what a Preservation Room is. This largely indicates the level at which this scenario is located. <br /> <br /> In order to make the rest of this short plot, Gates actually runs away with D of I, in a ridiculous hack that could only happen in a movie. (I also hate how they portray the technology of computer monitors in films — full of incredible and impractical graphics and fonts.) Abigail Chase ends up following them for convenience and as an obvious corner of “love interest”. At some point, three of them, fleeing from the law, very loudly discuss all their plans in a clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates' father, performed by dispatcher John Voight, leads the good and bad guys to the great entertainment of Indiana Jones, located under New York. It is strange that the underground builders have not found this thing. Gates and Gates Sr. lead Ian in pursuit of a wild goose. Ian believes that they are at an impasse and leaves them there. However, after they left, Riley asks how they are going to get out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... oh god ... <br /> <br /> ... presses the button and the door opens. No, I'm serious. A button, as they might have a toilet in an office building. Good thing he knew where it was. Anyway, after another sharp turn, they find this huge treasure room (remember, this is all under Manhattan!), Filled with all sorts of historical gold things. Riley gets a really stupid line. Again. And FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgives them, arrests Sean Bean and allows two carefree heroes to marry. <br /> <br /> I think that for any viewer it would be difficult to ignore the entire exposure, logic jumps and stereotypical characters for a very long time. Although part of his exposure includes pleasant lessons of history, inserted into the conversation at random moments. I wish there were more such conversations in my life.
