It must be the worst piece of trash I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger - smoothie? He looked deformed. I wish I knew that he and Naomi Watts are things in real life, because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life, wondering what she saw in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando bloom - heartthrob? I cannot say that I agree with a quivering beard and deer in the light of headlights. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was her usual fairy tale character, but Jeffrey Rush looked like he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /> <br /> Should I be sorry for bankers and murderers? This is far from Butch Cassidy, which was actually an entertaining film. It was trite, cliché and boring. We stayed only because we were sure that everything would be better. This is not true. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally funny. Heath and his gang hide in the border hotel, and women and children die because of their presence. It's not funny. But it was funny when they left the hotel in armor, because all we could think about was the Black Knight of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say: “I will bite your foot off!” We howl with laughter, like several other perverted members of the audience. When we left, almost everyone talked about the fact that the film was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I may not have paid in cash to see this disaster (preview), but it certainly was not free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never return.
