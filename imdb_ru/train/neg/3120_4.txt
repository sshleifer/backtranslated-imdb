I really didnâ€™t expect much from the Night Listener, and I never heard of it until I saw the cover in a video store. However, the film is very effective when it comes to creating suspense and tension. Sometimes it takes a little while, but it actually helps you to wonder what will happen, and more importantly: when. As the movie progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is drawn into a kind of cat-and-mouse game to the extent that he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and the existence of a 14-year-old outraged child that no one has ever shown personally. The Night Listener is an interesting story that helps create tension throughout the entire film, and you are largely unaware of who lies and what is real. However, in the end, it is disappointing and does not correspond to the potential that he could have. This does not give you a detailed or believable explanation about the other main character, which would be useful and interesting.
