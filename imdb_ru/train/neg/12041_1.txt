Well, for starters? This is definitely one of the worst films I've ever paid good money for. I will not comment on the story itself, it is a wonderful classic, but here it looks like a soap opera. To begin with, the acting, with the exception of Eric Bana, is the quality of the series. I have always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor in “Brave and Beautiful” makes him ashamed. The camera action does not help either. How he lingers when he thinks it just brings me back to the days of Brooke Forrester in the lab! Peter O'Toole has either really bad plastic surgery, or he desperately needs it. In any case, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And at the end of my comments, Diane Kruger is a sweet girl, but she is definitely not Helen from Troy. Peterson should have chosen Saffron Burroughs for this role, since Elizabeth Taylor would have been rather erroneous by now.
