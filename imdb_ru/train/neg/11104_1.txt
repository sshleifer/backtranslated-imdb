I'm not one of those people who just go online after watching a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. If you doubt me, please check out my other reviews. However, for the first time in my life I saw such a horrible film that I wanted to write about how bad everything was before it ended. <br /> <br /> I LOVE bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Killing, Jeepers Creepers and the worst horror films were good. However, I can not say anything good about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically absent. If someone, reading my review, wastes his money to see it, he can understand for himself what the plot may be, but I advise you that nickel will cost more than watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> The game is bad. <br /> <br /> Two attractive sides are attractive, but that's all there is. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not the type to ruin a movie for anyone, but I INVITE someone to write me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to get my opinion on this movie before he spends it on him penny. I'll tell you everything. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies, I love horrors and new inventive movies. I even like horror movies like Hostel (some reviewers claimed it looked like, but obviously they only thought about it because Roger Barth was in this and Hostel 2). But it may be the most useless, stupid and stupid movie number 1 ever filmed. <br /> <br /> And before ignoring this review, he comes from a man who not only sat out the whole of the House of the Dead premiere, but actually bought a copy of it.
