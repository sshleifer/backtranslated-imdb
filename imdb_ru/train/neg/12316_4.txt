Director Jonathan Lynn made some underrated comedies in the past, such as Greed and Hint. This is not one of them. More like the movie "Police Academy" than on his inspiration, he starred in the role of Steve Martin in the old role of Phil Silvers in the role of army sergeant, who always pulls fraudsters under the nose of his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits a base that has decided to catch Bilko on the spot. Nothing special happens, really. This is all pretty boring. This is not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze out a couple of laughter thanks to the enormous effort, but they are better than this, and it is rather painful to see how they work with such a delicate material.
