I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years took place in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Moderator Steve Martin was the wittiest: “I saw teams helping Michael Moore in the trunk of his limousine "and" I'd rather not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with the head of a poodle in my bed. "<br /> <br /> 2) Surprise winners: nobody invited Adrien Brody to be the best actor (Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski is the best director (real mockery), but they won <br /> <br /> Last year’s ceremony at The wait was not so bad, but there were few surprises, and I was glad to see RETURNS OF THE KING win awards, even if they were not the best in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but what blew the BBC coverage was that Jonathan Ross gathered some of his friendly companions and pretended that they were cheerful when they were but that is why when I heard Sky cover British television, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to make references but instead we ended up with Jamie Tixston and Sharon Osborne! Oh dear, if British television desperately needs film critics (obviously, they are), I am sure that Bob Mu and Theo Robertson will gladly fly to Los Angeles to express their honest opinion about the winners and losers. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock wasn’t that bad, but he wasn’t Steve Martin, although the place looked like a gym with seats in it! Not a very brilliant arena in my opinion. The main problem I faced at the ceremony was the format with the "minor" Oscars, who handed out to the winners, who were sitting in their seats! There is no such thing as a “minor” Oscar, and just because the prize is awarded for the best animated short film or the best costume design, they are also deserved as the best picture or the best director. All winners must be admitted to the podium. Which group of arrogant snobs becomes the Academy, and I quite agree with the comments that this format is shameful, and if there were no surprises, this could be the most terrible ceremony in history. Regarding the awards themselves <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett. Not a big surprise for the competitive category <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman. There are no special complaints, as Freeman is one of America’s greatest living characters. <br /> <br /> Best actor - Jamie Fox. The most predictable reward of the night. Yawn <br /> <br /> Best actress - Hilary Swank. A big surprise, as everyone thought that Annette Benning was going to win simply because of academic policy, but Swank deserved it and delivered the best speech of the night. <br /> <br /> Best Director - Clint Eastwood. Big surprise, as everyone thought that Scorsese would receive the award simply because he never received it. Actually, I am glad about it, because if he didn’t deserve it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he didn’t deserve it for AVIATOR <br /> <br /> Best film - MILLION DOLLARS. Again, another serious surprise, since everyone thought the academy would share awards for best direction and best picture, while I thought AVIATOR’s Hollywood friendly conspiracy would have made it a dead testimony for the best picture, while controversial The MDB subject would have turned many Voters <br /> <br /> These awards, perhaps, illustrate that this year voters decided to ignore Oscar’s policy and genuinely present awards to people who deserve it, something they haven’t done in the past, I have in mind BEAUTIFUL MIND, beating ILC RINGS for God's sake! And for a long time the academy can vote with their heads instead of their hearts.
