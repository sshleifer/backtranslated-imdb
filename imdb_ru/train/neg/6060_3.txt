There is this girl and she is running in the forest, but she is in the clinic of this woman, and she wants to have an abortion. Her dad is on the street in the van, and he is all mad at this. The entire episode takes place inside and outside the abortion clinic. I am not a supporter of choice, but I wanted to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw the child come out, and he went into a corner. The part where they did the ultrasound was also pretty funny. I was very sorry for poor dad in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter, and I could not blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him at the end or what happened to another father and daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed too much, and instead of this episode, I would advise to watch "Lift me." It was not the worst episode, but it was not so great.
