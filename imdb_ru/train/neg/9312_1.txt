The worst movie on earth. I donâ€™t even know where to start, but I hope I can save the other person from punishing myself with this film. When it comes to action and lighting, this movie looks like bad porn without sex. The actors are one of the worst I've ever seen, and they could not have been worse, even if they tried to ridicule the movie completely. The film must have had a record low budget, which, I am sure, was spent almost exclusively on the cover of the film. This film became a joke with my friends and became the standard for comparing other trash movies. I would like to point out that no other film even begins to compare. I feel personally responsible for offering me and my friend to watch this film, and I am surprised that she still considers me a friend after the torment that I experienced. Do not watch this movie!
