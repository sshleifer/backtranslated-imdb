I had high hopes for Troy, and I was so disappointed. The film was directed so strongly that my stomach ached. The move was so slow, the dialogue was ridiculous and the film - not to mention the good fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow. <br /> <br /> And why, oh, why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to match “consumer approval”. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years, and Achilles was killed by Paris outside the walls of Troy with an arrow on his ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story as this one has turned into soap. <br /> <br /> And don't even turn me on to the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was a woman for whom the war was waged, and did not even look as if they both were very concerned about the other. No sparks, no emotions, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say that in the films, the defense of Brad Pitt, Eric Ban and Peter O'Toole played very well with a bad script, but this is not enough to save this terrible film <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the budget of 200 million pounds has gone? Maybe on all the trees they used for funeral pyres - where did they get all these trees? <br /> <br /> I am so disappointed that it hurts.
