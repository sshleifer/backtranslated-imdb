This is not enough - this film is terrible. I’ve seen old Christopher Lee / Fu Manch movies, I’m familiar with the characters and their serial origins, but it’s still just monstrous. Nevertheless, the genius of Peter Sellers still shines through his portrait of Neyland Smith, with an echo of sadness, tragedy and power boiling through the stoic facade; This performance, which I put on a par with the image of Peter Cushing Van Helsing, but in the tenth of the cumulative time showing all Cushing films "Dracula". If the film were filmed in a more serial way, like BUBBA HO-TEP, as part of the 1960s AVENGERS television show, this could be something special. If you are the most complete Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, this is what you need to see, but this is a pass for everyone else.
