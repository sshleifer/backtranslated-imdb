RIVER CRIMSON is one of the most over-intense, excessive, all-embracing riots I have ever seen in France. There is nothing worse than a French production trying to surpass films made in Hollywood, and CR is a great example of such a horrible horror film / action movie / playmate. I almost stopped him halfway, because I knew that it meant nothing except the French guys trying to show off. <br /> <br /> The film starts as promising as some kind of extensive horror film, but quickly switches genres from horror to action, to x-files and to buddy films, which, after all, CR is all and also nothing. There are so many clich√©s in it that at some point I thought that all this is a comedy. The painful dialogue and these silent pauses with the gradual disappearance and disappearance just at the right moments of presentation made me moan. I thought that only films made in Hollywood used this battered technique. <br /> <br /> The chase scene, when Vincent Cassel is running after the killer, is so overstrained and overworked that it is almost that beautiful. The climax at the top of the mountain, with a silly revelation about the killer (s) with Kassel and Renault playing "buddies" such as Nolte and Murphy at 48 HRS, completely undermined that little trust in the film by that time. <br /> It is hard to believe that THE CRIMSON RIVERS director also shot GOTHIKA, which, although it had its own share of problems, did not even come close to the horror of this confused, confused film.
