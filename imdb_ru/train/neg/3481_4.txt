May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say this, but anyone who is smart enough to read it will probably be able to figure out every turn of the plot from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not the movie I like. I did not hate it, as some films that insult your intellect, but it all seemed too predictable in its wandering to the necessary happy ending. Of course, there were funny pieces along the way, but few were original. At least it didn't work. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are in fact the only redeeming feature. All the others are cardboard cutouts, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who must have done this as a favor to someone. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a harmless, but not inspirational 90 minutes.
