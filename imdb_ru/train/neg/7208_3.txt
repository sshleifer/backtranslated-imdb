I grew up as a child when I watched the old cartoon "Inspector Gadget." It was like Get Smart for kids. Awkward chest can not solve a single case, and all the work is done by walking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I heard that the live fighter was decent, so I checked it in the library. I rented this movie for free and felt that I had to pay to see it. <br /> <br /> Broderick is not at all like the actor Don Adams, who was the voice of the gadget. In his voice, everything was wrong. The girl who played Penny didn't look like a cartoon penny. She is a brunette, where in the animated version there was a blonde with pigtails. But she does a decent job, considering what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman performs well in the role of Chef Quimby. Saldi, he never hid in a strange place and did not receive explosive messages, accidentally thrown to him by the Gadget. <br /> <br /> Mobile phone gadget was wrong. This has never been said on the show, and this is good. Why would they do that? <br /> <br /> The gadget was too smart in this movie. In the show, he was a complete idiot. Here he was halfway decent intelligence. It would work better if he were an idiot. <br /> <br /> In addition, he completely cut out a key phrase. Borderick says "Wowser". This should always be the "Wowsers". Sounds silly without 's'. I was upset when they showed a preview, and they did not have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> ONLY decent jokes were during the credits. Bad for Claw is in front of a support group to recover minions / helpers. In the audience sit Mr. T, Richard Keil, known as "Jaws of Bond", similar to Herve Villahez, Odjob, Kato and many others. This is the only part I laughed at. <br /> <br /> Another at the end, where Penny checks the clock of the gadgets and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams voiced the dog, saying that â€œThere is no brain now. Please leave your name at the sound of woof. Woof. Of course, this is not funny, but simply funny nostalgia for Adams in the film. He should have at least voiced a stupid car. <br /> <br /> Children will like it, everyone over 13 years old. <br /> <br />
