False defendants, chasing skirts buddies John Wayne (like John Scott) and Eddie Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) change their identity to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones." Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones." Mr. Chandler is supposed to be “Rev. Smith,” but Wayne calls him “Dr. Smith.” None of them has ever been as interesting as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; although Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, in terms of a career. Pretty blonde Mary Kornman (like Ann), who grew up in her band in “Our Gang”, has a great interest in Wayne. She and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne. If you are not a fan of the low-budget films of John Wayne of the 1930s, this film will not work for you.
