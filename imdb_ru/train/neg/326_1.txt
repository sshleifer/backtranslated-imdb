This early film by Adam Sandler can be compared to his comic life in the same period in 1989. The constant recognition of his latent comic genius as a hero and frustration with humorous material seems to come from Sandler rather than from the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as Big Dad or even trite Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler has not yet found a way to express himself consistently, successfully, and amusingly when this film was shot, much like his character. Most of the "jokes" of the film come from Sandler, who talks to himself, usually because of his unrecognized comic talent and beating himself, because he is too ugly and can't get women. The film is also difficult to watch, because it does not treat himself as a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the audience throughout the film, often referring to low-budget or questionable film content. The film ended up awkward and awkward to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I even saw this film after it ended, fearing that if they knew more about it, it would ruin Sandler's career. Pass this in the video store, I rented it for free, and it was still a waste of time.
