Absolute trash. The reason this is so terrible is not because it deviates from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The alleged star did nothing to solve the case — and no one else actually did — it was just a routine police job. Absolutely tedious. <br /> <br /> You sat until the very end, hoping for a turnaround - and you had nothing but a huge sense of frustration. <br /> <br /> There was so much potential to have a relative in apparent kidnapping. Can a lieutenant’s personal involvement finally cloud his opinion? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs that a stranger did it. But, undoubtedly, such a genius as Lt C, due to constant conversation with the offended husband, would gradually discover a devilish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room, while the groom in the mask surprises the bride, hides the body and then throws up thin tips. It might be good. It was a waste of time.
