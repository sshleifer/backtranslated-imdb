There were a lot of unknown movies or movies with bad reviews that I really liked. It was not one of them. <br /> <br /> He was excessive and used camera methods that made me feel like I was watching a TV show. It was ridiculously predictable, and most of the film began, and then you asked, “So what?”. As soon as I decided not to take the film too seriously and watch it from a purely banal point of view, it became more pleasant. This is one movie that could be on MST3000 if it was still included.
