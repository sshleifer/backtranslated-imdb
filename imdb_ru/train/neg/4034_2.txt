Oh my God. good composition, but writing and directing is an art, and writing wit and direct wit is a bit difficult. Even making a good comedy, you have to choose the right time and moment. I do not put it all aside in parts where I laughed out loud, but it was very rare. The focus was on fast free dialogue, which annoyed some people in the film. Reading the script in your head may sound great, but putting it on camera is a completely different task. A manual camera work gives energy to several parts of the film. The general direction was good, but the script was not so significant for me, but I am sure that you read the script in your head, it will sound good. Sorry.
