Whenever I make a list of the worst films I've ever seen, this film is always on it. He has no redemptive qualities. It was necessary to have the will to sort it all out, and I would rather shed my own blood than be forced to sit again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? Let me tell you the story of my trip, to see it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to the midnight show on Saturday evening. I was the only one in the theater myself and a handful of loud, noisy, rather uncontrollable teenagers sitting somewhere behind me. Obviously, they had a good time on Saturday evening and came to this “comedy” to laugh. Before the beginning of the film, during the preview, they laughed, joked and commented loudly, having a great old time. It was extremely annoying; if they had continued their unbridled enthusiasm in the film itself, I would have said something, but I felt tolerance and sympathy for their energetic fun, so I let it go. And they calmed down as soon as the film began. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because this alleged “comedy” can be judged by the way it affected not only me, but also this riotous heap. <br /> <br /> For the entire time of the movie, no one in the theater laughed. Never. Not me, not noisy children. Absolute silence, except for the soundtrack. And when the film ended and the lights came on, we all, all of us, slowly left the theater in a slow, gloomy, absolute silence. It could be a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was the effect this “comedy” had. Not laughter, not pleasure, but absolute depression. It was a depressing, depressing film, and not at all funny. Propaganda, condescending, depressive, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I believe that Mel Blau's "Blazing Saddles" will be on the short list for the Funniest Movie Ever. I'm still amazed that the same gentleman may well be responsible for the film “Least Funny”. <br /> <br /> In short: if you feel too happy, turn this film around; otherwise do not say that I did not warn you.
