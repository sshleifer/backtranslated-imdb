After watching The Bodyguard last night, I felt obliged to write a review of it. <br /> <br /> This could be a pretty decent movie, if it weren't for the awful camera work. It was outside of annoying. All angles were wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fighting. Close-ups were even awful. <br /> <br /> In this story, Sonny Chiba hires herself as a bodyguard for anyone who wants to lead him to the top of the drug trade. Judy Lee, who is never frank with Chiba, approaches him. Lee's involvement in the drug business is deeper than Chiba thought, as the crowd and another gang of thugs are after her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, and, despite the terrible dubbing, it could be a good movie. Given the best direction and editing, I'm sure it would be a classic Kung Fu movie. In fact, this is more like another stupid fighter of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Note: the introductory part contains a quote familiar to the fans of "Pulp Fiction" and then continues to study at the karate school in Times Square, which is in no way connected with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
