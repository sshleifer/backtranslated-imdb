Considering how much money was invested in this film, you can expect more from the story as a whole. Perhaps this is the most useless movie I've ever watched. There was no real advancement of anything. Character development, minimal. Perhaps the advancement of the plot. There is no enjoyment. I'm not sure which items they even tried to do. If you want to watch a movie where the terrorists are good guys, the American CIA is bombarding everything that doesn’t fit our mind, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see something like a storyboard development followed by death. For those of us who understand that we don’t need to kill a good guy to make a point, we’ll stick to other films. Thus, it was a terrible attempt to “hide the plot for a person to think” movie “Ocean 11”, because not only did you not know what was going on, but none of those who shot this film did it either. Home Alone 3 was the best cinematic work.
