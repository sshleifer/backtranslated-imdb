It seems that in "Science Fiction" you have this periodic return to the strange phenomenon that appears in long serial novels. It is here that the first novel (“Dune”, “Ender's Game”) amazes you with its revolutionary history. Sequels, however, take this universe and lead you along the garden path to any new small social or political commentary that the author wants to make. The Matrix is ​​finally the equivalent of a movie. The matrix stands alone, like an interesting film with a strange turn in the middle. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors will take you through what should be one of the most painful monologues and inactivity sequences in SciFi. While the visual effects remain just as stunning from the first films, new character studies fail in the future. Watch for sweets, but not for deep reflections. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 registered on this beautiful website.
