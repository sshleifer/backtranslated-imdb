Note: I could not bring myself to write a constructive review of the prom. It is simply impossible to do. Instead, I looked at what I was thinking when I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> What I was thinking while watching the prom: <br /> <br /> - I'm so tired of those dreams where these carefully thought-out deaths will take place only for the main character, so that wake up right before she bites him. Of course, when I say "carefully thought-out deaths," I mean slit throat wounds or bumps in the stomach. Wasn't all this “just a dream” destroyed by Dallas? Speaking about this, I wonder if a couple of strokes in the intestines lead to immediate death. <br /> <br /> - The film is only ten minutes later, and I can already count the horror clichés on two hands. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Even after meeting the main character's boyfriend, I am convinced that he will die. Anyone want to bet? <br /> <br /> - The killer in this film is a teacher who is obsessed with the main character, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think that Donna is a terrible name for the main character in a horror movie?) He spends three years in a high-security prison before breaking out, and finds Donna to celebrate her graduation ceremony in high school. Although there is no taste, I seriously wonder who would have spent so much time chasing someone as boring as Donna. <br /> <br /> - In schools, you can spend proms in hotels, and they do not follow the students. Apparently, students may well buy a hotel room and go in and out at their discretion. I believe that if this plot was not in place, there would have been 90 minutes in the film when people were bored from their heads and randomly biting dust whenever they went to the bathroom. I believe that compromise for their excitement is my complete boredom with everything. I already played “count the pieces of chewing gum under the seat” and “guess how much money I have in my wallet”, and I'm only at the 20-minute mark. How else will I have fun? <br /> <br /> -Note: Do not forget about milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> Dear screenwriter: You used enough false fears to get through this movie and any other horror remake this year. <br /> <br /> - The 1980 version of the film was not so good, but compared to this remake it looked like Citizen Kane or at least Godfather. There was Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her many horror films after Halloween, and at the end he had a little "turn". I miss Jamie Lee. I wish she acted more. <br /> <br /> - Apparently, there are not many dances at the prom night. Instead, the girls quarrel with their boys for where they plan to go to college. I hear all these colleges bring up by name, and I can't help but wonder who these girls should deceive at the entrance exams. <br /> <br /> - The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning products and wipe his mess between the scenes. This is the only logical explanation for why he could slaughter someone on the carpet or in the bathroom, and by the time someone goes to the hotel room, there are no signs of a struggle. (On the other hand, pay attention: this is a very lazy killer. Michael Myers went on a hunt for his victims. Just say.) <br /> <br /> - It's official: the entire audience in the theater is rooting for the killer. What caused this? Was this when Donna was returning to her hotel room, when sirens sounded, ordering everyone to leave the building? These were her constant dreams, and how, even after they experienced something dramatic in their sleep, did she insist on repeating her steps to a T-shirt? Or was it a flimsy performance by Brittany Snow? I must say that all of the above. <br /> <br /> - Well, who had "he dies off-screen in the third act"? You won the pot. <br /> <br /> - In the end, the film is over. My friend turns to me and says: "Donna was not too smart." This is an understatement of the week. It seems like to say that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week's power outage is a slight inconvenience. <br /> <br /> - I can’t wait to get to Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone has given it a move in favor. <br /> <br /> - I cannot recommend this. I refuse to recommend it. This is the same lazy horror film, like any other, and the only way to enjoy the plot with the smell of cheese is if you are influenced by at least ten beers. And, unfortunately, alcohol is not served for theater visitors. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out ****
