I read reviews of this film and decided to give it a chance. After all, I'm an open-minded guy, and I gave good reviews to some pretty bad movies. When this time the last credits rolled, I was looking for a meaning and something nice to say. Here goes: "This film was fortunately short." That's all I have. <br /> <br /> Good, good. The scenes and the visual effects were well made, and the music helped give the mood to the life of the asylum, but the film was painful to watch, and the endless dialogue took away from the good. I really laughed at this movie, but the way you laugh at your best friend, who was just embarrassed in front of a big crowd. <br /> <br /> By the time of the "chicken dance" in the final, which I had just decided to fill the film and let the bodies fall where they fall. I do not know what could save this film. The game was not bad, and it seemed to have a budget, but there was no way to make it watchable; not even the presence of a beautiful bare chest. Perhaps I should have lit a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full impression of the movie. In any case, I will no longer watch this film until I get depressed. Then I can say to myself: “At least I have not been to Dr. Tarr’s Underground. "I'm better than these guys."
