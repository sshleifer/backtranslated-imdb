This film is NOT funny - such a waste of great stars who seem so captured by their own glory that they forget. Only brilliant moments belong to John Cleese, the hotel manager who loves to dress up - you almost fall off your chair from helpless laughter when he dances at Donna Summer's “Bad Girls”, wearing high heels, a mink coat and an exquisite hat. The rest: FORGET IT!
