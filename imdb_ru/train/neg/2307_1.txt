I was true to my respect for Mr. Glover and Miss Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with my family and friends. I have no idea what the film is about. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their best efforts. <br /> <br /> This does not fit well. This is too volatile, and there is a little comedy. I'm sad. It could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I waited months to watch this movie, based on the liner notes. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money if you are not complete and just want to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Miss Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend the evening.
