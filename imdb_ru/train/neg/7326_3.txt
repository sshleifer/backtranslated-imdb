This movie has an interesting plot, but the acting is pretty bad, and the script is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the protagonist is intriguing, but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is being plundered. 2 of 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes, and 2 others laughed at how bad the movie was. Iâ€™ve got it done, but I have to admit that I played blackjack on my mobile phone so that the last 30 minutes can be tolerated.
