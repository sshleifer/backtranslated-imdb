For years (as reported), the television reunion of the two most beloved characters in sitcom history began poorly - and from there it went straight down. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rod Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long alienation and catch up with each other's lives. What a new concept! But, unfortunately, it doesn’t cost anything to say (not to mention making the film), it has not happened to any of them over the years. Thus, instead, the script comes down to throwing away one gray-haired old plot device after another (in most cases this concerns older women in the workplace), while completely losing the quaint charm and sophistication that made the original show the winner. The auxiliary composition is instantly forgotten, humor does not exist, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once were together has disappeared. Moore allegedly slowed down this project for many years, waiting for “just the right scenario” before making a commitment. If it was the one she thought was “correct,” what was she like? This is not the age of the characters who do this (time inevitably comes), but the almost complete lack of imagination in combination with the blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work. Once it was conceived as a pilot, but, obviously, he did not arouse interest among potential sponsors. Or in this respect among potential viewers. Quickly and graciously forgotten film - a parody and insult to the classic.
