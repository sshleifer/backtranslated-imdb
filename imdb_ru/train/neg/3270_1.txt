It is a nice and fast paced. <br /> <br /> There is no way on Earth that the actor who plays Matt is eighteen. However, the main thing is that he acts eighteen very convincingly. It must be the merit of his audition that he convinced them to play it. Soon, I took him for a naive young country boy. <br /> <br /> Although his performance was the best, most others were also very attractive. In particular, the interaction between the police was natural and balanced, and worked very well. <br /> <br /> It's only about 45 minutes, so the plot is not complicated. Another key is the style of all this. It is very smooth and bright, and the backgrounds are atmospheric, especially due to the fact that all the colors are very saturated. The gang can be identified for a foreign audience, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.
