As if at that time there were not enough of those who are swimming around, we have another lame GODFATHER clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973), which I observed earlier this year. At this time, the name “tent” returned - Telly Savalas, who belatedly entered into the process and was first spotted from behind, rather politely courting flowers and taking berets in the style of French artists! Besides the fact that he does not look minimally Sicilian, he shows no accent, except for his familiar attraction. Antonio Sabato thus makes the gangster unlikely - besides being resisted by a leading man; his relationship with Savalas, who become his father in the blink of an eye, is also unconvincing (especially since he later becomes romantically associated with the latter’s energetic teenage niece)! In addition, there are very few actions for the gangster film that can be talked about, and none of them are in any way remembered (although the final set in the clinic is well-processed); In addition, the account of Francesco De Macy is serviceable, but no more. By the way, a rented DVD that I rented starts in the middle of the credits, so not one of the actors — or even the name of the film — is ever listed!
