I watched this movie on March 21 of this year. Must say disappointment. But much better than “Tride”. The plot is beaten. Tells about Prabhat, who lives with his father, wife and his little brother. The film opens when he saves the bride. Anyway. Azhar Jurhad is plotting to kill his younger brother. He makes a plan by sending a few people. They come to school, pretending to be Prabhat's friends. Kill this baby. His father throws him out of the house. Then he returns He and Aakash travel to Kenya to find him. Sunny performs well, Chunky at best gets bored, Nasurdun is wasted. Divya is good, Sonam is wasted, Jozna is wasted, but she looked cute. The guy who played Sunny's brother in The Movie was cute. Too sad that he had to kill his character. The girl was cute, but annoying. The other child did well. Alok did well. Kiran was adequate. Amrish and Gulshan did well. Cinematography is excellent in both India and India. Kenya. The script is weak, but it has some good conversations. Also pulls. Movie. The music was fine. I liked only one song "Saat Samundar", the lyrics of this song was good. Other songs have been forgotten. Do not watch it. Rating 3/10
