When I saw a preview for this on TV, I thought, “Well, this will be a good werewolf movie,” but it’s not. it was not at all scary! the acting was good, the plot was terrible, the military bid was just stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could be better than this piece of shit. In the film, it sounded like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf, instead he turned a psycho and bit the doctor's throat. If you read some of my other reviews about other films, everything is positive, but this one is not just because the story was terrible. One of 10 max. I'm sure you all expected some werewolf, but I bet you didn't expect it. Behind Loch Nos was much better than this movie, damn it, any movie that is better on a science fiction channel than this movie.
