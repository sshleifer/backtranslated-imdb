This film has never been shown in cinemas in our area, so when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to make it. This time I had to listen to critics and pass it on. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent cast, the film was very disappointing. Now I understand why everything went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought that with Bloom, Ledger and Rush this could have some value. Everyone has done a wonderful job in the past. <br /> <br /> The film was slow and never delayed me. I did not manage to develop strong sympathy for the characters, and I had to struggle with the desire to rewind ahead to get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film, even if you are considering renting it only for “sweet eyes”. It will not satisfy even this.
