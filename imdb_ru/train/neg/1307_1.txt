It was a really bad movie. I am a big fan of Italian Terror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and, yes, even our good friend, Lamberto, sometimes comes out with a good one. I found that the first two films “Demons” were very exciting - they were so bad, they were great, but this film is so bad that it is really, very bad. This is very boring, the story never goes anywhere, and I hated the characters - the wife spanked her husband and the tearful crying pain in this wife who drove me crazy, and there was not enough room for the story dedicated to ogre, which is probably the best actor in all the movie. I turned it off about three-quarters, because I was very, very boring! Do not worry
