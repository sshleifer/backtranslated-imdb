A view, fascinated by erotic scenes, only to realize that it was one of the most amateur and incredible parts of the film I have ever seen. Something like a school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking? And what happened to all these typical characters in this strange supposed town of the Midwest? It's pretty hard to mess with this. No lessons to be learned from this, no brilliant insight, just nonsense and quite ridiculous (but a lot of skin, if it intrigued you) filmed nonsense ... What happened to bisexual relationships, from nowhere, after all heterosexual encounters, And what happened with this absurd dance, when everyone played their stereotypical roles? Give him one pass, it's like a million other miles of a bad, wasted film, money that could be spent on hungry children or AIDS in Africa .....
