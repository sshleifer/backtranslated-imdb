I give this marriage 3 years, and it stretches it. Adrianna Curry - dirty mouth, spoiled, restrained, loud, and her bi-sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris that he has an image for protection and he should avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self-esteem and from another temporal strain. I have nothing against Adrianna Curry, but this combination will not be happy after it ends. Her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks that this is his last attempt to regain his youth. There are 2 very good people who will eventually disperse. I don't think his old "Brady Family" would fit into his new life. I see them closing. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. He supported him and was beside him.
