I just watched this movie, and I must say that with such a wonderful premise and great talent, this turkey just lies there !!! A friend lent me this film, and I watched with an open heart, mainly because he highly appreciated this story. <br /> <br /> Well, the film began with the resignation of Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot ... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? Allegedly, he was hired by the character Anthony Quinn to become his new pilot ... well, we will never see Costner coming to the plane until the end of the film! <br /> <br /> Costner encounters a Texan (James Gammon), who sells a horse to a big Mexican businessman, and Costner goes for a walk. Not knowing what happened, Gammon is beaten almost to death, and Costner leads him to a meeting that happens with Quinn's partner! But nothing's working ... nada, zilcho! Why did they have the character of Gammon? Why did they have a sale of horses with partner Quinn, if nothing would come of it? <br /> <br /> Also, after they leave Costner dead, they make Madeleine Stowe's character a whore, then she attacks one of Quinnâ€™s people who paid for the move ... she stabs him with a knife and the next thing she was moved to a monastery! There is no explanation why it was moved, or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too many talents were spent on such a weak script and poor editing !! I only watched it because a friend owned it and let me see it ... I'm going to throw it at him during those 2 hours I wasted from my life watching the damn thing!
