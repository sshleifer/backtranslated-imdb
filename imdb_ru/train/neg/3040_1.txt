With this name, you know that you get a lot of trash. It acts badly. The script is bad. The director is bad. The grammar is bad. <br /> <br /> The film creates a lot of noise, which is not really music, and many scream. The film creates a bad racial stereotype. Why is there a drug addict in every black hero movie? Why does the hero always need to dance to succeed? Why should a famous rapper always be in a dance film? Why the letter "s" can not be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood should stop a stupid audience and create a film in which there are people with the mind who know how to speak English properly. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, and do not go look.
