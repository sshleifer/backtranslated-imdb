Blue Monkey (1987) or "The Invasion of BodySuckers", as is known here in the UK, was a rather boring horror film about an old man who was bitten by some mysterious poisonous plant in the greenhouse !!!! The man is urgently sent to the hospital, where a worm-like creature comes out of the mouth, of course, it turns into a monster insect and continues to run amok !! Despite the fact that Steve Railsback and John Vernon were in the film, I found it boring, with a flat predictable storyline, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects and no action !!!! Horror fans don't really need to track down this rare movie, you won't miss, believe me! I give this movie 2/10.
