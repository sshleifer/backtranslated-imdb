It was obvious that this film was intended for the audience “Chick Flick”, with whom I met quite a lot and enjoyed the most. However, it was a very annoying attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (which in itself became damn annoying). Her game was exaggerated, and it seemed that she was too excited compared to her colleagues, who were relaxed in their roles. This film could be more, as there was a suitable budget for setting, actors and a decent storyline. My wife and I agreed that it was “Muk” at the end, since the film ended at a painful, awkward height! Good luck next time, I hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of film to which she belongs, for example, “From Hell”.
