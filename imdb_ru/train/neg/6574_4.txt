(Avast, small spoilers ahead) I received this tape from my local library, which for obvious reasons keeps a copy of it. <br /> <br /> I once went to the city of Matevan, West Virginia, and in a small museum there I saw the schedule of the city theater Sitra, May 1954. Movies changed in the theater every day. Since there would not be a television in these places for another ten years, it was a large part of the entertainment available in the city. The “raid” seems to have been made for cities like Matevan in the 1950s. Although he was not listed this month, I’m sure that I showed there some Monday or Tuesday evening for an audience that probably wasn’t too demanding. The historical foray - daring and surprisingly successful - did not seem to be very well researched, so the film is full of Hollywood decorations, including the free cannon, played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice in Liberty Valence. And in St. Albans, it seems there were more Yankee soldiers coming and going through the city than in Washington, DC. <br /> <br /> What really made me laugh was when the raiders changed into Confederation uniforms. Only in the sticky pictures of the civil war do the rebel uniforms look so untouched. When, shortly before the raid, the son of Ann Bancroft caught Van Heflin in shape, I expected the boy to think that it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie, I actually watched IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The contract actress of that time did not look at all like in her later films, and does not have any presence that she would later have in “The Miracle Worker”, “Agnes of God” and, of course, in “Graduate”. <br /> <Worth seeing, if only 1). you live in st. albans and 2). You have a couple of hours to kill the Hollywood fiction of the biggest news in your hometown.
