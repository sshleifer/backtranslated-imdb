... but a lousy movie. As Maltin says, this was an attempt by Christopher Lee to make a serious horror movie. Well, this is serious ... Too serious! The plot is stupid and slow (something about elderly people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... a film is all talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk about the same things again and again. I actually dozed off a few times! The film is sooooo boring! Cast sleepwalking goes through with the only exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but it probably was a labor of love for both (they often complained that horror movies are too cruel ... well, there is NO violence in this!) . Avoid at all costs ... if you do not have insomnia ... it will put you to sleep!
