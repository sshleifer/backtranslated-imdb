Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy, reclusive video operator and an equally desperate struggling artist who, both living in the Big Apple, develop an unlikely romance using a dating site on the Internet. This in itself is not so unusual, but what is their way of communicating? Refusing words, they begin to write notes, and then communicate using video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the creatorâ€™s own relationship (Arin Crumley and Susan Beusse), who in addition to writing and directing take part as the main characters as well. With elements of avant-garde, anti-plot and dokudramy, the film is scattered in the wind with an unresolved structure, neatly nestled between narcissism and self-indulgence. <br /> <br /> As the film goes on, briefly the separation and the deterioration of their once-intriguing forms of communication grow old, as the couple faces the difficulties of reality. Focusing solely on internal conflict or the ills of relationships, the film fights through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor sharp. This could be easily circumvented by adding an additional storyline and external conflict, as well as the third act, to which it does not exist - just installing a melodrama that does not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> What is even more aggravating is the Descent of the film from the story into reality, which suddenly ends with an open end and an unsatisfactory ending. It would be all good and cool, but there was no question or point in being discovered or thought out. <br /> <br /> (By the way, the film contains excellent animation and a bright and touching soundtrack, one of the most interesting aspects of production.) <br /> <br /> But, as always, watch the movie and decide for yourself.
