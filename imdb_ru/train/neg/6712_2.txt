I suppose you should give a few points for the dedication of writing a musical around a history lesson, but what about decent music? <br /> <br /> Is the cartoon game by Howard DeSilva designed to arouse interest in other exhausted children? <br /> <br /> Is the contemporary (at that time) acting style of William Daniels appealing to the demographics of the 1960s / 70s? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the “jokes” about New York and New Jersey? (I can hear the blue-haired Broadway audience screaming on the cue.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I think that all the material is outdated, boring, and the game is too sharp for the screen
