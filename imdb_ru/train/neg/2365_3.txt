This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I understand this, I feel better. This film is poor from start to finish. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddie is his worst cartoon character. Thank God, they killed him. And who wants to see the cameos of Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is a small background that we told about Freddie. We see that he once had a family, and we see his abusive alcoholic (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Besides that, everything is bad. There are a few quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Japhet Cotto), and they try their best, but the end result is simply bad. One and a half hours, which I spent on watching this film, and one and a half hours, which I can never return.
