I'm going to keep it short. This “adaptation” of King’s remarkable book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are a lot of Kubrick and Nicholson fans on this site, and as a result, this film mysteriously found its way. in the top 250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is as ridiculous as Torrance and Shelley Duval. A story that has nothing to do with the book is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance. This is a complete joke. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story: stick to the series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and people who say that Kubrick had every right destroy the story of King, because King ... not a very good writer should stick to the review of "masterpieces", such as "wide-open eyes."
