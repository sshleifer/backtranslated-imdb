Can you say "Everything is shocking, without conspiracy?" There were so many unexplored directions in this movie. There was no story about the room, except death. * WHY * was it evil? What made it so? Why "hour" countdown? Then there were unexplored things that were hinted at; for example, we * saw * the camera in the vent, which he mentioned. But when he went upstairs, the vent said, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> How about the fact that all the ghosts looked "digital" and everything "winked" before hitting the ground, making static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all these things together, room 1408 looks like a high-tech haunted house. Except that it was not. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... electronics doesn't work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the mobile phone has no signal, but the wireless Internet works fine. How many inconsistencies can you add? Sorry, but this film was nothing more than shock-for-shock. This has all been done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things are just off site. Change of pictures. Bleeding walls. "Oh, it was just a dream ... no, it is not." And if the room was "evil", why make our main character accept the death of his daughter, if she still keeps him there forever? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, there was no reference information about the “First Book” he wrote. Just some vague information about "the father was a jerk" and so on. Speaking of dads, what was up with a little about his father? "You will be in my place." <br /> <br /> In general, a really HORRIBLE movie. It was a factor of 100% adrenaline shock, without any new or innovative effects, and, of course, without prehistory, character development, etc. I had the general impression that the entire film was shot by "Cheap"; to a large extent using one set and a pair of pictures with locations, and it was nothing more than a film with effects of processed, cheese, “seen before” effects.
