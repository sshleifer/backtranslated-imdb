To Earth talks about Lance Barton, a black comedian hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does several things in Charlesâ€™s body. There are some laughter in the film, but there is nothing special about it. This is a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the animated comedy of 2005, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock did much better than this. It will only make you laugh about 4 times for the entire movie. And this is not really funny. You will laugh at yourself and you may giggle, but you will not laugh at the floor.
