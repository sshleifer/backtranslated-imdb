Valentine is a terrible movie. That's what I think about this: <br /> <br /> Acting: very bad. Katherine Heigl cannot act. Others were not much better. <br /> <br /> History: The story was fine, but it could be more developed. This film could be a good film, but it was not a success. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some of the music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: not very original Name Paige Prescott Recognize Prescott? <br /> <br /> Outcome: not to see Valentine. This is really a stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
