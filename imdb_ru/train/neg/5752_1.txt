I usually do not comment, but there are things that need to be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> Jeremy London's game was terrible! I did not think he could be so bad. The plot could be good if it were well directed, along with a good solid game of the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those films that you read about and think that it has a lot of potential for entertainment, but from the very beginning give up. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I had a good laugh. I would not waste my time in your place.
