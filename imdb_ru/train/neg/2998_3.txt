Only for loyal fans of Judy Garland. There are two (2) really good numbers - one where she writes down the number with the senior cleaner (you all saw the photos), and a pretty good number at the very end. There are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny. But, in fact, the script is so bad, and the film is so outdated that it is difficult not to be terrified everywhere. But renting a movie costs 2.50 - get ready to rewind it.
