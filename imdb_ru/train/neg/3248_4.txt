Why did I go to see this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey participated in it, and in the past, he made funny films that made me cry with laughter, so you really blame me for expecting this again? In addition, the premise, the funny trailer, the participation of his colleagues Jennifer Aniston, and the fact that it was a huge hit in the USA, encouraged me. <br /> <br /> However, as my “Overview” suggests, I was Frustrated. For different reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. In the two-hour film, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, all the rest of the time I sat thinking, “I really should have eaten ice cream.” I admit that it might be wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what he actually expects when he is filming Jam films such as The Truman Show, Liar, Liar, Me, I and Irene “Dumb and Then the films“ Dumber ”,“ The Mask ”and“ Ace Ventura ”, according to Bruce Nolan's own words, create such a mediocre film? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: The role of Jennifer Aniston was criminally signed. I mean hello! She was in the public eye for about ten years, and in this film she talks about four lines. Wrong. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: one word is a cliché <br /> <br /> Reason 4: the accidental deployment of specifically American references - Jimmy Hoff, Walter Cronkite, “The Sweeping Week” is a clue to the film specifically for houses. “A teenager says“ no ”to drugs, and“ yes ”to education is a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be a miracle! ”God tells Bruce a strong feeling that seems to have lowered pleasure in the US, but might face tighter resistance in markets that retain a suspicion of subtlety. Besides, I still go to school, and this statement assumes that I and all my friends are miracles ... or maybe it just means that we have brains? <br /> <br /> Kerry has enough funny moments in this film to make you laugh and not let Bruce Almighty be a complete disaster, but you are advised to start to revise your expectations downward.
