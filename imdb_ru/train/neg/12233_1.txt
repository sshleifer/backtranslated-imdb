I just don’t understand how the film Concord-New Horizons, directed by Jim Vinorsky with the participation of Andrew Stevens’s acting talent and puppet, can be bad. It's just incomprehensible to the mind, is not it? <br /> <br /> Well, let's not be wrong. Munchie Strikes Back is a really bad movie. Manchi is a puppet that has existed for many centuries. For reasons not fully explained to the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. Mom's problem (at least her main problem) is that she needs to pay a mortgage cylinder in two weeks ... until the tiny amount of $ 20,000. Uch. She can't find the money because she just got fired. OK ... just the key word in this sentence. What the...? Did she plan to pay with one check? Maybe it would be nice to spend the last few years saving up for it ... what do you think? <br /> <br /> Manchi possesses magical powers, similar to those that a genie would have ... but there is not limited to the number of desires you can make! Manchi brings the boy a lot of fashionable clothes for one night, but then the child asks him to be sent back to the mall, Manchy “borrowed” him. Annoying furbooh also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by cheating. Baseball is hit so hard that it revolves around the earth several times. Unfortunately, these stupid parents watching the game, do not think that it is generally strange. Hm <br /> <br /> In any case, I would like to finish, because it has already exhausted enough of my vitality as it is. You will be really touched by the scene when Lesley-Ann Down, playing mother, kicks a dog that screams at her. Your heart is melting from her charm when she notices how dollar bills are flying in her front yard, and she wonders how it can snow in summer. Munchie Strikes Back Credits promised another movie called Munchie Hangs Ten will follow. To date, viewers who watch movies have been deprived of what would undoubtedly be a cinematic tour. Heh. 1/10
