Good. Who was that? Who gave the revolver 10 out of 10? Do you stumble over Ecstasy? You had so many. Did you do it for the challenge? Is this some kind of cult? Or did Guy Ritchie subscribe 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I will say it. The fact that you do not understand the film does not mean that it is not very good. Maybe you had a bad day at work, or you sat down to watch a movie after a quarrel with your wife, and then you were not in the mood. Maybe there is a more fundamental stumbling block - for example, you simply do not have mental abilities or a sufficiently developed philosophical sense to do this. BUT. And it is very, very big but. A mega-elephant is about the size of a XXL, but to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not confuse inconsistency with complexity, and please do not confuse this two-hour non-squirrel with an interesting film. Indeed. You may think that you are pretty smart. You can even think of yourself as something of a romantic figure: an independent thinker who stands up for a masterpiece against a hoarse hoarse skeptics choir. Please do not. You embarrass yourself. <br /> <br /> A revolver is a waste of everyone’s time. If you had thought, if within a few minutes you would know that too. It was a waste of the cast, a waste of the team, an empty meal and, of course, a waste of precious minutes (you cannot bring them back, you know) to anyone unlucky enough to go through this unspeakable, miserable mess. <br /> <br /> "No - wait," a voice sounded in the dark. “You just don't understand. This is NONLINEAR. This means that the story does not go in a straight line. This is actually a difficult and delicate work AUTEUR. She solves complex existential issues. And in any case - they are scheduled Fight Club, when it first came out - did not you hear? - Because they could not cope with complexity. They are now eating a modest pie. I bet you hate Lynch movies too, doncha? "<br /> <br /> I don’t want to disappoint you, but I’m a big fan of Lynch. I rather like Memento, so the story told in an unconventional way doesn’t necessarily fill me with fear. And although I only briefly studied it a few years ago, philosophy I’m very interested. I don’t like Revolver for these reasons. I don’t like it because it implies serious topics with a big brain, but treats them so insultingly superficially that it causes laughter. I’m not very fond of chess, but Richie’s idea is how chess works that this was a premature four-year-old child. I don’t like it, because the characters, without exception, completely pushed me away. "Aha!" Richie shouts an apologist. "The guy deftly throws his hat in front of Brecht!" Just maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that he just can't write a decent script for toffee. <br /> <br /> Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is actually very instructive. Fight club has a sour language, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has outdated fortune cookies deflecting one-liners that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great twist that makes you rethink everything that happened. As far as I can tell, Revolver has several obscure turns that are not satisfying, because ... well, they do not make sense. If you keep pulling the rug out from under the people, they will eventually kick you out of your house. And then they close all the doors and windows. And they never let you back. Ever <br /> <br /> The Richie guy seems to believe that philosophy entails repeating the mantra of small buzz phrases. Mostly they say, but often they flash on screen with attribution. This is almost a pathology. <br /> <br /> But this film is especially noteworthy because something so incomprehensible can be so neatly married with all the tired gangster clichés in the world. In the end, it is so irrelevant. You do not care. You do not understand anything. You are going home. <br /> <br /> Actually, I really liked what the killer was having, who had a crisis of confidence. He's great. But I can't recommend you to watch a movie, just to see it. He is only in this for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please trust me. It's horrible.
