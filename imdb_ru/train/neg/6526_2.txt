Hopelessly inept and boring film in which the characters stand in rooms or on a rocket ship and talk endlessly. You might think that the situation will improve when they explore Mars, but these scenes are shot through a heavy red-orange filter, which makes everything very cloudy. Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings, and monsters are completely unconvincing. There are echoes of the Bride of the Monster, when the heroine carefully wraps around the octopus, like a tentacle of a plant that eats meat, before wandering around a little, the difference is that Ed Wood's film is a hundred times more interesting. It is better to wear earplugs when viewing, otherwise the sci-fi musical score, repeated endlessly, will drive you crazy. If you find that you canâ€™t sleep one night, just insert this into your video recorder and your insomnia will heal quickly.
