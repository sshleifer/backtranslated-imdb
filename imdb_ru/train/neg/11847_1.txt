I am shocked at how bad this film is. As a stylist from the Hollywood artists of the early 20th century, he sets a new minimum - even after The Moderns or (gasping) Cradle Will Rock, and I never thought I would see a film worse than these 2. Of course, they were a bit different . However, the intentions and results were depressingly similar. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a terrible cast: Eddie Izzard as CHEPLINA? Excuse me? Peter, do you owe this guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loule Parsons Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davis ??? Gosh, these people are not even starting to try to capture the look or sound of the period they supposedly portray. <br /> <br /> Well, Last Picture Show was a decent movie, but it was a disaster. And the rest of Bogdonovichâ€™s photos were not much better. I believe that the rub against Wells, Hitch and Ford is long gone. However, good for accommodating TCM.
