Mediocre sci-fi channel of the original picture. Writhing a little, but not much. Nuclear submarine USA. Jimmy Carter performs a mission deep under the thick cold ice near the North Pole, when he is attacked by giant supercharged electric eels. A team member (Simmone Jade McInnon) thinks she invented a way to communicate with monsters, but she has little chance for vague reasons. Also among the team: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This film could be a little better if the eels / monsters were not so cartoonish.
