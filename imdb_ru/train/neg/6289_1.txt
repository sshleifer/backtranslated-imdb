This is the most cliche and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Each scene is horrified, and the two main actors, Corey and Danny, are very annoying. Corey is very stupid and naive and never should have listened to Danny's false promises. <br /> <br /> Neveu Campbell and the assassin from Urban Legend are the only redeeming qualities in this unsuccessful film attempt. Danny (Dean Paras) looks in his late thirties and the girl he is trying to sleep in - Corey looks like she is still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this film is called “Too Smooth”; There is nothing smooth about this movie. 1/10 Avoid
