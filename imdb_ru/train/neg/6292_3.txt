I wonder what this film has to do with the 1984 film Bachelor Party, starring Tom Hanks. Is this film an official sequel? This film is not enough in every department, and you obviously should not watch it. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this film is simply not good enough or ridiculous. It is based mainly on the character's stereotypical assessments, and not on the film, which has good, original and funny moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, it also has very few stories and a naked chest than the script pages. You just keep waiting until everything starts. Somewhere there is a main storyline, but it is so horribly non-original and so poorly executed in the film that it seems that it is something non-existent. I suppose that somewhere there is even a message and a moral story, but again this is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the film that it simply does not work. <br /> <br /> This is basically a typical teen comedy, with a lot of sexy jokes and nudity, only without the main teenage characters, which makes the story even more sad and tasteless. There are some really wrong jokes in the movie that are out of place for any type of movie. <br /> <br /> I regret having ever watched this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
