Why watch good movies if you can watch Trancers II? <br /> <br /> Oh, this film is sooo inconclusive. I can only portray the cast and film crew traveling around LA with a video camera throwing extras at the monster’s silly makeup at the poor, long-suffering Tim Thierson. Families of stars actually appear to play cameos, probably because Full Moon cannot afford “real” add-ons. Weak effects, lame sets and a script so tangled that for unleashing all the knots eons will be needed - these should be classic trances! <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... it rules. Please note this is the same thing that I am talking about "Trancers IV". I say this because it is true. What could be better if you look at how an old man in a raincoat mows down a zombie, and then flashes, like, “Don't worry, ladies, they are biodegradable”? Well, many things could be better, but in any case these are still good things. <br /> <br /> My only significant qualification is Megan Ward, which really stinks. She is a lousy competitor for Helen Hunt's character - they are both young pieces of eye candy, and it would be more effective if they actually contrasted a bit. Well, you can't have everything. At the very least, the “long second hour” storyline is on the spot again, and we have more Hep Ashby, the least persuasive athlete in film history (oh wait a minute - he has a rival in the David Ogden Stirs form in “The Creator”) . <br /> <br /> I have not seen this lately, but it seems that I remember that Martina Besvik ran away twice during the final battle. Hooray for lousy continuity! Just one of the many high points in this beautiful movie.
