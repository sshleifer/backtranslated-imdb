School nerd Marty (Simon Scaddamor) is sexually humiliated by a group of classmates, and then exploded in a laboratory (set by them as well), where his face is covered with acid scars. Years later, all the idiots are invited back to high school (since it closed) for reunion. What they did not know was that Marty was proposing to kill them. Then the storm begins, they are locked in the school, and Marty begins to revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty silly. The killings are inventive and bloody, and there are some creepy atmospheric shots from an abandoned school - but that is all. The humiliation inflicted on Scaddamora is more than cruel (he is naked, his head is buried in the toilet and is burned), and they are just uncomfortable to watch. Given that Scaddamor committed suicide soon after his release, they are almost impossible to see. Also this film does its best to strip. There is a full front Scuddamore (surprising for any film), but one girl decides to take a bath alone ... AFTER they know that the killer is haunting them! And then there is a couple who should have sex. This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everyone will be, and can teleport to them. It ends with a turn that made me moan and roll my eyes, and then ANOTHER turn that made me throw something heavy on the TV! Acting is tolerable - not good, but tolerable. Caroline Munro too in this. She is a very beautiful woman, but not very actress. <br /> <br /> This is 3 for the killings and the atmosphere. Otherwise it is the run of the mill and is forgotten. The tragic suicide of Skuddamor paid more attention to this film than it deserves.
