I will give this film two stars, because it is replete with a beautiful photo. Otherwise, it is replete with mostly cliches and stereotypes: mountain people are either stupid white trash of fanatically religious or ragged racist type, or wise white Indians. Indians - magical people who move without sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals and read minds at great distances. And so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I continued to wonder what the meaning of the film was (apart from showing me beautiful pictures of mountains, log cabins, woods, lots of animals, free energetic mountaineers, and strange people in the church). <br /> <br /> The story raised a number of questions, but none of them was studied in detail. It was not a story about growing up during a depression, or about being an orphan, or about fighting for identity. He tried to be all this and many others, which made him superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the film was supposed to tell about the formation of the Little Tree, we hardly know anything about it. He was given a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and the Stoics) and a demonstration of a distillery; tried his hand at chopping wood (which he failed to do) and whiskey (literally); I learned to read (and, possibly, write) with the help of my grandmother and her vocabulary - and that’s all. Apparently, he did not learn much during his time at the boarding school, because he was locked up in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, the grandmother and grandfather, as well as Graham Greene’s character, made sure that the Small Tree eventually became a very spiritual person, whose main goal as an adult was after, and I paraphrase here, “to go with the Navajo "And" to be caught in a couple of wars, "is to" catch up "with grandmother and grandfather and the character of Graham Green in heaven (instead of, say, meeting girls, marrying, having children, or other such nonsense). <br /> <br /> And last but not least, I must say that I have found that grandfather is insulting trade. Why all this must be whiskey? Counteract the stereotype of "drunken Indian"?
