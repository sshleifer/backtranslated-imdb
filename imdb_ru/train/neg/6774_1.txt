Being an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this film and howl with laughter, as AMC announced it as a comedy. I have never been so disappointed with the film! Cary's usual charm and light comedy is AVOL from this entire film; he looks tense, bored, and just not himself. Mississippi’s character is considered one of the worst stereotypes I’ve ever seen - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and wrong, depending on which part of Mississippi he claims to be from), and every time he pronounces the line, he a few decibels higher than any other cast. Mississippi tried to stand out in the film as an attractive, stupid dog, but in the end he manages to distract himself from the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene bloated doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and although she was never known in Hollywood for her acting skills, this film screams that she never had such an ability from the very beginning. Ray Walston's character was sweet and ultimately contrived. For the four people who went ashore, this was the quietest vacation I've ever seen. I’ve watched this nightmare to the very end, and although I’m not spoiling anyone, I’ll tell you that this is the most absurd of all that you have ever seen. The film tries to stir up patriotism and a sense of duty to the fighters, but the film completely misses this point because of its weak storyline and weak composition. Sorry, Cary!
