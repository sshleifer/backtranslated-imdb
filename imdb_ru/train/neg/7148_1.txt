Before watching this film, I had very low expectations and I went to watch only cars. In the end, I even regretted leaving for this reason. The site is almost non-existent. Character development does not exist. There was so much clich√© and so much fun in the movie that I could only watch and be surprised how he was released. If it were not for the exotic, I would not even rate this film as 1. An attempt to create a consistent storyline is ruined by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the ridiculous characters that make up its members. In fact, the plot of the film is so predictable and simple that the middle child can predict most of the storyline. Bad game, bad story, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see this. Instead, play Gran Turismo HD, and it quenches your thirst for fast sex machines, without leaving a bad aftertaste.
