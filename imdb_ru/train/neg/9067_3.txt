Although I had some hopes for this film, especially because I like to play Jason Segel so much (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared), I have to say that it was one of the worst films I have seen lately (Loser and Dr T. and women are also on this list). <br /> <br /> Yes, there were a few loud laughing moments, although the film could be much better. The idea was that scam artists, cheating on their way to college, meet their rivals when someone finds them with a proposal for them. The problem is that all the characters were so unattractive that I didn't give a damn about them. The blackmailer (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it was not so funny to watch him - he was not crazy or charming, he was just a crazy loser who was actually quite dangerous and not fun to watch. It was difficult to edit the film — it continued to rip between fantasy and reality, and it was often unclear what it was. In fact, only two or three gang frauds were shown, you just had to believe that they were really fraudsters - showing their schemes would allow you to create a better film. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in fact it was stupid, poorly written and directed everywhere. I could go on about the shortcomings of the film, but you get the idea. It’s not worth renting for $ 4 or the gas required for a trip to the cinema and back!
