This film has a few things going for it at once. Dani Filt as the lead actor will automatically make some people look like this movie. Admittedly, I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack for this film long before I watched it. Dani Filt is a very recognizable character, and he does an excellent job with his task. Independent film style is great for the creepy factor. There are great actresses in this movie. Because of the low budget, the special effects were also quite good. The way people died was very creative and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Now for the cons. Throughout the film, very little is said, which contributes very little to the development of characters. It is difficult to fear for the life of languid, static characters. When there was a little talk, the F bomb was abundant, appearing in random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems that it made the script for a teenager and considered himself cool, including the whole language. The storyline that I could make of it was pretty good, although many of its parts remained hanging, and the lack of conversation makes you wonder what is going on. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cradle of Fear is like porn for people who love sex and violence, but as porn is trying to get out of the storyline, it just doesnâ€™t work too well. Rent it if you are a sick person who wants to satiate your blood and appetite.
