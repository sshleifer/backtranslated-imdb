When I was younger, I liked this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is juicy, poorly written and rarely funny. All three main roles were good actors and funny people (Sageta’s performance was much better than when creating this show, since Kuhler was better, and Stamos was better than the average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted to leave the show, because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show was eventually canceled when many actors demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show: <br /> <br /> 1. Catch phrases - How many times can one person come to terms with catchy catch phrases, such as “how rude "," You understand, dude, "" moron, "" cut down "and" pardon "in 24 hours? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler is the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. The letter is outdated and cliché like oreo cookies. There is a good cliché and a bad cliché. Full House had bad clichés. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco have said enough. <br /> <br /> 5. Unreal things. Too much to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Fashionable children - the girls had all the latest fashionable clothes in the malls, and you can see the posters of fashionable recording artists in which they will participate. <br /> <br /> Now this is a show on Nick @ Knight. I would hardly call it a classic. I can’t say anything bad about the people involved, because I think that many of them are talented in themselves. But this show was so sweet that I could not stand it after a while.
