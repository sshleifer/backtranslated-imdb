I had high hopes for this film because I really liked the book. However, I don’t think I would understand the premise of the film if I hadn’t read the book yet. The film is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overwhelming government, but the book is much more detailed about suffering. Corrupt government officials lead a comfortable, almost luxurious life, while ordinary people try to find the necessities for survival. Perhaps most people belong to their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether they are oppressed or not. Dystopia Orwell looks as if it can exist in many places of our modern world. It has been several years since I read the book, but one often hears references to Big Brother, the Police of Thought and Newspeak in the media and casual conversations. Probably many people using these terms do not understand where these terms come from. I highly recommend you read the book.
