Brutal intentions 2 damn terrible, I mean super bad. Words can't explain how bad it is, but I'll try anyway. <br /> <br /> The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first movie. Sebastian (Robin Dunn) expelled from a private school and forced to move to New York. There he decides to start all over again and just live a normal life and calm down. Unfortunately, he has to deal with his half-sister, Catherine (Amy Adams) wants to drag him down. Sebastian begins to fall in love with Daniel (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the principal. Catherine wants Sebastian to just sleep with the whole school, which was described as a "whore." Catherine also wants revenge on Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who humiliated her during the school meeting. Catherine wanted to turn a newbie into the biggest whore in school, similar to the plot of the first film. <br /> <br /> Cruel Intentions 2 is basically a canceled television show that has become a prequel. There are a lot of problems with the film. This is badly written, unfunny and badly received. Fortunately for Amy Adams, the show has never been filmed, because now she is quite a big actress. Although “Cruel Intentions” had a sense of realism and can be seen in the real world, “Cruel Intentions 2” are set in a comedy series and, as described on amazon.co.uk, “a terrific version of Saved by the Bell”. In the first film there were some dark themes related to sex and drug use, but in Cruel Intentions 2 tried to make it funny, and some of the ideas in the film should not be the same as, for example, Catherine has an affair with a teacher. Other ideas also do not work, such as the secret society, where all the popular children meet to discuss the fall of other students. The film also had a major problem of sexualized 15/16 years of age. I know that teenagers have sex, sometimes a lot, but when it is done in the movies or on television, they are taken very seriously. One well-known feeling was when Daniel encouraged Cheri (who is about 14/15 in the film) to imitate sex on a horse's back to the point where she has an orgasm. The idea of ​​turning a girl around 14/15 into a whore is simply wrong and should not turn into a comedy. The jokes in the film were not crowned with success, be it a verbal gag, like “she becomes very wet when she sees you,” to the visual gag, where Sebastian pushes Catherine face in the dirt. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of something wrong with this film, in which I have no time, but I say that this should be avoided. Just watch “Cruel Intentions,” although not a classic, but still a good film that is good about the subject. <br /> <br /> This film is just a wicked dream when schoolchildren have a lot of sex with each other. ,
