I actually retired from Asian horror movies some time ago after I felt bad from seeing the trash ghost story in the same vein. However, lately I’m more and more interested in the exploitation of films, so I decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was the highly acclaimed director Takashi Miike "Visitor Q". I already saw the audition, and although I didn’t like it very much, I rate it as one of the best contemporary Asian horror films. So, I entered this with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately found only boredom. I believe that this film is really very intelligent, and it just went through my head, but what I thought was just a collection of cruel and vile scenes with little or no coordination between them. As far as I understand, any comparisons with the works of Louis Bunuel and David Lynch are sacrilegious; all Miike did here made a film; Any intelligence around him was realized by pretentious fans, desperately trying to find some meaning. My headache started in about 10 minutes (after the father had had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn’t subside until the film finally ended; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it seems. Do not misunderstand me, I am not against violence in the cinema and in fact actively seeking the most famous films around; but although it can be violent, it is also meaningless and boring, and I have not received a single gram of pleasure from it. Takashi Miike can have a lot of fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope that this is the last time I will meet one of his films.
