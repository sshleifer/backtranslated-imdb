This is a surprisingly stupid example of a self-made, written, and directed vanity project ... while I was working as a crew member, John Carradine commented to me (before they burned in the cola sequence): "This is the worst piece * t I have ever worked .. and I worked on many pieces of shit. “Also an interesting point earlier, when Jim Mitchum had problems with his lines, and he started swearing in the courtyard of Santuario (religious sanctuary in Chimayo) - at this moment one of the local“ vato loco ”observers with a low rider growled.“ Show respect to the man ", which apparently caused Jim to remember where he was, as he then made very deep and sincere apologies for his inappropriate behavior. In any case, the team did the deferment work and never received full payment - but left with a lot especially bizarre stories - like at night, when we caught the 10-year-old son of a producer / director entertaining himself by building miniature Burmese tiger traps for us so that we could break our legs. As they say: "I have to love Biz ..."
