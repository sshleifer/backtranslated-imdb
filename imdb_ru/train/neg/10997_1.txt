First of all ..... What the hell? Why in the world are they trying to sell a low-budget piece of shit on TV late in the evening with the promise of disturbing, abusive sick trash that no normal, real person with soul could watch <br /> <br /> What the hell is funny, when a dog is injured, the grandmother's head is cut off ... the guy's arm is torn apart, and two girls go to the bathroom? that the hell this world has come to the fact that people find comedy in something so sick. Anyone who thinks this stuff is funny should not even walk the earth. <br /> <br /> But from what I've heard, itâ€™s not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through crazy piles of sick garbage ... and they can't even do it.
