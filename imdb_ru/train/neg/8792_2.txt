This film is another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories combined into one movie. Other reviewers obviously also understood this, because there are several references to the “first part” and the “second part”. How can you have character development or a deep storyline when characters and history are presented in such a short time? I enjoyed the first part until it suddenly stopped (it didn’t “end,” it just stopped at what seemed to be the middle of the story) to replace it with a meaningless and absolutely incredible second part that seemed to be centered around the girl rearranges and clears up the boy's apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Vai will be given a decent script for work!
