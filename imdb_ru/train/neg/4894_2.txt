Excessive, eternal frames, useless frames, useless scenes - this is what you will find in this film. In other words, it seemed to me technically poor. Musical beats are aimed at amateur skill (there is no synchronization in future dances, poorly synchronized, poor and obvious improvisation of actors from time to time, etc.) <br /> <br /> The film is long and boring. In the end, it makes little sense and even less meaning. <br /> <br /> Although there are some good ideas. Some of the comic elements are really effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film is getting worse and worse, so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer that I saw was very dynamic, which does not apply to the film. That is, the discrepancy between the trailer and the film itself is very close to the breakdown.
