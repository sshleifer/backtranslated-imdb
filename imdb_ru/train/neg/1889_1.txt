This film is by no means entertainment, but rather a look deep into the darkest side of human behavior. Half a dozen stories of the worst kind of corruption, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance are loosely linked. The whole action takes place over several very hot and sticky days during the intense heat in Vienna, and the heat can cause some anger and hatred in the film. For me, the treatment of a backward girl by the seller of security equipment was the worst episode, followed by scenes of drunkenness and perversion in the apartment "slags". You will be embraced, and I hope to be terrified of this film. I hated it, but I felt obliged to see it to the end. 1/10 for "fun" 8/10 to display the "person" as he sometimes is.
