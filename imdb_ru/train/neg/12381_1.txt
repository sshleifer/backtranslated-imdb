This film is really ugly. It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s / 80s and puts it in a school context. I'm not saying that urban crime was not a problem for a lot of people or that schools were not / are not problematic areas, but this nasty part of the operation takes cookies. Violence is more than a real imagination, but in this case it is not a social issue, but a white middle-class student uses it to turn himself into the criminal authority of his local high school. And, of course, he knows how to play the system. Sounds familiar? Yes. This turd is purely violent exploitation, a very unpleasant job. This is an alarming cruelty, dressed as a social commentary. This falls into the same category as junk, like the Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5, and so on and so forth. The only wonderful thing is that Michael Fox was so broken at the time that he had to do such things.
