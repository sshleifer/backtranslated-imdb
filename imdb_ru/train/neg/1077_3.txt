Have you ever heard the saying that people "convey their intentions"? Well, in this movie, the characters' actions do more than just wire plans for the future - they appear drunk in your house and cover your head. This can be forgiven if the setting was used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. The character of Ambet Davidts is not mysterious, just wooden, and Kenneth Branagu cannot convey the audacious charm that his character probably wrote. <br /> <br /> Essence: an obvious plot, one-note performances, incredible characters and grotesque "southern" accents used by British actors.
