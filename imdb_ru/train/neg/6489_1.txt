What looked like a good prerequisite for the film ... unfortunately, it does not give at almost all levels. At the beginning of the film it was very difficult for me to understand that I was actually struggling with the desire to turn it off. The biggest problem from a visual point of view is that the camera is simply overwhelming with so many artificial connections and semi subconscious cuts throughout the film that actually distract you from the overall story. He really does his best to immerse you in the moment and bring the tense end to the end, but the film just has so many ill-conceived characters and irrelevant scripts that it just leaves you disappointed and confused because of why they tried to go so deep. ,
