I had the “privilege” to attend the special show “Lack of Light” at the horror convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> Firstly, you know that you have a problem when the director presents the film, saying, "Keep in mind, we did not have a lot of money ..." It’s not that off-budget films are bad but when the director uses it as an excuse, the results are always bad. And there is no better example than this unforgettable dream festival. <br /> <br /> In fact, “Lack of Light” marks the first place in the world of underground cinema: this is the only time I saw a dream about the talented veterinarians of the genre really bore me. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister, randomly enter and exit the film and are just as uninteresting as amateur nameless names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? What's the difference? It's all so boring that you stop caring for something or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. Not surprisingly, the majority of film crew members were also present. <br /> <br /> Any curious fans of the genre would be nice to stay away from it. If you're lucky, this film will never see the light of the day.
