This is one of the worst film adaptations ever created. The stage version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This movie almost misses the mark. Even casting is confusing. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Val's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer, but 3 in the exterior department. Yes, she finds a solution, but in the end she is a great dancer. What do brilliant directors do? They hire an actress who does not know how to dance and is famous for looking great. A way to skip a boat. <br /> <br /> Then there is the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett rolled over in his grave. Why didn't they use his choreography? It really cannot be improved.
