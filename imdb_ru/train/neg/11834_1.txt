Let's just say this in simple terms so that even the creators of this film can understand: this is a very stupid film with an even more stupid script, flimsy animation and a story as original as the drawing button. Do not worry - if you do not need to find a way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They may laugh, especially if they do not take medicine. The film has such an offensive type of insult - not only the filmmakers believe that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with cotton, which costs about zero effort, but they did not even bother to break the sweat by inserting a gag here and there, may seem funny. This film, frankly, struck me like a king. Shame on you for leaning so low.
