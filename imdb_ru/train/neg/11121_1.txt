I really can't understand how someone can give this disgusting film more than 1 star ... How can you like such a backward film where all the animal cruelty scenes are real? I don’t even want to imagine the excruciating pain that these innocent and defenseless living beings felt in these terrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "man" will torment them so for no reason or just for the sake of money? ? I tell you that this director is either mentally retarded, or he is just a monster with a stone heart. Or both. He really deserves his hands cut off and burned alive. <br /> <br /> It contains horribly barbaric scenes that can cause shock, especially in sensitive people and children: a real frog has a living skin, fish is sadistically disfigured. and thrown back into the water, the dog is beaten, the birds are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This film is more than terrible; it must be the worst and most backward film ever made, along with another film called “Cannibal Holocaust” or something like that. I will never watch or buy a movie made by this heartless monster. No one should spend their time watching it, especially when there are a lot of great TRULY films that show all the cruelty of animals. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only a few liked it, which is natural, as it is the worst film in the history, so it was not successful. I hope that this will make the backward director realize that such unwarranted barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence against REAL animals will NEVER praise, and that he will put all the scenes of animal abuse in his next films. I sincerely believe that everyone gets, but what they give! There will be a day when all backward and cruel "people" will feel the same pain that they once caused others. <br /> <br /> This, however, is my only “negative” review. I usually do not comment on the film if I don’t like it, but this time I just could not shut up. I had to tell the truth, because animal cruelty must stop!
