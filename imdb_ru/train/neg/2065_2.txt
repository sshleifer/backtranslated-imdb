I rented it last night. Discovery (2001) launched WAAAAAAAAAY for too long. The hitchhiker scene didn't make sense. Some parodies were simply backward. I knew in advance that the Chevy Chase was turned on in less than 2 minutes. No problems. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield's song <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material from a 75-minute film <br /> <Everything else was either unfunny or damn stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some tips: if you need a rough film that fakes television and movies, rent a Kentucky Freed movie. If you need a less rude film with fake TV programs and films, rent a "WOMEN AMAZON ON THE MOON" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not rent this movie. You will save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best film - "Modern Problems"
