It was not so great. Not terrible, not hateful or something else, just forgotten. <br /> <br /> There was a kind of indecisive, diluted air in him, as if he never knew whether he wanted to laugh, sweet or satire. Thus, we are left with a weak combination of the three. The actors seemed a bit confused. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ideas were really tired and reworked, almost zombie. How many more times do we need to say that the 50s in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity? And that it was perpetuated by aggressive consumption? And this emotional repression in men - thing beaaad? Old hat <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the biggest crime, as far as it was divorced from reality. I know that it was a comedy and all that, but - especially in the full-length film, where you have to keep the interest of the audience for a long time - you still need some kind of emotional anchor, some real history guide to make it fascinating, so that the "heroic" child watched the old woman, the two students of the school and, ultimately, his father, who was painfully dying at the hands of a zombie or something else, and that he greeted all this with a joyful smile and shrug. fight to deal with this any kind of positive way. Mom was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman at this level, you risk losing me, and that's what happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive thing I can offer is that I like the look of the apple pie suburb and it captured it quite well, it was a beautiful film, especially some of those wide-angle shots of the street and at the Robinson home. In addition, the introductory newsreel was sweet, in the style of "done before, but still funny." <br /> <br /> And I thought that with Billy Connolly, everything is in order, and this is from someone who is not a big fan of Billy Connolly: a movie star. I just had this fear that he was going to rig it and try to steal every scene, but he played it rather restrained and probably became the most sympathetic character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, not very good though.
