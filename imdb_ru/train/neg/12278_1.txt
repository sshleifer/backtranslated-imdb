Watching this show, you are not quite sure whether this story or the action is more annoying. First of all, the storyline of each episode is very predictable, the writers must have used every possible cliche, you can guess not only the overall plot, but also the location of the scenes, as well as the lines of each character that makes the show of its kind. collage of each police series there. At the top of all this, there is a “message” that good is good, and bad is bad, and that in the end good will prevail, and that we all must love each other, be better and better citizens, everything is done the most in a way. Actors, as carriers of this message and no more than that, will use a limited set of acting skills: a smile “I am a good carrier”, an interested look and body posture “victory is ours”, while the bad guys frowned: “I am bad” frowning and “you caught me” look, followed by the banding “I am not good for anything, and I must be removed from society” (this kind of general development of each show). True story or not, the show is rubbish, another proof that the producers do not complain to the audience that we are considered idiots. Well, this series is doing everything possible to idiotize out of you living brains.
