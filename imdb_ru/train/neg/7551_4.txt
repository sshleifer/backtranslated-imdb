Well, finally last night in London saw a remake, unintentionally cheerful, sexless and devoid of real humor. I really do not know where to start, although I was amused by this strange reverence, it didn’t touch me much. The acting is very flashy, there is no original music, the costumes are too Disney, there is a ridiculous insertion “six months later” after burning Nick Cage (which I didn’t come soon enough) with the Cage in a bear costume "Villains" on the island. It's such a strange remake that I can't believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that comic book gifts would have made in the eighties, a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the miners' strike, very strange!
