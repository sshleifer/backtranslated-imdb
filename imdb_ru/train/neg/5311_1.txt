This is almost the worst movie you have ever seen! Judgment Day 2012 is currently pulling the rug out from under it, for me. The props are a great example of what Frank Zappa once called cheepnis. It seems that the space scenes were made at a power station of the 1950s, just before the demolition. The music really sucks. The game is wooden and ham. The characters they portray are superficial and inconclusive. The plot is predictable. This is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of leadership breeds faith. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, at least in order to experience what should have been one of the biggest losses of the tiny budget. This is a priceless example of a silly movie!
