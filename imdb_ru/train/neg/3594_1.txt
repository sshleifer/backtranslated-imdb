This is not a horror movie, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie that should be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot, terrible acting and annoying music. If you watch only the trailer, you will know enough ... Itâ€™s a pity that such a thing is available on VHS or video, and so many good films are not available. If you like vampires, try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti. These are masterpieces, if you compare it with this garbage. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with that opinion.
