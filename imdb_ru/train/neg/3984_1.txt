I saw this film a few years ago on the BBC, I sat through it. How? I don't know, this is where the “bad” good diagrams are, Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman should cringe when they see it now. I think that Woody Allen would have done wonders with an outlandish plot, and Baldwin - Leslie Nelson could play this role with pleasure. Tonight he was on stage again, I tried to look at her again, but life is too short. The few minutes I watched were for beautiful Nicole, she was so hot around 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Pullman played his share in the exchange of a “good but dim” character, and the word “F” escaped from his mouth when the lady from “Fraser” mistakenly said that the detective accused him of murder, which sounds so wrong. stay away.
