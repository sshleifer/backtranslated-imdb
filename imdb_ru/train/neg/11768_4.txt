This reload is similar to McDonald's processed food compared to the very good, but very underrated 2003 Eng Lee The Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> Eng Lee's The Hulk is a comic book for a thinking person. Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does this, we see a conflict in the core of our main character. He does his best not to lose control, but, as he admits, when he does give up his rage, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this with the course of Edward Norton, where there is no conflict in his personality, and he turns into a Hulk when he becomes agitated, and his pulse rate reaches 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197 , and exactly 200). For this reviewer, it looked like the introduction of midi-chlorians in the “Ghostly threat”, which shows how strong “strength” is with one of them, as if mystical abilities can be assessed using a blood test. In the 2008 film, all Bruce Banner Ed Norton needs to do is keep his heart rate below 200, which is controlled by a device tied to his wrist. And, note, it is very difficult to gain a pulse rate of up to 200, even in a very exciting race, especially for a person with good physical condition. <br /> <br /> Emotions are driven by the Eric Bana Hulk. He suppressed the memory of his mother’s death and the role of his father in his youth. On the surface he is calm, but under him there is considerable anger, enough anger to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never intentionally kills, even his attackers. Mostly, he just wants to leave or be with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He disables his shooters and in one critical scene rescues a fighter stalking him from a collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, visual effects are present, but as needed. The plots (and there are a lot of them) are necessary for the plot, unlike the 2008 film, where the action is inserted for the sake of the action. <br /> <br /> In an effort to turn him into a “fugitive.” The story of Ed Norton loses attention to what Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. According to him, the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of the experiment. And Louis Leterrier, the director who captures Ed Norton's cue, cannot add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summarized as follows: Banner is pursued, and Hulk kicks ass, Banner is tightened, and Hulk kicks ass. Repeat as necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 film is that it may not be as true to the comics as the 2008 version. Nevertheless, even though I am a fan of comics, I would prefer a film that is not as true to comics as a fan’s dream, but in any case has a soul over comics - the correct, but fabricated and soulless 2008 version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is an excellent example of a film that is true to its roots from the comic book and has a heart.
