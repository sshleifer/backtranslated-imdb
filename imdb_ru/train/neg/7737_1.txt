Who in the world told Harrison Ford what is a good role for him ??? <br /> <br /> And Josh Hartnett ... as a 19-year-old who can't shoot a gun, becomes a policeman? Excessive clich√©s, plus zero character development, and about 15 meaningless cameos in the music industry are a surprisingly bad movie !!!
