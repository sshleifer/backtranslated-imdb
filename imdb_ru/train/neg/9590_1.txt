The film is based on a genuine 1950s novel. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a series of three “London novels”: “Absolute Beginners,” “City of Peaks,” and “Mr. Love and Justice.” I read all three. The first two are great. The latter is probably an experiment that failed. But the work of MacInnes is highly appreciated; and it is right. This musical - a novelist's nightmare - to see how the fruits of his mind turn into a brilliant, poorly acting, hypnotic one-dimensional apology of the film, which says that it reflects the spirit of London in the 1950s and does not do anything like that. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Colin McInnes was not alive to witness it.
