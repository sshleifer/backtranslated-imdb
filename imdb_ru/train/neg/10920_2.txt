It must have been one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with another commentator who said that the special effects were fine. I found them pretty bad: they just weren't realistic, and they were so fake that they just distracted from the real story. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this distraction is the reason why I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for "many." They did not bother to tell what a set is or what is so special about it. It also makes it unclear why they are looking for him in California, while the entry of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you make a film that happens in the desert, make an effort to actually go to the desert. The beginning - an ancient ceremony - looks like it was taken in a studio, not in a desert. <br /> <br /> The level of action was constant throughout the entire film, without ups and downs, without a climax. It made the film look short, and it is definitely a professional for this particular film.
