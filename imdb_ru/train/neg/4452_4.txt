Let's just say, I had to suspend my disbelief for Spider-Man than for hooligans. That is, I mean, I have fewer problems with the belief that Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than I, Elia Wood, has thrown violent blows in Manchester. I will not go into details, because I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​how adult, professional, British men get into death-waste every weekend, well ... funny. And this movie is not. The struggle, the idea of ​​struggle, is taken too seriously. The seriousness of the fist fight, the respect with which the subject is viewed, becomes annoying, as it does not establish or resolve a conflict. It seems that the plot, with holes large enough to drive a Guinness truck, was shot down with the invented theme "fish out of water", so that viewers can look into Woods tears as he learns how to become a man, striking the other people's opposite football taste, and then running away as quickly as possible. Cartoon characters, especially Americans at Harvard. Character development and storyline are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the entire picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its peak almost to the end, and by that time you have already spent almost two hours of your life that you will never return. Take the "Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this banal and disappointing rags. This is not a waste of time with an empty melodrama, a tired old "Yankee at King Aurtur's Court" or mean parables about coming of age. They are just pure, dark and smart. what should be violence.
