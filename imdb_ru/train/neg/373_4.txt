Blank Check is a movie that I saw on TV once, and like most of the movies they watch on TV, Blank Check was not so good. First of all, none of those whom I have ever met, have not seen the “Blank check”, including people who grew up in the 90s. In addition, the “Blank Check” will not be remembered in the 00s simply because it will be overshadowed by pixel films. I would not call “Blank Check” a bad film, but it’s also not very interesting. (Or, at least, it is not for someone older than 6 years) “Blank Check” is not an entertaining film, because there is nothing original in it. Everything just makes you go "what have I not seen this before?" “Blank Check” breaks down and tries to make money on everything: from Richie Rich to “Alone with Himself” (which is rather strange that both of them have Macaulay Culkin) “Blank Check” is a good film, but it deserves to disappear into obscurity.
