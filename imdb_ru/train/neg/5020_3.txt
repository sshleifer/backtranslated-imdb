This is the most convoluted IMDb entry that I haven’t encountered yet. All previous reviewers act as if it were a movie. This is NOT a movie. Rather, it’s just a feature that is optional on the DVD of The One. This is also not the 90 minutes indicated here. In fact, this is just over 13 minutes of how cool Jet Li can practice martial arts. and his reflections on the film. So yes, this entry in IMDb is quite a bit fubar. Do not listen to any of the other reviews, as they are ALL wrong. You can trust me, because I will never feed you, dear reader, B.S. / <br /> <br /> this is true. I think you can say that I am the “Only” reviewer who matters.
