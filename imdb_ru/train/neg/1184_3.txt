this movie had a pretty good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow ... really very slow. even if someone thinks that this is a cult classic, I think there are better quality films from that era that need to be watched. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is not very good, but not the worst. Sounds fine. The lighting is fine. <br /> <br /> I still would not recommend this to anyone except, perhaps, a student of the film. <br /> <br /> There is no music in the movie, and the horses have sex. make it good too. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was stupid. <br /> <br /> There is no win, miss this boredom. I have seen the worst, believe me, but it's just a waste of time, and I don't get good reviews here. especially high marks ...
