Dolph Lundgren plays the role of the Templar, who comes to New York when an archaeologist discovers the key that unlocks the Antichrist. Of course, the demon is only a couple of miles from Dolph and is not so easy to kill when it moves from body to body. (Like the Fallen without waiting) Of course, Lundgren is not in his element, and the film is completely invisible. I confess that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren, such as Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his films when they are on TV. I caught Mignon, and the boy was disappointed. This film is absolutely terrible. With such poorly thought out and poorly edited sequences of actions in the arena of battle, there is hardly any sense. Worst of all, Lundgren depressingly unconvincingly plays the role of the priest of the tough guy (!). All this worsened the fact that in the film such pranks from Fallen (which was good) and End Of Days (which was bad, but better than this) in general, this film is the worst movie I have seen with Dolph Lundgren. He literally nothing to recommend. This is terrible, and this is the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw the cover-up, the Last Warrior and the Lords of the Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Of 4- (Awful)
