After I watched and fell in love with Post (yes, I really loved Post), I decided to try another film by Uwe Boll and chose Seed because I accidentally stumbled upon it at a local DVD store, and it was supposed to be one of his best films. . <br /> <br /> Although the first 10â€“15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed to be the beginning of a not too massive psychological thriller, it soon went down and eventually turned into one of the most common slasher films that I seen so far, including a huge number of holes in the plot, unrealistic emotional reactions and acting skills. It seems that Ball tried his best to come up with a decent conspiracy, but after a while simply refused it. Maybe he should stick to comedy ?! A few good moments of this film are that it manages to create a general eerie atmosphere, that special effects are better than I expected, and the soundtrack blends well with the general atmosphere, but the unbalanced rhythm of this film combined with its overall nature makes it the last half hour rather tedious for observation, which completely ruined my experience. There are some pretty well done shocking scenes, but they seem to exist only for shocking value. And let's not forget about working with the camera, which sometimes caused nausea. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, once, Uwe Boll finds out what makes a good movie, because between a lot of horrible movies, he seems to be making a decent movie every now and then. The seed is simply not one of those.
