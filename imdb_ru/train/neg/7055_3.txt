Let's start by saying that “JAWANI DIWANI” is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said: "I missed the walk." lol <br /> <br /> The jokes were awful. The performances were average. Something went wrong with the movie. Emraan absolutely deserves something better. Everything that CELINA JAITLEY did was an expose. Rishitta Bhatt was fine. Emraan Hashmi also was fine. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. therefore, he uses RADHA and pretends that he loves her only because her father is the music director and can help him become famous (because the father obeys everything his daughter says). One day, Mann and his friends go to Goa to have fun. There he meets Roma (CELINA JAITLEY) and completely falls in love with her appearance and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then that night ROMA cannot open the door to her room, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he cannot either, ROMA turns for help. While she is gone, Mann is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sits on the bed of the BLA BLA BLAH. ROMA is coming, and they have one night. However, ROMA falls in love with this one bedside table. That morning, they notice the Don of the Underworld (MAHESH), who sees it all. Don loves Roma and hates what he saw. He orders them to get married, and, frightened, MANN obeys the order and ROMA Merry. Then their marriage news gets into the newspaper. Later, Mann learns that he loves ROMA after they together made a music video. Now he is trapped between love and glory. BLAH BLAH BLAH. <br /> <br /> the movie is terrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is also awesome. Guys, AVOID SEE THIS MOVIE.
