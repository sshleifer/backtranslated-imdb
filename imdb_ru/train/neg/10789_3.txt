If you expect to see a lot in the Altyoklar bath, as promised in the slogan, you will be very disappointed to see that the film consists only of Altyoklar’s ​​populist style, which deals with the most famous problems, such as sex, marriage and betrayal. To great nudity, which seems to come out of nowhere and in no way connected with the plot, proves that Altyoklar unsuccessfully tried to “try something new,” as he quoted. Many jokes about sex seem to show that Altyoklar fell in love with the well-known proverb “sex sells”. I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good storytelling technique. However, in the end, I found myself sitting for 90 minutes and watching the Altioclar experiment, but still too focused on popularization work.
