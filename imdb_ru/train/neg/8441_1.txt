This film was long and boring. It's amazing that he was chosen for Cannes, although they tend to love pretentiousness. The fact is that unlike other Dutch stars of the artistic genre, such as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. Moreover, he has no cinematic quality. A long start frame does not mean cinematic depth, it is just a long boring frame. The story was not interesting, and the characters had problems with which I could not identify at all. The actors did not shine under her leadership and at times seemed lost. Leopold tried, but she was not the talent I hoped for. Where is Kerhof and Kruishop? They really made some waves in Dutch cinema. Leopold just made another try.
