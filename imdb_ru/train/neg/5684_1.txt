poorly directed trash. mediocre nihilist sadistic grief ... if you are one of those people who like it ... see even if you are that person, he doesn’t make this movie good, the acting is really bad, the story is full of holes in the plot, the director should just give up find a real job because he has no talent for this. I understand why people do not like Uwe Boll. We have had several of his films lately, and this is the best of them, which is very sad! It seems that the complete absence of any kind of humanity suits some people, but here it just solves. Horror movies can be full of desolation, they can be miniature works of art, they can be just good watching when there’s nothing else on them ... SEED is really very poor.
