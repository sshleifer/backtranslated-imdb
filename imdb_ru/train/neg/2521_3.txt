This film has a number of problems, but the point is that he tried to do too much, too little. The basic story is pretty good, but there was simply no money to justify the story. A non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) has a loan for "Honey, I squeezed the children," which was a huge success. However, this film had serious monetary support from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when not to make a movie. If he had waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to make many of these effects. (not to mention that he could find a company with money.)
