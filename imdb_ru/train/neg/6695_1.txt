I have a thing for this Kari Chick, and as to how she looked in this film, there are no complaints. But after I caught him last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure: this is the only thing in the film that does not meet the standards. The script is terrible, the action is terrible, the direction is terrible. I saw in another comment that someone was commenting on how good the sex scenes were ... what? It's my pleasure. When the movie is bad, you can also just turn it into porn erotica, but instead I get to see some pasty white dude blocking me to see the body and the scenes that offer me nothing but to tease Wührer's. They just had to go to cinemax so that the movie was not a waste of time, but no. With such a terrible scenario, they should have benefited from the appearance of the Wührer, as this is the only professional film. 2/10, just because she looked so hot.
