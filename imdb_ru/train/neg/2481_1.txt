I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by these writing and directing efforts, he should keep his full-time job as an apprentice actor. Like many others here, I do not know how to classify this film, it was not scary or creepy, so it cannot be called horror, the plot was so thin that there could be no drama, there wasn’t Waiting, so it couldn’t to be a thriller, it's just a bad movie that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair Witch project. People who liked this movie used words such as ambiguity, complex and subtle, but they read something that was not there. Like Blair the Witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and realized that it was terrible. This film really began well with the family "meeting" the locals after hitting a deer. It looked like the liberation of the modern day, but then over the next 45 minutes (more than half of the film) nothing happened, the family paced around the house, which was very beautiful and stylish, but not the slightest interesting. It was obvious that at some stage the locals would be somehow involved, but Essendon clearly does not know how to create obscurity in the film. Finally, when something happens, it’s not even clear how the father was shot, how he was dying (the nurse said that his liver was only grazing), and all the time this Wendigo spirit clearly tracks the obvious shooter very clumsily with 3rd-class special effects. The film is called “Wendigo”, but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends up messy and leaves you very dissatisfied, I would help out 15 minutes before the end, but I wanted to see if this film could redeem itself, This is not true.
