Camp Blood III is a significant improvement on Camp Blood II, as it sounds mostly in the right places and in its infancy. This time they moved a little further away from the parking lot, on which two other films were shot, and this is a good step, since you can no longer hear cars passing by, which should be a distant desert. <br /> <br /> This time there is a reality show and a fake clown to scare off the participants. This is hardly a new idea, I saw at least three other horror films with the exact same premise where the real killer appears, but at least it has a plot, instead of people just being accidentally stabbed. <Br /> <br /> Unlike the other two of this series, this one is at least good for a few laughs. I liked how the sound effect of the shot was heard when someone was injured with a knife, and how the boom microphone hides behind people like a ghost. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know why anyone would want to make a third blood camp movie, I would think it would be better to start from scratch, but at least they tried with that. A half-naked, deformed woman was a little bit to me, it seems they were trying to maintain continuity by hiring a freak who would take off her clothes for $ 5, as they did in the second film. They still have not figured out that machetes are used to cut, not prick, but oh well, this is a film from Camp Blood, what do you expect? If you like shit movies, you will enjoy it.
