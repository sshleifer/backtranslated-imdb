From the pen of Richard Condon (the Manchurian candidate in 1962) this intricate story of political intrigue and murder appears. The story told in the fashion of almost comics is hard to swallow. Considered the cast of stars, this bad effort is not entirely a mistake of the actors and the team: the novel was full of the same flaws. It seems that sometimes the story actually teases the more sincere efforts put forward in the Manchurian Candidate. Disappointment on all counts.
