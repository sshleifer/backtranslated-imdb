This kind of "inspiring" saccharin is enough to make you sick. He conveys his feelings as the largest semaphore on earth. He removes his own interpretation and feelings from the audience, making the choice for him. The big end is swimming in a weeping orchestration that should work like a lintel on a dead car; I suppose you will need such an impulse to feel that you are stupid enough to watch such a simple and bold film. The strip glows and you wonder if it really demonstrates the depth of the sensation or is it just a display turned on and off like light. Because I can't see for the rest of her life how she could find life in such a dirty film. Despite the fact that it is based on a true story and inspiring, I am sure that the staging, performance and performances play in the third grade of a television film or a hesitant school drama.
