Watching how he lives at night makes you wonder who in the world is burning with this crap? Newlyweds go on a honeymoon, attack bats, and the husband begins to run in his pajamas, attacking different people. And where exactly are they? They are in the desert, then they ski, then they are in a small town that seems to have mountains nearby. The city is governed by a sheriff who loves to watch and has a personal vendetta against a tearful doctor boy. The ski hospital is managed by a really great guy with a nice thick mustache, and his wife is like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension, and the ending will leave you filled with anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston has made the effects for this film. I think you should start somewhere.
