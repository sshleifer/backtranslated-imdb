Ben Masters, (Kid Thomas), "The Lover of Dreams," 86th, plays a kind of Mike Hammer character, a private eye that does any old work for a dollar and never misses all the sexy curves of pretty girls. Kidd makes one big mistake when stopping Morgan Fairchild (Laura Cassidy / Eva Bomberg), "Arizona Summer", 73 from beatings and rapes. Kid takes Laura home to her notebook, and when he wakes up, she walks out of his patio, eats his eggs and orange juice and feels at home. By the way, Kid sleeps in her bed, and Laura was sleeping on the couch for this particular scene. Laura is mixed with all kinds of hoods, and there are several hot scenes between Kid and Laura. Everything is said and done, this is a lousy picture, and I bought a DVD for only 1.5 dollars, and it really ripped me off!
