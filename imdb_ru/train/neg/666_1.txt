I saw this trailer and thought to myself: “My God, this film is for real, who would like to watch this film, and at the same time I thought that my girlfriend turned to me and said:“ We have to go see this film ". .. he said enough, so I saw it for about 5 minutes, and I tried to boldly put on my face and enjoy the cheap fright, but they were not even there. It should be one of the worst films I've ever seen, the director has no influence, there is no perspective, the same shots are used again and again, he did not create tension, because the cast probably just said that he shouted, scream, run, fall. I would really like to see the script, since the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying giggles of girls and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... well, there was no plot, it was basically I know that we will terrorize the school group in their prom night with a serial killer of stalkers, it's great! hmmm In the Australian soap opera, you were expecting acting skills, the main character of the god Blondi, which annoyed me. her longest line must have been half the sentence, and each time she was filmed in front of the camera, she just stuck out another rude expression on her face. <br /> <br /> Please listen to me, if you have some taste in a movie, do not go watch it, and if you love me and you have no choice, then I wish you good luck, maybe smuggling in ipod or magazine. Can't believe this movie is made!
