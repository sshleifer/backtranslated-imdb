The disappearance is due to a couple who take their family on a vacation in New Mexico and get into big trouble after driving off the main road to visit the city, which apparently was abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons. The city of Weaver at first seems harmless and attracts tourists until the family is there overnight, and they have good reason to suspect that others have experienced the same difficult situation with a fatal outcome. The Henleys is watching a Blair-Witch-Project-esquire video diary, left by the last victim of the city, who ironically shows the best performance of everyone in this film. Although the performances of Hamlin and Day are much better than those of the actors, their emotional impact seems “flat” to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> “The Disappearance” attracts much of the film, as it has a lot of tension and good direction. However, the plot takes unexpected and improbable turns, which would seem to make no sense. Worst of all, there is actually no understanding of what exactly is happening in the film, which makes the strange ending less tolerable. It seemed to me that the filmmakers were so focused on creating a stream of disturbing scenes that they rejected all the elements of creating a good plot: plot development, a gradual explanation of the themes and symbols that lead to an agreed decision / result. <br /> <br /> The most difficult aspect of the film for me was that the first three quarters of the film were spent increasing tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot, which then suddenly disappeared, as if we had not done so . does not deserve an explanation: <br /> <br /> What significance did Indian symbols have on the walls? What happened to the original Weaver people? What was the connection with people at dinner? What did the sheriff know? What did the missing boy discover if anything? <br /> <br /> This was, I believe, a bad move, as it caused some resentment. I have invested a lot of mental abilities in the hypothesis of some plausible explanations of some of these plot twists and strange events, only for the directors to just do this without giving an answer to any of these things. These are some good cliffhangers for the mini-series finale, which is again set up next week, but a completely disappointing and inappropriate final for a separate movie.
