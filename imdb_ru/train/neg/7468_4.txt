Probably the only thing that gave me the film to four, is that I love Peter Falk. One of the greatest in the world depicting awkward incompetence. , and yet it is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster. Like Pops Romano, he provides a respectable combination of gangster charm and a direct man with manic stupidity of Chris Kattan. Richard Roundtree in the role of an agitated boss also offers respectable performances, Vinessa Shaw in the role of a talented female FBI agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling, and Fred Ward as an adviser to Falk and Benedict Arnold. <br /> <br /> In fact, the concept of the plot has some excellent possibilities and, in the hands of the young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, could prove to be an excellent comedy. The Kattan, who seems to have idolized Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, simply creates confusion. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray their brothers inadequacies, both fall far short of their proven abilities. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but there are too few of them and they are separated by too many boring ones. What I really miss here is something that has always attracted me to Leslie Nielsen films. There is no "second level" of wit riding above farce. No cultural links that only adults receive. There is no double meaning. , it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And by the way, this is not all means that I recommend it for your 9-year-old child, because I hope they have better taste and less enthusiasm for some of their body parts and their functions.
