First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle, and I was so excited when I saw the movie for one of my favorite books, Wrinkle in Time. This film, however, ruined this excitement for me. Sorry, but Meg is described in the book as effervescent curls and glasses and is considered not very cool. In the film, she has straight hair and no glasses, and she is of a "sports type" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle portrayed Meg. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and portrayed what she felt when she was little. This is just one important example of how a book and a film differ from each other. Therefore, I would say that if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it, but if you are a devoted admirer of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest skipping this film.
