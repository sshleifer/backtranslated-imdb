Being a fan of films such as Fire Sale, Where's Dad, Airplane, I saw it because it was mentioned in the context of real comedies and satyrs like the above. Well, WRONG CONCLUSION! <br /> <br /> Not only is it not funny, but it makes you angry, because it is not bad in a perverse, pleasant, but very bad sense. This is bad, bad. The script does not contain any funny lines, which, rather, prevents you from entertaining humor with your audience. <br /> <br /> Adam Arkin’s speech difficulty is probably the most annoying thing in this film. However, this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from being smug throughout the entire film, and it is difficult for him not to look into the camera. This amateur without charisma fits perfectly into the constant errors of continuity and clumsy plot - if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think about Je Leno, another late night talk show person who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen a few films about Leno, and he is Lawrence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good. In a few lines that he gave. It’s not so easy to scare me bad comedies, so I kept looking and looking for all the quasi-jokes every 5 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> The film actually becomes a kind of comedy, as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - he literally does: starting at 75 minutes of the film, he's in every scene. But this is too little, too late. <br /> <br /> When films try to deceive you, believing that their professionalism is the reason why you should love them because they have the right intentions, they remind me of students who are not prepared for the exam. In these cases, you must remain strict, and the assessment must be “F”. (But please do not think that I am a teacher. This is a profession with respectability somewhere between a politician and a child molester). <br /> <br /> If you're really looking for a cute horror / fiction shlock movie that is fun to watch and contains jokes, try Bruce Campbell's The Screaming Brain Man. Or see Sunshine / Core if you prefer a modern, loud, shallow SciFi Schlock. This is equally ridiculous, albeit unwittingly.
