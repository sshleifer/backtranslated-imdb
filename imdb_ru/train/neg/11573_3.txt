Last night I came here to watch, before deciding which television movie was worth watching, and those I found made this film unattainable. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> First, you need to immediately point out that this is a very daily film for a housewife. The performances are wooden, each sentence is an attempt at “sharp,” as is always the case in housewife day movies and in poor soap operas, and it is based on this predictable and well-trodden premise that men (especially soldiers) are essentially violent and incompassionate. The whole film is about the "drama", which manifests itself in moments when male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If this sounds tolerable (or even pleasant) to you, then be careful. Linda Hamilton's German accent, although quite a good one, is distressingly distracting - just like her face, for some reason. Other performances, no doubt, are a constant source of embarrassment for their performers, with painfully subtle and obvious characteristics that are commonplace of the day. There are few surprises, but watch out for the endless supply of Monty Paytonesk food and drinks that miraculously emerge from the packs of hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I did not expect action, but I was hoping for a beautiful or textural or emotionally charged one. What I received was a particularly bad Christmas story about a “good mood,” in which a reasonable audience would cling to the predation of all this. <br /> <br /> Look at this under the following circumstances: 1: Nothing more. 2: You are a fan of the predictable "housewife shoots men and wins" television films. 3: The only way to appreciate the real story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You have absorbed enough nog so that your emotions can easily be stirred up by a simple story telling.
