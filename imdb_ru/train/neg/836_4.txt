A dedicated fan of TLK films, the first of which is a landmark, and the second, perhaps, the best sequel created by Disney, along with this film ... Now I do not argue with animation, voice acting, music, but no more than timon / pumba screw in the atmosphere TLK. Although this is not bad, it adds nothing. In fact, this film is one big joke ... and that's all that saves him. Make a real TLK3, Disney! There is potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
