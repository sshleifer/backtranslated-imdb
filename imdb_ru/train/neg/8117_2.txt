“Awful People” should be a subhead of this horrible movie. If you want ordinary people to do ordinary things, look out the window for real life. But if you want to see how unpleasant people do boring things, you’ll have to watch this terrible Mike Lee movie. The characters talk for a long time, but in fact they never manage to communicate with each other. Why not? Supposedly, because Lee does things that we are all as ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to shoot in real life. But we are not, and he could not.
