Black and white film. Nice photo. Believable characters. <br /> <br /> Just awful. <br /> <br /> I wasted another fine evening watching a movie that others rated as "worthy" and "very good." There is a good game here, and the background of the plot is good (this would need more work), but it grows very slowly and never develops. It is completely based on sex without much romance and extra nudity. More could be done with the protagonists. If you are looking for something to watch with your family, it’s not in the film, and if not, you’ll have trouble watching it. Although this film is long, its depth is only about 1 inch!
