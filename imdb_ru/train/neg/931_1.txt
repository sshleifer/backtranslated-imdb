I can not believe that this wooden written and directed piece of movie cliches was made. There are about four good shots (the director should think about switching to photography) and that's it. A strong cast is completely useless, the scenes are constantly ending in the most interesting moments, and the script does not say anything new. Please save yourself from this movie.
