I just saw this movie and did not read the book. A good feature of the film is that in some parts it makes you think a little about the spiritual theme, evolution, synchronicity and your role in the world. <br /> <br /> However, immersion in the film is easily broken. and there is very little understanding between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses a lot in this version of the film. Events that were supposed to demonstrate what is happening are almost unrecognizable. It is necessary to argue a lot so that the viewer sees that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more, in order to imagine that it has something to do with a larger goal. <br /> <br /> Enlightened scenes are visually poor and do not create a better feeling than expected. Do you remember enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, it is not. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are poorly executed. There are many scenes that really do not develop the story, and also do not help create an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The best actors in this film, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, cannot save this. The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters trying to save the film, and because they were paid more, but this does not work. Most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does good in his scenes and sells like an evil guy (as always), but the script does not help him in everything. The scene where he first tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is just a bad scenario. The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is ridiculously poorly executed. Memories throughout the film are not even commented. <br /> <br /> In general, this film takes a long time, read the book! I have not read it, but probably a billion times better than this. <br /> <br /> This is so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.
