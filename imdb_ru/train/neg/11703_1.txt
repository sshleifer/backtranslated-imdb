You will notice that a chemist who appears in two scenes and starts talking is played by Stephen King. “Don't give up your day job” is a standard thing to say, but it’s unfair. King justifies himself well enough: he is no worse than any other cast member and better than most. On the other hand, this story is just nonsense. Please leave your day job. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many horrible performances, of which, probably, the worst of the main roles (LEAD ACTOR'S!) I gathered in one film. Everyone acts humbly, but not in an entertaining manner; they all somehow manage to go upstairs without spending or showing energy. I blame writer / director Tom Holland. It cannot be that ALL actors are REALLY so bad. What are the odds against it? Admittedly, I had never heard of any of them before, but, nevertheless, I didn’t think that I could go to a talent agency and go out with so many bad performers if I tried: to have talent . So what's more likely - that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then poorly directed it? It also explains why actors are bad in direct proportion to their importance in the script. The more direction the actor received, the worse he performed. (“You want me to bend over like a hunchback, talk from the depths of my throat, show all my teeth and look boring, all at the same time? Good ...”) <br /> <br /> This is Theory confirmed by the fact that Holland undoubtedly managed to jointly write a lousy script. Some authors here commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a cute character, but it is misleading the way to express it. He is not a recognizable character. All that we learn about him before the supernatural begins to happen is that he is fat and that he can only think about food. (“All I can think about is food,” he tells us helpfully.) And in the end ... <br /> <br /> (sighs) I suppose I should put a spoiler warning here .. . <br /> <br /> In the end, he becomes evil. What for? I can only shrug. Perhaps he is under some charm. Yes it is possible. By “evil”, perhaps, I mean “inexplicable” - this is not so much harm as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary psychology of end goals. In any case, his actions at the end have no meaning, the actions of no one make much sense, and this is despite the fact that the characters do little, but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience. <br /> <br /> By the way, here is my candidacy for the most modest line / delivery: “I don’t think you will like it. Actually ... "[big dramatic pause]" ... I don't think you would like it at all. "
