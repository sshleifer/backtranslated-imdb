Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, thick words about it, and Harrison Ford in the comedy of police friends! Here are three reasons to hate him, avoid him and better use 116 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> Movies with friends is fun. However, their real golden age was in the 1980s and 1990s. Creating what tries to mix action and comedy through the Hollywood police itself is undoubtedly a good idea, but the end result was not at least a deception of a sub-genre, but a reason to ask God to pardon all past films of the same kind, while the worst of them it was by all means more than (Hollywood Murder). <br /> <br /> What really happened to this entertaining formula ?! For a whole decade, everything was wrong. You would have a stubborn flop for the interlocutor after another. I will please you with some titles to understand this disaster well: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004), and the worst of them is still (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> I suppose that one of the reasons is a natural event of saturation after many similar cinematographic films and television shows for the past two decades. Add to this, especially here, carelessness and boring humor. In fact, this time is absolutely unbearable. Yes, we have the characters of 2 faithful cops, who have a second job, and the background of a sinful city, but what else was new ?! This is not a cliché; We are talking about several updates, mixed with clichés, where both were made poorly. <br /> <br /> The game, especially from Hartnett, is terrible. This guy is not a comedian (or an actor!). So his character wanted to avenge the death of his father! Revenge for himself, man, he probably died from watching your game !! Even small roles made people who have nothing to do with comedy (or this is what they seemed to be here, anyway!). <br /> <br /> The direction is not able to present something comic or so sharp, some parts were very boring (to arrest the black guy due to the lack of ??); This is a rare time to be boring in what should be a fighter / comedy! They did not use Hollywood itself, be it an ironic place where an ugly face hides behind the surface charm, or even a place full of shining or fallen stars (cameos that could give him some interesting moments). <Br /> <br /> This is a very light film that was broadcast due to the fact that it was watched only by the glamor of its stars, and like the film “Buddy-Policeman”, which ended up being one of the worst cases with two stars with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself! Guess who ?!), and the destroyer Buddy the cop is more than a movie! God, don't make me or my children live long enough to be witnesses (Hollywood killing ?? Part 2)! Finally, look at the performance of Harrison Ford, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we did not.
