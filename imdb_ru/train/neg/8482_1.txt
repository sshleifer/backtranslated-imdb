Some of my old friends suggested that I watch this film, but I got a chance just recently. I had high hopes of seeing something interesting from Kamal Hans, what I saw was a bunch of camera angles mixed at high speed. I could not understand what was the message, except for the humiliating Hinduism. I look more like many religious figures, but I felt that Kamal Hassan was a man of low character who organized such thoughts. He could have made a horror movie than this nonsense. He tried to add the Hollywood genre of viruses, and God forbid, he did not turn this guy into a mutant and, ultimately, is going to go on world domination. This is a very suitable film for film schools versus ordinary public. Shame on him because he could not bear his talent. At the beginning of the story, Chaos tried to borrow ideas from the Butterfly effect, and then between small religious harmony at the cost of insulting Hinduism. this film is intellectual.)
