I think the biggest drawback can be boring. The bad is actually better than the boring. This thing has no breath. This has an interesting fact taking place in Cambodia. How many American films of the 30s are shot in Cambodia. However, the conflict there is a little harder to understand. Even troop movements are a bit confusing. What pulls it to a deafening stop is a love story. Why these two guys are so shocked at the blonde blonde, I do not know. I thought he should continue to use his zombies (like them) and forget everything about her. The film is just having fun. The ideal microcosm is when one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to a secret place where hieroglyphs (or something else) are stored explaining how to turn people into zombies. I thought they would never get there. One guy takes two steps. He stopped. He looks around. Another guy is hiding behind columns. He takes two steps. He stopped. He looks around. The other guy is hiding behind the bushes. This is a film in a nutshell. Then there is bad acting and tasteless dialogue. I'm actually very patient when it comes to films B. This one is unbearable. By the way, the more successful name would be "The Rise of the Hypnotized."
