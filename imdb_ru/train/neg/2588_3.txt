Band Camp was terrible, The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third straight to DVD in the American Pie franchise seems to be of the same quality as its predecessor. In fact, Eric Stifler (John White) broke up with his girlfriend after losing her virginity, and now he and Mike Kuzeman Kuzeman (Jake Segel) join cousin Eric Dwight (Steve Telly) in college. With the promises of many parties, plenty of booze and enough hot chicks at Beta House, they have only fifty listed tasks that need to be done to become official privileged members. But the threat becomes apparent when rivals, GEK ("Geek") House, led by nerds (and junk) power hungry Edgar (Tyrone Savage), are offered more and better than Beta. To settle this once and for all, Beta and Huck enter into battle with the forbidden, for forty years, Greek games to defeat each other, with the loser. The last champion of the games, Noah Levenshtein, who is also Jim's dad (the only regular Eugene Levy), runs the show, which shows people unbuttoning bras, gladiatorial duels, floating on the water, catching a smeared pig, Russian roulette in the mouth with cartridges of an elderly horse spanked the wife carried and drank a full barrel of alcohol (without nausea without disqualifying). It all ends in a sudden death, when the guy is dancing on the stripper's lap, and they are forced to resist ending, Beta House wins when Edgar ends up with a girl dressed up like a sheep on her lap. Also starring Christopher MacDonald as Flubber as Mr. Stifler, Megan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronievich as Bull, Nick Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshan Hulbert as Sarah Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andrei Pankris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Roka. The amount of nudity is very slightly increased, as is the harshness of the jokes, and I can assume that it is rated by one star out of five, but I like it. Adequate!
