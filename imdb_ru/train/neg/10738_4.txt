It was a blind purchase of a used DVD. It completely killed the good buzz I heard when I got into the game. <br /> <br /> This is a comedic head, but this is um. miserable. The plot is ZANY !, but the characters make things with each other so small, agitated and conveniently invented, that I eventually find it dull to look at. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the box makes me expect something bigger, an uneven, dull caper film. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box and the Oscar nomination) mean nothing.)
