This reworking of Anthony Schafferâ€™s classic play did not last long in cinemas. Having recently experienced this by telegram, I still congratulate myself on not spending money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Law are deceiving themselves that their prestige alone can sustain this parody for endless 93 minutes without fun or a class of a longer original. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine strengthened his reputation by playing second in a beautiful 1972 film. Now he seems determined to destroy him, trying to play the main role played in this version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Oscar-Best Actor, but lost to Marlon Brando in the DIVINE REST film.) Looking swollen and washed up, Kane slides on a role with less depth than he shows, like Batman's butler. He had already gone down before the guest appeared in the cruel remake of GET CARTER. What's next - Alfi II or the Son of a Man Who Was the King? <br /> <br /> But then no one benefits from this senseless adaptation of Pinter, who believes that frequent curses and an extra sexual angle can compensate for the lack of ingenious interaction of Schaffer with the characters. The Branagh Guide relies on bluish lighting and soulless scenery design that a second-rate nightclub would not stand. Neither the shadows nor the narrow, overly close-ups can help Lo overcome his boring screen persona. The result is the failure of both a direct drama and a detective thriller, almost making you forget the goal behind the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original stage production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Kane's film would be well regarded this company as a bad dream. The late Mr. Schaffer, who wrote the script of 1972, as well as the adaptation of Hitchcock FRENZY and several adaptations of Agatha Christie, must be in the grave, wishing that he could plan a real murder or two!
