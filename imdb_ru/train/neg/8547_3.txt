It was a rather creepy movie; I found music to be effective for this. Photos taken by Mario from the village were also unnerving. However, I had three problems with this film. First, the lighting was very dark, so sometimes it was hard to tell what was happening, but maybe it was just my copy. Secondly, the beginning itself is not very well explained, and I am still not sure what is happening there. The third problem is that I did not understand the ending, but apparently some people understand. Of course, there are the usual problems of people who do stupid things, and the male leadership is very 70 years old. In general, it is watchable, but not even close to be a favorite.
