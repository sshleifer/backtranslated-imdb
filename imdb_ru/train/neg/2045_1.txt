This film must have been the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and got this one by accident. thought it was a joke before the real movie. it was awful, I waited for it to get scary, and it never did. In this film there were no real facts about the real killer of the zodiac. The filmmakers obviously did not even bother to investigate the murders ... they only liked the title ... so they decided to write a script that has nothing to do with his name. I'm upset, I did not understand that it was not a movie before. I try to like something in every movie, I don't hate movies ... never ... except this one. If you had not given him stars, I would have done exactly that. 1 out of 10
