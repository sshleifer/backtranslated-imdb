This film deserves work on Mystery Science Theater. Although it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth seeing because it is an unintended ridiculous riot. Indeed! This is worse than "Destroy all the monsters." Be sure to check out the following: the cheese locket (there seemed to be Schreiners), the obviously Norfolk polyester jacket in Allan Quatermain, David Macallam's poorly made stuttering (which distracts from his even worse game), an incredibly bad process working with all the “monsters” , by the monsters themselves - a puppet that threatens a little girl, a giant snake that threatens McAllum while he drowns in oatmeal, red eyes on motorized crabs, an amazingly cheerful boat (oh brother !!) that seems to be made of ners, established at the old dredge sand, and similar to the remains of the young. prom night (“Journey to the future with a class of 71 years old”), a Phoenician city where they wear armor of the Roman Empire, but in which inexplicably there is an Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet - come on!), and, worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with her frightened wig) play in a capricious face - oh, horror! The best part is that fearless researchers manage to lose the comic Frenchman, and the African guy — Snuffleupagus or something else — obviously decided to die heroically, and not be in any scenes.
