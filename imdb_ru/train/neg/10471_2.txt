Honestly, Omega Code is the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. For the first 30 minutes, I sat dumbfounded in my place, trying to decide whether I should request a refund. But since I did not pay to see it in the first place (passes), I thought that I could also stay. And I did not think it could get any worse. <br /> <br /> And so it happened. I will quickly go over low points (including some spoilers): the terrible misprediction of Casper Van Dien as Jillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two doctors of science. The characteristic was controversial; for example, Lane, despite his authority, is a complete fool. Then there is the inappropriate portrayal of the fulfillment of biblical prophecies; we see a lot of sensational sound fragments of news, accompanied by ridiculous computer printouts of translated biblical code. In addition, the terrible sequence of "actions": Lane breaks out of difficult situations without explaining the reasons, and once Lane is really in danger, he turns out to be a sequence of dreams! This is nice for writing assignments in the gymnasium, but this is an unforgivable plot device in a movie. The step was bad: after a long opening, the first third of the film changes scenes every 90 seconds. Later, the pace improves, but there are still too many unnecessary jumps around. And as someone else mentioned, years go by, but no one (not even Laneâ€™s youngest daughter) is getting older. It was confusing. <br /> <br /> Although there are a few good things. The quality of the film (for example, lack of grain) is high and very attractive. Outdoor shots were well done, and on-site shots added realism. In addition, there are several moments in the last part of the film when Lane calls on God (finally) to help him - it turned out to be quite exciting - even for me, a person who does not accept Jesus as his personal savior. But I liked it, because it seemed to me the only authentic scene in the film. Unfortunately, this was followed by serious incomprehensibility. <br /> <br /> Characters, dialogue, direction and action were ALL poorly done. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird. I think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot were more dense and more focused, and the characteristics more clear, the film would be much better. <br /> <br /> In short, the Omega code is disappointing. Definitely don't pay to see it. I give it ** out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
