What should be a simple, common, mysterious storyline involving a dead philanthropist is actually a headache story about a group of characters (the only major actor is Ginger Rogers, in a very early role), everyone is trying to find a Killer among a small group of residents in a chic residential building. These characters range from completely stupid to frankly mean. As a cheap, low-budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and its leader (some guy, I donâ€™t care who he is because he really sucks), talking about their various possibilities of solving a crime, being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with a head in the ass. Honestly, I never had a worse time when I watched an old movie with a b-rate of this type, and I saw a few real thugs. <br /> <br /> Oh, but the butler did not do this because there was no butler. But pay attention to the guy who is closest to the butler. Here you are. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
