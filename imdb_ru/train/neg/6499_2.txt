What a mess I saw with a friend some time ago, and we both consider ourselves open-minded to many of the wonders of cinema, but this is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it is very good that there may be something good ideas / concepts and, of course, there are good results (in the given circumstances), all this is buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony draws too much from the same gene pool as "Natural Born Killers", "At the Turn" and similar films as far as editing, or perhaps he was watching himself in Nixon for inspiration. Tell me what you want from David Lynch, but at least he most often has a method for insanity. <br /> <br /> His quote that he made a movie in jest, speaks for itself. It is not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
