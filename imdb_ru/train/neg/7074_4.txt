My God, this film is terribly boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I was shooting this film, I was expecting a romantic drama and a great Gershon performance. Gershon is, as always, gorgeous, but she is not an appropriate actress for this role, she is too good for Rade Serbedzia. The romance between the heroes of Gershon and Serbijia is too unconvincing. And I absolutely hated the hero of Serbedzia (organizer vonmena), he is not charming in any case in the film. As Dr. Lauren, Graham (Gershon) is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert De Niro or Harrison Ford would have done better with this role, but I think they donâ€™t look like Europeans. Anyway, I was so bored watching a movie. If you're looking for a good film about Gene Gershon, watch Bound, her best movie at the moment. If you're looking for a romantic film about a young woman and an older man, try movies about Harrison Ford or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon is so underestimated, and she deserves a greater chance than this, I wish her to make a better choice in the future.
