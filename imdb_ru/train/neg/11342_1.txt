I have to explain why I gave this ... "work of art" a 1-star rating out of 10. Just because it is difficult or almost impossible to evaluate it unbiased. it would probably be the same if I gave it 10/10 - in any case, explanations would follow. <br /> <br /> I don’t like such meaningless blood films like HOSTEL or so - I think it's disgusting and rather awful (in all possible contextual meanings), but as I learned after watching this movie - there is a genre called “historical drama” - and it would probably be the case of 10/10, since there is a lot of Tarantino in it and it would be more than happy (and made Kill Bill 3 shed more blood on the screen than here to show that it is possible). but the peculiarity of the “historical drama” genre is that it is a subcategory of “junk films” where John Romero is a dead man, a bloody emperor, and therefore it cannot be automatically rated as your default movie - as these are films that are specially made bad, and you can't say for sure if such a comically bad moment had to be, or if it was just a bad one. This is for people who like to enjoy a bad game, a bad scenario and bad everything else. And by some degree of faith - I am also one of them. There are days when I have a desire to watch a really bad movie and look for some rubbish, and now, please, the day is saved! but this is definitely my opinion and does not match anyone else. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that if you want to watch some awful movie, then Casanova Fellini is definitely a choice, but listen to my advice and do not evaluate it by default.
