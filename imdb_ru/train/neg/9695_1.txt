A WARNING! Do not even think to watch this film in any form. It is not even worth downloading from the Internet. Every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid. The so-called filmmakers, apparently, absolutely do not know how to shoot a film. They could not tell a good joke to save their lives. This is an insult to any person. If you are looking for a funny movie - look somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Mr. Unterwald (“the youngest” is a good sign of his apparent inexperience and intellectual childhood) is dying a slow / painful death, and NEVER shoots the film again. <br /> <br /> In fact, even WRITING ANYTHING about this shit, I’ll stop right now and watch a good movie. ,
