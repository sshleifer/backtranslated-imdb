Totally forgettable. Especially because of the weak acting. This is the first film I saw with Dux Shepard. To my surprise, it has existed since the end of the 90s. I thought he was new, since his game was so soft. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I saw her doing well in other films, she gave Claire Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the actress who would give the character a fiery, emotional personality, as Diane Keaton could, but it was rather strange to see her speak in a whisper. It seemed that in general there was simply no good chemistry between the actors, and I think that Diana Keaton felt it too. She is a fantastic actress, but in this film she looked just too much. It seemed to me that she just wanted to finish this film as soon as possible. I wouldn't blame her.
