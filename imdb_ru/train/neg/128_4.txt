This film, once sensational because of its visionary policies and images of free love and sexual liberation, eventually turned into just curiosity. Now it seems absurd that this boring little film was banned and withdrawn by the governments of many countries. Considering how socialist Sweden eventually became, the “radicalism” of its policies, once controversial, seems naive and almost dominant four decades later. And his sex scenes, once the subject of sensational tests of obscenity, look rather dull in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and its accompanying documentaries, detailing its many contradictions and influences, remain marginally noticeable as an early relic of the 60s youth revolt. One part of the film that still holds: his self-awareness of the “fourth wall”. From time to time, the filmmakers make their own film. The satirical playfulness of this still causes a chuckle.
