Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. He usually gives solid performances, such as the Straight Story and the Gray Fox. He also does a good job here, but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget, poor writing, and so-so photos of the Miller-Kino formula gives him 4. Richard gets 5.
