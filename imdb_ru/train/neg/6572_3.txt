In my opinion, the name of this film should be changed from “Only Brave” to “All About the Lane”. I went to this movie a few months ago and was very disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate the fact that the director made a film about the people of 442, a subject that has long deserved consideration in the film industry, the action in some parts of the film was rather stale. The performances of Mark Dacascos, Tamlin Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were great. However, the director should never put himself in the role of the protagonist of the film. Sorry, Lane, you're just not a film actor. Adhere to what you are good at - theater acting. Gina Hiraizumi’s performance in this film was also terrible. She should never have been given a talking role, and her appearance was unsuitable to play the role of the queen Miss Nisei. There were other young actresses in the film who were really beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were they not chosen for this role? Another serious problem with this film is the sequence of its actions. Japanese-American soldiers don't look as if they are fighting German soldiers ... not to mention anyone. Of course, it was an article with a low budget, but since it was a war film, isn’t it important to show battles? This film was a worthy attempt, but certainly not worth serious distribution.
