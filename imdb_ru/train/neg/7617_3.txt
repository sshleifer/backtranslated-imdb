This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but the Hostel is definitely much worse. This film is more funny and funny than scary. I laughed most of the time when I watched it. The effects of poor quality (when you watch it, you understand what I'm talking about, and HOW low quality), bad actors (I hear about them for the first time), and it seems that it was filmed by the amateur camcorder (itâ€™s more like TV shows, than the movie). But at least I had the patience to watch it to the end. Like comedy? Watch it Want horror? Watch Ju-On: The Grudge or some other good horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I'm talking about the Legend of Diablo, I don't even know if I can relate it to the horror genre. Just a little low-budget shit. <br /> <br /> I rate this 3 out of 10
