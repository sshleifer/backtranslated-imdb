I almost never comment on films, but I saw 5 glowing reviews of this “film” and decided that I needed to weigh my own review. My teacher received this film by mail, mixed it with the audience of the Academy (AMPAS, in other words, the guys who vote for Oscar), and was so amazed at how badly this film was designed that he brought it to our class to show us how to NOT make a movie. <br /> <br /> In this film there is no plot, the scenes are horribly, horribly edited (often using artificial “picture in picture” methods in the style of “24”), as well as actions (especially the main role, which is not even able to behave like a bad actress) for the most part nasty. Someone really could not understand the meaning of the introduction, namely, the setting of the plot. There is no setting! In the middle of the film, neither I nor the rest of the class knew what this film was supposed to be about. Shooting the opening crane, which sets up some kind of murder, is never considered, and now, when I think about it, it may have been assumed that this will be a retrospective, and the rest of the film will be a memory, but this passage from this Scene directly to the next one without no indication as such. <br /> <br /> Bah, I really could go on and on. At least this film gives me confidence in my own abilities to make movies.
