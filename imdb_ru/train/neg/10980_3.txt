Really scary movie. It seems as if it was done in the early 90s with a straight-line who wanted to show that gays are good, normal people who are striving to mainstream. Retrograde to the point of insulting, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred escape route for sad, lonely, madly in love with gays. Blimey! Who knew? Auxiliary characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (effeminate jester, bitter lonely queen, bastard, etc.), And the main characters are clones of dairy grade, middle class, medium height and little interesting. /> With regard to the romantic and ideological struggle of the main couple, there is nothing special to say: we have already seen all this and have done much better.
