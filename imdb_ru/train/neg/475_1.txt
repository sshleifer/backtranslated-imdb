One of the most disgusting films I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching. I saw this film in my American history lesson, and my goal was to look at the farmerâ€™s life in the West in the late 1800s. What we saw was that the pigs were shot and then slaughtered, a human birth, a branding. Yes, and at the end there was a live birth to a calf, and let me tell you that the birth itself was not too bad, but the many fluids that came out pushed most people in my class into the bathroom. The story itself was fine. The premise of this story is the widow and her daughter, and they are moving west to be the housewife of this cowboy. They live a difficult life, and this is a rather interesting and accurate picture of life in the West in the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, do not watch this movie.
