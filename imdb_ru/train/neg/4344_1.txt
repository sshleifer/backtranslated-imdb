If you hit the shovel on the head, write the script with your feet, you can get close to the intelligence level of this film. There is nothing in this film that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster films and has done much better. Those who think that “Scarface” was some kind of hero who you can watch or see “Goodfellas”, “Society of Threat II” or “Dead Presidents” and thought that MMM is life for me! like this movie. I thought I would give the film a chance, as the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better when I saw Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs. Anyone who has education above the 4th grade will see the original with Pacino, a true actor, and will be pleased.
