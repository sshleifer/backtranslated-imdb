I do not understand the positive comments made about this film. It is cheap and disgusting at all levels, and I cannot understand how this happened at all. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters in abundance - reckless alcoholic Sue, a prostitute, Irish father - a vivid example. None of the characters evoke a feeling of sympathy - with the exception of a brief description of the Asian guy Sue, but even then he is capable of domestic violence! Although they are both desperately unappealing, I don’t know why Rita and / or Sue would rush into perfect creep like Bob - but considering that they do it, why should I care about what happens to them? So many reviews continue to insist on how realistic this is. If this is true, this is a sad reflection on society, but there is no reason to film it. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like the movie.
