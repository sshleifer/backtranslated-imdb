Shekki, damn it, legend, make no mistake. Until recently, I worked in a retail network of HiFi & Video in the UK, where their testing department worked. We had to go through a lot of new snacks, and they would have to learn how to find various defects that are somehow returning from stores. Now, in order to try to verify the determination of these new employees, we will issue them a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film, because whenever someone who bought a certain model of Goodmans DVD player, who had this film as a free gift, went back to his DVD player, he never refused and from Sheki. Our new employees will be forced to use only Going Overboard to check these machines for faults until they find one or two of their own disks for testing. <br /> <br /> Now why this movie is so bad. where do I begin? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who may be as funny as in Happy Gilmore or Wedding Singer, must have been a hell of a day. The rest of the team smelled, and what was up with Billy Zane? His name pops up in some of the worst films of all time, and he is a worthy actor. Psycho. Product quality is absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would be inclined to give it a zero if I could, because they didn’t even have the courage to call him by the full name “The Unsinkable Shekki Moskowitz” on release. Regardless, it’s worth a look so you can see how far Sandler has come and how low he can go.
