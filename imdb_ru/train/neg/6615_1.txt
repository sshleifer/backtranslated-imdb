From time to time in Indian cinema there appears such a film as Sholey, which changes the view of the audience about a good movie. And even from time to time (hopefully) we have RGV ki Aag, which violates all standards and creates its own. The standard is so low that it can never be broken. Ram Gopal Varma manages to take a talented melting pot and create a dish so that it can be felt from a distance. To take such a classic as Sholey and kill her is completely unforgivable, and I cannot believe that he almost named the film RGV ki Sholay. Despite the fact that there were many folk elements in “Sholai”, the film managed to develop the plot, simply by defining the characters so clearly that they lived forever. Aag takes these characters and so spoils them that you need a competition to choose the worst. The element of realism is completely absent, and what the film ultimately gives is a group of “actors” who march less in the plot and seemingly not connected with each other by events. One star of this film is a ridiculous waste of votes. it's time for the RGV to realize the reality of its failure and create another “other” plot that can be categorized as a movie.
