Slash clicks are very rare, so when I heard about Cut, I had high hopes and I heard a lot of good things about it. Those good things I heard were wrong ... everything is wrong! This film is bad and I mean Bad. This is just stupid. Everything about it. Especially the origin of the killer and the way he stays alive and how he is cared for in the end. There is nothing original or outstanding in this film. Just another slasher imitates these “Hips”, “Self-Consciousness”. "Cinema savvy" characters. I'm so sick of this shit. Someone is doing something different, because the slash genre literally needs new blood.
