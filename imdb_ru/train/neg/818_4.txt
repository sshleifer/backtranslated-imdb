This film is remarkable for three reasons. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it is obvious that due to the success of the two Superman series, this low-budget film was shot and released in theaters, celebrating George Reeves and Phyllis Coates. Initial appearances like Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is reused in the series. Outside the town of Silbi, an oil well six miles deep penetrates the "hollow Earth", allowing the Moles to come to the surface. Forget about other holes (those in the plot). <br /> <br /> Second, unlike most films of the SF invasions of the fifties, the hero plays the dominant (and controlling) power in preaching and ensuring tolerance and acceptance of differences. against the raging mob of segregation warriors. There is no "soft reporter"! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and self-affirming, seizes control of the situation everywhere (“I can handle it!”), Even helping in a hospital gown to remove the bullet from Krotik! As Superman, he is softer than Clark in relation to the furious Lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance when he protests against the warriors as "Nazi attack aircraft". <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from Superman's cartoon animated flight in two series to “live action” in “The Adventures of Superman” has not yet been accomplished.
