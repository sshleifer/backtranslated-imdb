I was advised to watch this film from a friend who shouted about what a sweet story it was. <br /> <br /> Fu. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours ago to be as good as I could I have done so many more productive things with my time ... such as twisting my fingers. I do not see anything useful in this film, except for its attractive aspect ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and this is generous)
