Really bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen .... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to make up for it by saying, "we know that we are doing this." It would be funny if it were not for the fact that the Simpsons had already done it. And still it will not work, if they came up with this idea at all. <br /> <br /> Memories occurred as part of an ordinary characterâ€™s fantasies (mostly JD). Memories were not even about real events that occurred, just compilations, say, the fall of DD. or, I don't know ... the fall of Elliott. If I wanted to watch the Scrubs collection, I would go on youtube and not lose half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> The Scrubs eventually fell into the trap that most sitcoms fell into, which disappoints me, they managed to get through 5 and a quarter of the season without an episode like this. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that scrubs should not be such sitcoms. <br /> <br /> And as a fleeting thought, why the hell is Dr. Cox bald?
