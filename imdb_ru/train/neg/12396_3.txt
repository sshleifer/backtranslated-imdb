Not much good can be said about the Underneath, about Soderberg's false attempts to create a neo-noir. Soderberberg truthfully reworked Robert Siodmak's decent Criss-Cross noir without changing the plot, however, the adaptation exhausts him every ounce of his modern film noir atmosphere, giving him the same story, set in very least attractive places, lifestyle and anachronisms. Soderberberg, who will later make great crime films, such as Out of Sight and Ocean, with great style and atmosphere, follows a dangerously obvious path to modernization, updating the history of the ugliest, boring and flat fashion of the early 1990s . The nightclubs have horrible, disgustingly dressed garage groups, an uninteresting version of antihero Bert Lancaster Peter Gallagher is left by his femme fatale for an obsessive purchase of cinematically lifeless modern appliances such as stereos, televisions and other modern equipment that sucks the reaction out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It could be more exciting and less boring if he had several saving graces, such as a good count, more flesh for his characters, more than just William Fichtner, who was not in the spirit of wooden, clearer pace. Unfortunately, the Underneath has none of this. Cederberg, an excellent director, this time does not use his dry squad in favor of his film. This location works great when he makes a crime film with a lot of tongue in his cheek, like George Clooney’s previously mentioned paintings, or a social or character drama, such as “Traffic” or “Sex, Lies and Videotaping”. With a film like Underneath, he reinforces the boredom the viewer is experiencing.
