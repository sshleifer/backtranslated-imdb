What kind?!?? Why do people say it is "stunning"? Just put up with it, the final is one of the worst in cinema history! 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention that character 9 was an idiot all the time when he killed everyone. I was right all the time if he donated 9, then this would not have happened. People who give life there for a stupid business and for what? ... to make it rain? I admit that the film had its parts, and the whole concept was exciting. But a lot of it was a cliché one after another. And did anyone else feel that this is very similar to the "Lord of the Rings"? The characters died for silly reasons, there was almost no character development, and, frankly, ask yourself if it’s good that there are only four guys left in the world; it is pointless and stupid. It was one of the shortest films I've ever seen, and thank goodness! How robots turn against people who are creative anyway! This was done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, watch a movie that is worth seeing, for example, Star Trek, Hangover or Inglorious Bastards, these were good movies!
