Well, this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious about the movie they just experienced in an apocalyptic war, but they have the money to buy huge robots and set them against each other. Instead of investing in rebuilding their country, each country would decide to fight robots that no one could afford. Here's the best idea, let's rely on our most inept resource, athletes, to fight in our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says what about the director, what about him? He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give credit to this film only because of the director, maybe he slept? I really liked this movie because it was so funny and funny that I had to laugh. I really had a good time watching this, well, except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be a killer (believe me, no one will consider this guy a murderer, so this is a surprise, no matter how boorish) What training jungle exercises case. I was sad to see that Mst3k did not do this. However, I give a rating of two stars, because nothing can be as bad as Manos in the hands of fate. <br /> <br /> The budget doesnâ€™t matter either, I saw a lot of sensible films that had nothing for budgets. like a cube The storyline was not even believable, and I saw how best to play in school productions. Awful they could afford an eleven year old child from any school play. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a fun movie to watch.
