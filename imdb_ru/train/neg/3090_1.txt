I really have nothing new to add, but I just felt I had to comment on this bag. So here: <br /> <br /> Brutal. I go through my MST3K DVD collection again and just watch the Hobgoblin for the tenth time. It really, really hurts, but it was next on the list ... You can see that there is a tiny core of a real film buried under all the crap that "Hobgoblins", but it simply could not go out. Everything in this movie is the 4th rating. History, action, effects, women, "action scenes", ... ahhh, forget about it. I can watch a piece of shit like Dr. Z's “Bloody Waters” (aka Zaat) again and again, almost without any side effects (in fact, I like it, by the way, it will be on TCM later this month). October 2009), but Hobgoblins is a whole different ball game. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, about 12 hours after the end of the film, I slept, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the New Wave ersatz, dance music that was frolicking Amy, Red Shorts and Larayne Newman are in the living room, ELIMINATING THROUGH MY MY HEAD. This flour will last for several days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, isn't it?
