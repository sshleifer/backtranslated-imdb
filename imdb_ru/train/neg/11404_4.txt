It is very interesting to me that many reviewers consider this a masterpiece. I'm not stupid, as far as quality films are going, and I agree that from a technical point of view of filming, as well as for some of the depicted characters, the film is in an award-winning class. But there is no point (for me) in the fact that this film really goes somewhere; I mean, taking the viewer anywhere. This is a series of scenes with a mood, perhaps wonderful as such, but I want more from the film. I am looking for history and movement, and satisfaction of arrival, none of this I have found in this film. Yes, it can be considered poetry in the movies. but there are a lot of poems with which I cannot live for the same reason: they paint pictures without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Another thing to be said is that it documents the mid-century English childhood is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally shocked by what the young British boy had to go through, at that time and in this place. Grown up in America just ten years ago, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is huge. I can't help but wonder if this contrast had any impact on those who view the film so favorably. In other words, can there be a tendency to judge a film entirely by its “cinematic magic” (which, I admit, is) completely ignore its irrelevance regarding the nature of the actual experience recalled?
