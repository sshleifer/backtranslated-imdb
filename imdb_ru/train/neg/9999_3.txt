This is a film that my enemies are content with, I watch all the time, but this is not damn true. I just watch it from time to time to make sure it is as bad as I first thought. <br /> <br /> Some gangsters are hijacking a Boeing 747. (This, at least, an improvement over Boeing captured most of the Pentagon.) The plane falls into the Bermuda triangle and sinks under the bottom, a kind of submarine after the fact. <br /> <br /> He has one of those star casts. the stars are either falling or just above the horizon. <br /> <br /> “We ourselves!” says pilot Jack Lemon. He is so right. Except George Kennedy. He is in all these disaster films. <br /> <br /> Watch another movie instead. Oh, not the "Airport" original. This is also not good. Instead, watch a decent movie about stuck planes, such as Flying Phoenix.
