This is not one of the best films of Arbuckle or Keaton, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of all his drunkenness, so she took him to a sanatorium, where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have received a guaranteed cure! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and goes for an operation. Then he runs away and pursues the place where he meets a pretty girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite the fact that the employees are pursuing them, they run away, and at that moment it becomes obvious that the girl went crazy and Arbuckle was soon caught. However, he wakes up, and everything after the operation was a dream - there was no sexy crazy girl, and Dr. Keaton is not as big incompetent as he seemed in a dream. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is the biggest problem with the film. Of course, teasing people with mentally ill people is rather low, but at one time it was guaranteed to laugh. I would have laughed too if there was something funny about it! A lot of energy and everything. <br /> <br /> For your information - during one of the chase sequences, the fat man is surprised at the race for men weighing more than 200 pounds (wow, what are the chances for that?). And soon after, he returns to the post where number 5 has just been drawn. As a result, the top five is now on the back of Fat's shirt, and he looks like a regular participant. HOWEVER, the number SHOULD appear on the Fat's shirt in the opposite direction, but going outside is a mistake, as they should have understood that the mirror image would be the opposite 5.
