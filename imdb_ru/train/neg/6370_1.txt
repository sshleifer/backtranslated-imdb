For some reason, TV Guide gave these two and a half stars, plus Faye Dunaway in it, so it definitely looked like something that you can see. Oh, this is my worst movie I've ever seen. Ever From this terrible game (every time a girl asks a boy what is wrong with him, I scream on TV: “I can't act!”. When she asks what he needs, I scream “I need acting classes!” For the incredibly bad). Dialogue (“Give me back my organs!”). <br /> <br /> And the end of the imitation of Brian DePalma was also terrible. I liked it. Dunaway is one of the best actors in history. And the production figures were pretty good. <br /> <br /> But vouzers, it made me laugh, Laugh!, most of the time. <br /> <br /> Don't even worry out of curiosity, This was my first mistake. Staying with her was definitely my second, third and fourth.
