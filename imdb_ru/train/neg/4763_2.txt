The main reason for writing this review is that I found this “revision” of a magnificent play and a worthy 1972 film a terrible experience in cinema. If I can save someone from watching, I will do a good job. <br /> <br /> This “new” version is loaded with talents, and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh favors an ugly, sterile one-note set. He begins to make a film from all possible, distracting, self-centered points of view. We see reflections of stainless steel actors on security monitors, pictures of their heads from a height of 200 feet, close-ups of eyes, chins, and so on. The Nobel laureate scenario introduces a long strip of unpleasant homosexual banter that pretends to be on both sides, I think ?? Given the nature of the "twists and turns," how do I know? The characters themselves, so richly painted in the original, are rude and not sympathetic. Work time has been reduced by an hour, which is either a real problem or the kindest thing the director has done for us. Actors perform their roles effectively, but nothing they say or do is believable. Jude Law is beyond praise than Kane, but as a recognized producer he must have received the blessing of Brana. <br /> <br /> In general, I found it to be the ugly, unconvincing shell of a former classic, Why was it done at all ??? The paying public spent less than 4 million dollars on it! Vanity work that fails at every turn.
