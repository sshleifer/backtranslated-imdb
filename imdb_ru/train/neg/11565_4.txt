After the second week of Lonely Beauty, I'm a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some actions are good, except that this is just a drama. <br /> <br /> I’m not sure how people can feel that this “FILMAL DRAMA” is the “actual” coverage of the Thatcher years - it's normal, like a drama, but I feel that the award winning book is all much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will give us a continuation and the next part of the drama, as well as subsequent years, when “Things can only get better”, ending in 2006, and the fact that we all still waiting! with this promise from a government that is full of meanness.
