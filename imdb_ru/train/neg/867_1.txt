I had rather high hopes for this film, although it received a bad review in the newspaper. I was extremely tolerant and sat through the whole movie. In the end, I felt pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Although I’m not quite rude and not particularly sensitive to tasteless movies, I really liked the Woody Allen movie "Everything you wanted to know about sex", ... ”And“ Funny Games ”by Michael Hanneke - I discovered that the director's obsession with this ten-year desire to drink breast milk is absolutely disgusting. And when the film reached its climax in an “orgy,” where the boy drinks both his mother’s milk and the woman’s milk, which he longed for, the whole disgust at the complete perversion and sentimental boredom almost overwhelmed me. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the overwhelming majority of European cinema, as well as independent films, so I would really like this film. Avoid this movie at all costs, it should be attributed to the annals of history as a lesson in a bad movie.
