After Mafia boss Vic Moretti (the late great Anthony Franzioz) kills his lady, who cheats on him with Derek, their new driver / Vietnamese veterinarian, and blames the poor guy for this, Derek finds himself in prison where he has to contend with a corrupt guard , Vic's brother-prisoner, who runs the prison, and, oh yeah, illegal experiments conducted by the shadow CIA agent (the great genre and main director John Saxon) to turn various prisoners into superhuman invincible zombies. Of course, everything gets out of control, and it’s up to Derek and the rest of the remaining inmates to save the day after the infected have taken prison. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a wonderful talented actor. as directed by Saxo ... a great talented actor. To say that this film (John’s only directorial performance) lacks a certain visual talent would be a bit of an understatement. However, the film is not entirely groundless. The dialogue, though idiotic, is bad enough to sometimes be humorous. Unfortunately, in fact, this is not enough for the film to go it alone, and for the film to start acting by itself, it takes an eternity (which is rather late in the film). Therefore, the best thing that I can recommend to this film is to say that if you are a fan of Saxony (which I really am), then it is worth one hour, just let in small expectations, and you will be all right. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lees Mason and Thane McClure topless <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
