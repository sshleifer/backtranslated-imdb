This is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of horror. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t even have words to say how awful, painful, boring, confusing and just weird this effort is (Hey, what do you know, I know ....) In post-apocalyptic America, some guys meet on the beach, and this is followed by carnage and chaos - it was all so incomprehensible that I could not understand what had come of it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, then, as perceived by the National Lampoon, completely defeats me: it is really terrible. <br /> <br /> And not so bad, this is a good cult path. <br /> <br /> It's just terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still do not believe me, then look with any intentions, come back here and tell me what you think. Even an acid gerbil could not understand this. <br /> <br /> Avoid or even better destroy ...
