I have been using IMDb for many years, and I never wanted to participate in film comments until now. This documentary has so many problems that I don’t even know what to say. I am not a Muslim or an expert in Islamic studies, but I know enough to shed light on the obvious one-sided viewpoint that this documentary supports. <br /> <br /> Problems with this film begin with the fact that this is a documentary. Most of the documentaries I have seen bind themselves to a few real points, and then surround these points with debatable interpretations and misinformation. This certainly applies to Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists all over the world, and some of them are Muslims, but making a documentary about all Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This is truly a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who would like to more objectively examine some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are a few points that can help. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary is about the Middle East, but more and more Muslims live outside this region. Believe me, Muslims live in China more than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Koran used in the documentary is questionable. I watched the documentary, looking at another translation, and the differences were striking. I was warned about the translation that was used in the documentary, and now I know why. Surra 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that Surra says non-believers will go to hell. But the translation that I read instead: "Those who reject the Truth among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists will be in the fire of hell." The difference is that those who reject the Truth are those people who know about God and the Truth of God and in any case decide to reject it. <br /> <br /> The film mentions that there is no morality in Islam, but it’s not. While it is true that much comes from the Koran and the Hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called "Urf" or "normative behavior." Obviously, what is normative can be interpreted in many ways, but “Urf implies“ good ”behavior that an ordinary person would consider right or wrong. <br /> <br /> The documentary film presents Sharia (Islamic law) as a single body of knowledge, followed by all Muslims. This is simply not true. There are many Islamic schools of law, and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in how they interpret the law. <br /> <br /> The Hadith tradition is similar. There are thousands of hadiths, and each law school accepts some and rejects others. Using Hadith without a serious scholarship to determine which of them are accurate, real and applicable, selects and parses indiscriminately from a story that correspond to what you want to say ?? This is what made the documentary. <br /> <br /> I hope that people understand that the problem is fundamentalism and not Islam or some other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot doctors at abortion clinics and so on. I know that this is not the same as suicide bombing, I just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism may be a problem. If you feel that you have the answer, then everyone else should be wrong. But if you feel that you have the answer to NA, you can work alongside other people's views on politics, religion, God, or something else.
