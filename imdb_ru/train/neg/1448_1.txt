Growing up in Texas and less than 15 miles from what Gilli used to belong to, I can say that this film is disgusting. Most Texans live differently than this film indicates. The plot is weak, and the fake accents are funny, and this reinforces the stereotypical idea that all Texans drink beer, a cowardly, redneck. Terribly fake texas accents kill him for me. True, there is a certain Texan emphasis on the accents of the majority of Texans, but these people overdo it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just does not work. John Travolta was supposed to stay in a disco or in the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than as Texas.
