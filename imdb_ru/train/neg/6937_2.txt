The theme that this last advertiser, who became a film director, is trying to solve in his debut (advertising) project, is a long-standing topic for discussion by almost any cultural standard - the eternal novel (pun). <br /> <br /> However, the study (and the exploitation for the Desi audience) is terribly short, as the usual tendencies for “pepper, spices, and sugar” go up the usual masala of b / g score, dialogue, dance, drama and so on. Create a beautiful package with a small amount inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the film, the scene in the kitchen was repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repetitions follow throughout the film (after all, the main character is a cook). But therein lies the problem - no story! Ha, no wonder. Someone forgot to write the script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh adds chini jiyad (more) excessive action. Really, when will this guy ever stop? How many 60-year-old pranks are around, even if they are mocked by 30-year-olds? Yes, a timeless mind, but, of course, how about a less ageless body? And the sole? Sorry, soul ?! Good enough acting game of Pares Raval, who plays the only reasonable role in the film. The director lacks a sense of realism, which could get bogged down in his newfangled discovery of a hot new idea. Nowhere do we encounter any real problems or problems that such a couple can face, except to actually get married, which is only the initial obstacle. The subplot of a small child with cancer (the first love of a bachelor boy) does not lead to anything, and whatever keen feelings this may cause, otherwise, a tasteless performance, it is quickly killed along with the girl’s character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, good try, but not quite there yet.
