The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how it is possible that a culture that can produce such complex and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot create a single film that would rise above the hideous level of garbage that this film perfectly represents. This is Bollywood at its best / worst, to be honest, I can't tell the difference. Disgustingly cute, kitsch cliches on every level, storyline, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. Simply put, you must be mentally retarded to enjoy it. I watched this to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to leave him, because I could no longer tolerate him. The only redeeming quality of the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
