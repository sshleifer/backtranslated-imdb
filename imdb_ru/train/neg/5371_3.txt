This film was rather a disappointment. After a very slow, very intense (and rather bloody) start, the film begins to lose it. Too much plot leaves too little time for explanations, and when I left the theater I was surprised what it was. The characters remain superficial, the story is far from convincing, most of them are dezha things without hints of parody, and there are some very stupid details ... For example, a young policeman must dig up a body. Of course it is night And it rains And he must do it alone ... yawn! Or Evil, which is “Nazi” plus “genetic manipulation” ... Wow, this is really original. However, there are some nice moments, such as a fist fight scene, mountain views and some (running) plugs, but (although Renault and Vincent Cassel do what they can), this is definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
