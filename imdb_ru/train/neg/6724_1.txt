When you choose a film, I hope that one of the factors that you take into account is whether the actors in the film use their fame to influence the moral structure of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement, it is a moral issue that affects society. When a comedian / actor makes sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father, we have to ask ourselves (do I want to support this behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxâ€™s behavior breaks the social structure that teaches our young people correctly, not badly, and good behavior is bad, because loving kindness is better than hate. Mr. Fox must remember that he is only entertainment, and there are many things we can choose from. Regret does not remove it from the hook. This will not reduce pain and remove the bad behavior that it spreads to our young people. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. I no longer see anything that they are part of. We cannot change them, but we can stop the glory we give them.
