The original show was much better. They should have gone on a good note. This film killed the whole idea. It was boring, overly dramatic, and the funny parts were too far away to make up for the failure. This film really seemed to me too complicated to be serious, and this is definitely not what I wanted from this continuation. Not to mention that for a long time it just depressed the same thing over and over again. So, I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but try next time. This film is just boring and not so funny. Sorry. This is 4/10 stars. <br /> <br /> jay addison
