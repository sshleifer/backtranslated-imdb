The first thing to say is that I read manga, and therefore my argument is based on differences. <br /> <br /> This anime was very disappointing because it took comedy and high-quality manga and OVA performances. What was left was just the husk of what could have been. Many characters lacked the depth that is visible in the manga. Alucard is not a cute character who secretly wants death. There is no betrayal in Walterâ€™s story. And the Nazi villains who intend to devour the world with war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides the villain Gary Stu Incognito, who is defeated against what seems to be every chance. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that the anime is at odds with manga, but that it does such a bad job
