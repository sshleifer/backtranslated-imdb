Pere is an idiot, but he knows about it and acts as a consequence. His life is completely boring, and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend, Nikko, dies. He feels completely drained, and he decides to get drunk. When he returns home, he falls with a girl who advertises. Although she ignores him, he falls in love and starts obsessively following her. Well, the beginning of the movie is a bit slow, and this can lead to dullness for most people. However, when the action begins, it is a little better (not so much! Maybe the best part is 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes), which you can see in the middle of the film; this is not good for eroticism, but for the funny and the unexpected This is probably the best movie. Neither the actors nor the directing are good, and the result is a boring movie that may seem funny to some people (not to me). The whole movie is based on ridiculous situations (an idiot, as film) that has something interesting. I like Vent cheers Ponce, but I have to admit that this is not one of his best films (perhaps his worst!), he knows how to make it better.
