I'm a Christian. However, I have always been skeptical of films made by Christians. As a rule, they do not know anything when it comes to filmmaking. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus positively and honestly on screen. However, they did a terrible job. The action was terrible, and if someone is not familiar with the Bible in any way, he CAN'T understand what the film was trying to tell. Not only was the movie terribly made, but the people who did it even had some facts wrong. However, in this “criticism” these facts are out of place and too deep to go into them. In short, Omega Code is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone, except for comic relief from everyday routine work.
