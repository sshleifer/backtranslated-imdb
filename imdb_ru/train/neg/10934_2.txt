First of all, let me say that I am an LDS or, rather, I am a Mormon. Therefore, when I watched this movie, I automatically gave him the advantage of doubt. I can usually find something redemptive in every movie I watch. And this one was no exception. He has his redemptive moments. But they are few and far from each other. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that I was very worried about was the fact that Khalestorm was ashamed of our Church! In the LDS Church, meetings are called “parishes,” and the basketball court is located in the “culture hall”. NEVER ONE of these two names is mentioned. The Church is never mentioned by name, and “standards” is a reference to what our Church believes. <br /> <br /> I’m wondering if the directors are really LDS or LDS clients? This film had so much potential! This could really show our Church in a positive light and help the public see not only what we can offer, but also what we believe. Instead, it was just a little interesting and left a lot to be desired. If I had not yet been an LDS, I would have left to think that Mormons are stupid, idiotic, and ashamed of their convictions. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a movie that I would recommend to my friends not from LDS. <br /> <Sorry, Heilstorm. You can do better than that!
