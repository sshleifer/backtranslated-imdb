**** WARNING: there will be spoilers **** Why do I spend my hastily fleeing years watching such garbage? This film is an impressive collection of clichés, bad writing, worst directing, and then we haven't even gotten to acting. <br /> <br /> And, of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> An expert hero fights against stupid, corrupt and incompetent minions. One avalanche goes out, burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive, despite the fact that they overcome all sorts of dangers. The corrupt partner who caused it all healed alive with their money. The second avalanche, heroically rejected by the renegade’s adventurous experiment. In the end, evil minions also have a heart. Concerned teenager falls into the arms of his stepmother crust after she was rescued. Etc, and so on. D., And so on. D., And so on. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are few reasons to warn spoilers. You could probably work through the whole plot if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least most of the time, I was not too upset, anticipating what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we did not discuss factual errors. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous commentator that, although there are usually SOME redemptive functions in a bad movie. it will be difficult for you to find anything in it. I guess I gave him 2 out of 10 for some nice landscape shots, but that's it. <br /> <br /> Some time has passed since the movie made me moan, but this one certainly did.
