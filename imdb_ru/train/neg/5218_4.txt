All the elements for a bad night in the movies on the spot: a dialogue permeated with biological technological chatter, calico sets, balsa-style playing, a terrible Casio score of the late 80s, and a general look that suggests the Sci Fi Channel programming chart, circa 1993 of the year. Although “Metamorphosis” begins with a big promise, the film unfolds into mild idiocy and MST3K-style cheese, because Clark Kent emulates Dr. Doctor Peter Houseman (Gene Lebrok) and is forced to release information about his secretive projects. But when he tests his vague experiment on himself, he turns into an indefinitely defined creature (which has more than a fleeting resemblance to "Dr. Freudstein" from "The House at the Graveyard"). Working with FX is good enough for such a clearly low-budget production (although I suspect that most of it is kept in the shadow for some reason), but in general, Metamorphosis leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts, despite its hopes that make us different. I can not disagree with the final remark of one character: "(It was) A nightmare ... from the past!"
