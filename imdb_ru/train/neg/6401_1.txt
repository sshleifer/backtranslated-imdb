Can I do this until I need glasses? at least it proves that everyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. People who have released this disgusting pile of spewed vomit on the world, lack the similarity of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience should consist of newly labored children and babies who play with their feces. Anyone else would be too wise to break out of this movie. It consists of a series of second-year parodies in which the zest does not even extend to the obvious. It ends ridiculously. Joke stories are jokes that elementary school children tell (usually minor or sexually related) when they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like the one about dad's car and mom's garage. It would be pointless to use any more rigorous method of criticism, because creative “minds” have never heard of the usual standards of action, writing, directing, and the like. Behind this mess Not to be judgmental, but anyone who likes this film should seriously think about its purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
