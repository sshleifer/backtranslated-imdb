If you've ever seen an eighties slasher, you have no particular reason to see it. Originality is often not one of the strengths of the Slasher cinema, and this film is lacking. In fact, there is little to be said about the Jokes, so I will do it quickly. The film was one of the 74 films included in the DPP's Bad Video list, and that was my only reason to see it. The plot follows a group of children who stay in the dorm for Christmas. Since they are in the slasher, someone decides to start shooting them, and this leads to one of the most boring riddles ever seen in a slasher film. The fact that this film was on the Video Nasty list is strange because, despite several bloody scenes, this film is unlikely to spoil or corrupt anyone, and more violent killers than this f) is ultimately prohibited. But then again, there are forbidden films that are much less scary than this (for example, “The Witch Who Came From the Sea”). In any case, the conclusion of the film is the best in this, because viewers really do not care who the attacker is; it's pretty well done. In general, this is a dull and gloomy slasher, which even fans of slasher will miss well.
