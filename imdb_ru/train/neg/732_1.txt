A young boy sees his mother being killed and his father hangs himself. 20 years later, he gathers a bunch of friends to perform an exorcism on himself so that he does not become like his father. All standard characters are in place: a good pair; "Funny" guy; hard (but sensitive) hood; smart girl (she wears glasses - as we know); nerd and two non-personality blondes. All of this includes some kind of stupid wooden statue that comes to life (don't ask) and kills people. I knew that I was in trouble when, after the gorgeous debut scene, we jumped 20 years later - ALL bad horror films do it! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, the acting is bad (except for Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) And the killings are stupid and / or unimaginable. My favorite scene is when two people have sex, and the statue knocks the guy out of bed, showing that he is fully dressed! A very bad, stupid, rambling horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
