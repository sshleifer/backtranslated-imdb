Hello to all. If you saw "Singing in the Rain", you remember the scene in which Gene Kelly danced in the rain. You also remember the Donald O'Connor dance number “Make them laugh”. If you saw the Royal Wedding, remember how Fred Aster danced on the ceiling. If you saw "Jailhouse Rock", you even remember the name of the dance number, supplied by the King himself. <br /> <br /> That's what's missing here. In this presentation there could be several blockbuster dance numbers. The closest was Chuck McGowan "I can do it." the fact that several talented people are moving along on the stage does not make a big dance film. Richard Attenborough was to blame for this failure. He directed the camera to the stage and thought it would be good. <br /> <br /> Screaming at people listening for the Broadway production is not fun. Michael Douglas would have been the same terrible actor if he had played in Western or in comedy. He's fine when he's in the Michael Douglas film, where we see him screaming at someone we would like to yell at. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> The cast was good, except for Michael, of course. A good movie could even be made using songs that were in production, but someone had to think about how to make it. <br /> <br /> The next time they make one of them, I hope they call me first. <br /> <br /> tom willett
