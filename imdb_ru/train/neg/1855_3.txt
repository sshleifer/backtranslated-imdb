This is the dirtiest film I've ever seen, but, to be honest, it's watchable and quite funny. I donâ€™t think the filmmakers wanted this to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. This is just a stupid film about a serial killer, which is buried in poison with toxic waste, which causes a reaction in it and snow (as it is now the middle of winter). Then he turns into a snow killer, which is enough to make you laugh. This film is really stupid, but funny. The killings are funny. I would not advise you to go and buy it (as I did - the cover looked good!), But if something happens on TV one evening and you are ready to laugh, then put it on.
