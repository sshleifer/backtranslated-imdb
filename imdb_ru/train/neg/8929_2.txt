This jumble, adapted from the novel by Gore Vidal (in fact, one of the great American writers), makes The Magic Christian and The Valley of the Dolls look like works of art by Fellini. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and she is not really very tall) starring (except for KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was pretty good) playing Rex Reed's alter ego (bad film reviewer; not a critic), just to be surrounded by a transvestite (great chick) Mae West, lustful John Houston, a young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (pre-Lee Major, what a shame), and other various azoids to pretend that they are forging, WAY too, maybe There is nothing to do with this, except for glued old movie clips (for example, Widma rk in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horn) ... ONLY so that they can continue to bleed the lives of everyone. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. Best performance =? This is so bad, it's worth seeing!
