Zombie rebellion is bad. There is nothing entertaining in the film. It is boring, lifeless, bad acting and poorly written. I often complained that the original Dracula is a bit slow for my taste, well, this film makes Dracula look like a roller coaster. The duration of 65 minutes seemed to be 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> History: Expedition goes to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through “zombie”. One man finds a secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. As soon as this happens, he releases a zombie under his control to terrible consequences. That's all. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For the most part of the film I tried to figure out where I saw the lead role. He looked so familiar. I had enough time to think it over. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before the “zombies rebelled,” it struck me. It was Dean Jagger. I saw him recently as a general on White Christmas. So I entertained myself for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie. The zombie king is on the other side, and this is a masterpiece of filmmaking compared to this film. For what it is worth, I will give 2/10. (I will not go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I have seen worse.)
