What the hell was all this? I saw the Matrix and was amazed. It was the most exciting movie ever made. What the Wachowski brothers have ever allowed to make this film is beyond my power. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can't argue with that. In fact, this whole film was gossip, and don't get me wrong, I have no problems with talking films, but all the talk in The Matrix Reloaded was a meaningless exercise. Then there would be a sequence of battles that lasted too long, then a more meaningless movement, then another battle scene that lasts too long, and all this builds up to the biggest anti-climax in history. The little bearded boy speaks with an incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves also shows worse results. I knew that he was not a good actor, but that was no joke. If you watch his films in the order in which he was in them, it may seem that he gradually deteriorated as they progressed. God knows what his performance in the movie “Something is” looks like! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden board that ever became an actor. <br /> <br /> After the magnificence of the first film, this was a huge disappointment. If you have not seen the first film, I suggest you watch it, but do not waste your time on this pile of poop. <br /> <br />
