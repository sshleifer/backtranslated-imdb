This is a specially created for television and quite unnecessary science fiction channel telling the story of Beowulf, especially after the recent 2005 film Beowulf and Grendel. This film does not really fall into the story of Beowulf, but simply leads us through its battle against the predatory beast known as Grendel, because it leaves the kingdom in absolute fear and disarray, while the powerful Viking warrior Beowulf is called upon to rid them of violence monsters. If this succeeds, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep him at bay. After several unsuccessful attempts, the creature is slain, but his angry and vengeful mother soon attacks, giving Beowulf the opportunity to again display her mighty strength and courage to defeat him. The Grendel looks like it was removed with a small budget, and the effects of computer graphics are terrible. As I said, this film is absolutely unnecessary.
