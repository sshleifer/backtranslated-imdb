I first saw a live musical at the Denver Performing Arts Center, and it was simply stunning, stunning and had such a fantastic sequence of plot and dialogue that I liked it a lot more than most musicals I saw on stage. The interesting thing is that you NEVER need to see Zack's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was powerful and directed the direction of the entire production. When I heard that they were making a film, I waited with bated breath, but when I watched the movie version, I was so taken aback that I felt I was deceived. The movie lacks the exciting mood set live, and it never allows you to be fully in touch with each character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again, and if it is ever restored, I sincerely recommend that you do everything possible to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences that you enjoy.
