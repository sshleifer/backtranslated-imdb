Jane Russell turned out to be a delightful musical comedy in the eponymous film "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" ?? but unfortunately, this film loses these skills. There is a budget and a good Parisian photography, but the film just does not work. Miss Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. This leaves no one worthy of playing Jane Russell. Some of the other players are away from their element. <br /> <br /> There are some awkward scenes; First of all, keep in mind: there is a musical number where African cannibals with bone heads “cook” brunettes in a pot after Alan Young sings in a gorilla costume. <br /> <br /> It is interesting, sometimes embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen marry brunettes (10.29.55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jean Crane, Alan Young, Scott Brady
