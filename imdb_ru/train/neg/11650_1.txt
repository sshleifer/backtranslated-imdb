It seems that after the first exit, the Wayan brothers can come up with new jokes. Although I think not. If the first was not bad enough, this one is so bad that it hurts to look. With all the actors they had in this film, you think they could come up with something smarter. Although they could not, they had to take all the same rude, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it in this film, thinking that people would laugh at it again. Although the fact is that I did not laugh at this for the first time. They tried to turn these films into parodies, but failed on all levels. Most of the time itâ€™s just jokes that are accidentally inserted, so disgusting and rude that they are hard to watch and enjoy. Then, when they really try to make scenes that are parodies of the movie, they just end up making a 20-minute re-creation of the scene with perhaps one joke in the whole scene. Also for people who say that this is not for an older and real young audience, I fit into the age range for which it should be fun. While people say that different people have different ideas about what is funny or not, if you find it funny, then you are probably not one of the most mature or intelligent people around. To write such a script you do not need a lot of skill, although if you really want a smarter and funnier movie, watch the movie Space Balls. This is a parody of the film, which is actually good and well done, and for that it was not necessary to use disgusting and obscene jokes.
