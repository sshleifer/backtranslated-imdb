Poor Will would have flipped over in his grave if he could have this terrible adaptation of German television to his classic play. Obviously, very little money was spent on this. A lift, a podium and some randomly arranged columns stand out as a set. The film was clumsily duplicated in English, and the English actors voiced the muttering of their lines from time to time. The whole performance was incredibly gloomy and dreary. And where in this film was Fonterbras? MST3K gave this pathetic staging something that rightly deserved. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I would like this film to never come first.
