There are several beautiful scenes in this film, and Albert Finney does an excellent job with the role of a ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Lee is too excited as a daughter and cannot compare with the much more subtle, mature rendering of Olivia De Havilland in "Heiress" (1949). The feminist conclusion of the film also goes against the harsh conclusion of the novel Washington Square, the author of which, Henry James, wildly parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As an admirer of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
