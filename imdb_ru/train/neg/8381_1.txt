There are several extremely talented black directors Spike Lee, Karl Franklin, Billy Dyuks, Denzel and many others who give well-deserved credit to the film industry. In addition, there are Wyana brothers who, at one time (15 years ago), had an extremely funny TV show “In live colors”, which marked the beginning of Jim Carrey’s career among others. Now we have the nonsense, replacing humor and rough jokes (toilet humor) as a standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those portrayed in The Little Man, which they could not be. Is a baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo considered only monthly? The child comes with a five-hour shadow that he shaves. The child is supposed to have sex with his adoptive mother behind the back of her husband, Darryl. Oh, yes, this is just ridiculous. As the main culprit, “Little Man” is the most stupid on planet Earth. He hides a stolen stone, which is simply huge in a woman’s wallet, and then has to pursue it. Joint star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz offers the best line: "I am surrounded by morons." Based on the cartoon Chuck Jones "Baby Buggy Rabbit", without any credit. It's too stupid to be funny. A hint about how bad this film is, Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno on the eve of the BAT award, and he didn’t even mention this horrible film. When the green light trash from the Brothers Vayan will stop in Hollywood. When they overcome the guilt of their white man in all likelihood.
