This film had such a big potential - a strong cast, a strong enough idea and obviously a decent budget. I'm not sure where it all went wrong, but each of these elements was wasted. The story did not disappear, the characters were at least empty, and the result was a very boring, senseless waste of the film. I hated it. Judging by other voices, I'm here in the minority and, it must be some kind of freak. However, I thought this movie was terrible. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed. Particularly disappointed was the character Jody Foster. A very cheeky fixer kinda makes a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character didn’t do anything and didn’t go anywhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - enjoyable, but nothing new.
