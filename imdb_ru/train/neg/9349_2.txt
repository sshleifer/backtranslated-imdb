This movie was terrible. I put him a high score of 2, as I have seen worse, but very little. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the cliché - the end of the film at the beginning and return to the beginning at the end. In this film, everything that was in the box with the tricks used in making the film was used, just like a child with too many toys. It was an endless, boring repetitive narrative, slow motion, freeze-frame, flashbacks, merged images, etc. - none of them made the boring movie better. <br /> <br /> This is called “16 years of alcohol”, but there was little drinking or drinking, and there was no mention of the fact that the film jumps everywhere without a single meaning. The story was poorly written and extremely pretentious, and the direction was equally bad, and it is a shame that people invest extra money in more films of Mr. Jobson, previously known for being in the garbage group and on television, that has the same sense how this movie does. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me to reach the end, but in the hope that everything would get better, I continued bitterly, but in fact it was a waste of time, and I would have been better not to disturb.
