I’ll probably always go to see the Woody Alleb film, as no one knows when he can simply return to his past greatness. Only one or two great moments or lines can make it worthwhile. Unfortunately, however, this film simply does not do this in any way. To say that in fact I am upset and even a little guilty. I’m sure my reaction is very similar to many other Woody fans, but what can I say? Perhaps it is time for him to focus on his Clarinet, which, in my opinion, is pretty good. Speaking of all this, I'm still likely to go to any new film that Woody may release in the future. There is always hope, and I will continue to love and respect WOODY !!
