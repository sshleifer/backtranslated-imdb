Zombie Rise (2 out of 5 stars) No, this is not the long-lost ancestor of the classic zombie film George A. Romero. This is a low-budget bowler of 1936, which probably seemed very cool to the viewers of that time ... but it seems terribly routine these days. In fact, a pretty good scene at the beginning, when a soldier shoots a pistol into the crowd of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a close-up of bullets falling into the bare chest of one of them. Nowadays, the effect looks hopelessly fake, but in 1936 I am sure that the audience was choking. The story concerns finding the secret of mind control ... ostensibly to create an irresistible zombie army ... but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves. The film lasts only an hour, but moves at the speed of a snail, so it seems to be full-length, believe me! There really isn’t much to recommend it ... you can get some pleasure from fake studio shots of a star wading through a swamp. The ending is interesting ... so I would say that the film is worth watching at least once. Most likely, you will see this as an additional feature in some cheap compilations of “4 films on 1 DVD” at Wal-Mart for five bucks. Hey, it's well worth the money ...
