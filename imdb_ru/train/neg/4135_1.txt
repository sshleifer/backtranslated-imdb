This film was so bad that I had to rewind most of it to get to good places. Ha, what's good? the only thing that was worth it was the end (those who saw the movie will understand what I mean). I expected a lot from this movie, as the underworld meets the dawn of the dead, meets Freddie against Jason, but I got this nonsense. The story was forgotten, the actors were used poorly, and what the director thought about when he did this. It could have been great, but I turned out to be the most boring movie I've ever watched. Well, so if there was a bit of T and A, I was after blood and I was bitterly disappointed. Do not expect the film to be good, but if you want a bad cheese horror, then by all means watch it and see how a horror movie MUST NOT BE MADE.
