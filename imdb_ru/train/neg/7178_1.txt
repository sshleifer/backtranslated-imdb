Overvalued and only for those over 20 who wear particularly thick rose-colored glasses with tinted glasses who have never seen it at all because they were young. Horrible animation, dialogue and tired story. The real product of the 80s, the new trick with the puzzle “TOY” (truly, “TOY”, not absurdity, the pretentious and alienating child “collector’s action figure”) sold against the background of a poor cartoon and other accessories, is only important for those who bought the TOY when they were “real” children from “84” to “87”. It became a cult because the same adults had not yet let go of their memories. Avoid.
