This is a continuation only in name of the "Christmas Story", originally entitled "Summer Story". Ralfi talks about her family adventures in the summer when they moved to a small town in an unknown place.

The latest film of Charles Grodin - no wonder! This is one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenbergen does little, everything is formal, and you have to wonder why they were worried at all. <br /> <br /> And I mean, let's have a competition with rotating vertices ?! Unfortunately, this is the best part of the movie ...
