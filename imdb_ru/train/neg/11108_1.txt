When to start. The film started out pretty well, but after 30 minutes I caught myself looking at my watch. The horror at the beginning of the film was good, but then the story began. Over time, she became more and more stupid. <br /> <br /> Actors gave a middle role in this film, however I got a little boring because of Vinnie Jones' constant frown in the film. <br /> <br /> The film dragged on, and believe me, it dragged on, it became more and more distant. <br /> *** WARNING ABOUT SPOILER *** WARNING ABOUT SPOILER *** WARNING ABOUT SPOILER *** Just when I thought that the film could not become worse, to the final load, if appear skeletons looking monsters, just to eat the dead which had no meaning at all. It turned out that it was a cult of eating flesh, and the good guys died at the end. The ending actually made me laugh at how it was all bad. As soon as Vinnie Jones is cast in the lead role, he becomes the new killer. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie made Creep look like the best horror movie ever made. I gave him 1 star because the lead woman did a pretty good job, but even she couldnâ€™t save this train wreck from the movie !!
