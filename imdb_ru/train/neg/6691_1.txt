MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT HOLY, MAKE ME IN THIS FILM! what kind of drugs are you people! this may be the worst movie ever! I felt that all the time I was on a bad trip with acid, I need to call a therapist to help me cope with the trauma of this epic disaster. From start to finish, the glowing ropes are the ugly masterpiece of satanic cinema. When I thought to watch this film with my best friend from Jews and his family, we thought, “Oh, this can be funny! It may be bad, but still a bit funny. ” the film could have been. All my friends lined up for a lobotomy as soon as the film ended, and during the film one of my friends tried to hang himself at the waist, and the other tried to cut his wrists with a wooden spoon. I wish I could watch The Ring video instead, so that the pain and suffering would end in just seven short days. For anyone who wants to watch this movie, you are not ready! You may think that you are some kind of “cool guy” by renting him, but this film will break you, push you to the ground and piss on you.
