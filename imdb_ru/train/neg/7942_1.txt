Indeed. Is there any week past when Oprah does not remind us that she was a child in childhood? <br /> <br /> She focuses on each interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah cannot help commenting on the answer to every question she asks. She often interrupts guests before the answer is completed, to add her to the side or anecdote. The directors are obviously instructed to focus on her close-up reactions, not on the guests' faces, because this is what matters — what Opra feels, what Oprah says. <br /> <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always all about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says: “I'm sorry, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my battle with my weight. Feel my pain when I turn away from the fashion store after they have already closed. Nice to buy my magazines and books. Feeling good for my success. I feel good when you give away my charity so that I look good. I feel good because I am incredibly rich. <br /> <br /> My interpretation of her point of view: YOU ARE SEEERS ALL MOST IMPORTANT, AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE I have all the answers to your life, although I have nothing to do with you, plebes. I have never been married and do not want to be. I have never had to raise a family - but I know all about it. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me to others - the witness of the “Legendary Ball 2006”. Gail is my best friend, but we are not gay. <br /> <br /> As of July 31, 2006, the headline on her website reads: “Oprah.com is your main source of information about love, life, relationships, food, home, spirit and health. “Is it supposedly disgusting? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, she smashed two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to collect shots for her shows in September 2006. She continues to promise to leave the television, but her trembling stretches endlessly. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is neither a queen, nor a goddess, nor a personal mission of God. She is just one very successful, overweight black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called it her own. She was in the right place at the right time and exactly I knew how to cope with the necessary demographics. <br /> <br /> Oprah is PT Barnum of this age, and it amazes me that people cannot see through her facade. <br /> <br /> So, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and you too, Oprah, if you can fit this swollen ego through the door - Thus, now to the great exit ...
