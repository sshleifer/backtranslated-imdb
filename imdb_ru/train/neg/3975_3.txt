1st viewed 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Deer-Steve Purcell): Typical fare for Mary Kate and Ashley with a few more kisses. It seems to me that the girls are tired of all this, and it will be interesting what happens to them if they decide to part and go their own way. In this episode of their adventures, they are interns in Rome for a “fashionable” designer who puts them right in the post office to find out what hard work is (I think ...). In addition to the typical flirting with the boys, there is nothing else but the script of Rome, until about the “movie” shows why they are fired, then hired again, then fired again, then hired again. This is definitely done by people who do not understand the corporate world, and this shows in their interpretation of this. Perhaps their next adventure (if any) will be the real world. It seems that even my children did not care about this boring “adventure” in the pretense. Let's see, they probably have only a couple of years before the age of majority. Let's see what happens next.
