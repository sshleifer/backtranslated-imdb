Last week, I looked at Nielsen's weekly ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show you don't watch." <br /> <br /> Well, they are right that you do not watch it. It was broadcast twice and received 147 and 145 points out of 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: this is the show with the lowest rating among the national broadcast networks ... and deservedly so. I tried to watch it a couple of times due to the fact that all the press coverage put forward it as a “great” show, a “realistic look” on life and all such nonsense. In reality, everything was different. Veronica Mars is a bore. This is as unrealistic as possible, and it deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only mystery is why CW felt obliged to include in its inaugural schedule of the show with the lowest rating after two years of commercial and artistic failure.
