I spent almost two hours watching the film, which I thought would be worth seeing with all the good actors in it. I could not believe it when the movie ended, and I had no idea what happened ..... I was mad because I could use this time, doing something else ... I tried to understand all this, but really had no idea. Thanks to those who understood it and explained it .... right or wrong, it is better than not knowing anything !! Who was the woman in the dark hair movie that we saw a couple of times when we left? How did the first lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the film, Kate said that she would eventually learn the truth. Does this mean that we are going to be subjected to the end of Game 2?
