The main character Lance Barton is killed and to the skies before his time. When heaven knows of a mistake, he is given the body of the newly-rich rich old and white Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black guy in the body of an old white man, still acting like a young black man, maybe funny if you see that the old white actor did it. In this film, I reminded myself several times: "Chris Rock must be an old white guy." <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not work as intended: the “illusion” is not well tolerated and the love story in general is implausible. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock playing the young black guy, because the old white man, whom everyone should see, is shown only in small scenes, is a big problem for the audience: “suspension of disbelief”.
