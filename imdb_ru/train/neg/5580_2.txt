I like a lot of the actors / actresses involved in this project, so it seemed to me even worse to insult the movie than if they used unknowns. The main problem was that this film was just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers. At 20 or 30, Nbc is likely to be filmed in the cinema around the beginning of the 90s. Now I see a black family, where children participate in revolts, and the white family rebel children and listens to rock music in a grunge style. On the soundtrack, such groups as Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden, etc. will be presented as it will be as stupid as the 60s, and I guarantee you that NBC will do it. See, the biggest problem with the parts of the period when you make a purchase of networks, is that when you live in a certain period of time, you do not think that I live in the 60s or a decade of retro fashion at the time. The next time someone does something like this, he should give more weight to this project.
