Honestly, I knew what to expect before I watched this movie, and I must say that he has the worst acting game I've ever seen. It has its moments, and at the level of comedy it is very interesting, but I am afraid that it is not scary, and the stupidity is taken to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary blood, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why the aliens were angry, and why they even came to this remote part of Wales (I mean, who would go there anyway?), But I didn’t care because I was amused by the costumes and the bad CGI. As for the B-films, it deserves the title of “being so bad, it's good,” and praise the creators of the film, because they probably knew what they were doing. Long let these films continue .....
