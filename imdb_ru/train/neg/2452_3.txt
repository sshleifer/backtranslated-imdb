Watching it again recently, I was pleased to see how they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen, even if the meager budget and the Hammi actors meant an inevitable failure. It was a catastrophe by any objective measure, but I easily imagined how good the Lord of the Rings movie could be if someone had to make it sincerely and hire the most talented artists and screenwriters with money. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, this will be impossible for a long time. <br /> <br /> When I watched this film, I got the impression that with any budget this story simply could not be filled up. Fantasy simply provides many opportunities to create an interesting film. There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way Peter Jackson did, although, of course, you should always use your imagination because of poor performance. For example, they tried to show the ghostly world from the point of view of Frodo. Or the way Galadriel showed Sam what was happening at home for another. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really appreciated in this version is quiet moments. There were moments when the dialogue said without background music against the background of a stationary background. Contrast this with the awesome soaring camera of Jackson's films and the obsessive score that seemed to be designed to emphasize that every scene was the sharpest and most powerful scene we ever watched. Jackson's films were full of their own importance, it was quieter and much more modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson and the company achieved more than $ 270 million in production costs, at least $ 90 million in marketing, massive tax breaks from the New Zealand government, as well as huge savings from filming in New Zealand, not in the USA. However, despite marketing statements, the intention to be true has never been. This is well documented. Filippo Boyens said this in an interview when she said that they deliberately did not re-read the book before writing the script. Jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantastic film “modeled on” the Lord of the Rings, and that he really wanted to do “The Return of the King”, because there were many battles in him, but there was no character development. . <br /> <br /> On the contrary, this film tried to be more truthful. Of course, a lot of things were wrong, the acting was terrible and pretty much sank everything, and the pace was too fast. Naturally, they cut a lot and adapt other scenes, and for this they deserve praise. While Jackson added a lot of action scenes that didn’t pursue plot objectives, Bakshi cut out book scenes that didn’t help the plot anyway. In fact, there is a strange similarity between the structure of the Jackson and Bakshi films at the very beginning - that they both deviate from the original books in the same way - although, of course, this may in part be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> This was not a good movie, but the potential was there. Bakshi said in an interview with the club Onion AV that only animation can make the lord of the rings justice. His version did not work, but he could be right.
