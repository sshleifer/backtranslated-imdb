I did not expect much from the film director Sidney J. Fury with Dolph Lundgren in the title role, but I certainly expected more than I received. A single-line user comment — a second-level action movie — did not seem too demeaning to me to Lundgren’s film. On the other hand, I would not watch this movie if its rating was below 5.0, but hey, the movie had 5.9 out of 10 points, which seemed to me quite acceptable for this kind of production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of the people who rated this film as 10 (excellent) were clearly a publicity stunt, because DETENTION is the usual Nu Image garbage that you saw before, again and again. <br /> <br /> Lundgren does not convince, as the former military man turned into a history teacher assigned to a rough school. His actions are simply terrible, insensible and far-fetched. Lundgren’s inability becomes more pronounced in scenes with juvenile delinquents. Either they are great actors, or, compared to Lundgren, they seem to be great actors - simply because they seem natural and believable. <br /> <br /> DETENTION has some elements that could be potentially interesting for this low-budget film - closed - at a high-security weekend in high school, four teenagers are imprisoned along with a war veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to infiltrate - but the story (something like BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is it PANIC ROOM?) full of unbelievable situations, lots of cliches and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dobo play Bonnie and Clyde in love, and they show the most acceptable performances of the film, even if it seems low. Sam Rockwell's budget version, and she, Milla Jovovich, wants to be. In the film, where everything fails, their madness and style gave enough fresh air to keep my interest from falling to the limit.
