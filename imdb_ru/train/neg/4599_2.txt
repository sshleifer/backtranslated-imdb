The proverb “Never judge a book by its cover” was designed as a warning to those who do not look beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the work "The King of Ants", I immediately thought that it was HORROR! The secret images proudly shown on the cover and on the back spoke of a dark vision; the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal and retribution. Instead, what I found under this surface was less interesting than what you can find under your usual stone. <br /> <br /> In The King of Ants, Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an ordinary guy who is ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means killing. Except that Shawn Crowley is one you don't care about, I have never felt sympathy or sympathy for this character. In fact, he is completely unattractive, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Matthews), who turns into a boring performance, and did the worst because of the completely ridiculous dialogue that he is forced to pronounce. Add a grieving widow to Kari Wuhrer, who obviously enjoys absolute confidence (especially the homeless), and has almost no common sense, and George Wendt is the duke, who is essentially a sober rule from Cheers, but MEANS! There are a couple of interesting “hallucination” episodes in this film (source of covers), but this film never goes deeper into this world. He prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, poor dialogue and an unlikely event after an incredible event. Oh God!
