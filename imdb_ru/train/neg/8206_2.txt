With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this movie to be at least tolerable. It was not After the first half hour I watched the rest with the remote in my hand, so that the fast forward was ready. So trite, so standard, everyone knows what will happen in every scene. You can even predict the dialogue word for word. This is one of those films that makes you think and say: "How did this movie ever work out?" To add something positive, I will add that there are some fun special effects. But, in general, if you watched 5 science fiction films or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
