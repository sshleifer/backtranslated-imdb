This “movie” is more like a music video. In an interview with 2004, Kusturica said that when he makes a movie, he wants to make music, and when he makes music, he wants to make movies. The best thing about “Promise me this” is music written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In the same interview, Kusturica said that for him the dialogues in the films are like noise. “Promise me this” has very little “noise”. <br /> <br /> I liked "Life is a miracle." It was like a music video for the first 30 minutes and in some moments later, but it had a beautiful plot. “Promise me this” has no plot. I was waiting for this film with high expectations, because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozhich - one of my favorite screenwriters, who also participated in "Life is a miracle." Ranko Bozhich writes excellent dialogues, but for Kusturitsa they are “noise”, and, to my great regret, I saw only two dialogues that I could define as written by Ranko Bozhich. Another part of the script was used by the director to create a chaotic music video to the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihich (the man who wrote the scripts for “The Time of the Gypsies” and the “Black Cat the White Cat”) said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. “A black cat with a white cat” was the only scenario for which Kusturica said he would not touch him. According to Gordan Michic, in the end Kusturica returns to the script, and if not, he does not make a good film. And I think this is the case with "Promise me this." He had to follow the script of Ranko Bozhicha. <br /> <br /> “Promise me” is declared “comedy”, but there are very few moments that make me laugh. Comedy moments in the same style as "Black cat, white cat", but not so funny. I think the difference lies in the fact that the “Black Cat White Cat” was written by Gordan Michich. <br /> <br /> However, I know some people who liked “Promise me this,” they find it a very positive movie.
