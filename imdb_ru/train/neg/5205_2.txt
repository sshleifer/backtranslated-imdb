Minimal scenario, minimal character development, minimal stable camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headaches causing sharp increases, the maximum number of characters wandering through the forest, doing nothing. Until the time flashes on the screen at 12:01, you can move forward and not miss anything, because there are three hunters who know nothing about doing nothing. Honestly, there is some interesting string music in the film, so maybe a music video would be the appropriate way. Unfortunately, this should not have been, and what should have lasted twenty minutes, goes beyond the limits of faith. Forget about the "Man-trigger", I know what I'm trying. - MERK
