may I ask why? the characters roar, scream, and chew on the scenery for no tangible reason, except that someone wanted to make a movie in Barcelona. Billy Baldwin, is that right? It is forgotten in the role of the policeman / alienated husband / loving father of a cute little blond girl. the story seems to have been cut and pasted from scenes thrown out of adventure films over the past three years. Ellen Pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to drain energy from every scene she is in. Her true acting range is displayed when she takes off her blouse, when the movie is shot from one scene chasing the limp. unfortunately, directing is rarely bad enough to be a camp or a parody. all this is just a cliche, familiar in all respects. the director chose his daughter as a premature boy, probably because no respectable agent would allow a client to spoil a career by being in such an unconvincing, far-fetched and uninteresting film. the only robbery here is the theft of investor money and the time of the viewer.
