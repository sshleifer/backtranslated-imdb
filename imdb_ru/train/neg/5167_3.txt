I appreciate this film with 3 skulls, just because the girls knew how to scream, it could be better, if the actors were better, the twins were ok, I believed that they were evil, but the older and younger brother, they really sucked badly, they seemed to read scripts instead of playing them .... spoiler: if they are vampires, then why do they freeze the blood? Vampires can't drink frozen blood, the sister in the film says let's drink it while she is alive ... but then, when they move to another house, they take a cooler, they are frozen. The end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> it was a huge waste of time, and it pissed me off because I read all the reviews about how great this film was, how many awards this film received, and this film was * *** single ** t !!!!
