I was impatient to see it as soon as I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster and suggested that it should be the best satire. What a brilliant idea for satire - the genre is common. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think all participants are probably aware of) is a catalog of lost opportunities, not quite appearances and (fortunately!) Some extremely fun, inspired pieces. Janeane Garafolo, which is very striking, looks very bad here, probably because it is embarrassing for her to struggle to make her flat role funny. David Hyde Pears is just sad to see, he tries his best to be funny and looks like a nerd Castro. Molly Shannon is so funny, just her VISION makes you laugh, but for some reason her segment does not turn into a snowball into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had a great adolescent behavior, and he was damn sexy, the other guys are also very funny (sassy). I think the problem is that the director is simply not promoting things at the right pace. He begins very calmly, and this establishes monotony. But when he lets things get really outrageous (the sequence of drugs is the second funniest moment I had in the movie all year, the first one also appears in the unsuccessful movie: Andrea Martin in the movie ALL OVER THE GUY complains about the movie IN & OUT) It's ridiculous. I wanted this film to work so badly, but it just didnâ€™t work. Clothing and style for 1981 are 99.9% perfect, and very few songs used are also perfect. It ended as an episode of MAD TV of moderate severity, full of disappointing too long sketches.
