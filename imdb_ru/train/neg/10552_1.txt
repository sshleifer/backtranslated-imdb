This piece of dirt is almost impossible to follow. The sound is crappy, the image quality becomes bad again - worse is worse! Things happen for no apparent reason, characters appear and disappear. Did the director suffer from a massive brain injury during its production? <br /> <br /> Bad film making aside, the story is disgusting, just sick of evil. alley And if the simulated murder scenes are not enough, you can enjoy the clips of real executed people. I watched almost all of this, but I had to shut down after I saw someone blow off their brains. Never before have I seen a film that would leave me so bashful and dirty.
