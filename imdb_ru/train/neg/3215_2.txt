There is one nude scene in the film: a man sitting on the edge of the bed with his bare genitals smacking in the middle of the screen. This is a rather long scene. What was the point? I almost think it should have been funny, but we watched it with my mom, and it was not funny to look at us as it seemed, for a whole minute. <br /> <br /> The film is cold None of the characters are even cute. Audrey Tatu, of course, cute, but her character unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I really do not recommend this movie. I expected it to be charming and fresh, but it was depressing. I was wondering if the director was from a very educated French family, and he looks down on these characters. <br /> <br />
