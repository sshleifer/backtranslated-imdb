I was not as impressed by this as many other reviewers. Of course, he has a couple of beautiful girls playing erotic lesbian vampires. Marianna Morris and Anulka D. play these two cute sirens with razor teeth that run up to the cars on the road, prevent them from going home (at dusk) and invite their victims ... sexually hungry men to their boudoir, What's happening there ... well, after they undress and kiss each other mostly, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larras really has some flashes of brilliance with his camera. Some scenes are pretty creepy and effectively filmed, but sex itself does not hold the film (no pun intended ... at least deliberately). There really is not much history. We have two girls. We are shown some kind of inexplicable and inexplicable beginning, where we see how they shoot a pistol. What for? What does this mean: â€œWhy do we have a boyfriend who stops for a few days, greets the guy at the hotel who insists that he knows him many years ago? pretty girls acting as vampires in the English countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the Carpathians? In any case, the script is replete with such flaws. He is also very rare in actions outside of the victims of capture, wine and food. them (literally) and then go to sleep in a crypt. The end comes with some more juicy scenes, but this is anti-climatic. As I said, there are several effective scenes of the director ... I especially liked the way girls dressed and acted in the woods in search of prey. The house is also very impressive. And both girls, as I said, are very cute. Marianna Morris stands out in particular - in many ways than for you. For you, old movie fans, the silent screen veteran Bessie Love has a short cameo film end.
