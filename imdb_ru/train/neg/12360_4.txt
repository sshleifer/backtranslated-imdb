Why should a man return to a man who kicks him in the teeth, not once, not twice, but again and again. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that in order to find love, we must accept to insult (not just forgive it, but completely accept it). Gosh! Not surprisingly, my first relationship lasted only ten years. I obviously did not embrace my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> Like the debut of Bukatinsky, this film has many remarkable aspects; however, to justify the reunion of Eli and Tom, more character development would be helpful. We are never familiar with Eli's masochism, in fact, we tend to think that he is not a masochist, although Tomâ€™s psycho-emotional sadism is very obvious.
