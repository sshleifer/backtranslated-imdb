This film is probably the worst film I've ever seen in my life - it surpasses the previous most horrible film “Spawn Slithers,” which I saw when I was about 10. <br /> <br /> Poor acting skill, meaningless and ridiculous dialogue, incomprehensible plot, confusion of cut scenes, even music irritated. Did I miss something? Well, the special effects were pretty good, but CGI doesn't make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I spent money to watch this movie. If someone has contact information for Hyun-ray Shima (director), please send it to my username "gmail" and I will contact him to personally demand a refund.
