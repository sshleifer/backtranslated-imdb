Feh. This film began in an interesting manner, but quickly ran a gamut from confusion to despondency. The tangled parts occurred mostly at the beginning, where the scenes were so numerous that it is difficult to say what happens during the first twenty minutes or so. The sad comes later, with a cool romance between two living people (pusses both). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most alive person in the film, which is sad. If the rest of the cast were up to its level, the film could be better. <br /> <br /> possible. As the storyline becomes really interesting for a while, it seems that the mad mother of a priestess of a dead sixteen-year-old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead, with a clearly unfortunate side effect, that all other dead people will also return to a solid human form and, most likely, start killing everyone. A sort of Japanese mystical Night of the living dead. But it does not come true. Although this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket tied to his head, tells uninteresting young people that this will happen if the priestess finishes his ritual, she will do so, and the only dead person who manifests herself is her daughter. There is no mass uprising of the dead, no walking army of corpses, nothing. The priest simply forces the girl's spirit to return to the land of the dead, taking the boyfriendâ€™s washed piece with her as she crushed his spine like a frail peanut (at that moment I was tempted to loudly greet as the idiot came up to kiss and caress the DEAD girl, Fuuuuu !!!). Robitusen, sucking, a spineless best friend, has a long, long introspective shot at the end, when she leaves the village for the last time, that's all. No real horror, no real eeriness, which the Japanese, as a rule, do much better than American filmmakers, with their emphasis on excessive delicate makeup for the face, no screaming Mimi. I was very disappointed.
