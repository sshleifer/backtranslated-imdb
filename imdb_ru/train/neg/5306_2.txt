Well, I am blessed. I saw two very strong stage performances: one in New York with an original cast of actors and the other in San Diego (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you are great!) . The last two evenings I’ve made my way through the DVD and still haven't finished. Too much outside dialogue, and too many scenes and people added. Yes, the four main performances are pretty good, especially Miss Strip. But comparing scenes with films is certainly an example of "less is more." Thickening the play to satisfy the spectators ’need for stage diversity and specificity was a poor choice. Please, please, please find a stage production somewhere near you.
