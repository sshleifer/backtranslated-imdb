I was afraid to take my nephews to this film, since I did not think that it would be well made. Children aged 6 and 10 saw this, so I gave up. I have to admit that it was not as bad as I thought, but still far from the book. The film seemed right with understanding and a sense of humor of a 10-year-old child. I found that the 6-year-old understood what was happening, and he presented solutions to the problems that arise. In the end, I had to explain that films sometimes do not show the best solutions to problems, because it is much more interesting to watch what happens if they make a “stupid” or “stupid” choice.
