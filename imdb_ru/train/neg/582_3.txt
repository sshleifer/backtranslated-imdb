A brilliant book with excellent characteristics and views on human nature, especially on the nature of drug addiction, which still resonates strongly. <br /> <br /> As for the film ... eh. Nothing special. The operator clearly had a biased propensity for whirling and circling around everything that made the viewer nauseous. Why the director didn’t put an end to this, I don’t know - but maybe he was too busy trying and somehow unable to achieve good performances from these usually excellent but unsuitable actors. In general, poor adaptation. Your three hours is better to spend on reading (or re-reading) books.
