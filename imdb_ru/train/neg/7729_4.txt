Wonderful TV mini-series, completely destroyed by a 45-year-old woman who is desperately trying to pass herself off as a 16-year-old intrigue! Without exaggeration, this is the actual age of the character played by Ali McGraw when the film opens shortly before a sudden attack in Pearl Harbor. This mini-series is actually the most classic example of the title of this post, and I refer to it whenever a topic comes up. <br /> <br /> This in itself makes it completely invisible, although it is one of the “World” dramas filmed during the Second World War. If you have a belly - or a decent fast-forwarding ability - you could enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am stunned by some comments related to the love story (pun). Did they watch the movie with their eyes closed? Or they are aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision." I myself am a Boomer, so do not think for a second, I'm some kind of proud young punk. 45 ALWAYS LOOKS 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age is graceful, damn it. <br /> <br /> The winds of war could be ... so good. How much more will we talk about this mini-series today, after about 25 years, if THIS brilliant actor played such an important and critical role? Right now, with the constant exhausted old delusional distraction, this in itself cancels most of the wonderful aspects of the Winds of War.
