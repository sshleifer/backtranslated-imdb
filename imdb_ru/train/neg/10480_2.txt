He has a great name, but this is true, and you won’t get more for your money, in fact, in the first 30-40 minutes of the movie it may seem funny, but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just can't understand what's going on until the action ends. <br /> <br /> Yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I don’t think he can do it. Only replaying is called !! .... period. The little child who plays for his son has absolutely no sense of acting, and I think it was just a favor he did, or something like that, because he had no idea what he was doing. casting, which they thought, performing comedians, they could do it, but they did not !! and sometimes tasteless cheap humor is so bad that I don’t buy it. <br /> <br /> But I hope this is as bad as it can be. For people to taste these DVDs, they had to offer them some food, it might work. <br /> <br /> Maca
