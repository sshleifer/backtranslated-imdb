The beginning of the 90s brought a lot of “bizarre” and “unusual” independent films, a special sub-genre of which is a semi-spiritual film about the criminal desert. Others are notable: “Wild at Heart”, “From Dusk Till Dawn” and, to some extent, “Natural Born Killers”. Good movies, such as Highway 666, Fate Turns On on the Radio, and this inept surreal masterpiece Under the Moon of Hula. This comedy, which aims at a certain emotional tone, reaches it, but continues to annoy. While the pursuit of the desert spiritual world and the cast of Chris Penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty or tough enough to become a good crime film, and not focused on laughter to really become a comedy, I will not blow up the end, but let's just say it is bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of the cancer genre. This is scum indie-mania.
