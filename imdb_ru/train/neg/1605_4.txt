I recently saw the documentary “The Revolution Will Not Be Broadcast on Television,” also known as “Chavez: Inside the Coup.” At first, I thought that this showed a genuine view from the inside on the events that occurred during the coup d'état in Venezuela in April 2002. I was worried that the tone of the narrative and the accompanying music were thought-provoking, and that in no case was Hugo Chavez criticized. This is unusual, because if the documentary gives an unbiased account of what happened, it should have been that too. After all, Chavez is certainly not holy. Fortunately, since the documentary has been around for several years, a lot of additional information is currently available on the Internet, and, for example, it was not difficult to find “An urgent investigation into Chávez - the coup of 5 European television corporations that funded the film, which represents blatant lies about Venezuela ". It lists many errors and intentional or unintentional falsification in a documentary. (Just use the title as a search string in Google, you will find it). Another interest The video recording of the findings of the numerous errors in this documentary “X-ray of a lie.” I think this is a good counterbalance to “Chavez: inside the coup.” It is available on video.google. I strongly advise you after watching “Chavez: inside the coup” take a look at “Roentgen Lies” and then form an opinion. I came to the conclusion that Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Brien (consciously or not) participated in the propaganda of Chavez.
