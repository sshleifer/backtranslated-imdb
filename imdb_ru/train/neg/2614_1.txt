A sequel (actually a remake) of the 1996 Live Disney remake "101 Dalmations". Kruella de Ville (Glenn Close) was released from prison after she was "cured" from obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But the “medicine” is broken when Cruella hears about Big Ben, and she again goes on a crazy quest to make herself a perfect coat of Dalmatian skins. <br /> <br /> This film is a lot of bad levels, starting with the fact that this is a Thanksgiving Family Castle movie, designed to suck up all the latest money from a Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close replays for Cruella. With all that she had to put up with in this film - a lame scenario, endless makeup, baking at the end of the cake - I hope they gave her an extremely large salary. <br /> <br /> (Talking about where, in the world, you will find a factory of fur coats, a bakery with a conveyor belt Rube Goldberg and a restaurant with candles located in the same building - how do you do in the culmination of this film?) Of course, true movie stars must be dogs. They play the role of “Macaulay Calkin” in this film, drawing all the silly “Home Alone” jokes to the villains. (Bite them in the crotch, run around with hands with luggage carts, sprinkle them with icing, etc., etc., etc., etc.). I have to admit, dogs were pretty good actors - much better than humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely lost in this film as a furious French furrier. Two people "dog lovers" - paraphrased from an earlier film, but with different actors - completely boring. When they eat spaghetti at an Italian restaurant, the film intersects between two lovers and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene from the movie “The Lady and the Tramp”. I thought to myself, “Oh, please don't go there!” I almost expected people to do a satire on the scene of the dinner “Lady and the Vagabond” - like Charlie Sheen did in “Hot Shots: Part Deux” - making “a kiss with spaghetti -unnyu ", pushing the meatballs with his nose, etc. <br /> <br /> And don't turn me on to the annoying parrot in the voice of Eric Idle. <br /> <br /> Costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the film * are good. But they are the only good thing in the film. The rest is unbearable duck.
