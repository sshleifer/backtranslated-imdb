How can you say that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing at it, of course! The plot was well covered by other reviewers, so I’ll just add a few points about the fun of it all. <br /> <br /> In some reviews, it seemed to me, there is a place in South America, in others - in Africa. it was some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly this happens seems a mystery. The ogre's tribe consists of a pair of black women, some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa beating drums ... God the devil is a big black man with a terrible pink eye. > <br /> One of the most “bizarre” moments in the film is when Pablito finds his partner hanging on a tree covered with something like an orange substance, which, I believe, is blood, starts screaming for a few minutes ( it is actually funny), and then his partner’s head falls to the ground, and Pablito kicks him a little for what I suppose is “shit and giggles”, and his eyes actually move ... <br / > <br /> But, of course, then the “freak” disappeared when you realize that your eyes were moving, because the film is just bad ... <br /> <br /> I’m so Olgo did not laugh, and I definitely recommend this film for Sunday with friends, and you have nothing to do ... take a beer and start watching this film, you will like it! If you are looking for a real horror or horror movie, do not worry.
