"Fly Me To The Moon" should be the worst animated film I've seen in a long time. This suggests that I took my son to watch each animated release in the last 4 years. The story should be generous ... trite. The voice acting is terrible, it sounds too cute. Humor from Romper Room. The animation is passable for the Nicolodeon cartoon, but it comes out on the big screen, not on cable television. <br /> <br /> She gets 2 only because of the normal three-dimensional image. Some scenes had a slightly stimulating image, but we have seen much better in the past. I also question the perseverance of the filmmakers so that the characters fly off the screen, and not into it in most scenes. Although it is interesting at first, it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to me that this created an impression of indifference on the part of the creators. <br /> <br /> I will say this: he had a pretty cool soundtrack. And, by the way, my son was also not thrilled with this. Bad movie.
