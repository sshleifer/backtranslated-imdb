I know you read it before, in countless other films, no doubt if you read the comments here, but the voodoo academy still remains the absolute worst film I could track. No doubt, the really bad ones are not even available for purchase or viewing on TV, but even so, I feel that it will be fair to admit that I am not just some kind of stupid tenant who chose badly. <br /> <br /> I’ve seen two thirds of the top 100 films rated here on IMDB, and I’ll mark the rest of them at every opportunity. most of them stand head and shoulders above this ... superior in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to rate really bad movies (like in movies without humor, even how bad they are) by the number of people you have to watch it with in order to do it completely. if you can watch it yourself, it's not that bad. if you can watch it with one friend ... it's bad, but it can be much worse. <br /> <br /> It took us 5 people to get through the voodoo academy. and even usually funny moments of watching bad movies (for example, detecting a microphone with a boom, 3 times in this, if I'm not mistaken) could not remove the dry taste in the mouth. Yes, I watched it, but I also made four of my friends watch it with me to achieve this goal. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray that we will see the directors ... to think that there could be a version with another 20 minutes of large eyebrows with oil-bearing glands of the children, rubbing their torsos, just scares me. most of the film is centered around this. <br /> <br /> I applaud David Decote for making this film in two days with a small budget, just as I applaud him for convincing people to pay him to do what need to. Without a doubt, a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but this is not a good movie. the original horror shop was shot in the same time for a comparative amount of money (including inflation) and was a real decoration. this is no excuse for how bad this baby is. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ahead ... <br /> <br /> You shouldn’t even make out the holes in the plot or cliché, know that all the heroes of the characters .. ... the course of the film is insane ... nothing ... I wonder how much time decoteau devotes to the breast massage itself. no matter what your orientation or gender ... rubbing just does not stand up to such time on the screen. <br /> <br /> acting is cheese ... but not too amateur ... I have seen much worse in the best films ... but, anyway, this is a semi-competent transmission of some of the worst lines that you Ever heard of a movie, it really pleases. <br /> <br /> Rent it if, like me, you have a hobby with the worst of the worst, and only if you are going to watch it with a group of people who are willing to work to get through it. This is not ha ha ha. This is an endurance test that you probably want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure there is worse ... but I would not be surprised if it has the name decoteau on it.
