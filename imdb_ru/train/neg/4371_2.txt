After leaving the popular Andy Griffith Show, Don Notts gallantly tried a celebrity in a movie with a series of insane, but sophisticated comedy machines. Unfortunately, “Reluctant Astronaut”, shot cheaply (like most Notts films), is much worse than its others. Don is playing a small city string that is being taken to an astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want him to be their new janitor! Some may say that a weak satire benefits from the then fresh fever of Americans for a new era of technology, but this film is in fact only a vague pretext to keep restless children busy. This is a good start, with good settings and nostalgic locations, but it is becoming more and more soulless and idiotic. * from ****
