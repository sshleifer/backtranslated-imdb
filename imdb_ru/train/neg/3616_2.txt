If you just look at the cover of this movie, that's cool. DO NOT. The film itself put me to sleep. It was a slow movement, there was minimal violence and poor use of obscurity. The acting was the material of the lower feeder, and the plot, although it would be cool for another film, was poorly shown here. They even kill the only cute character in the whole movie! I give him 2 out of 10, because the only thing that was good was the turn of the plot at the end. In addition, you may want to save yourself from this trash movie.
