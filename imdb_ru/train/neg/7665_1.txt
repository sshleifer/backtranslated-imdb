Honestly, I can't take the time to write about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is too short. What I say is that Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things: 1. It makes you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. He manages to throw a few useless plots into the air, but throw them all away. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. This completely disgraces the classic computer game on which it is supposedly based, being a complete failure in all aspects of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Dr. Ball, if this is really what you are (I think the proctology is here), what on earth are you doing in the director's chair?
