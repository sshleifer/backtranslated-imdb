I am sure that Operation Dames was a favorite on the road at the time. There is absolutely nothing in the plot that you might have missed if you were otherwise busy. And if you needed a mood for other activities, you had some tortuous cuties on your screen to cheer you up. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, not everything Operations Dames can count on. This happens in the Korean War, where a platoon of soldiers along with the British Tommy is moving too far forward and should return to the UN line. Already bad enough, but these guys are also faced with a jammed bunch of girls from ODR and their choreographer in the same predicament. <br /> <br /> You know, the sad thing about this film is that it took several generations of women to finally get recognition from the army in combat situations. These pranks from the USO overshadow the release of women. In fact, even the bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these people cannot keep him in his pants. <br /> <br /> But it was probably better to remind some that they were at the entrance for. This is a nameless act, better if I do not recognize any of them for any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Chief Opera Dames is definitely a team failure.
