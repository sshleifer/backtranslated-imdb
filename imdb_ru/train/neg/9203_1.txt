Many people like to point out this television film when they argue with Hanks-Phil's numerous legions that Tom really shot shit films (I think The Bachelor Party was great, but that's another story). The film is dedicated to the "game in the style of Dungeons and Dragons", which ultimately leads our young Gampa to hallucinatory insanity. The story is enchanting in the early 1980s, because it focuses on the imminent threat to our young people that these evil role-playing games present. <br /> <br /> However, I prefer to see Labyrinths and Monsters as a turning point. point in "What happened to Chris Mikipey?" story. we all remember him as “Rabbit Rudy” in “Meatballs” and as miserable Clifford in “My Bodyguard”, where he gave us all a sharp thrill by knocking the crap out of Matt Dillon. Few can argue (especially those of us who regularly read “Dynamite!”) That great things awaited him. <br /> <br /> And then came Ron Jaffe. The line between bad behavior and bad writing is as thin as a razor, so I leave it up to you to decide whose fault is Makepeace performance. All I know is that the last major release in which I saw it was "Vamp", and that was in 1986. He played the small role of brother Sean Penn in "Falcon and Snowman", but by that time the Brat Pack torch had already been transferred to others with more straight hair and bright resumes. <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this film with a clear conscience. Look at him, if only to see the younger and more idealistic Chris Miquip, before Ron Jaffe feasts in his soul.
