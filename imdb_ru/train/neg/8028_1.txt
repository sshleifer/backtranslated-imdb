You are welcome! Do not waste money on this film. This is really nothing more than the boring robbery of a German witch made by some students. I couldn't finish watching this, and usually I like to watch all kinds of B-movies. How could they find a distributor for this? !!! It's funny however: look at Wikipedia on the “dark area”. The guy who wrote the post should be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from manufacturers. Money to be spent on actors, camera and editing. Even this would not help, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately, the "dark area" has already attracted too much attention. Please, the director, producer and author of this film, STOP making such films ... You are not doing yourself a favor. The world would be better off without this film.
