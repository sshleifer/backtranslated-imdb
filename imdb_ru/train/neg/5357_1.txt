I do not know where to start. This film is very similar to one of those cheap children's Saturday shows, which they filmed in the late 80s and early 90s. Kind of like Captain Power or Power Rangers. It is full of bad digital overlays and the really stupid sounds of “secret agencies” and villains. <br /> <br /> The game is so bad that it is not even funny. The direction is terrible, and there is little continuity now. It seems that someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there should have been a plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the film appears early when several villains play an explosive device in the agents' car. For some reason, even though the device is clearly stated as “remotely detonated,” the bad guys decide to chase her on their motorcycles when she leaves. This chase continues. all the time with bad guys doing funny and completely pointless cycling stunts. Stand on bikes, ride bikes and so on. At some point, an accident occurs, and one of the attackers is thrown off his bike, we see that the motorcycle (obviously cgi) is thrown over the agents' car, but the driver has disappeared. Then, after a few seconds, the cyclist and bike return ... apparently unscathed from the accident. At this point, despite the fact that an explosive device was installed in the car, attackers prefer to shoot the agent as they drive past and then blow up her car. What was also done with cgi. Is the sound confusing? It is just like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I could point out that when I say cgi, we are not talking about the Lord of the Rings cgi. We are talking about cheap cheese Power Rangers type cgi, in fact, I think it would be better on the Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savini and Todd shot this film, I never know, I can only assume that they did it for money, as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed ... probably the last.
