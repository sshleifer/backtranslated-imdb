This is a terrible film, and in no one scene is there a drop of true emotions. The characters are not reflected, clearly drawn, predictable, the storyline is obvious and typical of Hollywood desires. <br /> <br /> William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 years old when this film was shot, but he plays someone in his early 40s and looks as if he was over 60. Kay Lenz was 20 years old, and he was written to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found on the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection. <br /> <br /> Holden's character - Clint Eastwood's age when he made this film (not) by coincidence - is placed with the obvious attributes of the 60s hippie predecessor: bachelor pillow, swinging hi-fi, lunches at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously not cool - the clattering sound of old fogs desperately want the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon to find them and their big happy cars sexy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Youth culture has never been so desperate. And I'm afraid to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for young people that he accepted this embarrassing role.
