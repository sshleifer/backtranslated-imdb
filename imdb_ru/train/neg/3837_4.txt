I saw (too) a lot of clicks from this company - this one is about the middle of the package. On the other hand, he is a little more stylized and controlled than some of them - less of the minor attempts at humor and greater commitment to the story (whatever the cost). Many of their titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad appearances and amateur sensibilities. On the other hand, I found that the simulated sex scenes are not as hot as some of their other films (for example, Vampire Foxes, Gladiator Erotica, Spidebabe, or Mrs. Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Munde always gets 10 per meter, like Darian Kane. I found Barbara Joyce as hot as school marma and Ruby Larocca as a sexy little beauty. <br /> <br /> Watch it with the remote in your (free) hand, at night when you need a break. from porn. Do not waste your time studying history - you have more important things to do with your life. This is not a film, this is pure T & A, but by this standard is not bad.
