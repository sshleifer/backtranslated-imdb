Perhaps you should not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars - this is the original hip-hop. There are a lot of original early hip-hop artists on Beat Street, but they were made clear that this could be a big breakthrough, of course, for some it was, and it's nice. But if you see it as an original hip-hop culture, you are mistaken. It overproduces and has Hollywood sauce. Rather, look for the first two films I mentioned. They talked about what happens to life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating of this film is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even delusional. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction are terrible, people love music and dancing. I love dancing, but at that time I thought that electro was the death of hip-hop (I was very happy when a new generation of classic hip-hop artists like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagn Mc's, Brothers Jungle, Bizmarki and many others), and I still do not like most of the bits in this film, and therefore it does not work for me. I mean, Wild Style doesn't have many stories, but the music there is great and authentic. Of course, tastes differ, and this is normal. But as far as I understand, this film is rubbish, with the exception of break dance and music, so I cannot rate it higher than 4 out of 10.
