Shown in 1955, the film “COBWEB” is all star performances: from the silent veteran of the screen LILLIAN GISH to the posterity of the acting studio SUSAN STRASBERG. What do you think of the film in an exclusive mental hospital ...... high drama? The relationship between doctor and patient? Shock therapy? No, this howler is about who will choose the curtains for a mental hospital! Do you think I'm kidding? You will not believe your eyes when you watch this incredible storyline, which turned into a movie! Progressive head cutting Dr. McIver (Richard Widmark) wants all hospital patients to be involved in the design, selection and execution of the necessary new draperies. McIvera's wife, who plays the marble with GLORIA GRAHAM speech, also wants to receive 2 cents for this monumental task. Like a long time staff member Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you wonder if he really got too carried away with the smallest details because of his marriage because of anxiety, Judy Garland. Talented actors such as Lauren Bacall, Susan Stresberg, Charles Boyer and John Kerr are wasted in this hockey story. What were they thinking about?
