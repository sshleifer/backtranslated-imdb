Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I saw in a long time that really scared me. The game wasn't too bad, and Cupid's killer was believable and disturbing. <br /> <br /> Bad: the storyline and plot of this film is incredibly weak. There was nothing special about it. The way the killer killed his victims was horrible and disgusting. I do not recommend this film to anyone who cannot cope with blood. <br /> <br /> Overall: good fear, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** of *****
