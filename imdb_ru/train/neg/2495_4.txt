The problem with such films is that literally dozens make them every year. Fortunately, for use only a few get a theatrical release, while others are being pushed directly to a video or television such as this film. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this film is its originality. This is one of those films that use the Die Hard Nutrition formula, when a tough, but worried guy ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, the character played by Casper Van Dien, who works at a security agency that carefully tests security procedures for companies and individuals. In this case, he is sent to a cruise ship, which, of course, is stolen. You can see this movie as a kind of a combination of “Die Hard” and “Air Force One”, and the film does not even try to hide that these two films were probably his biggest source of “inspiration”. In fact, you can not treat this film as original. He uses all the clichés from the book, and this film does not really offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles something original. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from a movie like this, it has a very weak script. Or rather, it has a very lazy letter. As I said earlier, there is nothing original in the film, but there are some elements in the story itself that are highly unlikely and are just truly mocked. I mean, hijacking a huge cruise liner, in which there are only about 8 guys, half of which carry only a few small guns, and then asks for a ransom of "only" 10 million dollars, for a ship whose cost is about 10 times higher than this amount , in itself is already quite a mockery. How are they going to share this money later? Every person gets a little over a million or something? This is hardly beneficial for such a large and risky enterprise. And then there is the case of the seizure of passengers hostage. Somehow, they manage to take all the passengers hostage to a huge ship, and they manage to put them in one room, with one guy with a gun that he can't even hold while watching them. However, you will never see more than 30 hostages, as if they were all the people who were on board at that time. Also, when Van Dien’s character goes in search of his son, and vice versa, in which room they enter on a huge cruise ship, they always collide with each other instantly. Just a few examples of lazy writing in a movie. <br /> <br /> But this, of course, an action movie, so the story, of course, becomes secondary. But again, this is not as if this film shows any good actions at all. Half of the actors look as if they never had a weapon, and the film is full of vague ridicule. It really becomes funny in some moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are also no better actors in the film, although I have to say that Casper Van Dean is really not a bad “thriller” and actor, as for the genre and the scheme of the B-film. However, he also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; no matter how old he is, he never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager. Van Dien once started as a promising young actor, but acting in such films really doesn’t help his career. He is probably capable of something better, although he is never given the right opportunity to show it. All other actors also cope with their task well enough, but their characters are so formal that they never become really interesting. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not the worst genre film I've ever seen, but it's also not the most original or memorable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
