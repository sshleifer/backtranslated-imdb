I'm a big fan of old horror films, and since I'm middle-aged, for me the old one is a film shot before 1970, most of which was filmed from the 1920s to the 1960s. I'm not a big fan of more modern horror films, with the exception of Creepshow 1, which I think is great. I could remember these stories, but I really liked the monster out of the box with Hal Holbrook, and the story of a really clean guy was a great ending. All the stories were great. So why do I like them so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was bad, bits of horror were reinforced by close-ups of a face scared by fear, and funny bits were really funny! In this sequel, there are either very few of these elements, or they are completely absent! I am writing this only after seeing it partially, because the film was a waste of time, and I turned it off to do other things, such as writing movie reviews on IMDb.com, laughs. When George Kennedy and old Dorothy Lamur get the maximum bill, he tells you something ..... 4 out of 10. Besides, Romero’s experience is hard to find here, they must have told him to reduce it to the standard of PG ( I don’t know what it was rated for, but it seemed to me PG), and this is not a good thing for a film in which nothing happens anymore. This can be seen on the cable channel Encore, if your dying (bullshit) sees it.
