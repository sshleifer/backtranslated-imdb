I love a good war movie, and I fall into the category of "been there, done that." Therefore, I would like to think that my review is accurate (IMHO). After watching this movie on DVD, I can say with confidence that it was a bunch of garbage. I can not recommend you this movie. <br /> <br /> It started from the fact that I screamed on TV, saying: “You would not do that,” and so on. D. But soon I realized that a little experience would be a hindrance, so I relaxed a little . But on the initial scene, when the trailer wheel fell off, I had the unpleasant feeling that this film would be a predictable fraud ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic in the EOD scenes, I just know that the army team had some of the most patient rebels ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. So much so that all the time I had to scratch my head. Then, when you think you know where the story is going, the guys from Humvee go on a journey through the desert. One of the most valuable assets in the theater is a fun encounter with some SAS contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was just ridiculous. It just didn't make any sense and made me want to turn off right there. Then, so that they stretch it for so long, really test my patience. It started with the “Right to Contact” and quickly went down. If you had a British accent, you were hit, but if you were part of the EOD team, then suddenly you were a great chance and saved the day. Then, as you thought it was over, it stretched out for an inexplicably long period, adding nothing to the story at all. You just stayed to look and ask, why is it not over yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had a booze scene where they just beat each other for a laugh ... another scene where you just wanted it to end. This added nothing to the film. <br /> <br /> Then, when my life seemed very boring, the main star came out from behind the wire to track down someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. He challenged all the logic and ability to write a good storyline ... it was pointless and terrible. I still do not understand why they spent time on it. Then, to watch him run through the busy streets heading back to the camp, I was rolling on the floor laughing. Pure comedy :) The sad fact is that this storyline is everywhere in the series, not deciding what it wants to be. I thought it would be stupid illogical scenes of EOD, but then they continued to go on tangents, trying to be something else. But no matter how hard it tried, I'm just bored to death. All I wanted was for this to end. It was a dirty compilation of stupid scenes mixed in a series of stupid, meaningless, action scenes. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it. Perhaps my work experience has jeopardized pleasure, but even the naive must understand that it simply does not make sense. The only thing more stupid than this movie is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which should be the work of a 24-hour PR team that seems to use this site to make everyone think that this is good. Sorry guys ... just not! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... it just tires you out.
