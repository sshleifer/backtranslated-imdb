Let me confess. I found this video used and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on his jacket. But inside was another story. In addition to the fact that the film was basically a parody of the special effects of the Invisible Man genre (well visible lines and other similar attributes), the script did not miss a single chance - in fact, it struggled - insulting everyone WASP Races and imaginary homosexuals. Every insult directed at the person in the script was either homophobic or racist, or both. This is starting to unnerve, along with a shaky sound, candid camera-style photography and a melodramatic plot. However, the end of a few surprise. But by the time you get there, you will not care. Sorry, it could be a good movie.
