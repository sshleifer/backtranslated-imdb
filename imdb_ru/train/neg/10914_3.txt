Isn't it funny when an ordinary schmuck, leading a miserable life, suddenly faces something incredibly magical, turning his life upside down and forcing him to learn some valuable lessons along the way? This formula never gets old, does it? This is such a sure way to make a classic movie! Just look at the main hits, such as "Liar, Liar" and "Big"! ... It must have been Rob Schneider’s mindset when he made the semi-successful two Bigalou: Male Gigolo and followed her with Animal. Since I’ve already traced the sarcasm plot, let me color it in more detail: Schneider plays a loser cop who suddenly fell into a tragic accident, but escaped thanks to an operation ... by a blunt vet who loads him with animal parts forcing him to laugh like a horse , at the wrong time, run like a cheetah, etc. This film is a bit more sympathetic than other Schneider films in the main roles (for example, another excerpt from the film Hot Chick), but it almost gives the impression that they want the viewer I hated it, assigning a reality TV star romantic role (Colleen Haskell of "Survivor") and inserting a cameo Norm Macdonald. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. Sorry - nothing unforgettable, except for the cost of production. I just want to finish this review by saying that small links to other films in the film may be normal, but when it comes to the fact that the lines are delivered exactly the same way (“You can do it!”), There is a word for it - “ milking. " Actually, here's another word - “cheap.”
