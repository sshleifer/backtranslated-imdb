The disappointing end of the season, which began so well ... <br /> <br /> Exodus 2 and other famous episodes were among the best on television on any TV show where it was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure that this was an episode, which was a disappointment, but the crappy guitar music accompanying the final sequence would have been laughable and would have been better at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It’s as if corporate executives didn’t like the ending of the note in a low key, and they wanted to cheer him up. They failed and rather spoiled everything. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that this is not a trend in the future. <br /> <br /> However, we at least saw the return of a certain person, even if it was somewhat strange and trite done.
