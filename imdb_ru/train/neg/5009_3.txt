Perhaps it was the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot didn't make much sense, and the game was terrible. I am a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she is usually a wonderful actress, I can not imagine why she decided to make this film. Her character, Piper, drunk almost the entire movie, except for the initial scene. On the other hand, there were several moments in the film in which the acting was so bad that I actually laughed out loud. But despite this, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes, but it's 80 minutes of your life that you completely lose.
