Elfriede Jelinek, not yet a well-known name, is the Nobel Prize in Literature. Her novel spawned a film that won the second prize at Cannes and the main prizes for men and women. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so humiliated that something is going? <br /> <br /> “Gobble, gobble” is the UK's favorite orthographic view of the bubbling turkey noise. In the world of cinema, turkey is a monumental failure, as measured by cash vouchers or critical reception. “Gobble, gobble” and The Piano Teacher are ideal partners. <br /> <br /> The incredible horror of this well-known film can not be overestimated. It starts very badly, as if done to annoy the viewer. Credits interrupt non-essential scenes for more than 11 minutes. We meet with Professor Erica Kohut, apparently, an alter ego of the famous writer, rock professor of piano. She lives with her hoarse and domineering mother. Dad is a legalized madman who dies unnoticed during what comes of action. <br /> <br /> Consider Piano Teachers are difficult, apart from registering his troubles. What we see in the film (and, perhaps, read in the book, as far as I know), is a tasteless, exploitative, meaningless story about an emotional pendulum that swings to and fro, not moving further. <br /> <br /> Erica, whose name is used minimally, was originally shown as a person with strong musical sensitivity, but otherwise completely suppressed. Not really, because there are purses two steps away from the scene with her crazed mother in the beginning, which ends with a copious apology. If the reviewer had to (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when it would make it simpler), Elric's violently changing moods would be him. <br /> <br /> A young piece, Walter, is learning to become a “low voltage” engineer, whatever he is, and playing hockey in his spare time is also a talented pianist. He meets Elrica at an old-fashioned concert in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be in Paris. In a brisk fashion with such art, he immediately falls in love and begins “Cherche la femme”. <br /> <br /> Repressed Erika has an addiction to hard pornography, as shown briefly, but graphically for a few seconds, while she sniffs a napkin taken from the trash can in a private kiosk where she looks. <br /> <br /> Walter performs a brilliant audition, and Erika reluctantly accepts him as a private student whose teaching style is characterized by remoteness, hostility, despondency and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Soon, he declares his love and soon pursues Erica as a lady, where they participate in soft plateau and incomplete oral sex. Erica retains control of her lover. She promises to send him a letter with instructions for further pleasant exchanges. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, frighteningly jealous because of Walter's kindness to a nervous student who literally arranges shit before a rehearsal for a future concert, Erica fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass, which causes serious lacerations for these delicate hands that play on the piano. <br /> <br /> On the next big stage (bypassing self-harming the genitals, etc.), Walter arrives at the apartment he shares with his mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, tied up, spanked, and so on. Reasonable Walter is currently pushing off and going off into the night. <br /> <br /> At the moment, almost an hour more. The viewer can only fear the worst. Eric tracks down Walter on the ice rink, where he plays hockey. They are removed to the back room. Lustful Wally can't resist his hands tugging on his pants. His "baby gravy" is soon expelled along with other stomach contents. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Repulsed, but caught on a hook, perhaps wishing to avenge the insult so recently applied to the floor, Walter returns to Erica’s apartment. Can you guess what is happening now? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes rude, and Eric becomes a victim. At one moment, he locks Maman in her room and beats Erica, and the next time he kicks her in the face, has sex with her and renews the declaration of love. <br /> <br /> Am I unjust in this resume? Watch the movie if you want, but I would advise you not to do it. <br /> <br /> Everyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if he is in a good mood. I could tell you about the complex depiction of human relations, transmitted by this film, if I wanted to. But I “prefer not to do this,” because it is a cheap and unpleasant film that appeals to basic instincts and says nothing. <br /> <br /> I have to say that Erik, depressed by her parents, craves for love, ineffectively searches for her in pornography, wrongly rejects him when he literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realizes that she does not like being hurt , blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> in the world there is, for reasons, did not explain, delayed it. She obviously makes a monster of someone who seemed superficially loving - but, of course, we all know that any person is a potentially violent rapist, because this is his inherent nature, even if he tries to tell himself and the world differently. <br /> <br /> At the end, if you have the patience to be there, there is a slight twist. Before heading to the final scene, where she should act as a substitute for a dirty student with her arms torn off, Erika puts the knife in her purse. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you beat me to it. She stabs herself in the area dangerous to life and leaves. Drop credits. <br /> <br /> If it brought the second prize at Cannes, how bad were the rest of the entries?
