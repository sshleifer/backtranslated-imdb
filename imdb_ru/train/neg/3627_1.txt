I never loved classic movies. Films like Patton, Walking Your Way, How Green Was My Valley, Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Citizen Kane tired of me. However, I would prefer to watch any of these films 3,469 times, being tied to a chair, than to watch the film “American in Paris” once in the most luxurious suite in history. If I had done the last, I would probably have slept all the time. <br /> <br /> Color art and music did not interest me, Gershwin or not Gershwin. Dancing and singing can help insomnia fall asleep. The dialogue does not coincide with Singin 'in the Rain. Basically this movie is boring. The only other film I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me. I slept only 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (It is a pity that we cannot give zeros.)
