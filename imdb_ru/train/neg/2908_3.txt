Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez, and perhaps this is brilliant literature, this adaptation to the cinema really sucks because it looks more like fighting a dream than enjoying some cinematic delicacies. The story of an old couple whose son died and lives life in which poverty prevails, and where the main character is a rooster, which, I hope, one day will bring some money for the upcoming cockfight. I am not in the mood to say more words about this useless pretentious work, you may have seen Salma Hayek here, but sit for 90 minutes in front of your screen just for this? No thanks.....
