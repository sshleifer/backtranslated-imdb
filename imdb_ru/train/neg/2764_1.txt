First, I have no idea how this movie came out on the big screen. This is not even a low-budget movie channel SCI-Fi, it's just awful. My friend and I, who love action films, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc., went to see this movie, waiting for this movie for me Transformers with dragons, meaningless entertainment. All we got is thoughtless one and a half hours. CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is so terrible, like acting, it made up for it. These are mostly Chinese dragon legs that come back every 500 years ... Looks like a nice remake of Rain of Fire? No, the plot tries to be deeper than it should be, leaving not only the holes in the plot, but also magic, and a very small real war between dragons (rather large snakes) becomes simply ridiculous. The director tried to add a bit of humor to the film, which failed. My friend and I laughed at it all (along with all 5 viewers) and could not believe that we spent money on it. The short trailer on TV compensates for most of the action, and shit all the rest. I have seen a lot of B films, such as Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say that if you want to laugh without stopping for an hour, watch this. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t drink ... but it would help before watching this movie
