Clap. This is pretty bad. The performance is not too good to begin with, and the decision to transfer it to the film does not benefit him - especially since Ash does not decide how she wants to relate to the theatrical origin of the material (sometimes we watch the audience theatrical audience, etc.) and decided to use non-standard editing style, which is designed to constantly remind you that you are watching a film, whereas in reality it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very bad film of a director who is overloaded by her material. The central performance of World Sorvino is simply amazing: scenic and impetuous, as if she plays a role through the work of Helena Bonham-Carter “Trade Ivory”. Only Fiona Shaw performs an appreciable play - and perhaps her theatrical pedigree means that she copes with the material best - but it is difficult to watch a film for just one performance, even if this performance is as light, truthful and all as Show. Ben Kingsley turns in a normal and uncoupled turn, and Diana Rigg’s daughter Rachel Sterling plays her supporting role in this. Unfortunately, nothing of Bertolucci's magic rubbed his wife if this film should be proof.
