I did not see the original, but I just wanted to make a small note for everyone who scrolls this page so far: “The Wicker Man” is the worst film I have seen this year. Perhaps even in two years. I would like to ask the theater to return their money or turn back the time to warn myself not to see them. <br /> <br /> I will give him two positive nods: Cage's sarcastic character, at least, laughed a little at me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's all. Here are the mockery. The plot of the film moves only forward, because other characters will not give Cage direct answers - and he puts up with it !!! How could this go on for the hour of my time (much less days in the film), is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill out the library. How someone could read this script and think: “Yes, people have to pay 11 dollars to see this shady sketch of what the film should look like” - this is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Or even rent it on DVD.
