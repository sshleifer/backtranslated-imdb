Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the latest in the series, and, like Part 4, it is not related to the first three, except for the title and the fact that it is a horror movie about Christmas. <br /> <br /> With the exception of not paying attention, some obvious things happen here ... Mickey Rooney plays a toy maker named Joe Petto, and his creepy son is called Pinot. Call anyone? One evening, a little boy named Derek heard a knock on the door and opened it to find a gift for him on the doorstep. Even though it said “do not open until Christmas,” he still starts to open it, but his dad stops him, who scolds him, sends him to sleep and opens the gift himself. Inside there is a little red ball that sprouts Santa's hands and head and kills dad. Oh, maybe he should have stayed well enough alone. Of course, Derek was injured by the incident, as he watched him from the stairs, but he does not grow into the killer Santa, he just stops talking. <br /> <br /> A mysterious stranger lurks around, who seems to be very interested in the toys that Joe Petto makes. We even see him buying a bouquet when Derek's mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to take him out of his injury. And what exactly does this guy do? Well, we're not sure, but he seems to be sorting out these toys to see what makes them tick. He does not allow his owner to evict him, promising him to pay him in cash the next day, and gave him a toy "Larry Larva" for his child, but, of course, "Larry" is not a good toy and comes out of the box in the car and, of course , something is not so beautiful. <br /> <br /> In any case, in the end, what happens to Joe Petto and Pinot, of course, is revealed, and, like in the old story, Pinot is not a "real boy." Pinot is probably even more agitated and capricious, because he suffers from "Kenitalia" (smooth plastic crotch), which may explain his evil deeds. And the identity of the lurking stranger is also revealed, and there is even a kind of happy ending. Whee. <br /> <br /> Step up from part 4, but not so much. Again, Brian Yuzna and Screaming Mad George are involved in some decent special effects, but not enough to do it well. A few remnants from part 4 also stick out like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that doesn't matter. Anyway, now I see a whole series from my system. Now, if I could get some of that out of my brain. 4 out of 5
