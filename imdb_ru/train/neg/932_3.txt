I watched this movie and hoped all the time that something would improve. What good is a guy without emotion? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You will never see Alex showing emotions to anyone but his son. Yes, I know that this is why his son is the only one who makes him lose his temper (if you can call it that), I understand. <br /> <br /> Characters are not developed, relationships - there is not enough time to understand. In one scene, Sarah says they will not fall in love, and the next time we see her, she talks about how his death really shook her because they were so close? There are a lot of logical synapses in this movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like someone watched “Boogie Nights” and wrote this piece to emulate Little Bill. Even the scene where he “loses his temper” is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife, even the expression of his face (or his absence). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - you were there, did that - can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> In this film, not only were there no emotions, there was no content, a good script, developed characters and plot. And this is definitely not enough of my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
