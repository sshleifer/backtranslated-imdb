In leap years, some strong strikers are shot on the local and regional film and television scene. And yet they cannot save this film. It has so many things going against it - over the action, overly melodramatic, bad script, inconsistent direction; and too few things for that - decent music, good cinematography. This comment is mainly for those who throw all local films into one basket after watching this film and says that all local films are bad. Please do not judge the rest on the basis of this film. This television soap opera, masquerading as a romantic feature film. My hopes were great when I bought my ticket, and my hopes were broken for five minutes in the film.
