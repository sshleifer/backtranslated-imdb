Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don’t know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she is definitely in sexual relations with men. She is still researching, trying to find “more data” so that she can see what she wants from life and the men in her, although it seems that at her age she should already have a pretty good idea. (However, I cannot agree with someone who says that Young is too old for this role. If so, then we will all grow old so well.) For the most part, this film left me cold, although it was by no means The case is not the worst of this type you will ever see. And unlike the recent Eyes Wide Shut, at least something is happening in this.
