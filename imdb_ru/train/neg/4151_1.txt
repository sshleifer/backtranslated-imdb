This is probably the best horror movie ever since Ed Wood’s death. <br /> <br /> I can't spoil the final, because I have no idea what happened. I will try my best though. There are some lesbian vampires, but they exchange bodies, so any character may or may not be a character you should be thinking about, or it may be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sound confusing? This is not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters makes any sense to start. There is no plot, no character development, and random people appear, speak a few lines, and then disappear to never hear anymore. There are also zombies who * are * possible enemies of vampires, but there is also a “dream in dream” sequence in a mental hospital. , so perhaps none of this has happened, and all this is the hallucination of the protagonist. , <br /> <br /> Top? Both girls take off their shirts for a short time. The special effects are staggering (I especially liked the incredibly slow, awkward battle sequences). Everyone has a really stupid Canadian accent that adds to the overall level of fun. <br /> <br /> Well worth the rental price. We laughed until we cried.
