I gave this film "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexual love scenes. Otherwise, if you cannot read like a speed reader, you will NEVER get subtitles that try to keep up with Spanish speaking speed! And what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the subtitles. Endless looks and dull eyes and permanent failure. Just bored after an hour or so. Some good cinematography, but also so DARK, you think your screen is blown. How it won, I will never understand. It is difficult to talk about “action”, since the leading actors seem to just look and look at each other with love when they do not push each other away. Geraldo's character is so attractive that it’s hard to believe that NO ONE will push him away. And what about the mother? I just didn’t get it most of the time, except for the fact that there were three guys who seemed to have a story with each other ... but they didn’t figure out whose it was “EX”.
