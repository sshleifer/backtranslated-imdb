As some other comments show, this movie can scare you when you're a little kid. (And this is probably all that is good for.) <br /> <br /> However, if you are older, this film does only one thing: basically sucks - and so I don’t mean acting, its soundtrack , cutting or art. like this. I'm just talking about the “plot” (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> Ahead of spoilers ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I don’t want to give more spoilers than necessary (if after reading you really want to watch this movie), but if you graduated from any school, this is just a serious insult to your intellect. Watching this, I was stunned most of the time, because it was ONLY stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> - the formation of UNITE (evil association) <br /> <br /> -> we just have to believe that this is evil. is it all evil? if so: why is it evil? <br /> <br /> - a sign of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> there is no need to impose it on people, so why the hell (not a pun) are they doing this? <br /> <br /> - to invite Christ into your heart just as in words <br /> <br /> -> because no one in this film is considered a “real Christian” does nothing except to say this stupid a prayer. so ... just say this prayer before the rapture, and you will be saved - no matter what?! <br /> <br /> So rating 1/10
