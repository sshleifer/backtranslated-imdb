Dr. K. (David Hickey) is trying to master a formula that would put an end to all diseases and shortcomings, but needs living donors to complete its work. His brother, Dr. Richard (Dennis O'Neill), has a son named Eddie (Derek Phillips) who is enrolled in medical school. Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cárdenas), who has no right and plans to attend law school herself in the fall. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah ends a relationship with her current boyfriend, who also fucks the lady of Walt (Bill Sebastian; Eddie’s best friend, who recently paid for the work of her cheating girlfriend). Eddie accidentally gets hit by a car and appears on the verge of death when Dr. K. proposes to Richard ... let him "recover" Eddie using his secret, illegal methods. When Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie, terrifying results occur. Eddie's face bulges big warts, while he also gained a taste for human flesh. Many will die so that Eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite, which he cannot quench. Soon he may even pose a threat to his father and girlfriend. Eddie Monster must be stopped. <br /> <br /> As a rule, a terrible horror movie right on the video suffers from an acute shortage of budget, acting and general talent. Premise, which looks like an interesting festival of fear, cannot cope even with a zombie movie. The blood is limited to a few chewing scenes, but most of the violence occurs behind the scenes. Using time to promote a story can really become annoying.
