The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror films of all time. This is the dirtiest. When I sat down to look at it, I really thought how bad the fourth and fifth is, it should be good after the previous terrible ones. The boy was wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I watched the first ten minutes, I was really tempted to turn it off, but I thought not, maybe it would improve. This is not true. <br /> <br /> Not only is it just a terrible movie in itself, it did not need another sequel, because the last two (the fourth and fifth) were already horrible enough! Also, how many times can you return Freddy!? The action in it was HORRIBLE, the storyline was predictable and shitty, and there were also flaws in it. The way they did Springwood was completely wrong. Pays no respect at first at all. To add to this, it all seemed excessive. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie was “funny.” This film is not "funny" at all. Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be “fun”? I would call it ridiculous shit. This film should be a horror film, not a comedy. If Freddie had a daughter, wouldn't this information appear as in the first? The ending was just stupid and stupid, like everything else. This completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first. Just shows itself. <br /> <br /> It’s a shame that Wes Craven first created something so good, but still he needs to be dragged off because of this garbage that is in the trash can. They shouldn't even bother making this film. None of the other continuations, except the third. The third is the only worthy of all the sequels. <br /> <br /> If it was a DVD in itself, and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set that I received, I would throw it away when I understood. <br /> <br /> Short description: a pathetic and unsuccessful attempt to continue. <br /> <br /> - a complete explosion of the first movie <br /> <br /> So, please do not waste your time on this worthless trash.
