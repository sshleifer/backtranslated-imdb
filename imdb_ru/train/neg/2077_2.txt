It needed an excuse to get out of the house while the paint was dry — left the film an hour later to go back and see how the paint was drying. <br /> <br /> I do not remember ever going to the movies before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to the cast and just continued to “go and go” badly - come on! Uma Thurman doing this? Pretty lame special effects. These were elderly heroes and actors who had been involved in surface horny lives of more than 20 years old — simply annoying and wrong feelings. <br /> <br /> This review is based only on the first hour - it could get better. I just needed to go back home and see if the paint had a darker shade than when it lasted.
