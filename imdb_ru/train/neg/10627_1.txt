I notice that most people who think that this film is telling the truth were either not born before landing on the moon (1969-1972), or not old enough to evaluate them. I think it is much easier to question a historic event if you have not experienced it. <br /> <br /> I was young in the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines shouted about the latest events happening every day, from launch to landing, from moon walks to the moon taking off, right up to splashing out in many languages. At school, some classes were canceled so that we could watch the main events on TV. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and held its breath when people limped home to an uncertain fate. You could not go anywhere if someone did not ask what was the last. The world was truly one community. <br /> <br /> Now, with more than 30 years after this fact, it is easy to demand fraud, because all over the world enthusiasm and interest have died away. We stayed with our history textbooks, and anyone can argue that history is wrong, and try to “prove” it with a bunch of lies and fictional facts, while completely ignoring the prevalence of evidence to the contrary, not to mention living in the souls and memories who survived these wonderfully rash and fantastic days.
