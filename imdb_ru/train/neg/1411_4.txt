This film was great when I first saw it when it was called “Lost in Translation”. But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a naughty Latina played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan, turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence, which we enjoyed in the "Translation", we get meaningless chatter in 10 points, which border on irritation. Instead of characters who were thoughtful and introspective, as in translation, we get characters who give meaningless advice on topics that they have no idea about. How can a character who wears T-shirts for a hundred dollars and has never been to a Target department store count on giving advice to a working woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think that it stops him. If he does not give her advice on clothes, he tells her that she should eat. The most annoying part of the film for me was that they were in a hurry to arrange a meeting, and yet the characters continue to find time to fulfill another assignment, whether to wash the car, stop at Arbi or just lie on the list. from their 10 items or fewer lists of things they love and hate. I always wanted to shout at them, saying: “Didn't you say that you had to be somewhere? What the hell are you doing? A minute ago, you were practically late, now you are eating roast beef and thinking about your life! ”Until I watched this movie, I still didn’t understand how something could“ insist on myself ”, but I think this movie does this, and unfairly. The dialogue makes the characters funny and not sympathetic, except for the fact that I felt sorry for both actors for subscribing to this project.
