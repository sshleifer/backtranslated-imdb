Well, first of all, I didn’t sit down to watch the Star Trek premiere to see a cowboy flying in space. This is how the usual Enterprise episode works <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a nebula or something similar, and wants to take a closer look, but this may destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 he sends a shuttle to the nebula, and the shuttle is damaged ... <br /> <br /> In all the episodes that I saw, all problems are due to Archer’s silly mistakes. Oh, and you saw a preview of one episode in which Archer and T'pol kiss?!?!?!?!?!?!? I planned to watch this episode, but after that I was completely disillusioned with the Enterprise and immediately turned to the TV. Come on !!!! This is Star Trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> What happened to the banana slug ?? In one of the episodes, Hoshi had a banana slug, but for some stupid reason he had to be left behind. Okay, well, a little silly, to deliver you a slug in space, but it doesn't matter. Well, that was what I thought, until they left him on a desert planet !!!!! Banana slug can not stay in the desert !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid are these writers? <br /> <br /> In any case, just to say that the Enterprise does not look at it !!!!!
