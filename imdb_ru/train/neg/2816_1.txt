This is one of those movies that you see in the video store, which you just have to get, because it looks terribly bad. And indeed, we could not take much of this. There was a lot of fast-forwarding. <br /> <br /> But then we came across the scene when Robert Englund seduces the main character (for some reason, her name eludes my mind). Cripes I have never watched one scene from a movie so many times (I rate forty or so). And I never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show off his loins. I last saw the movie a couple of months ago, but I can't stop laughing when I type the text. Be that as it may, the scene is a montage of the pictures: Englund rips off the girl's underwear, Englund on horseback, a naked, and some mysterious woman falling on a snake's head. This is an absolute genius. You should see it yourself.
