It should be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson as the two authors of the paper. Mike Nichols directing. Uh-uh It's boring, boring, boring! Pointless and predictable! Slow and unfocused! <br /> <br /> A cookie maker meets a girl, a boy marries a girl, the boy has an affair, the girl has a story with a boy. Now there is an original concept! After two hours (there were only two? It was six). I wasn't sure if it was a comedy, romantic, tragedy, or a soap opera. It was made in 1986. Iâ€™m sure we all did things sixteen years ago that we would rather forget. I hope that the damage to the reputation of Streep and his colleagues begins to heal, and that the emulsion on the Master begins to disappear. The point is not that it is such a bad picture. He's just so bad.
