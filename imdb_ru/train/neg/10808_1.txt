On the 8th birthday, they gave me a book version of Kazaam, and people always say that book versions are always better than movies, but this time they were wrong. At least with the film, everything will end soon. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is terrible, as I expected from the movie with Shaq, who plays a magical rap-genie, which emerges from the old ghetto bomb (which is probably a good reason why he was there trapped). The guy in the movie who plays Max is a whiny and terrible actor. He is being bullied by neighbour's children, for which I do not blame them, because he is a little moron. <br /> <br /> The story is just stupid and extremely cliche. About a boy whose father always works, and never near, who finds a new friend who makes his life better and, in the end, helps him to reconnect with his father. <br /> <br /> Even at the age of 8, I thought it was a stupid idea, It is amazing that any of the people who worked on this film had a career after the wards, because it was embarrassing and should never have been done by I could tell you more about how this movie sucks, but you should already know just by reading the plot.
