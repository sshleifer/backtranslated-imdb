Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose huge series of films includes both completely forgotten and constantly shown (for example, John Wayne in “The Sands of Iwo Jima”), tried his hand at a big musical with “I Dream of Jeanie”. Taking advantage of the popularity of singers with little past experience in cinema and, as it turned out, with virtually no future, he unfolded a fictional and largely offensive story about the great American composer Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is a young lover of Foster, whose kindness towards slaves involves earmarking a wedding ring to pay for the hospital price of a wounded little black boy. His intention is Ines McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), whose annoying younger sister Gini (Eileen Christie) slowly realizes that she is in love with an almost moneyless blacksmith song. Foster is in love with Ines, who is outraged by the number 1 composer on the melody of the charts "On Susanna." Enter Minstrel Edwin P. Christie (Ray Middleton) to help start the profit-making phase in Foster's career. <br /> <br /> This is, according to music cinema standards of the early 50s, a big production. The suites are luxurious in that special Hollywood fashion that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings. The singers are not so bad, and Foster's songs are almost impossible to spoil. <br /> <br /> But this is also literal whitewashing of the fore south. The largest number shows the black face for everyone on stage, the historical anomaly and the modern part of thoughtless racism. If these images of blacks were somewhere close to reality, abolitionists would rightly be condemned for interfering in such a beneficial institution. <br /> <br /> “I dream of a Gini,” apparently plunged into the studio’s storage room, hardly a whisper of death. Revived Alpha Video for only $ 4.99, this is historical material with charming songs and repulsive sentiments about the victims of America’s great crime, slavery. <br /> <br /> This was what Hollywood released two years before Brown opposed. Ministry of Education. It must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who donned bedding to the theater.
