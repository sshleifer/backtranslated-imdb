Well, I finally saw it. I did not go when he first came out, because, frankly, I was afraid. I'm afraid how bad it can be or how disappointing. Although he is not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, he was not particularly memorable or satisfactory. <br /> <br /> I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in a theater. From the initial scan to the final credits, it was a film that I will never forget. The eternal story of a bored village boy who just knows that he is meant for more, saving the princess and the galaxy from an evil threat, being a mentor to a wise wizard, a pirate cheater and various comic reliefs - everything in space - Operational setting <br /> <br /> And this should not punish Lucas for using the old formula. This is the old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave him new twists that made him very special. <br /> <br /> Then the Empire appeared, and the story was not just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture, and we recognized one of the greatest turns of the film of all time. The great villain, Vader was the father of Luke. Wow, no one expected this. Of course, I am convinced that and Lucas, until he appeared in the script. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, especially in the light of the first three episodes, see if this is not true. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to my problem. Revenge - a fascinating movie - amazing effects, lots of action, some good battle scenes. But the film still lives or dies in its plot - the story he tells. Oh, of course, a really good acting game can save a weak plot, but a weak plot combined with poor acting skills is a burden that no director can overcome, of course, not as bad as I am forced to understand that George Lucas ( the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in his career from some very good actors - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * Story. My God. Understand, he is already disabled by what happened in the first two films, so this is an incredible burden. Too much for him to overcome. <br /> <br /> First, we have the complete absurdity of the background. As a child, Anakin was found on Tatooine, the product of a virginal, miraculous birth - the "elect." Well, this detail is never explained remotely. Indeed, the closest explanation is the observation of Yoda that perhaps they were wrong. Well, good, then good. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now this same prodigy turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence. And he will return to Tatooine and never know where he comes from? Blimey! How about this. Feeling a former desire to suspend disbelief, George? In any case, we have this stupid child, a capricious, irritable, aching young man who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinema history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - a good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption at the end. <br /> <br /> How, pray tell, is this happening? Why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, of course, he lives in a stellar civilization that relates to gravity just as we treat gasoline, but can this happen to a “dark creature” to possibly check with the doctor, maybe, just maybe Can this futuristic society do something about this issue? Why, no, the only thing he can think of is to go kill some children, because the bad guy who underlies all the evil that they persecuted in two films tells him that he has the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Of course he knows. <br /> <br /> Shish. <br /> <br /> How can Lucas expect us to see such nonsense and be touched by it? How can we expect care from us? Damn, why would anyone want this child to be saved or redeemed first. I wanted Kenobi to kill him, not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, Amidala is finally dying. In childbirth. What for? Well, they do not know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself is an indicator of the incredibly high technologies to which this society has come, offers only a conclusion: “she has lost the desire to live. Well, okay, of course she has. Maybe it dawned on her that she was sleeping. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have a Kenobi gift for all this. He knows about the birth of Luke and Lea. Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. He also knows the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, after a few years, when Luke gets close to masculinity and appears with 3PO and R2 (curiously, the 3PO mind is destroyed, but not from R2 - why ????), saying: "I think these droids belong to you ", Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was created by those whom he considered" elected "and a student of the Emperor himself, and who, as it turned out, was built on this very planet, says:" strangely, I don’t remember there was some kind of droid ". <br /> <br /> Oh dear. <br /> <br /> Lucas just made this up when he went on. As soon as he introduced VAder as Liu's father k, unfortunately, the story started to get out of control, because he didn’t know what the story was about. The plot of Episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing that Palpatin did did not make any rational sense. And nothing this is not related to the story he originally told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This is an afterthought, and it looks like this. <br /> <br /> I cannot give this film a high rating, It reminds me of Triple X. A funny movie to watch, but completely forgettable. Star Wars will remain in my memory forever. Fortunately, this and the two preceding it will soon disappear.
