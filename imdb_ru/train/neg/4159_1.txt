In this strangely hopeless apocalypse, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to worry too much about this Grade-Z film, which is less like Sheridan Le Fan’s famous short novel than my mother’s lasagna recipe. Bored workers still work at gas stations, and doctors still call the house, and helpful police officers still appear with radiator fluid exactly when you need it. The plot, and I use this term loosely, suggests that the father and daughter are trying to get close to the “general”, whose daughter is absent, in the church, to kill the vampire, who, very conveniently, travels with the father and daughter. I have to admit that a moment or two of real humor can be found between huge sections of unintended humor. The film also boasts enough nudity to interest a boy of fourteen. Anyone older is wary.
