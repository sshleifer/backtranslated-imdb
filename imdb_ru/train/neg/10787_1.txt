Let me say it differently: balls. Or what about the bol * kc. It's really awful, more embarrassing than those he is trying to saturate. Julia Roberts - an experienced actress, and usually her work at the highest level. This film is so lacking direction that even she struggles to look skillful. Usually she is an unsurpassed professional, but I swear that in her eyes were signs of bewilderment and despair. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save this move was the idea of ​​the director (Chris Walken) turning the film into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, this topic has not been fully disclosed. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta-Jones was wooden, Cusack - Cusack, and Crystal should stick to acting. The two talented ex-stars Buffy had different experiences: Green was hopelessly mistaken and Balfour was underused. Julia is well done for not becoming the worst movie ever made.
