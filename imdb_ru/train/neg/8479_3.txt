Well, when I came to the board for this film, I really expected people to laugh at it. I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it. I liked the movie ... but only me and my younger sister (who is actually only 10 years old) laughed at all this. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Jordan, but this game was terrible. You know that the movie goes to the toilet when the presenter cannot act. And there was not even a good script or plot to buy it. I also thought that the character of Pamela was very, very unconvincing ... pathetic on the border. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I thought there are some good actors like the gorgeous Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. However, not enough to redeem the film. <br /> <br /> Two things in this movie that I just can't overcome: <br /> <br /> 1.) That this guy Spencer will fall in love with her, Okay, whoo. I looked at the dates and, although in fact he is only four years older than her, the difference in the “figure” looked much larger. Jordan is a very beautiful girl, but in GF she seemed 10 or 12 ... she seemed like a small child! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) Is there some way that Kristi Yamaguchi comes to ride only for the sake of one girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and all that, but it still seemed unlikely that Christie would go to a boarding school that doesn’t even have ice skating scholarships, or that a figure skating trainer would be hired at school. with such connections. <br /> <br /> That's all it says ... it was not the worst movie ever known, but it wasn’t very good even by DCOM standards, which I think is pretty low.
