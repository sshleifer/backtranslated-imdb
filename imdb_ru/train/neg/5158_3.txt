Sometimes creating something strange and modern does not always benefit all. Although I admit that the set design and the concept of the film were quite interesting, the realization of these ideas in one congruent story simply did not work. This film was so terribly slow and meaningless that even Robin Williams could not save this garbage. Obviously, Barry Levinsonâ€™s dream collapsed on his face, but he had to warn the rest of the world about this slop.
