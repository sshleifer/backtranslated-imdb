Lady in Cement - pi-false with ole blue eyes. Frank Sinatra - Shamus on a houseboat in Miami in this rarely funny “comedy”. Burdened by the annoying and boring score of Hugo Montenegro and many misfires, this 1968 film never rises above a little too bawdy to be on television to gain the status of a television movie. Dan Blocker plays an important role in the role of Mike Mazursky / Ted De Corcia, and Raquel Welch should thank her personal trainer. The only thing that makes a DVD worth saving or watching is the Collection of trashy trailers for Welch films such as Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mother, Jugs & Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge. Even if you get a DVD, skip the predictable movie and go to the trailer library with special features. Sinatra lisps @ homosexual owners of the local go-go bar. Relic to be put back into the time capsule. D
