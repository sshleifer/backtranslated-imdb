This is definitely not the best film of Lucio Fulci, judging by the imagination. The plot is pretty bad, the millionaire is killed, and his alcohol encourages his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I encountered (besides the fact that I found out who killed him within 10 minutes after watching the movie) was why should anyone care? His father turns out to be a really big jerk for everyone he came across (including his daughter, who he asks to help him), which made it difficult for everyone to care about who killed him. But no one is watching the movie Fulci for a good storyline, to do it would be like watching porn for incredible scripting and action. Usually his films try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of blood, but even that is not enough in this film. If you're looking for a good Fulci film, watch The Beyond.
