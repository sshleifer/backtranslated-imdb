I was embarrassed to watch this movie. I felt as if he was pushing the storyline down my throat, as if I could not catch the subtleties, I needed a voice in order to constantly express them for me. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still an alcoholic, I really did not feel that it was a film about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion, of course. It's hard for them to communicate, something that the main character really had no problems with, except that he REALLY had a problem saying that I love you at some point â€” which was a bit of a weak effort to establish his cold temper. He, too, was constantly surrounded by people! <br /> <br /> I felt deceived, because in no case were we really alone with the character to truly feel his inner loneliness and confusion. I could not communicate with the character and did not feel any connection with my father. I did not feel anything when it was over, just a relief when it was all over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a good actor, but not a cool hero! The orange clockwork was as thin as a brick. McKidd was too old for a teenager, they should have had three different characters or avoid the teenage scene and concentrate more on McKidda for adults. <br /> <br /> On the good side, I felt that the little actor boy was really good at the beginning of the movie !!
