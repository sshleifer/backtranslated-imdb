Some time ago I was visiting one of my relatives, and we looked into the theater, so we thought that we would go and give this film. What mistake! This film is terrible in every department. I have never heard of a movie before, and literally still have not heard. No wonder this is so important. This is a comedy, so it says that the only thing that is funny is the ability or lack of a director to make such a film. Coming so close to Christmas, it should be titled how to cook a turkey for a short time, almost an hour and a half - or how much time passed while I was going out. At the end of the film you will feel as if you poisoned food on a sick turkey, and you will regret having wasted your time on such a dribble. Who knows why such things are done. Some people left the theater even before the film was finished, and I blame myself for not leaving much earlier. It really annoys me that you pay good money to watch something decent, and everything you go out and see is a bad TV movie that should be shown at 2 am, in fact, it's such a bad daytime TV. should not show it. What else can be said ... probably not enough bad words can make it fair.
