be careful: this film tells a lot of love stories without any sequence. <br /> <br /> The sole intention of this film seems to be to show love in different ways. <br /> <br /> Each story is a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no plot. Just a sketchy plot idea. The writer tried to build the turning points that were intended to surprise the viewer. However, it simply did not work, because you did not know the characters before, or these “jokes” were just stupid. <br /> <br /> This is a film about love that does not reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more, I do not know, and I do not care.
