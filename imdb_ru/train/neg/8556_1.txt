Well, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I'm in a demographic age, and I sort of identify with some stories. Even sometimes a tasteless and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in another film this would be excusable. <br /> <br /> I try my best not to destroy this film like the others, but it's not so easy when the filmmakers never tried. <br /> <br /> Editing this movie is terrible! Perhaps the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you do not need to attend in film school to study, good editing quality is not one of them, but the definition of bad is also. <br /> <br /> In addition, the shot ... Oh, my God shots, just awful! I can't even get into the details, but sometimes we see random things, and this, combined with the editing, will give you the most painful experience of watching a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is made on a low or zero budget with 4 actors and crew is also no excuse. I have seen short films on YouTube with much greater artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the hell you thought, but this film is nothing but the masturbation of both of your ego. You should be ashamed of yourself! In conclusion, this film is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie would be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If this is not your thing, avoid it at all costs!
