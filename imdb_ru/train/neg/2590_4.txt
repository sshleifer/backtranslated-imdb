American Pie has come a long way from the first. At first, I believe that the actors have no idea what they are doing, and instead it's just a remake of a college party. Storey talks about two college beginner guys (with the participation of a young sorcerer) setting out dreams of college entrance only to enjoy late night parties, sex and, of course, drinks. The plot is stupid and goes far from the original cake. In fact, there was no more apple pie in the film. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I work in a video store and can rent it for free. But please remember that it is a waste of time if you do not enjoy brainless sex movies with absolute nudity and insane drunkenness. I myself am a teenager, and I believe that even Evan Almighty would be the best choice instead.
