This is the movie that leaves you one impression. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects. Very good game, especially from Shu. Everything is perfect .. Except .. The story is just bad, and therefore, everything fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine this, if you had the power to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) could not think of anything else but to caress and rape women ... That's all that his “genius” mind could suggest. Is he trying to get extra power? No, he did not even bother to find a way to return to visibility. This guy is essentially a crazy maniac. <br /> <br /> Add to this, in a laboratory atmosphere, you have all these young guys .. They throw jokes like in a bar .. If there weren’t all white bathrobes and equipment, you might think that bad imitation of "cheers". Very small and poor personalities and very little attention is paid to make you think that these guys are nothing more than lambs for the Wolf of the Hollow Man. <br /> <br /> Even in a thriller, the film is lagging behind, because most of the exciting "scenes are written so badly and are full of illogical behavior of actors who just scream," it's just nonsense that I have to do so that Hollow Man can find me alone and kill me. "If you read this book while the Scientist (Kane) pursues women, there are many mental manipulations and disturbing thoughts in his character. In the film, Kane is just a sick guy who goes on a crowded marketplace to rub your body in women and get off O. Just said.
