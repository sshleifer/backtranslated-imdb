Marvin (Rob Schneider) has no components to become a policeman, which is his lifelong dream. But his luck changes when he gets into a car accident (very bad) and is detected by a doctor. The doctor must use the organs of animals to restore it. After this moment, he begins to behave wildly and unconsciously and becomes the best cop he could be. By that time, he is aware of the changes, and his animal instincts are beginning to capture his human side. At the same time, he finds a beautiful girl and tries to be the perfect gentleman, which means that he must control himself and behave in a civilized manner. I'm not very cheerful Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first film that I saw. However, I can easily say that he is the best man to play a loser. (See His role in Ellie Macbil, quite funny). There are some good roles in the film, such as flirting with a goat. In such films, the biggest problem is that the script makes the viewer feel less intelligent. I am sure that this film can be watched as long as it is not taken too seriously. But it is very sad to see that such films work very well at the box office. “The Animal” is not the worst film I have seen to date, but it has not received more than *.
