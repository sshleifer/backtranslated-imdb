I loved Dewaere on the TV series Noir. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers" or "Going Places". Well, this is a couple of guys parading the convention in the most absurd and unacceptable way; many people find this behavior funny. It was a boring, meaningless exercise designed to shock. I find a smirk on Blier's face, on the face behind the camera, annoying. The Noir series was a true expression of personal freedom and dissolute behavior. From the first moment when we see Patrick Dewer jumping on an abandoned section, we get an idea of ​​the incredibly beautiful antihero with whom we will spend time for the next few hours. When we see him chasing an unhappy middle-aged woman with his friend Depardieu in Going Places, we rightly warn that two hours spent with these guys will be heart-rending. I have trouble finding even 3 for this annoying distraction.
