Bad performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hayer. Roughly underdeveloped secondary characters. Annoying talkative without real plot. The end leaves you flattering than a pancake, with looser ends than you could tie up in four sequels (that is, if you even cared about these wooden characters). McLain is the only real asset. This penultimate sequence in which the “Chicago Hood” is looking for a Sinatra character is ridiculous. The music in this sequence is also bad. And in the final scene, when Martin’s character removes his hat to a woman, whom he called a “pig,” I almost made me go outside and find a stone that you can throw on my TV screen.
