Hmmm, the sports team got into a plane crash, got stuck on a snowy mountain and faced a difficult decision to eat the meat of their dead companions in order to survive. Sounds familiar? I mean Live since 1993. The only significant difference here, of course, is that the big white drunk crow-yeti appears several times to drag the dead. I guess people are tastier than yaks. <br /> <br /> Stupid: the person in the first scene does not have reliable firearms when hunting for yeti, nor does he have a backup copy. <br /> <br /> Plane crash completely fake. It would either explode in the air, explode when it fell to the ground, or be erased from the face of the earth. People wouldn't have survived, but hey, this is scientific. <br /> <br /> Stupid: they survived and they are cold. It may be a good idea to use some of the burning debris nearby to freeze to death. The fire, being warm as it is ... WTF: The pilot formed on his face while he was alive and talking, but, strangely enough, no one else does. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the guys tells the rest to look for matches and lighters, but around the parts of the aircraft are scattered FOR FIRE. <br /> <br /> Stupid: they find coats and sweatshirts, and yet there in the cold Himalayas they can’t use their hoods! <br /> <br /> Stupid: they look at a bunch of sticks when, I repeat, the pieces of the plane are ALREADY BURNED. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are famous for their storms. For them, it would be common sense to collect debris to strengthen their structure, and not to sit outside the quarrels. Around a lot of pines, the branches of which provide excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: In case of doubt, use the hand of a dead person as a tire. <br /> <br /> WTF: If one guy knows so much about hibernation of squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, then why doesn’t he know enough to hide from the very beginning and set traps? <br /> <br /> Stupid: when you try to catch wild animals, meaningless conversation in the vicinity of this trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how difficult it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a piece of glass ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti, while the other two were standing there without protection. The Yeti pulled out the boy's heart and trampled the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. Is love. <br /> <br /> So two Yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury evidence forever .... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues to an even greater degree of idiocy, but most actions occur in the last 15 minutes, as usual. It is pleasant to think with a dart and a chain, although it is a little ingenuity (with a magic-looking chain), which they lacked at the beginning of the film, when they could not even start a fire, despite the fact that it was around them. br /> <br /> As is typical for Sci-Fi Originals, a couple in love kisses at the end, as if nothing terrible happened to them (not to mention that they ate human flesh and did not brush their teeth for several days) . <br /> <br /> However, the very end is a quote lame.
