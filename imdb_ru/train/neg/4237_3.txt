JUDAAI was a bold Raj Kanwara film at the time. In 1997, when such a topic was damn non-standard. <br /> <br /> To give him his due, he was able to show how greed changes a person and to what extent a person can go to get what he wants. <br /> <br /> However, the film is pretty darn melodramatic, in many places he is funny <br /> <br /> I wonder why Anil does not buy TV for his wife? when he earns so much, just to show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> Turning is good at handling, but with processing right from the 80s. The comedy of Johnny Paresch, which is entertained here and there, stands out as a sore thumb because it does not fit into the story <br /> <br /> There are even several plot stories <br /> <br /> Directing Raj Kanwara is adequate, although sometimes Music is too melodramatic Music is in order, but most of the songs seem forced <br /> <br /> Anil copes well with his task. Sridevi copes with his task. Urmila is decent. For the rest, as usual, Kader Khan, Johnny Lever is funny, Paresh is annoying, Farida is decent.
