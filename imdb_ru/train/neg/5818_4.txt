--- what happened to these incredible people. Alan Arkin was, as usual, unfunny and just walked around the role. The kids are all in disarray. Maria Tomei probably would like this role to never be in her way. And what are Carl Rainer and Rita Moreno doing in this really bad, mean-spirited movie? If you like to watch how losers lose their abilities and don't try to do something better, this is your movie. Everyone else, take a walk, read a book or look at something else. <br /> <br /> jane
