My God, was it an adaptation of the conviction "Run, Lola, run"? It was terrible. It's bad enough that the “screenwriter” (and I use this term very loosely) cut and paste dialogues from one character to another, often completely out of context, and hurried with the story: but Ann Elliott ran from place to place in search of Wentworth near the end the play was an abomination! Austin must be spinning in her grave. No respectable young woman would act so cruelly. And the actress who played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of the Austin remakes are so bad, they will shut off a new generation of watchers. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an impeccable version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, get the directed version of Roger Michelle in 1995 with Amanda Ruth starring (whose expressions can say a lot) and Kiaran Hinds. It is excellent.
