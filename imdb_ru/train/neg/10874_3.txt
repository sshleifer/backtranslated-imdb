I just finished the marathon of this series, and it became painful to watch its development. From the invention of historical elements to the terrible accent of O'Herlihi in later episodes, the show just drops sharply as you go. If you are looking for low-quality WW2 generalized fluff, then I would recommend season 1, but avoid anything that then degenerates one step from the soap opera with ever-worse storylines and sensitivity. <br /> An old black and white film is by far the best of all kinds of entertainment, which includes the name of the Kolditz, and even this is not something to hope for.
