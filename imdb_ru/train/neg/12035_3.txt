I expected it to be much better. I love the work of Tim Burton, so I was very happy to see these short online films. Well, they are not exactly what I expected. <br /> <br /> I don’t know what I don’t like. I think they are just boring. The sound bothers me and most of the characters, although I loved Roy the Poison Boy and Steinboa. <br /> <br /> Probably the “Girlfriend” episode worried me the most, although it was pretty funny. <br /> I also don’t like how some characters die. For example, how a Match Girl basically set fire to a gas station or how a girl who looks at all has died. Roy's death was amazing. Death by car freshener. Very original ;-) It made me laugh so hard ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not suitable for children. Just tongue and blood. This is about all I have to say! 3/10
