As the films about Steven Seagal show, this film is the bottom of a barrel. His best was just food for bored teens. This one tilts the scales, then falls. All characters are cardboard. History double sucks. I can't spoil it by telling you the end. You already know how all the films of Steven Seagal end, if you saw them. Here it is. He is a super-duper government agent who knows too much to lose consciousness, so they decided, instead of killing him, to finish his brain until he remembers his squats. Of course, he escapes, he is arrested and he is with his old general, who needs one person with millions of experience, to return the stealth aircraft, which was transferred to a terrorist gang in Afghanistan by a fraudulent air force pilot, who, surprisingly Surprise, was trained by Segal. All the characters, except for the character Seagal and his dark-haired girlfriend, heroically die, and Steve-Baby saves the whole world in one fell swoop or a stroke. No difference. Made with some surplus air force and navy. And a lot of boom booms. Get some cartoon films for Popez instead.
