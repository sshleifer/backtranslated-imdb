This move reminded me of "Tales of the Crypt Keeper". He has the same idea that people get what they deserve. I think they are always in the story of the Crypt. The same goes for a bad acting game. Very bad game. I enjoyed the film, knowing that most people did not like it, and I did not expect much. Whenever I watch a film by Stephen King, I don’t expect much, because all his films are terrible compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie, and they were great books. I like the way Carrie played out, as if it was a true story, and the whole book is a bunch of reports, theories, and the like. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels were not like movies. The endings were very different than the movie versions. Of these two novels, I suppose that all his novels have changed a lot, and the finals are always stupid. I have the worst Thinner ending. So cheesy. I want to read a book to find out the real end. I suggest that anyone who is going to read Stephen King’s novels watch his films in advance so you can compare. And so you will be very pleased with the book. I'm going to do it with all his novels that were filmed in the movie. I am sure that if they were turned into films, they were really good books ... and the script went terribly wrong.
