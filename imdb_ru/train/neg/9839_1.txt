The beginning of this film was good. It became really stupid after he told people that he wanted to kill himself. I think if I came from such a small town, I would be offended after watching this movie. Many of these people look stupid and crazy. How could these people do so little that they would follow him all day. Many times these people told him ways to kill themselves, as if they urged him to do it. How can so many people not respect other people? I also think that they could have made a much better end for this film. There were good sides to this movie. Some may like it, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
