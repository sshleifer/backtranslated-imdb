This is the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, although shots, "special effects", acting, and I mentioned the plot? Every thing in it sucks! from this film tried to do; it was supposed to be one of those films that you can’t say for sure what the hell is going to end. You sit hypnotized, not knowing who is dead and who is alive and who killed whom and why, and only when you think you understand the schedule correctly, you will find that you are mistaken, and the film ends - leaving you with your mouth open for the next 5 minutes ! Something like “Unbreakable” or “The Job”, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the author of this junk, yes, Olga ?? Writer, director, producer, scriptwriter, Custer, production designer, art director, costume designer, as well as a double for one of the characters - some scenes ... it's mostly a movie with one woman, and when it comes to Olga Levens Productions Levens, you can't go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well, this may be a shock, but “this time” Olga did this a great time, jumping from scene to scene, from dream to reality ... but wait! In the end, it was just a dream ... or was it ??? The picture disappeared, and I realized that nothing had happened, the girl was alone on the ship ... in fact, there was no ship ... no waiting! There is a ship again, and guys! They are alive! Thank God! No, they call her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears, so maybe they are still dead ??? or maybe they were never alive from the beginning? <br /> <br /> If you understand what I just said, you might like this movie - otherwise it’s a boring job and the only reason I laid out all this nonsense to find out how the hell they can finish this movie ... <br /> <br /> Do not watch it if you value time, in this case 90 minutes is a waste of time ...
