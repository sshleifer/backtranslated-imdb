I'm just wondering what is the purpose of making such films? profit? and to whom do they refer, what intelligence should your brain use to look at something like this crap? This film can be watched by children under 3 years old, if you are not adults, do not try to watch it. That's why I think Hollywood has started using cartoons in films with such actors, that you have to forget about the art of cinema, be sure that you have a lot of popcorn to spend time passing through the end of this movie, and get a lot of coke hamburgers, This film can be easily used in a restaurant, but certainly not in a theater, my dog, who is always next to her family when she watches a movie, left the building. Of course, this film applies to people without the requirement of cinematic art. The only thing that can be used in this film is to watch it when making a shopping list in a supermarket. I give 2 stars for supporting the cinematic efforts of India, but for nothing more or less ..
