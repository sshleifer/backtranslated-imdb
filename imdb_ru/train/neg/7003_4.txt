(in other words: TRINITY ANOTHER NAME) This continuation is similar to what it was done in order to benefit from the outstanding European box office success THEY CALL ME TRINITY, only this time the photos of Joseph E. Levin and Avco-Embassy wanted to benefit from it to America too. It’s a pity that they didn’t get too far, as Hill and Spencer’s paintings had only a slight success here in the USA, and this largely boring, protracted film does not help him. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful criminals and take care of each other. Later, they are associated with arms dealers who take arms out of the monastery and mistakenly think that they are a couple of federal agents. It all ended in failure, despite a couple of funny scenes, especially the one where Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and don't know how to behave. And the card shark scenes were also slightly humorous. <br /> <br /> Gina Roman’s introductory headline music sounds like a real pop song from the early 70s, similar to Bobby Goldsboro, while the musical replicas scattered throughout the film are pretty good. Not sure if I want to buy a soundtrack for it, but some others can. <br /> <br /> The film could tear itself away from him for half an hour, and he would not have delayed for so long. It seems that there are a lot of landscapes chewed on here. In fact, I lost interest in him about 2/3 of the way. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant hum on the soundtrack and a bad print that looks like it should have been sent to this huge pile of garbage in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step down from the previous film. . <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
