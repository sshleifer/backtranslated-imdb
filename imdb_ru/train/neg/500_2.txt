The bloodsucker leads the dance - what a funny name, it is so deceptive. Not surprisingly, the filmmakers are trying to mislead us, because this is one terrible movie. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the plot lies the mystery of the murder in the castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> Very little is happening in this film. And when something truly awakens the viewer from its stupor, it is invariably an unintended comedy in the form of a terrible dialogue, staged by a hopeless vocal group. These guys are so bad that they make the actors, for whom they give voices, look like a group of morons of the correction level. It is difficult to determine how bad the game is when you duplicate this deplorable state. But voice performers cannot be blamed for the original. This is a parody. Inadvertently funny at best, sorry for the worst. The history as a whole, to put it mildly, is uneven. Female characters are especially idiotic; men are either creepy or tedious. <br /> <br /> The whole enterprise smells like the pure exploitation of the audience He does not remotely deliver what he promises, and even when (finally) murders begin to occur, they all take place behind the scenes. All we get is a few hesitant shots of a severed head. <br /> <br /> Several people said that this film is great. I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who loves Italian thrillers should give this film a wide space, as there is nothing exciting about it. This is basically a soft horror movie. But this is not very erotic. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this to anyone.
