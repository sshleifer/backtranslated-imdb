Actually, I can not believe that I spent 5 dollars on this film. I’m a big zombie fan and thought the movie couldn’t be so bad. There were zombies, right? Was I wrong? Honestly, there were moments in the movie ... I thought it was cool when the guy's head was torn off, but that's all. In general, I think it would have been more pleasant to slip the razor blade on my bare walnut bag into a tub of vinegar, and then watch this movie again. The film could have been better if we could see some sort of chest, but I had to watch the trailers for other films released by this company in order to see it. The buyer is wary ... if you are not in masochism.
