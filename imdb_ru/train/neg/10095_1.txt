Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. It is very likely that they need immediate professional help, as anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can award stars is literally scary. <br /> <br /> This film ... well ... I guess this is pretty much some kind of attempt in a horrible porn / snuff film, without porn or without real scary bits (except acting, plot, story sets, dialogue and sound). I mistakenly assumed that it was a zombie. <br /> <br /> Watching this is actually pretty scary; you are scared that someone will come, and you can never describe what it is, and they will leave, thinking that you are a freak who is watching home amateur videos about torture or something like that. <br /> <br /> I am so surprised that I write this review on my mobile phone, so I remember trying to lower the rating further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate, I just suffered. <br /> <br /> I’m the worst movie I’ve ever seen, and I can tell (with a hand on my heart) that it will never be defeated.
