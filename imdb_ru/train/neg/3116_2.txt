Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film is fair. <br /> <br /> BUT .... If I had to watch a movie, I was: <br /> <br /> Director <<br /> Production Director <br /> <br / > Editor <br /> <br /> Never miss a damn microphone boom that appears and leaves the film for almost every chapter of the film. How can I enjoy and concentrate on the story, and believe in the damn thing when I am reminded of the technical details of the the film !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> WAITING FOR DVD OR DON'T
