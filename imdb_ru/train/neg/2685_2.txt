I have never panned the movie online, but I felt the urge to do this after seeing this movie. No one appears at someone’s funeral and says to the dead: “My relatives died, so why should I take care of you?” <br /> <br /> Without propaganda, there was little, if anything, that could be called “art ". As the daughter of deaf parents, I was especially annoyed with using deafness as a trick. Any deaf person who feels the vibration of this immensity, most likely, investigated, and did not ignore it. <br /> <br /> The word “arrogance” comes to mind. As a writer, I would stay away from several subjects: the Holocaust is one; it is different. I wish these directors were not so arrogant (and inept).
