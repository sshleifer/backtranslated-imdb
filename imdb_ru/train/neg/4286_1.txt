This is the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've ever seen. I say pretty much because I also saw the Soldier in which he plays the villain ... but from what I heard, this is not considered a Jason Scott Lee film. This, however, is. And if this is any indicator of the quality of such films, I will not see any of the others. Lee is basically passing as a martial arts artist ... as a leader, he is terrible. He enters into a fight with random nameless characters every few minutes of the film, perhaps because the screenwriter could not figure out how else to stretch the film to the minimum necessary time for the feature film. The villain is the only character who has even a hint of a person, and, despite the fact that he is definitely insane, he is not at all like a villain. Most of the movie is basically Lee stalking the villain in time ... or maybe the other way around. I can't say for sure ... and I definitely won't watch it again to be sure. The effects are not really terrible ... but it's close. The name comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. Somehow, the film is also a bloat on this interesting idea. The plot is too complicated for his own good. Walking is bad. I can't think of anything good about this movie ... I really can't. It is just too formal and meaningless. If only I had a time machine so that I could come back and prevent this film from being shot ... no, it doesn't matter. I just hope that few fragile minds will be exposed to this as much as possible. Listen to negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to Lee fans, and to anyone else. If you are looking for a quality movie ... well, it is not. That's for sure. 1/10
