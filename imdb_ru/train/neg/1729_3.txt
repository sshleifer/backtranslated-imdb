... and how they tired you out of your mind! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films of the 70s, shot without any actors, an embarrassing script, a sad direction and a tireless desire to mix “horror” with light comedy. This film tells about a paleontologist who finds drawings of a water dinosaur under Lake Crater ... a meteor falls from the sky, and a water dinosaur with a variety of clay content begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding Lake Crater. The whole thing is decided by our local sheriff Steve. Most of the film — when the pools of blood are not shown, left behind what we imagine must have been the food of the beast — is done after the awkward madness of two guys named Arnie and Mitch, who run the boat rental center. They try so hard to be funny that we get phrases like, looking at a business sign, Mitch says to Arnie: “You wrote the bait wrong, it was written B-A-T-E.” The laughter here was rather scant. Then we see them getting drunk together, and imagine that a tree trunk is a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy, watch out! The dinosaur looks unreal, but the film is bad. And at least the lake is beautiful.
