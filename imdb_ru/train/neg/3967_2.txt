DARK REMAINS is a low-budget American horror film that somehow managed to win 2 awards. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to include 2 separate threads. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting her wrists while swimming. Secondly, the young daughter of a technical writer was found with her throat slit. Grieving couple decides to move to an isolated hut in the mountains. Later it turns out that the house and surrounding places are often visited. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, 2 separate storylines eventually converge, as was to be expected. However, the execution is random and leads to confusion, which can only be resolved with a few views. Unfortunately, the film is simply not seductive enough to attract the majority of viewers to watch it several times. <br /> <br /> Almost everything that can go wrong with this film goes wrong - and quickly! And a low budget cannot be used to justify all the flaws found here. <br /> <br /> I think it would be wrong to judge the actors involved in this production, because the material was simply too scarce. /> <br /> Characters are uninteresting, as noted by other reviewers on this site. A poorly written script introduces too many people, without giving them interesting conversations, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations, and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> Direction is not inspiring. The inspirations from J-Horror films such as RINGU, GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL are obvious. Unfortunately, directors DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on the fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant shifts between a strange situation (for example, the ghost of a video surveillance camera going to it) and the reaction of the central character who encounters it without any warning. There are no elements of humor or ridicule in these films. Everything is played so directly and without remorse of conscience and restrictions that you cannot but be convinced and enchanted by it. The atmosphere of premonition creates uncertainty and ensures that horror has a psychological effect, very different from the “funky jumps” used in Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> DARK REMAINS directors made a bold attempt to avoid Hollywood cliches and also successfully avoid using CGI. Respect for the J-Horror could be well thought out. Unfortunately, lack of inspiration can make the viewer laugh at the alleged “panic” on the screen. The effect of "ghosts" is not so bad, given the low budget, but their actions simply do not lend themselves to logic. During this film I scratched my head several times. <br /> <br /> I could not give the ending, even if I wanted to. I just could not understand it. All I could do was a bit of an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> What remains? The answer of the browser on the other site is boredom. The film is hard work to sit on. Fortunately, the pain ends in an hour and a half. However, most of them are likely to shut down long before the end. <br /> <br /> In this film I can find only 2 positive points - the successful avoidance of frightening cliches and the absence of “f-words” in each sentence that is usually expected to be found. This is what 2 stars are for. <br /> <br /> Those who love supernatural or psychological horrors associated with ghosts and ghosts can succeed in sticking to such films as “LEGEND OF HELL”, “CHANGE” or “I” Subgenre horror. <br /> <br /> If it seems to you that you have seen too many famous films and want to watch a scanty horror film about ghosts with an ultra-low budget and an “R” rating, watch the movie Mortal Ghostbusters. This may not be the best horror movie ever made, but it is certainly much better than DARK REMAINS, and it has some genuine surprises. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.
