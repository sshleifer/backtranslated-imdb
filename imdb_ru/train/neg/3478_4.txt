Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be alone this Christmas. Drew is not only a millionaire; but also unpleasant and guilty of being very ambitious. Drew returns to the house in which he grew up, and offers the family living there, Valco, $ 250,000 to become his "family" during the Christmas season. Tom Valko (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but greedy enough to accept Drew's offer. Christina Valko (Catherine O'Hara) can say little about this, but she learns to love Drew around ... not exactly the same attitude towards Aliciaâ€™s daughter (Christina Applegate), but this is also the case for change. Girlfriend Drew Missy (Jennifer Morrison) tracks down Drew and wants her friends to meet his family. Genuine fun is preparing for the fact that happy Noel turns into a fun dysfunctional nightmare. Other cast members are Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Farasi. Affleck comedic, though strange.
