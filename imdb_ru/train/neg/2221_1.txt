Sorry, but it could be scary in 1978, when it appeared, but in our time it just does not stand up. The only interesting scene in the whole film is the scene where Michael kills his sister Judith in a Halloween mask. The most striking moment in the entire film is when his parents tear down the mask to see their son kill their daughter. From there, the film goes down and does not rise until the last fifteen minutes, but by that time it is too late, we have lost all interest in this story. The character development character is almost absent, and people are always in awe of the fact that Lori is such an exceptional heroine, when in fact not so much for her. I regret that I do not agree with everyone who is afraid of this film, but if you want a big horror movie, watch the movie "Shining or Rosemary" These are the two best horror films in history. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave him four stars, because this film never deserved such a high rating.
