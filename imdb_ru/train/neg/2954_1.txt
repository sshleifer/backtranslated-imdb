I watch a lot of bad movies, a lot !!!!!! This is really a hobby, really. Almost every Saturday we gather together with a group of friends and watch garbage from all over the world - NOTHING. Turkish super hero films, Brazil vampire films, Italian gorilla transplant films, Kevin Kostner films, NOTHING (except, perhaps, Raising Helen), but I have never seen a worse film than THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even fun, in a way, like Ed Woodâ€™s - just sucks. Now this film was known in Hollywood at the time it was made, because Whoopi took off her gloves and made it clear to the press and everyone who listened that she hated that part of the trash = she tried to get out of her contract, she whined, she moaned , but nonetheless they poured her fat ass into this skin-tight, futuristic police uniform, which is terrible to see, yikes !!!! And you can just see how she boils during duplicates - she does everything, but she looks into the camera at her agent so that she can scream at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions, and the script is so terrible that the third class could do better if they promised cookies.
