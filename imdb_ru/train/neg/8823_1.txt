This is one of the worst slasher I've ever seen in my life. The end is what you must see to be believed. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Harry Standing and Philip Stand who are sitting on the stairs while their mother watches his father go down the chimney dressed in a Santa costume. He puts gifts under the tree, eats cookies and milk, and then returns to the pipe. Philip goes to bed, but Harry goes down only to find his father, dressed in a Santa suit, sexually pleasing his mother. Then Harry climbs the stairs, breaks the snow globe, grabs a shard of glass and cuts himself. <br /> <br /> Then you go to the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Santa suit and watches small children with binoculars. He has two books. One book for good children, and the other for bad children. He writes down everything they do in these books. The guy is a scumbag. He also works in the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Philip has a family, two children, and he lives in a good house. <br /> <br /> When Harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits, he goes, collects all the toys and gives them to several children. Then he goes to church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts gifts under the tree. Children catch him, but they return to the bed. So, Harry goes to the bedroom, kills his father and leaves. <br /> <br /> When he goes to the house, a group of children notices him and runs up to him. Parents are nervous and try to get their children back to them so that they will not suffer. How do they know that Harry is a murderer? Of course, you must be suspicious, because you never know who it may be. Harry gives the children gifts, and his father takes out the switch blade, trying to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs away, the townspeople light torches and follow him to kill him. They do not even know that he is a murderer. When Harry gets to his brother's house, his brother and he talked a little, and Philip is choking him. He only loses consciousness. Philip loads Harry back into his van. When Harry wakes up, he leaves. <br /> <br /> I could not believe the ending. Once again, you have to see it in order to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that struck me is black santa. That's right, the man in the Santa suit they saw was a white man. So why did they bring the black? <br /> <br /> Skip this and watch “Silent Night, Deadly Night” and “Murder of Santa”. You will get your money for watching these two films. They are better than this pile of garbage! I give this film 1 star out of 10. I would like to give it 0 stars, because this film deserves it.
