Just awful! Why don't you use real actors? Look, this must stop! Stop using non-actors! If you need authority or any message sent through these low-budget films ... please, for the love of God, use real actors! Most will work for free ... take advantage of this! Now back to my comment ... in any case, the humor was lower than that of various bathrooms and was not funny at any level. Regarding quality ... in one scene filmed on a public transport bus, you could see a reflection of the team ... guess what? It was one guy with something like a Sony camcorder, and probably not even him. Well, I guess the only audience for this film are people with a bloody fetish ... and it was not even good blood.
