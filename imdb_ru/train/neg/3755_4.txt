I liked this movie, I admit it. It should be the best (right?) Movie I saw. Well ... my friend and I decided to just shit and laugh that we would make this movie. We knew what to expect, and we got exactly what we expected, and more. When this red neck pressed against the Sasquatch tree, we literally watched this part three or four times, it was so amazing (hysterical, of course). And why? Oh, why should the main character throw so much? How, frankly, we know that you are in danger, skating so much will not help. But actually, if this movie is in your local video store, RENT. It costs money, and itâ€™s not even as bad as it is, but not incredibly bad. In general, if you rent this movie, you will be completely amazed.
