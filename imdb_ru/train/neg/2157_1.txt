Siskel & Ebert were awesome on this show, whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict generated by their individual professional opinions. Roper took this show up a notch because he was not a film critic and because he replaced a rash person. Now, when Ben Lyons appears, I feel that I am watching “Teen News” - do you know this is a news show for children that is organized by children for children? Mankiewicz is not much better. Obviously, they have only met the steady diet of the mainstream films all their lives. The idea that these two lovers of rank can say or tell something about films is ridiculous. If they watch a movie without a formula, they are completely lost. Show them something original and clever - they just find it "confusing." Wait - I think I get it ... ABC belongs to Disney ... Disney makes films for children. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were just amazed at the big budget studio productions - what a surprise: these two guys LOVE a big studio choke and they manage to endure only a few indie. In addition, everyone knows what the age advertisers are aiming for. Eye makeup is the icing on the cake. In what alternative universe are these guys film critics?
