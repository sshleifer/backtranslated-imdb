Henry Salah’s “Nightmare Weekend” is a rotten piece of dirt from Tromá. This is a youthful, sloppy and stupid low-budget horror film about how some teenage girls spend their weekends in a mansion. Evil assistant professor lures girls into a strange scheme to conduct terrible experiments. Using a brain implant, she turns her victims and their dates into zombies. “Nightmare Weekend” is just a piece of garbage, in which there is a lot of nudity and dampness, not to mention a ridiculous musical score. This is terrible, and the script is completely incoherent. Why is such a piece of shit widespread outside of me. Avoid it like a plague. 1 out of 10.
