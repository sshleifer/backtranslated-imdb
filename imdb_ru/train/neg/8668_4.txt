I have never read the Bradbury novel on which this film is based, but from what I have gathered it will be interesting (when I finally read it and make it). My comments will be based solely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew that I had to see it, and I was so excited, but when I finally saw it, I was so disappointed that it hurt. This is because the film itself was so amateur. The actors were not well played (although Robards and Price are both good actors - just not here). It seemed to the child actors that they were simply asked to appear, dress characters, say lines and make faces. Set and props were cheap and unreal. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised by this horror that I had to go online and check who sent it, just to see what kind of work he had done. Editing was cut and pasted, and the plot (script) was just that (although the author was involved himself, irony?). The growth of tension, fear and uncertainty was so mild that it was ineffective when the climax finally came. <br /> <br /> I read some comments on this film and it's hard for me to believe that people really like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting, fun and intriguing. He had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad that it takes away the glitter of the story.
