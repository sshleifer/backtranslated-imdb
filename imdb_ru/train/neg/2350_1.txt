This show was ridiculously bad. Letter sucked, dialogue sucked. The guy who played Craig couldn't get out of the paper bag. Since it was Thursday night, it was definitely great to watch with beer. Cool music, bad game, bad writing - all came together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> This was a drama / unintended comedy. I don't care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, because they could not reveal who the victim was, they had to write a dialogue around him, which was terrible. I mean, the speech at the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that happened in the present were absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> So let's take a look. Everything that is happening now sucks. The flash of scenes, only writing, dialogues and actions of Craig sucks. The music ruled though.
