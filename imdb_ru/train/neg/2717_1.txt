Do we really need more narcissistic trash in the baby boomer generation? Technically, I am Boomer, although at the time when all the “idealistic young men” of the 60s read Marx, they burned their draft and, as a rule, prolonged the war, which killed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in elementary school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just fools who would believe in anything if it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another exercise in the self-esteem of children who have never been raised.
