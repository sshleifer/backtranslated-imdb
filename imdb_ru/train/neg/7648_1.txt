It is considered a fashion to single out any social evil as a result of patriarchy and male domination, no matter how illogical this illogical "logic" was. However, within the framework of the plot and the theme of the film there is no gray area, and the woman who should be called the antagonist of the film is the "villain of history." Under no circumstances what she did cannot be justified. In this case, the sexuality of a woman is just hype and has nothing to do with reality. This is a betrayal of the ultimate kind. The person eventually spent his resources and time on the wasteful education of the offspring of another person. To top it off, the weakest argument put forward by the three "liberated" female characters at the climax is pathetic. A womanâ€™s sexual needs do not exempt her from adultery and constantly betray her husband, and even worse, no other children. In fact, his life was wasted. In some societies, where justice still prevails, such situations result in unjust executions.
