I have not seen the first two - only this one, which is called the Primal Species in England. I don't think I will bother to watch them, though. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. Awful game, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything in it is so disgusting. The most responsive characters die very quickly and leave you with annoying characters, especially with the name Pollack, who is an incredible moron. No one will survive 5 minutes in the army. He lasted for ages, but I was pleased when he finally got a gnawed head - I had nightmares that he was going to survive. The colonel was also rubbish - all sullen puffed up inscriptions and ignorant cries. And Specky the doctor looked and behaved as if she were from porn. I was waiting for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and turn into a vampire, but she did not. It is a pity that since this would revive the film without end. <br /> <br /> Didn't Roger Corman make half decent movies?
