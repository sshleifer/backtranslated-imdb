this is a piece with - t !! it looks worse than television. movie. and I think the continuation was even achieved, and the results ... the war is more beautiful than that. Jean-Claude Van Cham did it again, and he wonders why his career is where it is now. neither the script, nor the story, nor the time should be spent on it. I mean that. 1 out of 10 is too tall, too tall. Goldberg must be killed for this. Van Sham is not an actor.
