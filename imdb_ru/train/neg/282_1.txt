What was an exciting and quite original Fox series has come down to a tortuous scar. For the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly “must see” list, and not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Fox authorities decided that they needed to “hone the storyline.” During the 3 episodes of the season newcomer, they completely lost me as a spectator (not even seeing Jessica Alba!). I found that the new characters that were added in the second season were too funny and amateur. New storylines too stretched the continuity and accuracy of the show. In one of the episodes of the second season, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where in the first season it was said that she cannot sleep biologically. If it works, don't mess with it! <br /> <br /> azjazz
