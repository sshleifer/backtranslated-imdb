this film has only the second star, because I work in the center of the city, and I liked to see it destroyed. The effect was pretty good - I heard that it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. Being the most expensive and still absolutely terrible makes it a huge waste of money. I rented it, so I won't complain about what I paid, but it was a couple of hours that I would never return. plot holes abound. terrible to play in all directions. I do not recommend spending time watching this movie, life is too short. if your friends want to watch it, run away. I can not stress how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> Where the hell did the second dragon come from? why didn't he appear earlier? where did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago?
