A teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide. Because of this, his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) ask many questions ... and blame themselves. <br /> <br /> Good idea with bad treatment. For a start, this was done before 1988 - mainly in television films and after school specials. In addition to some curses and dialogue (hence the PG-13 rating), this was nothing new. The result is predictable, and the attempts of Riva's acting act were really painful to watch. He is good NOW, but not in 1988. In addition, his character was dressed as slavering and always looked so dirty that it was difficult to evoke sympathy. <br /> <br /> This is, besides the movie, boring. I saw every oncoming scene and every “surprise” was wired. I, in principle, could not wait for this thing to end. <br /> <br /> I vaguely remember how I saw her at the theater in 1988 and hated her (she bombed BAD). It still looks lousy almost 20 years later. This item is worth exploring, but it was made better (with a better game) in countless other films. "Ordinary people" comes to mind. You can skip this.
