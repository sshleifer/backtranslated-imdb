I didn't like the movie, Joshua. Perhaps it’s because I’ve seen another, much better film called Orphan 2 days before, but maybe it’s really because this film wasn’t very good. I'm going with the stairs. Of course, the plot of an evil child is not quite original, but this does not mean that the film cannot be successful. It could be tense, entertaining and frightening, but instead it was a slow construction, boring, without incident and really not forcing me to think more than “it was not very good” when it was all over. <br /> <br /> At the end, Joshua’s motives are revealed. I will not give it up, but the reality is that he did not achieve his goals, because, despite the fact that Vera Farmig, like his mother, Abby, was missing by about 3/4 of the film, all the arrows point to her returning home soon time. She was placed in a mental hospital because she was losing her mind, but then Joshua’s father / her husband was accused of counterfeiting her medicines, which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was not really mentally ill, but rather receiving a medical dose. So ... shouldn't she be home soon? Joshua did not fail? Would not his Mother live with him and his sister, and perhaps with his father soon? I am asking my father, as his future remains open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day I didn’t care about the characters. The evil demon child Joshua was not really scary. The storyline moved slowly, and when it started, it was still boring. Suspension fell idle every time. When it was all over, I could not believe that I had gone through all this. <br /> <br /> 4/10 only because the game was good from parents, especially from Vera Farmigi in the role of Mother, but if you want to watch a movie about an evil “child”, watch “Orphan”. Now this is a film that took a non-original concept and created a brilliant film.
