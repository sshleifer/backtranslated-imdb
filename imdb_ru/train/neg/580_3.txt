A really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable, and plays the role of a complement badly. <br /> <br /> A vampire hunter story - the worst I've ever seen, Derek Bliss (John Bon Jovi) travels to Mexico in search of bloodsuckers! He uses an interesting weapon (but nothing compared to Blade), and is part of the network of vampire hunters Van Helsig? Good, but he works alone. He is assigned to search for the powerful vampire queen who is looking for some black crucifix to perform a ritual that will allow her to be invulnerable to sunlight (almost a continuation of Vampires (1998), directed by John Carpenter and starring James Woods), Derek begins his search in search of the queen with new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, very bad acting game), teenager without experience, Father Rodrigo (Christian De La Fuente), Catholic priest, Zoe (Natasha Wagner), special vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCreerie), another experienced vampire Hunter. Obviously, in this adventure, he is not alone. <br /> <br /> You can start to feel how this film will just look at its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); this is a huge difference as an actor compared to James Woods, and then if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this part), you will fall into one of the most simple stories, absolutely predictable, with terrible acting actions, really bad special effects and incoherent events! <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not to watch this movie!, rent another movie, watch another channel, go out with friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
