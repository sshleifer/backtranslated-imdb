I saw this film as a kid when it was released in the theater, and it was so bad that it turned into a family joke. If the rating had a zero, this film would have received it. Dinosaurs were terrible. The storyline was ridiculous. Acting cannot really be called acting skills. The only reason I remember the name of the film so well is because my family is still talking about how bad it was.
