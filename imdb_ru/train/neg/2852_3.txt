This is a very unpleasant, albeit slyly made film. I tried it because it’s the stars of Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the storyline — the mafia boss is about to leave the mental hospital — sounds promising. The film is announced comedy, Sorta. We have an endless series of shots - you should excuse the pun - people in dimly lit and elegant, albeit somewhat surreal, interiors shooting at each other - in the head, stomach, patella, foot, heart (without participation, it seems, anatomy is avoided, while they are engaged in a vague and mysterious dialogue, some of which seem to be humorous in some way a postmodern character. The Goldblum dialogue for the entire film could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears one expression everywhere — sar Don's grin. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are doing everything they can. Bert Reynolds makes a comeo. The list of credits is Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (a good move on their part). Everything is cold, sterile, mechanical and unpleasant; I suspect he's the heir to Pulp Fiction, Fargo, and Natural Born Killers. If you like these, you will probably like it.
