Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a cook for a pirate ship that becomes captain after killing the previous one. Although he witnessed the burial of the treasure, he begins to lose his memory, and the treasure map he receives becomes empty. So Dick is forced to find someone who can see ghosts and communicate with them (do you advertise for this?) And help pave the way to the treasure. It's amazing how someone could control this meaningless film. Former Gun Spike Milligan replaced Medak as a director, and given Medak’s talents in The Ruling Class film, you can probably guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes Milligan was in the director’s chair. Peter Boyle appears in the first 10 minutes of the film in the role of a doomed pirate captain. He is probably very grateful that the young Frankenstein was released that year when he was filmed and preserved, so that he can hide it from his resume. Franzioza looks dashing, like a handsome powerful scraper, but he and the salesman look pretty desperate, even Sellers’s makeup and hair looks pretty awful. They should have known that this film was being bombed, even when they were shooting it. With such strings, I can understand any possible concern: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (going to be hanged). You will pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won 't. I will do it for free. <br /> <br /> And this is one of the good jokes. It is surprising to me that much of the Sellers' prolific material is still in storage, but it was available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone coming up to the plate and releasing in the USA a well-received British television program "A Show Called Fred" with Sellers in the title role, directed by the great Richard Leicester?
