I really do not understand all these positive user reviews. This film is the worst film I've ever seen, and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez in this film is hot, but terrible. But I do not think that it is her fault, but the director. He somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their action, idea, makeup, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give is only the idea of ​​a film that was very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this nonsense, go watch Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
