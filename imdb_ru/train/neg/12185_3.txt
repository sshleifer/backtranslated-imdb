What has ever motivated Martin Scorsese to remake this film? And he not only redid it, completely destroyed it? The nonsensical decision to turn the character played by Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated performance, and that says a lot), into a religious fanatic, is ridiculous and is an example of the relationships inherited by Hollywood (and especially Mr. Scorsese) - which make writers think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. In any case, this film is terrible. <br /> <br />
