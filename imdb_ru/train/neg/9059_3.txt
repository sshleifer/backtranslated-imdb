I will just vaguely ask about my potential spoiled comments. In this film there are enough canned plot elements, therefore, it is essentially pre-spoiled. <br /> <br /> This film draws several ideas from the southern classic "To Kill a Mockingbird." I suppose that perhaps TKOM got its ideas from some source ... anyway, after you look at it, you will say: "Oh yes, this is robbery." <br /> <br /> I think that the most interesting thing about these McMovies is when you have determined the plot element, find out whether they will stick to the original or try to wrap it. Not a lot of turns in this.
