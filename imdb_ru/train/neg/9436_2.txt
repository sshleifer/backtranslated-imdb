Unheded follows a typical storyline in the early 80s. Pretty young girls are in danger. I have to give it up for the sake of the director who used the helicopter for some early filming on the road, you really think that for a second there will be quality in production. Watching “Unheded” is the same as seeing acting classes go through warming up. Some of the most awkward, poorly lit, too long scenes are played with the pleasure of an overdose of Valium. I wondered why they didn’t just put the cue cards on the camera so that the actresses didn’t have to constantly look. Obviously, the two main girls were chosen for their T & A factor, and not for their talent. Laurel Munson as Terry's main chick is as fascinating as watching the drying of the paint. Two nude scenes make for teens thrills. Janet Penner and Virginia Settl as a crazy / creepy daughter and mother, whose chicks are in a quandary, compete for the worst roles in history. Long pauses, strange expressions, emphasis on the wrong word - all this is there, and it is a joy for those of us who love bad movies. Scenes suddenly change with long trips through which you can drive a Mack truck. Animated lightning falls through the frames, without even bothering to show the sky. Eye shadow eighties attacking the viewer. But you know, it grew on me. I was sorry for that. I wanted to hug him, kiss him boo-boo and make him better. The ending does not compensate for the damage caused to her, but I still smiled. I have my own theories about all “banned” advertisements, and I hope that anyone who wants to watch this film will do so with significant substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise pass.
