Oh, man, what was Sam Mraovich thinking about? What did everyone who was involved in this “movie” think? Mraovich is the head of almost everything “Ben and Arthur”: the director, the writer, the producer (also the executive producer!), Custer, the leading star — call it, he did it. And he (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone else sucked in every department of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> So what is wrong with this movie? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich - * Ston *). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone hates gays. Worse, Ben's crazy “ex-wife” (they are definitely not divorcing), Tammy (Julie Belknap) madly thinks that Ben has left her for another man, and demands that they come back together (saying that she might be gay! ) and Arthur's Christian, a devoted, overly hypocritical, as violent as Tammy's brother, Victor, is obsessed with having Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he was kicked out of the church. <br /> <br /> The film is absolutely packed with a block with so many stupid things (that is, Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married - they fly there on Alaskan airlines, and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on FedEx cargo plane - I hope that they were conveniently in a wooden box, plus many, many others) and a plot of loading holes (Victor calls Arthur’s murder "The Final Plan", which later changes to "Last Deed"; Arthur and the private (young) detective drive on one car, blah blah blah). The “actors” are all very bad and too cool; the script is ridiculously horrible (one of these examples is “I don't make sense? You don't make sense! I make sense, that's who makes sense!”), and there can be much more mistakes with the “film” than I can’t write them all down . <br /> <br /> However, the funny thing, but incredible in Ben and Arthur, is that Sam Mraovich thinks he created something really fantastic (see his fake reviews “Ben and Arthur” and his comments on YouTube.) Mraovich is narcissistic, and his arrogance prevents him from seeing how horrible anything is with his name on him. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, forget about every bad movie you think , is the worst of all ever ... Arthur "will knock them out of this title right away, even Paris Hilton films look like" The Dark Knight s "in comparison with the monster known as" Ben and Arthur. "
