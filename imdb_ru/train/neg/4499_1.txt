Any film that has nude scenes with Karen Allen, and I'm still so bored that I am leaving, it's terrible! <br /> <br /> Karen was stuck in Paris and made friends with a nice French man, with whom she soon has sex. Of course, he is married (“But, dear, why should this be a problem?”). What could be an interesting collision of cultures (believe it or not) is simply boring. I went out. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film has become much better after I left; but it would be much better to compensate for a rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice: if you find yourself in this, run, do not walk, to the exit. Save your time and your energy. Surely save your money. It's a shame that the production company did not save their money.
