This documentary begins with an interesting premise - it leads an intriguing and convincing argument that the story of Jesus, as is commonly believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, after it inspired us, the film completely switches and becomes almost a continuous attack on Christianity and largely focuses on light goals. <br /> <br /> The writer / director clearly has some problems with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger), and this film seems to be his form of liberation. It would be interesting to see the extended first 20 minutes, but overall the film is disappointing.
