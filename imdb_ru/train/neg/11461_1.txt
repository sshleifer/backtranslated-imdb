Please don’t spend +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don’t do it. Especially if someone is lucky nap near you. Damn, if you ask me. I waited for something to happen - this did not happen. I'm not one of those people who stop watching movies halfway through. I must always bring it to the end. What a huge mistake. Do yourself a favor, go and draw a wall and see how it dried out - much more interesting. Please don’t spend +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don’t do it.
