I will not spend a lot of time on this, because, as I understand it, this is not a film to start with, but simply careless mixing of borrowed frames and embarrassingly amateur new shots made solely for the purpose of gluing the whole mess and calling it a continuation of "Boogeyman ". Literally 80% of this film is stolen from its much higher predecessor “Boogeyman,” a film that the authors of this rubbish obviously did not even bother to see, because they could not even get the name of the original heroine of actress Suzanne Love (Lacey) right. And to add insult to the wound, the killer is invisible in the original frame and visible in the new frame, obviously, they think that their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10, and I would like the IMDb rating system to go so low, the roughest and blatant attempt to wreck the money of people that I have ever seen, YOU WARNED!
