The cars in this movie are awesome. The acting in this movie is terrible. The plot and driving scenes do not make much sense and are equally bad. If you really worry about movies in which someone switches and suddenly ridiculously accelerates, save yourself from the hassle and money. Good movie for racing lovers? Well, thereâ€™s the part where they make the mistake of calling the NASCAR driver a rally car driver. If you can't tell the difference, go watch it, you will have a blast. It comes down to the fact that there are really very good cars in this film, they are awful and absolutely unrealistic. The game is terrible mainly because of the extremely poor plot. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I am disappointed that such good cars would be presented in such a bad film. If the class of cars must conform to the class of the film, they must ride on rusty bicycles.
