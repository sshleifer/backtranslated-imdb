I bought a DVD version of this film on the recommendation of my wife, who loved the version she saw on the TV. But the DVD version was a disaster. The lighting was bad or absent, and the whole scenes were simply cut out. In one case, Adel is put to bed, and we immediately move on to another scene — entering the half-word — where the next night. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason never even imagine what makes you wonder if they didn’t fall asleep for a few minutes during the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD that we saw was released by Platinum Disc Corp, and even for $ 6.32 it was a hyp. <br /> <br /> Be careful what version of this movie you are buying! We will send it back.
