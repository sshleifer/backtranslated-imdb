This film is a pathetic attempt, it seems, to justify the actions of Mary Ann Leturno. To do this, they threw a 19-year-old Well, probably not "in order to do it." There was no way they could play a 12 or 13-year-old boy, because the love scenes would pull everyone out (if they were even allowed to do it) - as they should. The guy Mary Ann was the age of my nephew, which made her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of "pedophile" does not have to include many children - all you need is one. <br /> <br /> I really do not care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to the students, which she did not comply with. The reason is that she is bipolar, refused diagnosis and refused to take medication. It is clear that she did not think rationally. Hopefully, now she understands her actions. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children, I pray that she will take the medication and think clearly. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, Penelope Ann Miller was absolutely convincing and ideally suited for this role.
