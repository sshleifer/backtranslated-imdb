I liked it, but then I think I could iron at the same time. This revision of the Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a completely undemanding, formal romcom, saved from shameful to video shame after its release by a sharp turn of Janeane Garofalo. Playing Frasier of Pets, she finds herself trapped in love when insecurity forces her to impersonate her best friend (Uma Thurman) when he calls. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film in Ben Chaplin's fascinating career. The average British actor, he gave the Hollywood treadmill a shot with this film. He is unremarkable, and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising on this basis, although he appeared in solid cameos in both later films of Terence Malick. Uma Thurman makes autopilot on, and Michael Lehmann intelligently packs it all up. Although phone sex is disgusting. 4/10
