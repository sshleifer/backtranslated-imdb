The final score (average of various classic cinematic qualities - acting, visual effects, creativity, impact, humor, fun, etc.): <br /> 4.3 / (out of 10) <br /> < br /> If "Atlantis: A Lost Empire", released a few years ago, would have seemed a bold, serious new direction in Disney animation. However, this happens a year after the innovative and almost genius "New Grove of the Emperor" and marks itself step back in disney's release from his repetitive “Disney Form.” I'm a big fan of See the Disney cartoons. See how they all love or hate it. Atlantis is a lively return to “20,000 leagues under the sea” and similar science fiction adventures of the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea. It looks like a remake of something, even more than a real Disney remake (Tarzan, Hunchback from Notre Dame). The characters are nothing more than the usual clichés of ordinary suspects who usually inhabit such movies type (crank, fanatic-general, sassy tough women). Apart from Milo Tetch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the auxiliary staff is completely disgusted. The film also suffers from its brief tempo. Instead of putting it into an epic story, Disney plays a lot in a usually short time, combing out opportunities for development ... suspense, characters, something really. They throw us into this new and wonderful world and barely allow us to get our inhibitions. The awkward pace sometimes confuses what is a relatively simple story. The animation is grim, dreary and cheap. This thing looks like a Saturday cartoon shot down in the morning. Hopefully, they have not forgotten that traditional 2D animation can still be wonderful. The Iron Giant, among other things, proved it. <br /> <br /> Negatives: visual effects, tempo and lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positives: Perhaps the coolest death scene for a Disney Villain in a long time. This is a creative highlight of the film.
