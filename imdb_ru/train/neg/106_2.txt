First Watch 3/3/2003 - 2 of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Crazy 3-D film about zombies eating flesh in 3 stories of the film chronicles And yes, we see zombies eating pieces of human flesh in 3D ! Wow, no !! This was done again and again in 2D in a zombie film, but what usually makes a zombie film better is the main story, not the actual meat-eating. This is what made the original zombie classic good. Kushala flesh just added. We actually miss most of this three-part chronicle due to lameness (similar to the twilight zone), easily understood and slowly revealed in the final. The last story is actually the story that started the film (with a reporter investigating the so-called ghost town), and, of course, in this film we see flesh eating zombies. Well, I think I said enough. See the classics, not this 3D holiday.
