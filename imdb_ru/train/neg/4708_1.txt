Oh my God! I first heard about this bad show, when one of my friends was screaming like an idiot "Johnny Test" when we were playing video games. I thought he was confusing "Johnny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life, "and changed the" Quest "to" Test. "It's something weird that I'm wrong but actually I was wrong, he didn’t change anything, he heard about this show. <br /> <br /> One day when I was watching TV I heard that Cartoon Network would be released. I wasn’t sure what there was the plot of this show, so I wanted to watch it myself, and here is my answer, “I WANT TO DAMAGE AN HOUR BACK” (because I watched this nonsense and “My gym partner is a monkey.” <br /> <br /> it One of the worst shows I've ever seen. First, the beginning, the most stupid song in the world, then the plot. Oh, where are my manners? I didn’t tell the plot of this show. and experimenting with my own brother. Ohhh, now I understand why his name is Johnny TEST, he is a test of his sisters' experiments. <br /> <I honestly miss La Dexter's b (before it was transformed into NEW Dexter complete nonsense too). This is a bad copy of the good old show, except that it is surprisingly bad show. Don't look, do something more productive in half an hour than watch this shit.
