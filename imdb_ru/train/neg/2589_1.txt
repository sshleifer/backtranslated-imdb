For those who have little time, I will summarize quickly, in one word ... sorry. There are many good examples of why this film fits this description perfectly. So much so that you can barely pass 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and senseless imposed on you. Do you want a completely nude woman in the first 10 minutes? Do you understand! The reason she appears is so pointless that it actually sets the tone for the rest of this youthful shit. You can almost look into the lost minds of 12-year-old boys who wrote this piece of garbage, just by watching the crap that they expect the public to actually pay for !! ?? !!! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I have seen a decrease in the film franchise, but the American pie: Beta House should be one of the worst offenders, considering that, despite the average nature of the original film, it is still a thousand times funnier than this jerk. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, and sometimes you really feel that you are watching a school play. What is happening in this film is so unrealistic that in order to watch it, a lot of mistrust is required (we are talking about levels of Star Wars suspension, something that you need to convince yourself that Jar Jar is real) < br /> <br /> The plot is thin, and most of the events that take place happen only to show another breast or create another pitiful joke. There is no acting talent to talk about, all you get is a bunch of nice guys trying to make us laugh. And how they fail !!!! Each gag did not work, and the only thing I laughed at was how socially ignorant the writers are. How else can you explain the bulls ** they are trying to pass off as history? <br /> <br /> They miss every opportunity to do something worthwhile and interesting in favor of badly written nonsense with the least common denominator. Characters must complete a certain number of assignments before they become members of Beta House, but this is mostly solved by a series of very short installations, which imply that they complete the assignments, but we see little or no evidence that this is actually happening. This is a very lazy way to tell a story. It also misses the opportunity to be funny about it. (Imagine the Wizard of Oz, where all the important events took place behind the scenes, not on it, and all we see is that Dorothy occasionally waves the Scarecrow and says: Of course, it was a great adventure that We were then ") Lazy. Lazy. Lazy !!!! <br /> <br /> Female characters have nothing to say. All they do is strip out for no apparent reason and are used as visual supports throughout most of the film. Your brain dead, who are only looking for T & A, will not be disappointed, but only for this reason. you are ashamed of you. If you buy it on DVD, you will in your own way contribute to the downfall of society. Congratulations.
