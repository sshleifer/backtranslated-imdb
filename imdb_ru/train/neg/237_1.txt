After Mr. Brosnan was extremely busy playing "The Tailor of Panama" (I rate 10/10 in all areas: casting, acting, script, history, editing, tempo, music, emotional impact, etc. .) I enthusiastically expected this film. I was very disappointed. This is a script, and not a film, vulgar for the sake of vulgarity, bankruptcy in all respects, that Panama's Tailor is rich and satisfying. Blame writing and screen setting. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part"; it never came. I did not laugh and did not cry, although one line of dialogue made me smile. Is it worth 7 dollars? Barely
