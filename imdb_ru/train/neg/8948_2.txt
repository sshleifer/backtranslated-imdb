Ninteen Eighty-Four is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and cannot be trusted. This is a very dark film, and it does not make you feel good. We are talking about the novel taking place in this society, the betrayal of lovers and the fact that human nature is self-centered. The film has some very good ideas, and it is good at depicting this society with dark tones of colors (contrasting with happiness and bright colors in a dream) and a general feeling of loneliness among objects, people and places. However, despite the dexterity of the film in the image of this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to completely understand the idea. It seemed that too much time was spent on being smart, and not telling a story.
