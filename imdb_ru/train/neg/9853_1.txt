I think that most want to believe in the existence of unusual things, and this film does not show restraint in trying to use it fully. The presentation is very interesting, well presented, and the graphics are modern, but from a scientific point of view it simply does not work. Hydrogen filled flying bubbles? They must be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there is the ubiquitous possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problems with fantasy, just do not try to pass it off as a fact. Some people will always be misunderstood. In general, the film is interesting, but I always found myself saying that: “Oh, brother, what a burden ...”. If you want the documentary “Fake,” see “This is a spinal click.” Or at least turn off the sound.
