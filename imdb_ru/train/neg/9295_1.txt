I was very surprised how bad this film is. Good cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only shoot a movie. I was hoping to restart Hero, but it’s much, much worse. <br /> <br /> Because of this film, Kung Fu has first of all earned a bad reputation. There are no believable characters (even in the cartoon world of kung-fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), with almost no plot or funny plot twists. <br /> <br /> This film is so boring and disappointing that it reminds you of trying to play a game with a child. Every time you think your stupid battle has any meaning, they come up with another ridiculous twist that makes no sense (“Oh, you only think that I have my superpowers and 10,000 ray guns, but I ate your vitamins with the addition of plutonium and Teflon, so your beam guns do not work, and I am invulnerable to your supernormal abilities ... press, do not trade, do not exchange infinity PLUS one. ") Children can continue with this madness because they don’t care everyone listens because they are having fun. , for BROWSE, especially for an adult viewer, this long film is worse than a fight with bad gas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FORWARD Note to kung-fu movie makers, (a) if you have a knife in the back, it hurts if you are not on the PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back with a knife, it will hurt more and cause more damage if it is not a fake prop, (c) when you are stabbed in the heart, you will die, especially in ancient China, where there is no Kaiser Permanente around the corner, (d) Kung Fu fights do not last for hours until 3 Legs fall with snow, and (e) sometimes it’s worth explaining your characters and their motives. <br /> <br /> In any case, look again at “Hero”, because, at least in his small world, this is understandable.
