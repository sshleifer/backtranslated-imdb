Even if you subscribe to the anti-free trade policy of this film, itâ€™s still the same weary note played over and over and over. Clink blade blade. Even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair, who favors a return to the first principles, it is quite difficult to perceive Rev. Billy as a serious figure. The Rev. Clown is the type that wakes up every morning without any more striving ambition than to see his own face on TV before he goes to bed again that night. I have to admit that he has a beautiful wife, but it would have taken much more to save this melancholy porridge from the film. Endless bus rides - the worst part - with the progress shown - can you guess? - along a color line moving around the map. Oh, you guessed it. Oh, well, this has the advantage of being short. Is this the only auspicious thing I can say? Hmmm Yes, I'm afraid so.
