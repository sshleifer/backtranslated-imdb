The highlight of this film for me was, without a doubt, Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he definitely played against the type and showed that he can cope with an unconventional (for him) role. Hanks is usually a good guy in the movie - the one you like, admire and support him. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this film he seemed somewhat noble - his goal was to avenge the murders of his wife and younger son. Despite this, he was already a gangster and a murderer before those murders. So Hanks took on a role in which I would not expect him, and he coped with it well. <br /> <br /> In addition to the good work of Hanks, I, of course, could not call this film enjoyable. After the discovery, which I would best describe as mysterious (for some time I didnâ€™t quite understand where it went), it turns into a very dark movie about complex relationships that Sullivan developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney (Paul Newman ), which is a kind of mafia boss and tries to raise his two sons and keep them clean, so to speak; isolated from its business. After the eldest son witnesses the murder, the gang tries to kill him to silence him, gets the wrong son (and mother) and leaves Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike Jr.) on the run. It becomes a strange film linking the relationship of father and son. <br /> <br /> Although it ends on a slightly encouraging note (at least in the general context of the story), it is actually very dark indeed, and this mood is intensified by many scenes filmed in darkness and torrential rains. I have to admit that, although I highly appreciated the performance of Hanks, the film as a whole simply did not pull me. 4/10
