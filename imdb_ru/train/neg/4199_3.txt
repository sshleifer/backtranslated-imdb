A very modest effort that offers virtually nothing to anyone except the hardcore Stanley Tucci fan, who is trying but not able to save the poor structure, dialogue, leadership or talent of our leading person. <br /> <br /> Pretty much the only trick that this comforting story about a naive new seller for a company that produces a security alarm system is in its fancy side characters. But without a realistic background, such characters are meaningless. <br /> <br /> Nothing to see here, keep moving ... <br /> <br />
