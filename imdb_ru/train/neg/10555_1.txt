First of all: I love good Splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget film is none of that! The picture quality is damn low, the soundtrack is the most annoying of all I've ever heard (!!!!), but as for the FX ... well, because of the super-low quality, some of them don't look as bad as they could in real film (what this garbage is not here). No concept, subtle storyline, primitive action and rare dialogue - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the entire film, each of which was repeated about 20 times ... the same for many episodes of the film (may be an indication of what audience this shit was done !!!) It seems that the story that the young boy had to watch his father raped and kill his mother, suffered psychological damage and, when an adult goes on tour, demonstrates self-destruction. So far, so good ... But for these pseudo-art-idiots directors, this plot is just a line to put in a row cheap shocked scenes produced that have no message and have no meaning (recently extracted guts thrown at the bare, bound woman in a hole ... why ?? and why is this the only time you see a woman and a thrower in the whole bloody "movie") ??? Anxious? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Need to? Not! Artistic? NOT !!!!! Anyone taking this cheap mountain show for art should visit their psychiatrist as soon as possible or watch Pink Floyd's “Wall” to see how such a topic can be cleverly designed ... I hope this was your first and last ( !!!!!!!!) movie Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And remember: everything in your head, not everything that looks cheap and does not make any sense, automatically becomes an “art” ...
