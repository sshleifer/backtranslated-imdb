I'm a big fan of Lon Cheney, but the script of this film did not help me. The story is strangely jumping (since I learned that there is no section in the film), and the characters appear and disappear with annoying suddenness. Some of the names are too explanatory (for example, “why, you are no longer a child!” - shortly and slowly cut the picture - “you are a woman!”) Yes, we understood for the first time, but there are several talking sequences asking for explanations, which never appear. (Let's listen to the argument of Luigi and his blond girlfriend, please!) The plot, which includes incestuous desires (figuratively, if not technically), disturbed him to such an extent that it was difficult to look at. To the credit of the author, this problem was considered as a problem, and the match for May-December is not portrayed as the inevitable inevitability of some of Mary Pickford’s films (for example, “Papa Long Feet”). Cheney, as usual, plays well, but I think that in the past he was better oriented - he overdid it here several times, IMHO. I really enjoyed the episodes of the clown and was very impressed with the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though surprisingly young. The film has its moments, but so far this is my least favorite picture of Cheney.
