Too much of a borrowed class B- <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in theaters every year. Because of this, film studios, as a rule, do not produce films with a large budget this weekend. Every few years, the studio produces an anti-programmed film about the female bias (“Wedding Planner” of 2001) to compete with the big game. This weekend, the Super Bowl with the same name “Wedding Date” will try to succeed and attract viewers who are not watching the game. <br /> <br /> A sick woman who feels sorry for her is a lonely woman, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, TV show “Will and Grace”) hires a male escort Nick (Dermot Malroni, “About Schmidt”) to introduce her boyfriend to his sister's wedding in London. Her family was worried because she was not married, and her seven-year experience, which left her for no reason, is the best man. To make him jealous, Kat flaunts Nick around her ex, so that he can see what he is missing. But ultimately Nick helps Kat understand that she can open up and allow someone to love her. <br /> <br /> The film borrows too much from similar wedding films. This is an almost exact copy of Picture Picture 1999, which is mixed in scenes similar to Wedding Planner and My Best Friends Wedding. The film also uses the reverse theme “Beautiful Women”, and, knowing its audience, the director makes clever references to this and other films. <br /> <br /> “The wedding date” contains all the clichés In a typical wedding film there is a stereotypical domineering mother (Holland Taylor, “Legally Blonde”) and almost plagiarized wedding speeches of family and friends at a wedding and rehearsal dinner. The turn in the final was made earlier, but it was something that was not quite expected. The real reason Kat was thrown out was a surprise and changed the direction of the film in the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Although the “Wedding Date” is predictable, it can stand on its own. Debra Messing in her first starring role proves that she can be charming and fun. Dermot Malroni has excellent chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogue was too banal and unreal. He is able to do the best of what they give him and be able to save the character. <br /> <br /> With a lot of clever puns (often sexual), the movie is actually funny. Despite the fact that the film, basically, is a film that has everything that everyone can like. The feeling of a pleasant story and humor make it the best long-term film released in a long time.
