Another American film about the pie was hidden in our throat, and this film is the worst of them all. It does not deserve the name American Pie. They should have been stopped at the "Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie that they gave the title American Pie on. When I watched it, I felt like I was watching another series. He did not fall at all like an American pie. He has a different humor, and he is much rougher, and there are much more sex scenes in him than in other American pie films. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it ever. Actually, I do not recommend any of the films "American Pie Presents". Just stick to the original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
