This movie is just awful. John Ritter performs parantnye videos, 75% of the actors give out their lines as if they are reading from cue cards, poor editing, terrible sound mixing (in places where it is difficult to hear the dialogues), and a plot that is not going anywhere. thought I would ever say it, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others who suck more. Patty Hansen delivers his lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I began to wonder if she did not die inside. Even the children of Bogdanovich are terrible (the eldest, of course, reads her lines from the cue card). This film is really terrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until 4 years later. Please do not watch this. If you see it on your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend offers it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you better find the other half. I'd rather knock out my eyes with lawn darts than sit down through this piece of trash again. If I could summarize this movie in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
