Yes, “Southern Star” has a rather mysterious title melody performed by this heavy set singer Matt Monroe. This largely sets the tone for this bloated and rather dull function, overwhelmingly erroneous with George Seagal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) in the pursuit of an ostrich, tons of video footage of wildlife and a poorly composed and boring photograph of Raul Cuthard, and you get a completely uninteresting fuss in the jungles of Senegal.
