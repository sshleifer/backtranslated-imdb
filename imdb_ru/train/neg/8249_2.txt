Hi guys, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie sucks. Think "Actually Love" the other way around. Nothing fits perfectly, nothing is connected, and, of course, nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a complete failure. As stated, however, there are three redemptive points about this disfigured film potential. <br /> <br /> A) With star billing by Jennifer Love Hewitt, there will be hordes of guys who, with grace, will present a view of this just to catch a glimpse of little Hewitt with tight clothes. I'll tell you now, guys ... there are some promising scenes .... but this is really a weak eye candy. The "opportunities" here are weak. However, I watched the next scene being seduced in which you know that ..... exciting! <br /> <br /> b) The ending is romantic and positive. That it contradicts and “excessively” is relevant ..... yet there was still a positive moment for me. <br /> <br /> c) Dougray Scott plays a very friendly guy ........ Refreshing! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not worthy of your 10 or so dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3 of the way I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt would be the next legend in an erotic show. Although now I will take it back ... it depends a lot on her next film. <br /> <br /> Yes, and her sister is stupid. Her husband is so stupid ... and, damn, she is so stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. can't wait for the next love really with jlh!
