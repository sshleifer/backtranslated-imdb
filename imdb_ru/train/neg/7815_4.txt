As a longtime fan of Superman from the comics, in the 1950s TV series, the first two films of Chris Reeves, Lois and Clark and finally Smallville, I * really * hoped for something clever with Superman Returns. br /> <br /> Instead, we had Lex Luthor making * one more * real estate conversion attempt, another Superman “beaten while wearing kryptonite” and internal inconsistencies: he couldn't stop himself in the Ocean when stuck with 6 "Kryptonite, but when Lois tears 3" from him, * leaving everything else *, he can lift * continent * into space ?? Indeed, the only hero in the story was partner Lois - I cannot remember his name by hand. He did all sorts of saving, heroic things only with courage and skills - without superpowers, without invulnerability ... just with a normal person. <br /> <br /> They keep making Superman so small. Why can't we have Superman fighting Brainiac or fighting to save the universe from General Zod instead of Lex’s petty ideas. Oh, I forgot ... they do it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yes ... I think I’ll stick with Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You should probably be too ...
