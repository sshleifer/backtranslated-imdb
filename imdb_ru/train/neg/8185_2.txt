Oh my god I decided to go to the cinema with a few friends, wanting to watch one of those nice, pleasant to the touch Christmas movies, and leave with disgust. The film failed. Full stop. Paul Giamatti, whom I consider a good actor, played his character and just rode awfully with Vince Vaughn, who was always my favorite actor. They are trying to turn the Christmas movie into a new style. It seems bad, mixed with good, but it turned out not so at all. The first ten minutes were not so bad, but as soon as we saw Santa, it was all over. Nothing has improved, the rate has remained the same, there is NO character development, and, of course, this is one of the worst Christmas films ever invented. Do not look, whatever you do.
