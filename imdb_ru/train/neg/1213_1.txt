I cannot believe that such Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger were involved in this piece of garbage! The script is so poorly written and the direction is so weak (both from the same person) that it is difficult to find more one-dimensional characters in the film. Dialogues are so stupid that this so-called thriller laughed from several fools who got into the theater. The situation is complicated, we invite you to believe that you are going to watch the chilling thriller, and suddenly it turns into the most stupid film about the persecution. The character of Bassinger is so stupid that she really stops shouting to God "Where are you!" so that people can follow it, and then it flows !!!! And then she obviously got into the smallest forest in the world, I mean, she runs around, and the killers never lose her mark, and this happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder: can the best writers in Hollywood really find that they spend millions on it?
