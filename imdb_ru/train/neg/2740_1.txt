I still do not know why I forced myself to accept this. This “movie” was not worth the Memorex DVD-R on which it was burned; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of middle school students stealing a video camera of their parents. This is by far the worst movie ever made. I really want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this must be bad on purpose; However, if you find yourself in hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute turn of doo-doo, you will see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make a stunning film. The actors are trying to play an amazing game comparable to Crimson Tide, but approaching The Marine. <br /> <br /> Crappy game - just the tip of the iceberg. The angles of the camera are terrible. At best, this is a C-film - the plot is not even good enough to be considered the caliber of a B-film. The dialogue tries to be dynamic and witty, but this is crap, like everything else. It is rumored that a printed copy of the script really attracts flies. Plus, the techno score is annoying ... not because it's techno, but because it doesn't stop. That's right, the music plays in the background ALL THE TIME, acting as a subconscious reminder of how bad this thing is. I do not care what the disclaimer says, I do not buy it. BOTS was not made so bad on purpose, because it is too serious for jokes in itself. <br /> <br /> This “movie” was very low budget. But this is no excuse for its record settling factor. Great films are born from substance, not budget. BOTS had neither one nor the other. <br /> <br /> Let me once again articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I had a three-way relationship with Jessica Alba and Jessica Beale in front of the TV and Blood from the samurai, I would go out of there faster than Stephen Seagal in the Executive Decision. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, some people will try to protect the film. Two, maybe three. They will say: “This is Greenhouse chop-nanny!” Or “cheesy in a good way!” or "it's so bad, it's good!" These people are idiots. The film is either good or bad. Good bad movie does not happen. But there are such idiots who like shitty movies. Do not get me wrong; There are many films about Cornball that cannot be taken seriously, which are enjoyable and interesting. Slider is one. BOTS is not. <br /> <br /> This slop lasts about one and a half hours, and, in my humble opinion, it is 90 minutes more. The best thing about this “movie” is the DVD cover, so the next time you get close to the Wal-Mart DVD shopping cart, look at it — DO NOT TOUCH, just look — and leave quietly.
