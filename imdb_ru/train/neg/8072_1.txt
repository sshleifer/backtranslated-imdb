(Possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> “Surviving Souls” is perhaps the worst theatrical film ever produced. Nothing makes sense at all, there is some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. By the end of the film, the entire film is just a collection of random frames that are not really related to each other. <br /> <br /> There is no such actor, the work with the camera is intermittent, and the script is so complicated that it makes watching the film even harder. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to tie the film, but nothing happened. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
