When I first looked at the storyline, I realized that it could be a decent movie. Can I ever be wrong? The beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of addicts gathered together and decided to make a low-budget film. The first 10 minutes you do not notice the stupid game, terrible sound and terrible special effects, but then it gets worse. After about 20 minutes, I asked myself: "What was the plot again?" The main actor has one setting for emotions, and he sticks to it throughout the entire movie, although he had to endure love and hate and everything in between. The flashback scene almost made me break out because she made me relive another minute of the movie that was shot earlier. Now we are in the middle of the film, where they are clearly trying to rip Morpheus off The Matrix, although he does just a terrible job. The actor talking about Star Wars and cookie-making phrases about luck is almost unbearable. Now, at the end of the film, you donâ€™t understand that this is the end of the film, because you actually think that the plot is finally evolving. The character "Morpheus" dies, ONLY a good thing in the film. He says a few words and the credits roll. What is it? There was no conspiracy, a bad game, a crappy one, it could not be worse. Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT LOOK THIS MOVIE!
