The shaky manual camera was used, apparently, to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to experience motion sickness only from viewing it. It looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding a camera (no offense intended for people suffering from CP, but I don’t think you expect to get a lot of work as a filmmaker!) The camera’s work was so disgusting and so distracting that my my wife and I thought he was inaccessible for observation and refused him after 10 minutes of torture. I checked a little later (it was shown on TV), and it did not get any better. I advise you to try it if you do not need to get rid of bad sushi that you may have eaten!
