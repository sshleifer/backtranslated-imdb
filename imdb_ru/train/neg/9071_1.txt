Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronne) were cheating in college. When creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) reveals their secret, he blackmails them, helping him to beat the beautiful, good-hearted student Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> A stupid and incompetent “comedy” - a lot more moaning causing laughter. The film is trying to attract its target audience with its disgusting jokes - but DOES NOT WORK. Moreover, he is full of useless, unattractive characters - and the character of Schwartzman is so disgusting that he is disgusting. The film even tries to use sex sweat / 50s / 60s actress Mami Van Doren in the most outrageous movie scene. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> Predictability and waste (once again) of the talent of veteran comedian Joe Flaherty make it even more predictable - when does this guy stop accepting each of his roles and doing something? <br /> <br /> In general, the only thing I liked was James (aka Jaime) King, who was very attractive and deserved the best. <br /> <br /> This is no more than one in ten from me.
