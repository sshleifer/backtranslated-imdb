I was lucky to read a book before watching a movie. It was the epic of youth, the dream of summer, a big potential indie film or a drama with a big budget. It somehow fell into the hands of a cracker who apparently took notes while watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without actually learning anything. The script loses the meaning of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and weak jokes. I feel sorry for the actors, as the characters in the book were rich and textured, but narrowed down to embarrassing characters in the film. Mason Gamble is great when he is given such an opportunity, like Dylan Baker, but the skeleton remaining from the story plays out as a bad after school special. Poor people = good, rich people = bad. <br /> <br /> Although almost worth a look at the beach in Southern California, where Gary Sinise parks his trailer, which is designed for the Gulf in Delaware. <br /> <br /> This is a good book, but an awkward twist for the first director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
