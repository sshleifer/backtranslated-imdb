I found it to be a waste of time, effort, and money. I know that Disney always shows a lack of creativity when making films "right on video", but rethinking the plot of the original film with "new perspective" is a record low ... soon they will simply re-release original films with new animation and new songs and call this is the "new version of the film that we all love." Nathan Lane unexpectedly returns to his role as Timon. Timon and Pumba, animated animals from the world of the original “The Lion King,” set off on a narrative journey to tell us the original story of how it REALLY happened ... how they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Timon is now the hero of this story, Yadda Yadda Yadda, blah blah blah ... <br /> <br /> Musical episodes are lame, and animation is shit. Vocal talents are impressive for the video, but again, when was the last time you remembered how Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane were in something of a real commercial being? In general, if you like the original, you will hate it. This is offensive because it is unfair to children and adults. And this is about summation.
