In order to call a movie about a chrome ghost revenge for serious chrome and lifeless would be too ironic, but this is here an undeniably unremarkable combination of Gaslight (1939 and 1944) through The Devil (1954); although it is watchable in itself, it is so clich√© that it causes irritation, but not a marked chill. Nevertheless, due to the difficult situation in which the British film industry was in the late 1970s, even such a mediocre scenario like this one was able to attract 10 star names - Cliff Robertson (as a cunning husband), Jean Simmons (in the lead role), Jenny Agutter (as the artist's half-sister Robertson), Simon Ward (as the mysterious chauffeur), Ron Moody (as the ill-fated doctor), Michael Jauston (as the business partner of Robertson), Judy Gizon (as Simmons') and Johnston's best friend) Flora Robson (as housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as the notary reads Olu Simmons) and, most surprisingly, Jack Warner (as a sculptor tombstones) - although most of them do not really have anything to do, I'm sorry to say!
