This is such a film that is so terrible that you can’t stop watching it, because you keep telling yourself that “it cannot be so shitty until the very end. It just can't. You know, “worse than Jaws 4” is something bad. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I only saw ONE film that was worse than this, and then we talk about how you are. ” I went to hell for lying or watching football. <br /> <br /> Gore? Indeed much of it. Well done blood? In no case. <br /> <br /> The game is bad, and all the lines are lousy cliches. The same applies to the storyline, which in fact consists only of sex, blood and violence, like many other horror films. <br /> <br /> If you hope for a combination between Ichi the Killer and August Underground ?? keep looking you won't find it in the live feed.
