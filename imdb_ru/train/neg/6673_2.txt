My first clue about how bad it would be was when the video clip said it was from people who brought us the Blair Witches project, which was a masterpiece compared to this piece of garbage. The action was at the level of Oklahoma's 6th grade, and the plot, such as it was, was predictable, boring and stupid. 85% of the script are four-letter words and countless variations on them. Mother F seems to be the favorite of the "writer" because she is used constantly. It must have taken all 10 minutes to write this script in some last run. Thank God, I rented it and could jump most of it on fast-forward. Do not waste your time or money with this.
