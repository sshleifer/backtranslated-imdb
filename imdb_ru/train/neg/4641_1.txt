I sometimes like really lousy movies ... those that sometimes cause people (even talented people) get together with good intentions to make a movie and for some reason it turns out to be a disaster. Such films as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Plan 9 from Space, Manos-Hands of Fate, Gate of Heaven, etc. <br /> <br /> So, when I heard that this The movie "Attic Rachel", according to many, was the worst movie of the decade, of course, I just have to watch it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I'm sorry about this decision. This film is beyond the limits of the bad ... it's so bad that it's not even as pleasant as a regular bad movie. Actions, filming, script, etc., are even worse than a low budget porn movie: the sound is absolutely terrible, the “plot” is completely incomprehensible, the “acting” is ridiculous .... this is a waste of all this time and money. At the very least, a porn movie has a porn break the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple, and a tea party. <br /> <br "Mad Hatter" /> Illumination is nonexistent .. Many scenes take place in the floor or in complete darkness, which is probably also good. "Writer-director" (I use the terms loosely), David Tibor, tries to pervert in the scenes of bondage ... but the results would be laughable if they were not so pitiful. There is some nudity, but it is of such terrible quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant. I could live forever and not pay tribute to all the shortcomings and shortcomings of this truly terrible waste of the film. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, avoid this train wreck. I know that, despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of garbage is really as bad as I say it is ... but trust me in this ... it is even worse than what I said, and you absolutely certainly will regret it (and about the costs if you spend the money to buy or rent).
