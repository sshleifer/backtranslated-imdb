Well, TiVo recorded it because of Angelina Jolie. It was 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. It quickly went down. <br /> <br /> A lot of replays even from Angelina. She is about 20 years old and she plays 16 years. There are three characters that must be Italian. All other Italians are Americans. I thought the native Italian accents were good. According to my wife, the young man is very handsome. All the others in this movie are fat Italian. Even men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was thrown as an abnormal doctor, it was a bad sign. Two couples stalking their children are like four Italian puppets. <br /> <br /> My wife did not let go of the remote. I hope she did not take makeup, did not dress and did not decorate the tips. It was a sick and distorted combination of disgusting and harsh. It was indecent. <br /> <br /> Cutting off my left ventricle was not enough to distract from the pain while watching this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, do yourself a favor and push your head through the TV screen. You will be glad you did. The only film I ever saw that was worse than this was Hamburger: Film. Or maybe "Deadly Friend."
