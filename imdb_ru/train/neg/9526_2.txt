In the distant past, when I shot a video for free, I picked up this one. Oops I would like to mention the following in addition to the summary already given. 1: Someone who was directly involved in making this film had a weird and sick eating hobby, it was rude and unnecessary. 2: There is a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there all the time, and judging by what I felt for several days after watching this garbage, I believe that something subconscious was happening on the track. Either this, or it was just terribly bad, or both. Many times throughout the film you can say that the screenwriter and director did not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask about the acting.
