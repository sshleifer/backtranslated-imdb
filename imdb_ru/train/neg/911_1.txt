It must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad script made it possible to become a film and be shown in cinemas quite recently, in 2006. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many visible sponsored products. in the same movie. This should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why so many famous actors even thought that the idea would even be visible in such a film. If I had some respect for some of the famous actors in this movie before I watched the movie, now itâ€™s definitely gone. <br /> <br /> I heard that a movie will be added to this, and I cannot understand how this is possible at all.
