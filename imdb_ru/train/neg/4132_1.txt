The peculiarity of the cinema of the beginning of the 21st century allows us to set various evil creatures and bad guys against each other. We have not seen anything like this since Godzillaâ€™s time against King Kong and the like. It always sounds great on paper when you curl up, and in a haze of good things you have an inspiring idea, and you see how it all sounds before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then you come to write it. Great ideas, like all vampires, are feminine. Ergo is hot, seductively lethal, but in a sense I want to die. And all the zombies are men. Well, how do men treat a woman immediately after being abandoned or deceived, right? So everything looks good before actually doing it. Then the rot begins to come. Mosterov have a fight. Nothing special happens. Another fight. Philosophical noodles and cod frown. Eureka, we found how to win. Again a big fight and end. Sounds great, right? If this was done by an independent company, it would be great. But this is Hollywood with an emphasis on money: gloss instead of what the fans want. All this could be soaked with beauty.
