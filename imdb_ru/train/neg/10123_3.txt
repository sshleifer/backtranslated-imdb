I believe that when scientists and Hitchcock experts come together, it’s not about the great films of the Master, such as North to the Northwest or Strangers in a Train, but about a less well-known effort like this in 1931 that is unclear and serious. disadvantage. which demonstrates the great director in a fledgling form. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle class London couple looking to be ahead. He is jealous of their participation; she accepts it. The changes come in the form of a letter from the uncle, which says that he will set them up so that they can enjoy a luxurious life. They make plans for a world cruise. But their problems have just begun. <br /> <br /> Ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill or Marion Crane. Well, Marion is currently unwell, but you understand. Journey and Hitchcock go together, like moths and candlelight, at best setting them on a dangerous journey. This is perhaps the earliest Hitchcock raid on this topic, and not the most successful or memorable. Hitchcock is trying to mix comedy with another element, in this case it’s rather a home drama than an expectation, but they are not co-ordinated, at least here. <br /> <br /> Hills are a boring, flat pair, without chemistry or personality. When they find themselves in Folies Bergère, in the form of end-to-end shooting with shots that look ten years older than the rest of this film, they are embarrassed by the costumes of the performers. "The curtain rose too soon!" gasps Emily. "They are not dressed." <br /> <br /> When the Hills break away from each other on an ocean cruise, it seems that mercy kills more than a tragic thing, even if the people with whom they cooperate are drops, too. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont) wears pictures of how he sits next to the empty chairs that he offers to fill with Emily. The girl Fred's "Princess" (Betty Amann) has Clara Bow's eyes and the five-hour shadow of Wallace Beery. There is also an unpleasant fellow traveler, a furry maiden that Hitchcock always presents with the cartoon sound of a horn. Subtlety is still to come. <br /> <br /> Everything is very harsh, with confusing blocking and intense dialogue. Hitchcock is trying to find some early comedy with Fred and his umbrella, which is not removed, and Kendall seems to be eager for laughter, and Berry for tears. When Fred and Emily fall silent, they are noticed when they are pushed onto a rivet in the form of a wedge, one of many clumsy attempts at symbolism. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only dimly sympathetic character, partly because she really doesn’t care about her husband and is tormented by her love affair with Gordon, but mainly because she is one of Hitchcock’s first magnetic blondes , her platinum curls encircle her face, like Botticelli, on the open deck of a Chinese junk near the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> The questions end in a dangerous situation, which should be decisive for the main characters, and presumably restore their relationship. Only they are not active participants in the resolution, and, apart from the fate of a friendly cat, nothing in the final resonates. <br /> <br /> At least in the early 1930s, you have a beautiful view of London, and the chance to see Hitchcock while he was still working on food. “Rich and Strange” is what Hitchcock pays his fees and learns his profession, one for scholars, but not casual film lovers.
