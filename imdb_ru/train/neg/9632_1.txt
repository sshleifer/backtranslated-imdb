I have a horrible videotape "Boom!" With pan and scan, and I want to see it in all its widescreen magnificence. So I voted "1" and hope you do too. Together we can pull this film into the pit of cinematic dross and hope that someone will see an opportunity for BIG MONEY to release “Boom!” in his directorial extended version. This film is one of my howling favorites - you just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and you say to yourself: “Yes, I think you can fool some people for a long time. Producers are considering the release of the DVD "Boom!" It should be noted that wherever it was shown, there were massive sales in cinemas. But this is not to icing.
