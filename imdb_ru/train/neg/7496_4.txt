It is difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred of this film. But I will try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was abusive, sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were rampant, and stereotypes were out of the norm, if not insulted the Italians-Americans. <br /> I'm not saying that the game was terrible, because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito and others. I did well. But ... almost every character in the movie despised me. Since the days of "The Fire of Vanity" I have not loved every character on the screen.
