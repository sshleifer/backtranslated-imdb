This is not a good movie. The acting is unusually tough and unconvincing. It looks like the film does not know whether it is truly horrified or on the path of camp and kitsch. I have never seen the first film, but this one does not stand on its own dignity, there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer never realizes the importance of the main female vampire. Not worth the effort to watch
