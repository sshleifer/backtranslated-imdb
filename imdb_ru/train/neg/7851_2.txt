As stated countless times, “The Hills Have Eyes 2” is NOT a remake (as a rule, not counted) of the continuation of the mid-80s to the original 1977 Wes Craven. But, wanting to give the postmodern sequel to the remake the official press of "Waning Returns," Craven himself (double threat with his son Jonathan) decided to write a film of the same quality - in plain English, what a horror. Former music video director Martin Weiss takes the reins from Alexander Aji and is clearly above his head - and yet one wonders how someone could create a watchable movie from Cravens’s screen by writing 101 scribbles. Not only are the characters (in this case, a gang of men from the National Guard who send to explore the turbulent hills of the original remake) are absolutely disgusting and prone to really annoying genre traps (played without irony, notice), but they are constantly joking that they are not ridiculous. After seeing their complete inability during the exercises, their fate against the disgusting, wandering cannibals is painfully obvious. Only this time - as in the original sequel of the 80s - the script is so simplified (in fact it barely exists) that any potential subtext is rejected in favor of a rate increase in repulsive shocks (we turn to combined childbirth - murder during opening credits plus gratuitous rape for those who did not extract the DVD from the middle!). Even the mutants in this walk - crazy faceless figures - tasteless, naughty, rubber-looking makeup FX, like the entire movie, tries to hide its face from embarrassment. I really moaned at the unsatisfactory “surprise” at the end of Aji’s excellent film, and the producers literally went bankrupt at the end of Hills 2, setting the stage — VERY affectionately setting the stage — by a third installment ... but Cravens and Weiss created a film that is so cynical, that made the 1977/2006 version work, that it would be difficult for them to find an audience after this insulting slap.
