The standard fare for monsters with "coloring by numbers", filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from films about big creatures. It was as if someone had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other films written on them that were jumbled and taken apart. Whatever subject lines and characters appear in this transaction, they were then added to the script. <br /> <br /> Characters are so awesome that you can play the game “Guess Who Will be the Monstrous Food” in less than ten minutes in the film, and probably get all the rights - including the order that they will devour. Many characters are so disgusting that you support the creature to shut them up. The main characters include a clone of Billy Idol who surfs with sharks, a talker boy who flashes bankrolls, Captain Ahab's boyfriend with a vendetta and girlfriend Ahab who performs dirty dancing in a bar. Oh, and a big, big beast that needs therapy to fight anger. <br /> <br /> On the way, people argue a lot, cute girls run around with wet T-shirts, couples sort out on exotic beaches, explosions appear the ruins of the temple, and pirates with a fat face rush past. <br /> <br /> Funny, for the most part, but one thing worried me: the heartlessness of the characters when other people were being killed. After one violent death, they joke in one line. I almost heard rim shots. <br /> <br /> In general, it's good if you have 90 minutes to waste, and you want to make fun of the movie “so bad, it's good.” Otherwise, you can skip this one.
