Being a director myself and possessing a bit of a dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I would have fun when I took “My mistakes ...” home (not that there was nothing on the cover of the DVD, instead choosing an ambiguous quote from the director polemicist, Chris Morris, "short film, including scenes"). I should know better, and avoid this tasteless (and often offensive) piece of nastiness. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church is disgusting (especially because we are too familiar with Morris’s perverted attitude to pedophilia from his notorious Brass Eye series and serves no other purpose than to shock. I’m never going to be called a comedy. <br /> <br /> A runner’s comment sounds like a fundamentally new idea (being the runner itself is often an interesting and unobstructed perspective on the filmmaking process), but unfortunately this is not the case. Instead we appeal to one public Kolnik, who speaks about dogs on film, before coming to the conclusion that there are actually no good films involving dogs. It's all very interesting, but not a single shot of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Say that this film is not going anywhere would be an understatement. It relies too much on its sophisticated style through plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely agitated and dissatisfied. His overly simplistic message that a person should be held accountable for his actions, is like idnym and poorly illustrated. <br /> <br /> The film does have moments of pseudo-Kafka surrealism, but ultimately it cannot convince, entertain, enlighten, and annoy. If you want to see a really great short film, I highly recommend Franz Kafka “It's a Beautiful Life” by Peter Capaldi.
