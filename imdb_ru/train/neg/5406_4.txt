My first opinions about this film were, of course, bad. I expected a terrible, stupid action, bad entertainment, a funny movie with special effects. What I got was not really that bad. The special effects were absolutely terrible, but I found the film itself quite interesting, and the script was actually quite good and decent. Acting was NOT ONLY bad, and on the whole I had fun watching this movie. It's still a pretty bad movie, but it's not completely useless, as I thought it would be and I am pleased to know that this movie managed to hit me even when it was not so good. In general, this film should be avoided, but for me it was not as bad as I expected to be.
