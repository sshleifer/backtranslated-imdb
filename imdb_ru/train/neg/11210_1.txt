I read the story of John Everingham many years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking what a wonderful film it would be. And it probably would have been if Michael Landon had not fallen into the hands. As I understand it, Landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license was too high, which is similar to his carnage from the Little House book series. The acting, due to the lack of a better word, is terrible, the script is sloppy, and there are more close-ups of Landon’s pussy than it should be. <br /> <br /> This film reflects the history of Everingham as well as “Little House on the Prairie” reflects the books on which it is “based.” This is just another car to boast Landon's horrible hair.
