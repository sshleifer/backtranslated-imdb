<br /> <br /> I saw it on a science fiction channel. This happened immediately after the first. For some reason this movie interested me. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was stupid how this guy got involved in making the film. In the first film, he had a “reason” to kill people, but in this continuation half of the killings / attempted killings was mostly without a reason. Stanley killed the director because of creative differences, he captured the co-author because of creative differences, but what was the attempt to kill the actors? No actors, no movie. Did he want it to "look real when they died"? If it was supposed to be a movie with such a big budget, use special effects, MAN. Of course, as in the first case, the captive girl runs away, and Stanley eventually gets confused and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This film had potential. And the saddest thing of all ... the really sad part ... I would look at "Lake 3 Hut". Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he is the only good part about this sequel.
