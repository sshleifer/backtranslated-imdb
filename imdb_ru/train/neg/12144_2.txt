Although nothing can compare with Vampires Vs. Zombies ... in any field of filmmaking, I will try to judge this film. <br /> <br /> First of all, the special effects were exciting. When there was an explosion on the TV screen, I thought that my whole house would explode, and when they fired from machine guns, I thought that the shells were falling to the floor right next to me. Just stunned my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene when the sound of Jack Black gives the worst monologue I’ve ever heard almost killed himself, but don’t worry, as the film burns it, which he can pass on to his terrible play "I have to be tall." Seriously, he must have watched him chatting mindlessly about incongruent thoughts that have absolutely no meaning, and just adds that he must be “high” to justify his terrible behavior. Well, if you can say that you are sorry for the terrible acting game, then if you talked to writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you will probably get the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called “Shock-o-rama” I was shocked, I didn’t put a cut-off shotgun in my mouth and committed suicide after this terrible horror movie was played. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this film, then you must be killed <br /> <br /> Regards, <br /> <br /> General
