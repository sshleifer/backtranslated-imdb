Wow, I can not believe that people consider this film "good." Now I have seen much worse, but with John Cusack much more romantic / funny comedies. <br /> <br /> At best, this is a mediocre movie. While acting was not terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that could not be detected or hesitant. Unfortunately, the main characters appear as cowards. They do not know themselves well enough to understand that they do not like the people with whom they are engaged. How do we know that they are not in love? Due to the complete lack of remorse of conscience, both characters leave their finances. I can think of a few things more romantic than the constant escape from the commitments that these two demonstrate. <br /> <br /> The film does not even end with the wedding scene, it is more than likely that both will freeze and throw each other like hot potatoes when the commitment draws near. This film is really about two people who can’t do anything, unlike previous Cusack characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.) ). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this film was the complete absence of any twists or something interesting. When the film ended, I felt that they could not include the climax in the plot, which generally corresponds to the whole film: boring. There is no doubt that these two will be together, there is no joy when they do this, there are no consequences for their actions. <br /> <br /> Sadly, people are so blind to the scandalousness of this film, that any criticism of “Everything is too cynical!” is simply reproached. The criticism of this film is not cynicism, but an objective examination. There are many other best romantic comedies, even with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this film is great, try these films and your hearts will explode: “Princess Bride”, “Say something”, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Saving Faith, Charade , Rear Window, North to the Northwest, or Something is in Mary (which is a good study of an idealized novel against modern society).
