This film does not really encourage children to be kinder and better to treat them, as it should be in a family film, and in any case it is not considered a family, because there are some things in it that children should not see. Not the best ABC family movie if you ask me. If the film had less sexual themes, then perhaps it would be better. Hollywood does nothing to make the film better by adding in sexual situations. There really is no reason for them. At least it's a television movie. I would not want to spend money on this garbage, renting it. If you have other things besides watching this movie, go to them.
