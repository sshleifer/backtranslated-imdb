Before watching this movie, I expected a fictional drama based on ideas from the book; instead, it is a book interrupted by dramatic scenes illustrating various “diseases”. It didn't bother me much, but it prevented me from enjoying the film. One story, or even two or three long stories with excerpts from a book interspersed into a film, would be preferable, in my opinion. If you are going to base the film on a psychological text, you need to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this. The film is shot in episodes where it is a little more than a 19th century sexual psychology encyclopedia video, and would be completely unbearable if it were not sexual in nature (because “sex = interesting” for most of us, even for me). Fortunately, there are several stories with actual character development that attract us. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, theories of Krafft-Ebing’s sexuality for the most part have not been questioned. I hoped that he would use stories to show how imperfect his archaic views on psychology, which are still preserved by many. <br /> <br /> So, what do you have? Detailed catalog of several fetishes and orientations, with some slightly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of several “sexual deviants” before they are healed. For most of the film, the film moves at a creeping speed (and mood) of the track. And, as is obviously a low-budget film, cinematography and acting is not quite the highest level. Although I * was * pleased with the music, costume and interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt that the theme of this film was right in my alley, and I still feel that this movie is below average. It deserves 3/10; 4/10 if I felt extremely generous. I can not imagine that someone would like it, if they were not interested in sexual fetishism.
