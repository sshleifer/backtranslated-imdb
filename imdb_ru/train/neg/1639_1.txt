“Whipped” - 82 minutes. This review is 82 words. The three disliked New York Loraria, the ruthless "cheater", ended up courting the same woman played by Amanda Peet with disastrous results. This refers to the story and film. "Whipped", too sophisticated to be misogynical, sluggish and ridiculous, blends the philosophy of shock of Jock Tom Likis with fantasies from the Penthouse letter. Although technically skilled, it is outdated, annoying, poorly written, sneaky and obvious. People don't behave like that. People don't say that. Indeed.
