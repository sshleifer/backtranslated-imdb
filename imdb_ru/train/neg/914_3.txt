(Review in English, as Swedish is not allowed). <br /> <br /> I saw this film with very low expectations, and, unfortunately, I can tell you that the film barely met them. <br /> <br /> No matter how much I wanted to see Jeanne “Loffe” Carlsson again on the big screen, the writers should have understood early in the process of writing the script that the seven people falling into the water are not original and not funny. The story is very thin, and the jokes are used and predictable, and those that are not, are just boring. I smiled three times throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Placing Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny, and not just loud advertising; "Findus made it possible!" <br /> <br /> Göta Kanal 2 does not need to be watched in a cinema or on a DVD, just wait until it goes on the air on TV, it will not take long.
