This film has a very simple, but very bad plot. The whole film is about a girl who is being pulled through the gate into another dimension, and after years the witch again opens it, while a group of friends (including the main actor who is having trouble killing her ex-girlfriend who is one of the campers with your new partner ... another girl ... surely they are lesbians, and, of course, there is some nude for no particular reason). Unfortunately, the demon follows the now grown-up girl. Also, unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. Where exactly were they? Where did the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell educated her and made her gladiator-like clothes? The game is terrible, I think, but it's hard to say, because the writing is so bad, maybe they just could not do anything about it. I give him three, because the wrestler was pretty good, and the effects were pretty funny, although they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be funny.
