As Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that everyone could easily enjoy, I never saw the reason for the remake. Not to mention the remake, made with people, the cartoon was quite perfect, what is the purpose of this film? But Jim Carrey, too, seemed a little strange Grinch. I mean, he's a great comedian, but is he like a Grinch? It just doesn't make any sense to me. His performance was a bit excessive and inadvertently ridiculous. Not to mention that some of the added dialogs were a bit childish and not very pleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was finished and not needed. In fact, they simply destroyed the story. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Watville is preparing for his best Christmas season, where everything has to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is interested and worried about the Grinch who lives above them, and that he will not get the same good Christmas as the one who loves. He kicks her out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year, and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show who his version of Christmas is. But he soon realizes that someone may know that this is a little more than what is the materialized version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> How the Grinch stole Christmas was not necessary, and that was too much. I really recommend sticking to the cartoon just because itâ€™s a rather disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The compilation and presentation of the entire film was a bit finished, not to mention how Grinch stole Christmas! it was more meant to be like a cartoon, not a starring version with Jim Carrey. But at least this version makes you thankful for the version of Boris Karloff that is played every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
