Two old buddies are sent to Japan to get the results of a genetic study containing a videotape that was stolen by a ninja in a black suit at the beginning of the film. First, they just need to learn ninja skills, because "only a ninja can beat a ninja." <br /> <br /> Sakura killers try their best to be pleasant, but fail. The whole film is so empty and predictable that it is difficult to say something good about it: the same plot was seen in different variations dozens of times earlier, the characters are drawn too briefly, the direction is boring, and the script does not offer anything surprising, even in the final scene which in itself reduces the value of the film (garbage). <br /> <br /> Even a fan of the ninja of the 80s, who understands the aesthetics of garbage films, it’s hard to find this film, even hardly pleasant, He just doesn’t offer anything new to the viewer, either at the visual level or in the plot. Shurikens are thrown, and the katanas are swinging, but this is not enough to lead the film in the direction in which it was, and to repeat similar fighting scenes, stunning even the most callused viewer after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to recommend a movie for everyone. Even the awkward performance of Franco Nero in the movie Enter the Ninja lags behind the American ninja killer Sakura. Even at the film’s visual level, there are no balls, and it’s a waste of time to try to find great battle scenes in this movie: they aren’t there. All in all, one of the most useless ninja films I've ever seen. Not even interested in curiosity. Believe me of it. <br /> <br /> ½ of 10.
