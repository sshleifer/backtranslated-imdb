I wanted to see a comedy with a satirical storyline (as this film was advertised), but this film terribly failed me. For me, the plot was a bit confusing, and I quickly lost interest. I'm very sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for participating in this film. I will remain a fan of them, but only time can heal my feelings about it. The only thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played the role of Yonica so well that I did not even recognize Hillary; It took me a few scenes to understand what it is. Fortunately, I rented it for $ 1 through the Red Box; if I paid to see it on the big screen, I would really boil !!
