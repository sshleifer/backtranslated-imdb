As an inspirational director, this film was fun to watch with criticism. Filmed with a low-quality digital camera, probably with a 35mm DOF adapter. Editing is decent, decent, sound effects are not too good. I would give 7 for an indie film, but the story is not so interesting. This is more about drama, character development, than horror. <br /> <br /> This is not for those who want to be scared, scared, quarrel or sit with popcorn, just to enjoy. <br /> <To be honest, this film would be good if we were still in the 50s. <br /> <br /> This film is about a family with a dry field, and thatâ€™s it.
