Of all the films (and I'm a graduate of the film, if it costs you something), this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I know that there may be worse, which I have not yet seen, but I have seen it, and this is the worst. Once my friend and I shot it because there was Denise Richards on the cover. Talk about being young and backward. She is not credited! Her role was incredibly small! How did she do it on the cover? IMDb doesn't even list it in its filmography. This film was so bad that we wrote a little note in the video store, when we returned it, and put it in its case. He read something like: “Please, save your future clients from having to watch this complete and completely bad movie!”
