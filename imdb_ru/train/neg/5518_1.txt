I have not seen this, and do not plan to watch this film or any other film that Lindsay has in it, unless and until the “poor little rich girl” fixes her life for a 2-year period, starting from her very recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> <br /> Actually, I don’t know anyone who watched ANY latest Lindsay movies. I rather imagine that 2007 will be the highest point in her film career until she clarifies the situation. All recent publicity has only prevented her film making career if she has any further ambitions to make more films. <br /> <br /> Until this point, film producers were actively looking for Lindsay for roles in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to audition and actually fight for ANY role. Her reputation is currently "poisoned", and it is possible that this could have a negative impact on ticket sales at the box office for any film in which she participates. <br /> <br /> Sooooo .... now Lindsay will have to deal with "not wanted" ..... can she handle this? <br /> <br /> I wonder if Jay Leno would even like to bring Lindsay back to his TV show? <br /> <br /> All of the above is just my OPINION. I have no inside information.
