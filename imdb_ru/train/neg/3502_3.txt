Sarah Silverman is truly the "flavor of the month" comic right now. Is she really worth the whole hype? Yes and no. At times she is funny, sometimes funny (she has a rather interesting routine, although not always funny). In other cases, the media feel cheated for exaggerating another artist. She is one of those really cute comedians, in which men especially flock, saying that they dig her intellect and wit. But if you drive them into a corner, most men admit that they just want to sleep with her, and so they watch her. She reminds me of why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Jeanine Garofalo, although none of them is really “hot” now in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least, cigarettes), so she must be hot when she is 60 so her fans (especially men) can rejoice. <br /> <br /> As for this show, she really likes her comedy. When it works, it's fun. When it is not, it is full of tiresome and very, very boring. The episode with AIDS is the best here. It's always funny, and it has a really good satire. Brian Poesh's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's very fun to see him in a T-shirt with an inscription. But they never go anywhere with it, and it will eventually wear out his greeting. Sarah’s character on the series is pretty annoying, it seems that the gay couple (Brian Poshn and some other boys) are passionate about and actually do nothing for the show as a whole, as well as supporting players (including Sarah’s real sister, Laura, who isn’t her) everything is fine. When jokes sound, they are great. When they do not, they are terrible, and I mean really terrible. There is also an obsession with coprophilia (jokes about jokes), which seems to have replaced real wit and intelligence in comedy today. So is it worth watching this show? If you are in love with Sarah, do it. You can look at her and pretend that she is yours. As for her show, it ranges from good to absolute zero.
