When the guys from Kino Video put together their beautiful collection of Slapstick Encyclopedia, a multi-cassette collection of silent comedies, someone decided to start the first release with ONE TOO MANY (1916), an obscure one-drum farce in Florida, starring very young Oliver Hardy Anyway, this decision was unsuccessful, because ONE TOO MANY is a very bad film, which almost does not allow the viewer to look further. Like any typical farce, this includes deception, inspired by greed, panic, when plans fall apart, and complications that escalate to the point of absurdity, but unlike good ones, ONE TOO MANY is incoherent, unfunny and completely annoying. At the moment it is difficult to say whether the hopelessly entangled plot is the result of missed footage or inept filmmaking, but regardless of the reason, halfway through, even the most wary viewer has no idea what a character relationship is or what happens and by the end it doesn't bother anyone. <br /> <br /> The only interesting moment is to see Hardy’s 24-year-old “baby”, who looks much harder than a decade later, when he teamed up with Stan Lorel, but, nevertheless, full of youthful energy. At the opening of the scene, waking up with a hangover, the baby performs a very sporty roll back from the bed. Believe me, it's as fun as this movie. If you read this before you saw the first Slapstick Encyclopedia of Cinema cassette, I suggest you go back and look at the good stuff.
