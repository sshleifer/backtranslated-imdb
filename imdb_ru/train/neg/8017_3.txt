I haven't finished the movie yet. You can say that in this case I have no right to revise it, especially negatively. But I do it only because I stopped it because I could no longer look ... I went halfway, and I only achieved this by promising myself that something good would be about to happen. This film is so tiring, so dim, that I was really insulted. I didn’t read many other reviews, so I’m not sure if there are other homosexual teenagers who suffered from it, but I’m a homosexual, and I went through "similar" revelations, day dreams, problems, etc. D. And so on And so on. Perhaps there were two moments when I really felt that this film could go somewhere, where I felt that there might be some kind of suspicion of meaning or relativity in it, but these hopes collapsed at that moment when the next set of cliche-narrative narration appeared. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you cannot hear clumsy reproduction, and the echo-hey will not disappear if you just read the quotes, because they are too painful / ridiculous / stupid to skip them. I gave the film three stars, and all these three stars went to the filmmaker, who did a fantastic job trying to turn Archer's weary “concepts” into something watchable. Keep in mind, I pray that he will not be the one who decided to include all the long shots of television close-ups ... another unnecessary cliché already finished in films like Gammo Korin ... I think this is quite it is appropriate that the premiere of this film at Sundance (only because Archer had connections at the festival through volunteer work, which he did, by the way ...), because Sundance seems to be the only festival where the cliché of heavy chatter, as it is, it is still adopted as an "arthouse". No, this is not an art house, I'm afraid this is just an ordinary house **. Do not look.
