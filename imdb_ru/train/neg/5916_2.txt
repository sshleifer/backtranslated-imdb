The painfully slow pace of this film was probably the director’s clear intention to convey what life was like when he grew up in a village in China. Nevertheless, I found a combination of an icy slow “plot” and a general style of filming so impersonal that it completely repelled him, especially for the western audience. At times, it was really difficult for me to distinguish some of the characters, since they were shot from such a distance. Two hours later, and I was completely carefree. As a person who is not only interested in music, but also keen on the history and culture of China (and, by the way, is no stranger to Chinese cinema), I couldn’t study any characters and did not find anything that could help me, This begs if I would not like it, who on earth would like it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This pathetic effort simply does not match. I would be sorry to see that Chinese cinema is rated by this indicator.
