I probably don't give anything good to this film because I couldn't watch it all. Perhaps if I saw it in the theater, in its original presentation, I would appreciate it, but it is too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read a book about 25 years ago, and the plot details disappeared from memory. This did not help the film, as there is nothing alive and clear in the presentation of events. <br /> <br /> This is really a four film or four-part film, and I suppose it was intended to be seen for four nights in a theatrical performance. I found Part I pleasant enough, but that was all I could do to get through Part II, which stretches endlessly. Reading the philosophy of Tolstoy is one thing. If you get a good translation or can read it in the original, his brilliant composition far outweighs any problems that may arise with the pace of the story. On the film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with parts of the film that I have seen. This is very stunning, with a lot of hei-mei-look-on-this camera work that draws attention to itself, rather than serving to advance the story. <br /> <br /> I’m obviously missing something, but I just couldn’t arouse the enthusiasm to launch Parts III and IV.
