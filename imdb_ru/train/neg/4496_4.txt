This film is a terrible celebration of bad games and bad scenery, as well as tasteless lines and an unconvincing plot. But it is so fun to watch. It's all fun. The main plot - a group of scientists from the future, traveling back in time to catch his evil employee who intends to destroy them all. They catch up with him in 1146. The “futuristic” laboratory of 2033 scientists is an eighties-style room with a bunch of “futuristic” flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a canopy for a lawn. The actors hand out their roles with imprudent aplomb, which is easy to understand, considering that these lines are usually stunning: “I checked everything twice!” He checked everything twice twice? Did he check it four times? And not only that, but they give you the whole premise of the film in the first five minutes, and continue at a fast pace of fire until they reach the medieval section. When Roger Korman ran out of money. And I had to stop traveling in time and, therefore, in different sets. The medieval complex is a comic blending of anything from the end of the 10th to the 16th century. Any costume they could find they used. I think the chain mail wasn’t in the budget because all the guys wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor. Battle scenes are ridiculous when men casually throw at cardboard swords and throw deadly blows without a single blow. It sounds really terrible, but I enjoy it every time I look. Lines alone are enough to make you fit, and everything else rallied to create a stunning B-film, which, if you are a connoisseur of banal attacks, I would advise you to watch. And as soon as you do, read the review of Unknown Movies. I like to hear them point to all the funny, really terrible moments in the film.
