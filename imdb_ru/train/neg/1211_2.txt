The only redeeming qualities of this film are rather original scenes of death. In addition, this film is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger, a besieged housewife, slowly wandering around the local mall during the first 30 minutes. a movie that added nothing. Then the film is livened up a bit, as it has a confrontation with 4 punks who took 2 parking spaces on this busy Christmas night. They start harassing her after they fired the local guard who tried to help her. From there, this movie gets worse and worse. I know that this is only a film, and you have to go with the flow, but it has about 5 minutes. Warden, and she can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, she travels to a half-built unit near the forest. As usual, she does her best so her followers can easily track her. But now it turns into one hard mof. You get the point. Under no circumstances buy or rent this film, no matter how much you like this type. It is so illogical that you will question every scene. It is a shame for Basinger and Craig Schaeffer and other actors, as well as consumers.
