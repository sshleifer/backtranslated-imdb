This film starts slowly and then narrows. After seeing about an hour and seeing that nothing was happening, I went out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip Nada There is no history. Characters are vague ideas about the most boring people we know. The producers of this film can be held accountable in court if they try to sell it as a “movie”. There is no movement. I could tell the same “story” with a couple of still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any screenwriter doctor in the world could save him. My biggest regret is not that I spent 60 minutes of my life watching the movie “Love during Money”, but because I missed a great opportunity to become a leader. I could go out first, but I waited too long. Instead, I watched as about 20 people came out in front of me.
