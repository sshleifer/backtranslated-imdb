When I first saw this film, I quickly noticed an actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York portrays Lucy absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was a terrific comedian with incredible talent. Thinking about a legend like Lucille Ball, who is portrayed as she was in the film, is terrible. I can not believe of all the actresses in the world who could play much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She may be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. It's hard to find someone who could be like Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in appearance and talent. If you notice how York portrays Lucy in episodes of “I Love Lucy,” such as a chocolate factory or Vitavetavegamin, nothing seems like anything, nor her expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> To top it off, Danny Pino plays Desi Arnaz awful. Pinot does not claim to be Ricky. He is small and thin, his accent is unreal, and, again, his game is incredible. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> Overall, a terrible cast, and the story is poorly told. If people want to understand the real situation with Lucille Ball, I suggest looking at the biography of Lucy and Desi in A & E, reading the book of Lucille Ball herself or “American PBS Masters: In Search of Lucy”. If you want to see the documentation, then "Before the laugh" will be the best choice. Casting Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in the movie “Before the Laughter” is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown, not nothing.
