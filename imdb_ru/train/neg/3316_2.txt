It was the first film by Ewan McGregor that I’ve ever seen outside of Star Wars. Since then, I've become a very big fan of Evan McGregor, but I still can't bring myself to forgive the existence of this film. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a big fan of Jane Austen, and therefore I was subjected to various classics, Emma, ​​being one of them. I always thought they were annoying, stupid and boring. However, after seeing this terrible performance, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was amazing and charming. Ewan McGregor hardly serves the purpose in this film after they hacked and disfigured the role of Frank Churchill. Gwenet Paltrow is a ridiculous character, and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone who is remotely interested in the drama of the English period ... go see the originals. If you are a fan of Ewan McGregor ... believe me, having missed this film, you did not miss anything, except for a five-minute team in a silly hat and bad haircut.
