First viewing 05/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (director Michael Almereida): A strange story about a Druid witch who is trying to capture eternity, inheriting the body of her granddaughter. At least I think it was a relationship. In the film there is a kind of creepy quality, similar to Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that in the performance of Nicholson was hostility, which is not in this film. All this is taken very seriously until the very end, when some losers and attempts to raise their spirits do not work at all. The performances here are not a problem, but a story. It seems that things are not going very smoothly, and the viewer is left with a lot of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. Christopher Walken as his granddaughterâ€™s uncle is a very small one-time performance, which, of course, gives him maximum bills in an attempt to sell the film. Do not buy into this trick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
