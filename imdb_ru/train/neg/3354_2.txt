In my opinion, when you decide to make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give him a new point of view. Now the 1963 story of Robert Wise about Shirley Jackson's wonderful novel “Ghost Hill House” is worth accepting even today. Now let's fast forward to 1999 and redo it. I was left shaking my head and asking why? The action is wooden, the story is unrecognizable, and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with so many special effects that computers can generate. I heard that this update was bad; but could not believe that it was so bad considering the source material. I was wrong. After seeing this and telling my wife how awful it was, she said; "Well, they got your money!" She's right, don't let them get yours. If there is no benefit in creating lousy rework, maybe they will stop doing them or move to a higher standard that does not offend their audience.
