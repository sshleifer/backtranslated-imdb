I'm an actor, a producer, a director, and I'm going to tell the facts. This project was the worst film in filmmaking history. From producer to director, and editing this so-called movie is a joke, and I mean a BIG joke. Why did Blockbuster release such crap? I take my work very seriously, and this film insults my profession. Did the director try to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I saw bad Zombie movies, but it took Coffey's cake and everything on this damn table. This movie sucks !!! I really do not want to talk bad about other directors, because I myself, but please consider taking up another profession. I respect the fact that you finished the movie, but I have to ask you: “WHERE'S SMOKING”, I mean the makeup of your girls, scary zombies, what you thought. For the whole nation, if I could vote for Zero, I would get it. The worst movie in the movie makes history !!!
