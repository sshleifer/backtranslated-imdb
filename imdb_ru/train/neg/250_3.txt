After watching three other versions of the same film, I am afraid that this is the weakest film, primarily because of Scottâ€™s rather dull and lead performance. His emotions are so soft that it is difficult for them to participate in the film. Alistam Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was in his vile state, you do not understand what Scott talks about with great persuasiveness, and when he undergoes a metamorphosis, he is also unconvincing. I can not remember a single actor in this film, which would correspond to that of the version of Alistair Sim. Even the musical version (and, frankly, the dolls) is better executed. Very disappointing.
