I came out of 6 films in my entire life. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I don't know how I sat in an hour of this. I must have been in a coma that night. I saw it in the theater when it came out 8 years ago. I could not even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller had appeared in it. It must have really influenced me to waste my time commenting on it today. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
