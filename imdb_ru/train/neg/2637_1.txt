Seriously, I don't even know where to start. It looks like someone gave a budget of billions of dollars to autistic third-grade students and said, “Make me a film about the secret service.” Editing is funny, cinematography was random at best, every syllable of dialogue was completely slow, and the direction was ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was so meaningless, and limping, and meaningless ... and accidentally ... and limping. <br /> <br /> Here you have SPOILER; this film is the stupidest thing you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> However, if you liked this piece, you will also like it; Containment, dark blue and partial frontal lobotomy.
