Released on DVD in the UK as Ax, The Choke is a teen slasher who fails in almost all departments: the story is almost non-existent, the result is a film that mainly consists of people roaming the dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are obviously destined to be survivors in the film), everyone is completely unwelcome, which means that the viewer does not care if he is killed; deaths are not bloody enough (if a brief shot of a pound of chopped beef covered with fake blood does not turn your stomach); and a gratuitous sex scene with almost no nudes (an unforgivable mistake that can be made in a short film!). <br /> <br /> Thin story sees how members of a punk band are locked inside what seems to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they are selected by an invisible enemy. With a small budget, the production figures are in order, and all the actors seem to be quite capable actors, but with almost complete genuine fright, unwillingness to become really dirty (this is a slasher, so where is the graphic splash?) completely dead, but soon enough drummer) and inappropriate use of sloppy video technician in an attempt to add some style, the film quickly becomes extremely boring.
