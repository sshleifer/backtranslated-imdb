“Zombie Rising” proves that if the same director modernizes and redesigns the idea, it will not necessarily lead to a lightning strike twice. <br /> <br /> The Halperin Brothers, responsible for the White Zombie horror classics, made this trite piece of trash just a few years later to capitalize on its popularity and even reworked close-ups of Lugosi’s eyes from this previous film. There was a lawsuit with the copyright holders of the White Zombie film, who did not want Halperins to use the word zombies in this title. This word was the only thing that could help this film, because, as everyone knows, bad movies can make much more money just by appearing in the title of the word “Zombies.” Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years ago only makes this uninteresting film more offensive. It seems he never made another horror film after this debacle. The zombies here do not seem to be the real walking dead, but simply victims of hypnosis. <br /> <br /> Want to create an army of zombies, controlled by the mind? Be prepared to break several eggs, including your own. <br /> <br /> PLOTTED: A man falls in love with an intriguing woman who plays with his heart and engages him only to make him a friend whom she loves jealous. It sends a person into a spiral of madness, in which he tries to use the methods of mind control of a zombie to change things in his favor, trying to conquer a woman who does not care. <br /> <br /> This includes one of the most obvious plot events I've ever seen. You must be blind or stupid to see no end. The game is not even good. Because of this movie, “the king of zombies” (which appeared on the same DVD with double bills), which I feel racially, compared to him looks like an atmospheric masterpiece of horror, reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic. This makes the atomic age science fiction festival with the zombie cheese “The Invisible Invaders” look like serious drama. This is one big piece of cheese, so ridiculously melodramatic that it can cause many Korean movie fans (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). Credits list an ironically named company Favorite Films. I'm not sure whose favorite movie is, but obviously he is an idiot. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for fans: zombies, romantic or classic films.
