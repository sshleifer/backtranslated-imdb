If it could be rated 0, it would. From the terrible wooden acting skills to the dull, dense pace, children's exploitation angle and sophomoristic pseudo-Lesbian titration, added solely for the sake of sad viewers, this is a disaster of the film. <br /> <br /> predictably, since from the very beginning they are absolutely sure what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will begin. From a boring, extraordinary beginning to a miserable and dull finale, every single presence in this film is lost, and every meager piece of talent dug up for this turkey is wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something as ruthlessly dull with a lot of the same children's shows, watch one of the Ilse films. At least, they do not regret in advance what they are trying to do. How terribly bad it has ever been possible to rate higher than 5 is the miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious purposes. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not so interesting, and, above all, it does not excite in any sense of the word. In my opinion, this is a crime; it was a crime when such a terribly offensive and incompetent piece of garbage was ever thought of, and resources were provided for its occurrence, and an even more tragedy that some horribly misinformed viewers still protect. <br /> <br /> Even the cheerful personality and the jokes of Elvira could not soften the blow caused by this terrible parody of the film. Avoid this at all costs.
