Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first full-length film with Stooges, and it's pretty bad. This makes the THREE FREQUENCIES THAT RIDE WORLDWIDE IN STUNNING (since 1963), it looks like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Stooges - cleaners in rocket space. They get into a rocket, and she goes to Venus. There they meet some things, including the speaking unicorn, whom they call “Uni”, which they bring with them to Earth. “Uni” speaks like an ordinary pleasant person - “Oh, hello. How are you? Beautiful planet here. I hope, you like it. Happy. <br /> <br /> Very few jokes and so many scenes just goes on and on. <br /> <br /> The Stooges are returning from space, and the film ends as long as the Story goes, but no one said that for filmmakers the picture lasts another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing special happens. The Stooges leave the party, and then the film is almost over. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the end where the Stooges sing a beautiful little song about their journey. Larry and Curly Joe hit Mo in the face with two cakes. Brutal. <br /> <br /> Another writer mentioned an excellent musical score. BUT? The only music that I even noticed was two classic melodies - “I will take a novel” and “Again and again”, both of which are performed at a party. And * it * really is the culmination of the picture - the music from the old films of Colombia. <br /> <br /> High sexy blonde was good. <br /> <br /> Awful - new VHS video from Shop 99 cents only.
