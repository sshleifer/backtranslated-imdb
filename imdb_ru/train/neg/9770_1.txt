This is the version that even the author hated because it is so cool. They gave him a “happy ending” and changed many of the dialogues, and this is just a big pile of saccharin. The stage manager is pretty good, I suppose he created the role, but everyone else gets into that 40s acting style that really just poses. One great feature is music. This is one of the best results ever recorded, and you should look for it in a record store. Overall, I think the 1989 version of Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller is much better.
