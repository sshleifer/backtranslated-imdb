Gayniggers from outer space - it is a short foreign film about black gay men, aliens, who explore the galaxy, until you stumble upon the earth. Being gay, their goal is to have a universe only for men, in which all people are gay. Therefore, when they discover that women or "female beings" live on Earth, they are at first frightened; in the end, they decide to destroy all women on the planet and liberate the male population. <br /> <br /> An abusive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist plot line, although probably conceived as a satire, gives this film some shock value. However, there is little substance under it. As noted by another reviewer, in addition to the names of the characters there are a few jokes (for example, ArmInAss); It seems I was laughing at one little funny joke. I think I quickly understood the meaning of the film, the satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had enough; I continued to want the movie to end (and this is a short movie!). Not brilliantly or especially well written.
