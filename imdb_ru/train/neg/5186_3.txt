RKS films have always been commercial films that came up to the 90s from GHAYAL, DAMINI. <br /> <br /> His last few KHAKEE films were watchable. FAMILY was shit. <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent movie, but it could be better <br /> <br /> The problem is that there are a lot of old-fashioned cliches in it, and many of the scenes are too dirty and long. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan's character is very well shown, but his character becomes heroic, which can be subtle <br /> <br /> Long-lasting memories can be avoided, as tandas are just extended <br /> <br / > Even the street game in the second half looks too simplistic and is hardly a solution to the problem. The message is well communicated. <br /> <br /> The direction from RKS is not bad, although it could be better. The music is fine. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks very good in his role and calmly plays his role. mainly, although sometimes he looks at ease in bright scenes, he is excellent in drama, Vidya is excellent in media scene. Pankaj has not quite a definite role and is too dirty. In his unit, he surpasses Darshan Jariwal, the villain of old age, with the rest everything is in order.
