Since the 70s, writer / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction, science fiction and horror films. Some of these are excellent examples of how to use a tiny budget for maximum effect; many of them are pretty bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> In the Terminator story about time travel and actions, the Trancers saw Tim Thomrson playing Jack Det, the future police officer tasked with tracking down the bad guy. Whistler, who travels to the past, inhabiting the ancestor's body. Whistler is able to control other people with his psychic abilities, turning them into obedient zombies (“trances” in the title), and trying to change the course of history by killing the ancestors of the future leaders. Jack follows him until 1985, deciding to stop him. <br /> <br /> In this continuation of 1991, Jack still lives in 1985. After killing Whistler, he calmed down and married Lina (Helen Hunt), a young woman. who helped him succeed in the first movie. But, for Jack, things do not stay calm for a long time, and the problem appears in the form of Whistler’s brother, E.D. Vardo, who is trying to create an army of transamers. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment, considering how good the original was. The story is difficult to understand if you have not seen the first film (or, at least, not for long), and there are a lot of unimpressive actions and a few bad special effects. The ingenuity and wit that made Trancers so merry are gone; instead, we get some stupid one-liners and a script that seems to have been written on the fly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can recommend this movie to fans of the genre is the cast. which boasts many names that sci-fi and horror movies followers will know: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martina Beswick. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have a “day off” during the filming of Trancers II, and the performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series obviously has fans; Since then, four more sequels have been released. If the quality has not risen, I can not imagine that they were good.
