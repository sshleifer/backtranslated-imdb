I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were far from low enough. I honestly could not say what genre this film was from watching it, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. The plot did not exist, and the action was terrible. My friends and I managed to watch about 30-40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and immediately asked the video store to take it back. I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone, except when you intentionally try to watch the worst movies of all time. I honestly do not know how this film lasted more than one day in cinemas, and, moreover, I can not understand why someone would want to watch it, given not only its very uninteresting title, but also the absence or famous actors / actresses in its composition. This review is no joke, and I honestly think that this is possibly the worst movie ever made. This is definitely the worst movie I've ever watched.
