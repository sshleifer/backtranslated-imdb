I do not know what the other review was talking about. This is definitely not a bimbo film, in fact, I don't think there was any decent girl in it. No, it's just a stupid, poorly made, sci-fi slok in the style of Ed Wood. And that's bad. I can't even begin to tell you how bad it is. I saw it late at night by cable, and I was shocked. The fact that this film has ever been released is an insult to all of us. The actors were either producer friends or mentally retarded, special effects were a joke, and the pace was insanely slow. For me, however, music is paramount. A monkey could write a better theme using a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on cable, see it. You will be amazed at how bad a movie can be.
