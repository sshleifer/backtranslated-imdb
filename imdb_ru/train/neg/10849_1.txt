Usually, when I go on a raid from a local Hollywood video, I head for B-Horror films. For me, the basic principles of the movie “Horrors” are the cost of the camp, “Heavy blood”, “Lots of unnecessary nudity” and special effects that everyone can put together with a package of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I was a fan of the band since they released their first demo in 1995. The film began on an interesting note, and then, when I saw the tramp of Dani Filt on an extremely obvious latex mask, I LAUGHED. When I saw a lesbian sex scene for a lesbian sex scene, I laughed even harder. I spent almost the entire movie laughing, and when I didn’t laugh, I shook my head, thinking about how a rock star with multi-million prices would want to make a movie that seems to cost a few hundred dollars on a budget. It seemed to me that the whole point of this film attracted "children of hardcore goth who think that death, destruction, sex, blood and Satan are the greatest things invented since the time of the Lava Lamps". It was really so. This film seemed to me at 80.5% of what happened in this film, happened just for the sake of satanic. This film had a lot of potential, and it really could have been a very good film, but in the end this “Film” is actually just an extended Cradle of Filth video. ,
