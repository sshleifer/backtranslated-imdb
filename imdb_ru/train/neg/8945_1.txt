I have to admit that there are several books with relevant films that I actually read before I saw the cinematic adaptation. Nineteen eighty-four happens to be one of those rare occurrences. The book was great. It was exciting and interesting prophetic. But the film just sucks. This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I didnâ€™t turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half the time of the two-part assignment for the class. It was dark and grotesque, but did nothing on the way to creating the proper atmosphere. Acting was nothing above average, and, given that there was nothing to play, it was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not create the impression that Winston could not blurt out more than one syllable at a time. A boring, disturbing and visually unappealing film completely destroyed the book. Wait a second ... Isn't it British?
