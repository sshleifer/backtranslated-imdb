The film is just bad. Just awful. A number of bad Bollywood movies have no end! They must not have enough excuses for making such horrible films (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mostly with directors. There are 2 good actors in this film who have proven in the past that they have the ability to show great performances ... but they were shot so badly. Bad script didn't help either. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of funny moments in this movie and very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first big concert, Ajay Devgan meets Om Puri (from whom he fled about 30 years ago and talked to him again), and all that Om Puri wants to say is to beware of his friendship with Salman !!! What nonsense. Seriously. Not to mention the baaad soundtrack. Whatever happens to Shankar Esan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is completely inappropriate to portray a rock star. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace - good performances in the second half. Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. Like Salman as a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Watch this can only be for the past half hour.
