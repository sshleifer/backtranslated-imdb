There is a great reason Edison went straight to the video: it would end up in cinemas with a crash. The film lasted too long and was terribly boring. Just a step up short (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had free time two weeks before their next films), the bad guys are as ridiculous and almost do not exist like the actor Justin Timberlake. I hate knocking on a guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not so bad ... just mostly. I like the fact that LL Cool J got what looks like a leader role. He deserved it. And, unlike his fellow musician and colleague in the film, he can act. Kevin Spacey is also almost always nice (you can see him swallow several times as he chews landscapes), and Freeman has the opportunity to raise this film to three stars (out of ten ... he is NOT good). /> <br /> When all is said and done, the final mistake in this film is that it is an ordinary and tedious piece of pseudo-action, which cannot fall asleep. It also can't make anybody give a shit about any of the characters. In general, it's just boring. That being said, rent it when you suffer from insomnia.
