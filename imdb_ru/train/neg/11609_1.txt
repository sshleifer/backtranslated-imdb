I am not from America, and I know what “exchange of wives” is. When the show with this title came out, I was excited to see some cool glamorous sexy moments from the program. But what I got was real stupid nonsense. I was incorrectly rated by name, it does not contain adult content, nudity, even vulgar dialogues (Hallmark threw a widespread channel, and I think they edited / deactivated such content to make it neat). <br /> <br /> A show that gives an idea of ​​the current American / Western family state, full of plump people, polluted teens and their sucking family events. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more precisely) were chosen to live in each other’s house and changed each other’s family routine in accordance with the new rule. Sometimes it turns out well or more evenly bad. In the final section, each mother returns with her husband and tries to conclude what they have done with each family in recent days. This is a settling part of the program, in which each opponent is fighting for their rights. I was shocked to see it all, instead of seeing some cool sex material for adults. I mean, who makes this program, more than the one who gave the name "Exchange of wives"; better to be called a "swap." In general, it spoils all the great things for which there is a real exchange of wives! <br /> <br /> Wife swap = average sucking reality.
