It was not only the most expensive Canadian film ever filmed in British Columbia, but also the worst ever to see the light. The director is not even a Canadian, but a Brit, and the boy shows it. We are all created in order to be a bunch of overly sexy perverts and morons. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and that is why we must finance this cot. Of course, the British character is normal. Everything else is a sitcom stereotype. Can you say “Norm !!”? Cinematography ranges from cute postcard images to darker interior silhouettes. Actors always seem worried. Are they just as bored as the viewer, or is this a film director's idea? Avoid this mess and watch some Bruce McDonalds films. A real Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. You will not be forced to go to HIS movies in 10 minutes.
