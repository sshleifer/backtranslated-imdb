This film looked promising, but in fact it was pretty bad. The package was OK, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried their best with limited material, but they could not rise above the average vigor of this sticky student film. Jason Schwartzman was again very annoying - even more than in Rushmore, the other actors were completely indifferent. The scenes that were supposed to be fun turned out to be discouraging and incredibly young. Tries to be Road Trip / American Pie, but fails at all levels. A total waste of time for everyone.
