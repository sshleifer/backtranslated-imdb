How this movie was made with so many big stars is beyond my power. This is a terrible clich√©, a movie that starred the worst actors, any of these actors. It really surprises me that many of these stars on list A would agree to this unfunny movie. Even worse, there are almost 100 million made here in the states. However, this shows that big stars can pull money, even if the movie is terrible. I felt sorry for all those who participated in this snore fest. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he was given, and the rest of the stars seemed to be moving. Whatever you do, don't give in to the great cast, because no one could save it.
