Wow, this film sucks. I heard that this film expresses the meaning of friendship very well. And with all the hype on the Internet about this film, I realized that it could go wrong? However, the film was just bad. It was boring, and character development was never there. “Space Travelers” was also a terrible movie, and if you didn’t like this movie, you won’t like it.
