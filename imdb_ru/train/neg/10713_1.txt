Come on, come on for real. The Knights of Christ, the Ordo Temple, or the Templars, as they are called, did not even exist until the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so funny that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked bored. And besides, if you want to have a templar in real life, why not just use the Knights of Christ that still exist in Portugal. At the very least, they had to take history into account. The only redeeming quality I could find in this film was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to withstand medieval or Gothic works. The action was bad, horrible storyline, terrible actions, and the props were fine.
