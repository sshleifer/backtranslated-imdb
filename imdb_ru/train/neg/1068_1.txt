My wife and I just finished this film, and I came to IMDb to thank the reviewers who found this film less than satisfactory. However, out of 10 pages of reviews, only a few are negative. I feel that this film is a great concept that has become terribly erroneous, and I want to warn those who want to watch the movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit that I like to write reviews more when I don’t like the film more than when I do, so my bunch of reviews are all negative. However, this does not mean that I tend to not enjoy the film, but I often find more eloquent reviews of films that I really like. <br /> <br /> “Paris je t'aime” - the most pretentious film I’m watching ”was seen in years. Using the “smart” concept and attracting several great talents to the WAY to many stories, the film becomes the worst of all worlds. This is art for the sake of art, but this is what a 2-year-old can come up with and implement. Providing the director of free management for 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in the field of entertainment. Directors can not write, writers can not lead. (I would also like to add that Clint Eastwood is overvalued, but this is because he is an actor director (who also rarely works)). <br /> <br /> What ends up on the screen is a distorted mess of short stories that have no meaning, are not completed in 5 minutes and in the end spoil Paris for me. Why call it Paris je t'aime if the more appropriate name is the f * ck cluster? There are only a couple of stories that can be seen, especially this work of Alfonso Cuarona, but everything else will fall into obscurity. The short version of the Coen brothers is passable, but can you name their film, in which there is no scene with a choice guitar? As if all the directors decided to do what they wanted, and chose Paris as the place for it. Since we all love Paris, including the current company, we are blinded by the fact that this film sucks. Actually, I think they wrote the names of the directors on each of the shorts, because the directors saw how bad the film is and decided to make sure that they were only accused for 5 minutes. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress. She is not an elf dream girl expecting to be yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Do you play or just perform at concerts from other films? I look at you, Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (City of Sins) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Grace). <br /> <br /> One last comment about acting: I give double Kudos to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more humane than ever, or perhaps ever again. Find his short film on YouTube, as his 5 minutes is very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult, and only a few authors have understood this correctly. I mean Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, and these are just a few of them. It is much more difficult than writing a complete novel, and only a truly talented person can do it. The same can be said about short films. It seems that only one director will live in the annals of history. <br /> <br /> If you are upholding Paris as a gem that will be discovered and reflected in your own lenses with your own story, then do not expect to enjoy this film at all. The directors either didn't care or were lazy. In any case, when you read this, it means that you rented it. Praise that you did not pay 10 dollars for a head in cinemas for this.
