The obnoxious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day, when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her from a truck and kills her. Then she tries to destroy the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with her new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her. <br /> <br /> Obvious non-original film will not be bad in a cliché, except the character of Longoria is hateful and unpleasant, because it sucks all the fun from the film. This is how to brush your ears with sandpaper. To be honest, Longoria, or anyone else in the cast or crew, is not a problem, it’s a terrible scenario that sank the process. This is really very stupid.
