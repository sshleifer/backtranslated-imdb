Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can't stand Ben Stiller anymore. The way this person is allowed to make films is beyond my power. I can not understand how this happens, if I work the way he plays in the film, they will dismiss me and I will be the owner of the company ... I will have to fire myself. THE GOD! This film was a simple, steaming, smelly pile of POO that needs to be evaporated, if possible. Something else I have to say, the guiding principle of the 10 lines of text in the comment is idiotic. What is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will need a short novel written when a brief comment is sometimes needed.
