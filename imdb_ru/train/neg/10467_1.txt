If ever there was a call to make a bad film, reflecting how stupid humanity can become, this one would win a prize. The plot is centered around biblical prophecies, which are enclosed in hidden messages of the Holy Scriptures that encourage a group of power-seeking goons to try to fully control the world. How stupid does this author think that people really are? <br /> <br /> The game was bad at best. Casper Van Dien spent his talent on making this film. The work of Michael York was an honest part for the role, as he was the center of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was disgusting and very disturbing. No gentle or immature minds should see this film. Here's how the plot of good and evil can go astray. <br /> <br /> There should be a lot of mental illness in cinema circles that are looking for ways to market this type of garbage. Something must have been censored to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
