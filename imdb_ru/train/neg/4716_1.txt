This show is boring, unconvincing and basically breaks all sorts of things to make it "original." First of all: the animation is so ugly ... Johnny is disgusting ... and everyone is annoying. The twins look like Dexter's teenage girls from Dexter's Lab, and Johnny is almost like the smarter male Dee (also from Dexter's Lab). Secondly: plots ... painfully lame, which is why they are difficult to follow. The jokes are commonplace, and nothing makes me feel a little laughing ... especially when it tries to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but they turned me off alone. <br /> <br /> Third: the whole thematic song starts with picking up a melody from “The American Idiot” Green Day. And, although I am not a big fan of this group, I find it really stupid that they take the same melody of discovery, and then change it slightly to make it their own. <br /> <br /> Case to the point ... this is a big fat ugly bore. 1/10
