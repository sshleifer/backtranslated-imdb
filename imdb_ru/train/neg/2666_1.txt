Honestly, if someone has brains, then there is not one positive thing to say about this film. <br /> <br /> I lost 1 dollar by renting it. I would rather laugh at Will Smith, who said, "If you had a dream, you should protect it." <br /> <br /> All the actors must have been bored or not famous at the time. even Matthew McConahey * whatever you say * was better than all the actors in this movie when he played a psycho in a Texas chainsaw 4. If you watch this movie and want to say something good, your IQ must be very low With such a bad taste in the movie it hurts. Thank you ... And TRUE, already said! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from suffering. <br /> <br /> Get Devil Deviations, now it's a classic.
