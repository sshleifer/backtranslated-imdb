I still can not believe how bad this film is. If I were not a masochist, I do not know if I would survive while watching. It seems that it cost about $ 1,000, but not the money brought them down. The game was terrible - not just bad, students in the 3rd grade could better read the lines. Secondly, the only other reason for watching this kind of film is the skin, which is very lacking in this film. We do not even see more attractive chic in the amateur style. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, good luck next time, eh?
