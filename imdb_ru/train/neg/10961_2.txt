Although the film could have been “truthful” with respect to the Lewis book (in the sense that the script was mostly verbatim), he could not reflect any greatness that would otherwise be associated with an epic story similar to this one. Mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) * are drawn in *, and, as in the previous review, the flight sequence on a green screen was very difficult to swallow. I almost laughed to death when I saw humanoid beavers with their gigantic hard costumes and teeth; I almost cried when I heard a wolf "howl" - a man in a gray fuzzy suit, mostly screaming as loud and girlish as possible. <br /> <br /> All actions are incredibly forced, especially about little Lucy Penvency ... I could endure so much indignation, despair, and grin my teeth for (as it seemed) fourteen hours of watching a movie. The actress who plays White Witch in her entire story seems to feel at home on stage, where a loud voice, open arms and a courageous desire for something Shakespeare would be more than desirable. <br /> <br /> The sets are claustrophobic, regardless of whether the scenes occur indoors or outdoors. Indoors, it’s as if the BBC could afford to spend only $ 100 to create a set, and therefore it’s very small, and all the characters get together all the time. The White Witch's Castle is a worn, rotting English castle in the countryside, filled with statues of foam plastic and poor lighting. When the children of Penvency roam the woods - in fact, * any * scene in the woods - it seems that they just roam in circles. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks decent in the film is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC probably blew up the film’s entire budget for creating a mechanical cat. He looks great when he stands still and before he starts talking, but as soon as he starts moving, you can't help but feel sorry for the poor man who has to be back in a lion costume. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you are an avid Narnia fan, you may want to see this version simply because it saves every word Lewis ever wrote - but Lewis, of course, was not a writer, and many from Dialogue seems cumbersome and awkward when on screen. During the scene in which the children are at the beavers and are preparing to run away from the wolves, incessant Mrs. Beaver: “Oh, just one more thing, dear, and then we will be ready to go,” simultaneous shouts, sighs and moans "NO, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE! " - the scene of comic relief, so irrelevant (they are supposed to LEAVE from imminent danger, without wondering whether to pack a sewing machine or not), distracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have. In fact, the entire film is replete with directing such as this. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new film with updated effects, impressive computer animation, wonderful time everywhere and the magnificent White Witch (which plays its role with all the subtle evils of a seasoned politician, unlike the screaming banshee), impresses everything about the magnificence and magnificence of the world of Narnia, without detracting from the slightest from the original vision of Lewis (I think). Lucy is much prettier (WITHOUT damn teeth, DAY!), Like beavers (and of realistic size), and the depraved BBC Edmund have nothing to do with divine, desperately thirsty, unsure, and dangerous — the Inferiority Complex Edmund, that goes to the new version of Disney. <br /> <br /> If you are not one of those who like to spend time on joking movies, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
