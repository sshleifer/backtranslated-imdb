This is one of those films that are more interesting to watch from an academic point of view than from an entertaining one. I make my grades based on how much I liked the film or I enjoyed it, so I give it 4. If I rated it as an academic film, it would get 10. <br /> <Made in a very interesting manner as a pseudo-silent film with elements of sound effect and reality. It is designed to transmit fragmented memory and fragmentation of the mind, and this is interesting in this regard. <br /> <br /> However, there are many disgusting elements in the film that I didnâ€™t find so interesting. They are basically just worried. It also has some very interesting images and some interesting concepts, but some of the character relationships (especially between mother and son) are rather disturbing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film will either please you or won't . <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you are looking for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
