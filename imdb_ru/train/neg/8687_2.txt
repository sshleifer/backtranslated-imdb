When the jokes against the bush get really light, a show like this one is better to make sure that there is something extra in it. When this is something extra - children's versions of politicians who joke about the future, which they do not yet have, it is simply nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are great, but Dick Cheney mumbles mostly. There is also Condoleezza Rice, who for some reason is in love with Bush, and Donald Rumsfeld, who really doesnâ€™t look like Donald Rumsfeld. Democratic characters rarely give their names, so it remains a mystery who can be someone other than Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. <br /> <br /> There are coherent stories in the episodes, but this is not enough to keep them from falling.
