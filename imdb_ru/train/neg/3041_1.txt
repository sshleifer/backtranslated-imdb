Yes, I rated this movie as one terrible star. However, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies from now on. This is really so bad, this is good. This is another production by C. Gordon Murray (read: it buys a really cheap / bad Mexican film, spends zero money on its duplication in English and releases it in a children's matinee in the mid-1960s.) As I am sure, some mood enhancers will make it even better. I'm not going to rephrase what many other reviewers have already said, a Christmas movie with Merlin, the devil, a mechanical deer and some of the most miserable childish actors I've ever seen, without exception. I plan to spend this on holidays with Kelsey's “Christmas Carol” song. Truly a holiday made in hell. Now, if I can only find “To All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)” on DVD, I will have a triple function that cannot be defeated. You should see this movie. It moves so slowly that I don’t want you to touch the fast forward button, especially in two dance programs! This thing smells like expensive blue cheese - I think you have to get past the stench to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad Amigos!
