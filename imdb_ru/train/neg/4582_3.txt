If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend $ 9 on a used textbook, not on this film. I'm a little concerned that the money spent is used to buy Kool-Aid for shipment to Guyana. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t think that the directors really understood something, but they seem to have tried to do a few: 1) Science can explain everything we do, that is, our life is determined; 2) Science cannot be used to explain everything we do, which means that we have free will; 3) Science is cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) the world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman - a difficult role to follow, and 7) here, put this little paper square in your mouth, and you will see really cool things.
