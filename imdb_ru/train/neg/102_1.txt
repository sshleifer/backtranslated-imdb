One day, my girlfriend brought the Chronicles of Zombies with us, so we joked. Little did we realize that the joke was on her for the fact that she paid 1 pound for it. While watching this film, I began to invent things that I would rather do than watch “The Zombie Chronicles”. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) Drinking bleach 2) Rub sand into eyes 3) Write a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Play a civil war in the USA 5) Tax declarations 6) Mathematics GCSE 7) Sex with an old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, who is also a sergeant. Did Ben Draper write this? The guy could not even dig a hole properly. The best thing he did was kick the door (the best part of the film). It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw White Noise: The Light. There have never been so many mistakes in a movie. My girlfriend left him here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> News only in: Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to commit suicide. Fact. <br /> <br /> DON'T LOOK
