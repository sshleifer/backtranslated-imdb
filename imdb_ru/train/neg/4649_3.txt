1957 (yes, this is the right date) directed by J. Arthur Runk with the participation of James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a terrific comedy, right? Oh, it's just terrible. This is a one-gag movie: watch people get shocked at the sight of a little alligator. Music is thrown, completely inappropriate and forgetful. Ginny Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. But what did she do in this movie? Diana Dors is also here, providing very bold images for use in previews. Her acting level is not bad, but she is in the film to give someone a laugh at. Well, you have to do something besides moan during this movie. The film is now being sold on VHS by people on e-Bay. Save yourself costs and time. Comedy without laughter. A musical without a catchy song or dance.
