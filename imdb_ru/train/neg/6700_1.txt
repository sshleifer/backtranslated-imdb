Is there a movement that is more intolerant and condemning than a movement to protect the environment? Joining a circus aspiring young socialist should seem as frightening as entering a real circus. Even if such people usually transfer their brains to Hollywood to address these important issues, Hollywood’s teachings can often seem fragmented and confused. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippie the art of environmentalism. <br /> <br /> Here you will learn the art of wagging a finger across the face, without losing the smirk of your brand. You will learn to ignore logic and science with the help of powerful arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you, marking it as the gateway to the planetary Armageddon. <br /> <br /> In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face, you will also learn how to brush off accusations that deviate from your path, no matter how hypocrite you are. You can use as much energy as Al Gore as long as people treat you as if you were Amish. <br /> <br /> The second season was even more rewarding because we were able to visit other Hollywood gods. Your names are holy, and the revision — that is, the judge — their way of life. NOTE. This is the only time when it is appropriate for a balancing judge to judge another, because it gives the victim the opportunity to buy all kinds of expensive and fashionable eco-toys so that they can wag a finger over other people's faces. <br /> <br /> What is Ed preparing for us in the third season? Maybe he will teach us to be judgmental while sleeping!
