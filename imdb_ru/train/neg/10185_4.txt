Back in 1967, a certain director had no idea about a galaxy, distant or close. He tried to finish a movie called “THX”, etc. This short reprinted story about a certain George I wish he had only an attraction to protect him. This is just a promotional promo for the director, actors, etc., etc. He has little intrinsic artistic value. This is a brochure. The leader playing George is very good, as is Leah’s character, and the hero of ersatz Darth. Everything else is ordinary commercial slag. What a waste. However, he did the work, I think. I think the rest of the film is just marking time to kill time. only brochure.
