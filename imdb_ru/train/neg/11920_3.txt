Oscar Wilde’s comedy about manners, perhaps the most witty piece ever written, is almost completely destroyed by second-class hands. Sanders, as one would expect, casually brilliantly plays the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole procedure a waste of time. Gene Crane is attempting a stage emphasis in alternative sentences, and other cast members seem to believe this is a melodrama, not a comedy; indeed, the entire production has flyleaves that reduce it to tragedy - undoubtedly, Hayes’s office insisted. Preminger's guide seems to be to make sure that there are a lot of servants around, and even the music seems banal. Adhere to the visually perfect silent farce in accordance with the instructions of Lubich or even the 2004 film adaptation with Helen Hunt in the role of Mrs. Erlin; or try to read a play for the pleasure of words. But skip this version.
