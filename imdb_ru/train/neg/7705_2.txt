(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I had to understand. The DVD did not even show the time or how much time had passed. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I've ever seen. This one is much worse. It makes no sense. Dropped the plot. Everything so that we can see oversized breasts on a figure that does not support them. <br /> <br /> This was supposed to be a student film. Musta received a rating C <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I found out that it will not end) the ending does not make sense <br /> <br /> Repeat: 0/10
