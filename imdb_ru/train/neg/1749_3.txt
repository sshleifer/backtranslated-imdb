I have to say that it was the worst film “Priyadarshan” (released together with much better Könki, which was also his directorial project), it does not contain a specific storyline and simply focuses on showing the body to debuting actresses and some silly comedy episodes. I think that prijadarshan is becoming too repetitive in his comedy films, as Govinda and David Dhavan did in the past, giving some good artists, and they also lost their audience. Therefore, it will be good for him to concentrate on the scenarios and try several options in his direction. Give us more weekly and Malamal weeklies, and not give us as garam masala!
