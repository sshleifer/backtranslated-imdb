I believe that Shakespeare explained that I just read beautifully. I think he (the lady) is protesting too much. It all sounded to me like the author was trying to convince himself! He posts non-normative literature (essays of the same time period, but not related to the Bible) several times, but I can recall at least three references to my head that give historical accuracy to the events contained in the Bible. Anyone can distort the data and prove everything they like, but it does not help. Changes in customs, definitions of words change over time (look at English and German, where this is obviously the common root), nothing remains the same, it always grows and changes. The Bible has many different translations, but I believe the King James version is the best when it comes to any research. In the King James version you will notice that some words are written in italics. These words have been added by translators and can be dropped, and the meaning of the entire verse changes. Letters from the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without numerical verses. These entries look like one long word, and the translators have added all of the above. For example, how would you read this: GOD, WHERE do you read it like God anywhere or do you read it like God here now? The same string of letters of two completely different meanings. That is why many biblical scholars use Lexicon to help them translate, because it provides a literal translation from the original Arabic, Greek, or Hebrew, depending on the language in which the Holy Scriptures were originally written. It is also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic, you can prove that God exists, but you cannot prove that He does not exist! In the end, I just adore listening to people who think they are so smart that they have the right to judge the all-powerful. Talk about ego! Removing soap box, God bless Maegi
