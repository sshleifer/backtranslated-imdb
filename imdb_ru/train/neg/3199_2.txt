Joe Don Baker. He was great at Walking Tall and had a good game at Goldeneye, but here at Final Justice, all hope was gone ... the dark side won. <br /> <br /> Like most people, my main experience with this was on MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's flesh and mix that click completely. Obviously, they were just starting with “Mitchell” on their strike against Joe Don, and here lies their continuation on the subject. <br /> <br /> This makes for a fun experience: there are many riffs of choice. My favorites are “John Rhys-Davies for sale”, “This is“ Meat wheel: Texas Ranger ””, “None of them are suitable for a sponge”, “Why she put her prom dress on in bed” "Son ..."? What? What was he like a son: a son of a HUMAN MAN? <br /> <br /> By itself, “Final Justice” is, as Joe Don says in the film, “big fat nada”. But here it does have some entertainment value. You get the chance, catch the THIS version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars of "Final Justice." Ten for ONLY MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don is in the city.
