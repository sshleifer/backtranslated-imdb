Well, I admit, it started very nicely and well, but then it just fell, I can't believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could even finish reading the script about 5 minutes after the film began, the only reason I actually sat out all this time. a movie in which I wanted to see a turn in NED, and to my surprise, well, guys, I can't even tell you if it was one, because the end just leaves you confused, and then the role of the loan, I was like on what the hell is it didn’t deserve a theatrical production, sorry, but that doesn’t mean that it was terrible, the only thing I gave him was 4, it’s because there were several nervous parts in it ... that's all! You can watch it, I'm not telling you not, hey, you might even like it or even love it! but if you hate it, do not say that I did not warn you!
