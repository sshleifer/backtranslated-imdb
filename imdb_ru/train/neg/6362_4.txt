I'm a big fan of Italian films of the seventies, and I would not hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bush among my favorite actresses of all time, so with some hope I got into this film. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely meaningless film that is not going anywhere. It is clear that no one will go for it, expecting much more, but the fact that it is meaningless becomes more annoying when you consider that it is also quite boring and none of the characters are interesting. As the name implies, the film is about the "rogue"; in this case, the one that steals, women, and smuggles. This is basically the whole plot of this movie. The film does have a “seventies style,” and the idea that all this is very carefree is clearly visible. Sometimes it seems that the directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to explain some point of view, although, whatever that may be, it is not very good. Watching Barbara Bush on the screen is always nice, and that's the point; she is definitely the best thing in the film, and the sequence in which she hangs out of the car naked is the best part of the film. In general, The Rogue is likely to have some appeal to people who love the style of the seventies, but, unfortunately, can offer nothing more.
