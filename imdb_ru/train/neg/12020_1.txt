It was such a waste of time. Danger. If you watch it, you will be tempted to rip your DVD from the wall and throw it through the window. <br /> <br /> Amateur production: terrible, repetitive, empty dialogue; thin paper storyline; wooden views; Lucy Lawless was miserably beaten. <br /> <br /> A seriously spoiled story, absolutely incredible characters. The two worst concepts in cinema and tv. are: (1) angry twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins here. <br /> <br /> “Twist” plot? Outrageously simplistic and obvious - how to look at a train going on rails in the middle of the day on the prairies. It does not even solve properly. Evil is not punished for the original offense. <br /> <br /> Please, please, please — don’t watch this, even if it’s free and your only choice is to go to the synagogue.
