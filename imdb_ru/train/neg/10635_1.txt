There is a remark that one of the heroines was raped by "drunken violence" by Russian soldiers, which is completely untrue. This film should not be shown just because of this. <br /> <br /> Also, someone claims that the KGB is prosecuting “Jews, Gypsies, etc.”, which is “worse than the Nazis.” The KGB was looking for so-called "Zionist" agents who were (according to the KGB) imperialist agents. This is completely different from targeting Jews in general, as the Nazis did. Gypsies are never pursued. The KGB was a political tool and was used politically, but from an international point of view. Communists really do not distinguish nationality. <br /> <br /> The whole movie stinks like a fake. The main character does not speak Russian, signs in Berlin contain typos, the KGB general looks completely fake. Some so-called “Russian proverbs” have been completely compiled, and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Watch not recommended - this film is full of lies and fake things. Instead, go to the Good Shepherd.
