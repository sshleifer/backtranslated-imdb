I can't believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid science fiction fan. I read countless science fiction novels and enjoyed many science fiction films and TV shows. I really wouldn't even consider this real fiction. Each episode I reviewed looked like an unconvincing, diluted version of the Star Trek episode, with the exception of everything that could make it interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> This is basically a group of people standing around in an ARMY uniform, talking about something boring, who sometimes passes through the Stargate and enters a planet that looks like Earth, with people who look and sound just like people! It seemed a very low budget. All the characters of the forgotten one-dimensional cutouts, and numerous attempts at humor have failed. It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete trying to be funny, but it’s not. This is just sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was terrible too. You can do so much with the portal in space, but every place where ARMY people go is boring! It shows a lack of imagination! I actually thought that the series “Alien Nation” a few years ago (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. This show had good storylines and decent characters. I was not thrilled with “Alien Nation”, but compared to this overrated shit, it was great! <br /> <br /> In addition, unlike the new gorgeous Battlestar Galactica series, Stargate copied the look and feel. lame movie too crowded! They should have at least updated the special flush toilet effect every time someone passes the Stargate.
