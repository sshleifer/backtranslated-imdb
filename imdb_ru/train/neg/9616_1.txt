First, I had my doubts, I just looked at the DVD box and read it, saying that itâ€™s about a bunch of teenagers who are gathering by the lake, where they will find something to do or something like that. Any film having such a premise failed miserably, even as a slasher, with the exception of the first Friday of the 13th. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I just kept thinking that it should get a little better. This is not true. I usually think that in every film there is something that you can learn from it. There is nothing in it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find something constructive for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself a piece of paper or eat dirt.
