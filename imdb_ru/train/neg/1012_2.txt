How can there be so many corrupt cops that none of them slip away? With enough cops to wage a mini-war that includes weapons such as flamethrowers, you might think that they would be caught before anyone writing for the weekly coupon newspaper heard someone say “Thank you” to a corrupt cop. <br /> <br /> You will never return your 90th minutes ago. Life is too precious to make this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because of the famous actors who made a mistake when making this film. <br /> <br /> If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to make this movie. He has a very important role, so fans might like to see him. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the majority of his fans are young girls who can be turned off by the violence in this film.
