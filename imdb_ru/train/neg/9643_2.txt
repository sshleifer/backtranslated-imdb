Below the average movie with bad music, given the movie based on music ??? The usual script and direction with blunders. Salman Khan was in his usual game. Ajay’s work deteriorated over time, as his appearance, especially his style as rock stars, was pitiful. Asin was only an exhibit. In general, I felt like I was spending money on a movie. Salman Khan remains immature, like 10 years ago, compared to Aamir Khan. There were a lot of boring songs in the film, except for "Man Ko Ati". The most important song that impressed the British music sponsor was the most impressive. “Khanabadosh” can be easily understood by the English music sponsor. Another film I saw last week was Wake Up Sid, which was a simple slow love story with good leadership and play, despite the average music
