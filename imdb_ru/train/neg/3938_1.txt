Even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could not save this dead fish from the movie. To begin with, the script was definitely written to be turned into a B-film, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star car to lift itself out of television) and Hutton (looking for “two” from “one or two blows”) he hoped to identify his career after "Ordinary People") began to become attached to the picture. Cheesy lines, big bad wipes from the stage to the scene (well, who uses napkins after the 12th class of telecommunications?), And the old, bad acting film sank this movie. Even Duchovny is not immune from the bad actor's plague, which is this film. Only Timothy Hutton generally rises above the material. I have to admit that Duchovny felt the pain when he read offscreen words. Although I laughed when I was sure that the director wanted me to feel the horror, nothing prepared me for the final phrase of the voice-over of Douchonwy: “If you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911.” If only the studio called 911, this dog from the movie would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
