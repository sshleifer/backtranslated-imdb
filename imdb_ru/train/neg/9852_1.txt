The Discovery Channel / Animal Planet should be ashamed of itself. This fantasy is modeled on the series Walking With Dinosaurs. Although this is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing fantasy dragons with T-Rexes and the extinction of dinosaurs. Added to the show on the educational channel instead of, say, Sci-Fi, it gives the impression of the actual authenticity of this show. <br /> <br /> The show itself is about 7.5 / 10 in terms of entertainment. But the way it is presented, I have to give him 1/10. Don't get me wrong, I have no problems with fantasies, but they are so erroneous. I really see small children and slow adults who believe that they have found a dragon and that it is real. <br /> <br /> I also think it weakens the great series Walking with Dinosaurs, because now you have to see it. thinking about how much fantasy costs in this mini-series.
