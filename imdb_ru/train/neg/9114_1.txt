Because "cruel" would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you even start? I want to start with the terrible game of almost everyone in this film. Erase it. Almost does not apply to this proposal. I can not remember a single character, which is well portrayed. Although, frankly, it would be almost impossible to portray these zero-dimensional characters in a successful way. However, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I deliberately didnâ€™t mention - I pretend she doesn't exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only a darkened guy who played Sebastian. The story was horrible to God. He tried to reflect the brilliance that was first, but failed in many ways. Virtually every part of it was meaningless - although I (reluctantly) admit that the plot was pretty good, and that was his surprise. And the final was a little humorous. But this film is there with the worst I've seen. Do not look. Just do not. There is absolutely no value in viewing it. No one. It only takes away the pleasure from the first.
