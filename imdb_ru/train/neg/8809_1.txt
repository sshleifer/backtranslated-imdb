A group of women who can not act, sitting idle, talking, smoking weed. They have another woman in a wheelchair that they hide because she is deformed, and sometimes they kill someone to feed this person with human flesh, which really looks like some ham in the store, which they put on, sticking to several plastic fingers. We do not see how they are killing someone, suddenly a body appears on the floor, covered with a bloody sheet. Because of this, I can no longer eat spam with a cover sheet. Just thinking about hiding spam with a leaf is enough to cause the same narcoleptic fit that was caused by an attempt to get through this entire film. Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes with a guy who “hunts” at them, torturing some guy he tied to a chair - this is his basement. Why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the Sisters "Sit on the couch" is never explained. There are also scenes when some kind of "superhuman" guy goes crazy. He sheds blood and punches through the wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is not explained and is not even connected with history. <br /> <br /> No action, no special effects no history. If you want to see some boring people talk deeply about something, sitting and eating ham and smoking, then here are 90 minutes of this, because, except for the scene where one chick jumps on the street corner and the above mentioned random scenes, absolutely NOTHING not happening. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you see how they move things, including a deformed sister, when they move into their new apartment. This is one of the few times when they are not sitting on the couch or lying in bed.
