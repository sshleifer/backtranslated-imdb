Of course, no Saturday morning baby TV show has ever done so badly. In the end, these producers had to count on the return of the audience. Well, in this terrible offer, they could at least count the money they saved on the set. The script could be rejected from some long-forgotten space opera series, with the addition of a few tricky lines for tough guy Gerald Mohr to whisper Naure Hayden. No director could have done something decent with such a crazy plot line, so the action just falls apart. Spacecraft props are absurd — for example, the Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter — but the sets of planets must be among the worst in cinematographic history. Most of them are rough drawings, and all of them are often filled with an improperly focused red light. Even Mora's naked hairy chest is used as a support. And this is bad - as thin as the plot. Any spectator who can reach the end of this film will hear a message from the Martians - and will probably agree completely!
