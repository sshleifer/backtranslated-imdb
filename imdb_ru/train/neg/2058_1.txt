I can find very little that can be said about this film. I am sure that the idea and the script looked good on paper, but the fear of the film and acting are, I am afraid, not the standards that I would expect from some very talented people. I doubt it is much appreciated in their summary of the filmography. Michael Caine sometimes seemed wooden in the role of the Doctor, and I never believed in his character. The plot was incredible, especially in relation to the victim's son. Some scenes were very similar to other films, and I sometimes wondered if this was actually a fake thriller. At times the lighting was dark, and it added to the feeling that I was watching a low-budget film with a few large named stars, wondering why I didnâ€™t watch it at all.
