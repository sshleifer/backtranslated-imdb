In the unlikely event that some aspiring filmmakers read these comments, I would like to offer some tips (for free!) From a spectator's point of view. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure film, do it. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure films, go on. DO NOT ATTEMPT to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, if you kill and decapitate a stupid character with a “comic relief,” and then, after the monkey shakes the tree and throws a coconut on the cannibal's head, you just look like you have NO IDEAS what movie you would like to shoot. This boring, winding, cheap, racist ... you understand. A couple of pleasant moments and a few bare bare eyes from Katie Dos (too primitive here) are hardly worth your trouble. There is a reason that everyone forgot about the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
