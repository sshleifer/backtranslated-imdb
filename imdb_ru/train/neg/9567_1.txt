It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008, and now it happened with another classic from the 80s Wargames ... :( Why, oh, why, oh, why Hollywood never learn? Leave them alone ...! They can not be redone ...! They suck ....! We all hate them ....!. <br /> <br /> Those of you who have not yet seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick and Ally Chidy, go rent / buy now ... !! The hardware may look outdated, special effects are not the new millennium, but they still beat this stuff .... <br /> <br /> For those of us who survived the 80s, Yes, hacking was sexy, the Internet was something mysterious, and your disks became an 8-inch floppy disk, and now we have the wisdom to avoid such a film as Thermonuclear War! <br /> Never before has "a good game of chess "did not seem to be the best option ....
