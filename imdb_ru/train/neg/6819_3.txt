In this film, Joe Sands claps dunks on basketball. Joe Sands ... <br /> <br /> Being consistent, the rest of the script is equally implausible. <br /> <br /> Pesci - funny guy who saves this film from failure in the absolute. The back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. his father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people who didn't even play well. instead of a person who is an archetypal villain, he was more like an immoral android programmed to make money at any cost. then there is a token that Sands assigned as a friend or something like that ... I donâ€™t even remember ... it was so unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Anyone who rates this movie above 5 or 6 is a paid member of some film studio trying to raise the reputation of this sunken film, or at least one of those millions of media minions who cannot effectively to criticize (you know, people who feel bad if they are given something to check off below 6). <br /> <br /> stay away ... far away. and the shame of the central comedy where I saw this film. they usually choose better.
