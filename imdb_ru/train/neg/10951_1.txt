I have no idea what idiots donated to this film “Palm D'Or” at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, because it was awful! I actually watched all this simply because I could not believe that someone would make such a useless movie. There is nothing interesting in the plot, the characters are deprived of depth, and there is no attempt to impart any atmosphere to the music or sound effects. In addition, if you decide to spend 2 hours of your life watching this movie, be sure to bring something that will throw up, because the cinema is just someone running with a hand-held video camera, and you can’t even see half the time items. This style has been used much more successfully in films such as Blair the Witch, because it creates uncertainty. In Rosetta, there is no plot and it is unclear what this style can give anything. I should have known better when it happened at 2 am that it would be terrible.
