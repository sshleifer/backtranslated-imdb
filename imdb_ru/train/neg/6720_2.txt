Now here’s a movie that, if shot in Australia, would have been a comedy. Unfortunately and annoyingly, here it is, sluggish, cheesy and baked from the land of Lal. How was the director so wrong? Well, mainly because I was serious about work, so amazing that no one in their right mind could take it seriously. Unless, of course, they were a dull, lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute) ... or is it cliché folded on a cliché. No value in a story that almost seems like a prequel to Jerry Ghana Van Santa ..... and with a name like FLUFFER, how is it all so great? Well, this author must have been so stunned that he did not get to Bert and Boogie first, that he had to make his own. Rolled up and undeveloped, with the exception of the theme “unrequited love is a bore”, left over from the faded lyrics of Streisand, we have only a whimsical beefcake and the storyline level of the series. The unnecessary fourth act of this long drama drama is really terrible as the film leaves, like Jerris, in the desert and gets stuck there. At the end of the 90s in Oz, about 20 people shot a similar, but actually funny film called MONEYSHOT. Originally shot as THE VENUS FACTORY, he also suffered from an author more terrible than Orson, so they re-took half of it, got a ruthless television editor to split him to 72 minutes and hey presto..comedia tonight! The lesson is when bad movies get better when they are covered. I assume that FLUFFER froze on release, and when I saw that it was not working, I can understand why.
