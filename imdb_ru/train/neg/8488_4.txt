Embracing the virtual reality, the potential of computers, the connection with the past, the ongoing struggle for the manifestation of their identity in a limited society and the exciting Ada Byron Lovelace, portrayed by charming Tilda Swinton, this film was supposed to be great. But it's lousy, terrible, given the potential! Acting - except for Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - deviates from tolerant to cruel. Building a plot is at least inconvenient - a modern programmer is a boring character with one note, but half of the film leaves on setting up her character, and then, when Ada finally appears, she talks about the events of her life, not presenting an interesting story (although Swinton copes with this). You will never fully recognize her as a real person, just an icon from a historical graduate student newspaper. <br /> <br /> Digital effects, such as a digital dog and a bird, are disgusting and distracting, considering that it was 1997, not 1985. And finally, the script is just bad. Bad, often pretentious dialogue - especially fights between the programmer and her boyfriend, which made me squirm - cold and distant characters, and zero attempts to create a sense of surprise. The programmer successfully communicates with a person in the past! Amazing But this is hardly surprising to anyone, and her boyfriend says: "Well, be careful." (Although then and later we did not get the slightest idea why this could be dangerous, and in fact it never seems dangerous.) <br /> <br /> Also, despite the fact that we are talking about computers, Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics, It is clear that no one associated with the script knew mathematics or computers â€” any reference to these subjects is found as a complete dead end that challenges any suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> One scene, the end of the film, is a pretty good one, a Tilde Swinton monologue expressing her sadness about the fragility of life, but her joy in this life. Sharp, passionate and insightful, he seems to be missing from another movie. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed in this film because it is a missed opportunity for an exciting little cult film. If you find an item interesting, you can rent it, but be warned. See Orlando for another, much better study of gender roles in history with Tilda Swinton's excellent performance. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Ada asks her memories not to be saved (in what I considered the best scene in the film) . But then a modern programmer seems to do it anyway, transferring the memories to his little girl (hence the name of the film). Am I right that the programmer violated Ada's desires without even trying his best? Or is this another confusing story that I misread?
