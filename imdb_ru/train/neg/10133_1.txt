If you are not mentally ill or you are not Segal’s heaviest fan, you won’t get tired of this terrible movie reason in less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot. Even for Segal, the plot is just stupid. I mean, he's not just bad, but barely connected. <br /> <br /> Acting is incredibly wooden. Literally seen better acting in porno's. Ironically, this film tries to capitalize on this audience, which is a “scene of lesbian love”, which is completely hopeless. <br /> <br /> Special effects - would not have seemed out of place in a film of the 60s and about magic. <br /> <br /> If you don’t suffer from insomnia and do not exhaust all other medications, don’t make the same mistake as me and buy this DVD, since you’ll ask for an hour and a half of your life back,
