This film is the biggest waste of nine dollars, which I spent for a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies, you would say that it is difficult to imagine, but nevertheless, it is true! After watching the trailer for this film, I realized that I should see it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and indecision, then why not? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; Unfortunately, the film is nothing like this. <br /> <br /> From cinema, screenplay to acting, this film is a complete failure. If you are reading this, planning to go to the film, expecting some kind of thrill, secrets, action films, horror, or something other than spending an hour and forty-five minutes, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. <Br /> <br /> “Why is it so bad?” You ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor disturbing. Nothing in the film made me a bit of fear or curiosity. The script was ridiculous at best. There were many times in the film when the dialogue was so ridiculous that I began to write it off as a comic relief, and after a few seconds I discovered that it was not. The game was absolutely terrible. I like Nicolas Cage, but it was Miss. Without exception, the performance in this film was incredibly below average. Cinematography was terrible without a single moment of waiting or mysticism. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this film approaching a mile away. <br /> <br /> I am usually not a very sharp critic. Honestly, when I go to a comedy, I want to laugh, and when I go to a riddle / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This film was a boring, poorly played, poorly written and overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and see something else.
