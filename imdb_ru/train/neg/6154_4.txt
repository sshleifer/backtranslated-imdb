The fluffy nice guy falls in love with the juicy blonde; She likes him too, but not for the reasons you might think. A little-known black comedy from writer Pat Prift shows very good performances by Joe Alaska and Donna Dickson, but she does not have a lasting impact. This is just a quick catchy effort led by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at the B-comedy level, the somewhat similar Raul Food is the best choice. This is definitely a fun environment; Unfortunately, in the second act the picture has nowhere to go. An interesting attempt, but it fails. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
