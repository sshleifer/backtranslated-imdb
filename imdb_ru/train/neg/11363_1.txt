This film was advertised on radio, television, in magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. Therefore, when we went to Kinnnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh, how sad this movie is! This is a Hollywood movie about a movie in a movie. The hue shows are so clear that we are not ready to make “big Hollywood movies.” I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As they say in my topic, it's nothing, and then fixated. You can just watch TV without seeing anything. It was a feeling that we experienced when we saw Shades. Shades is a bad product !!!
