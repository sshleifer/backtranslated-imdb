All the ingredients of the cult cinema with a low content of eyebrows. Topless (and bottomless) girls, chefs, kung fu, slave traders, evil Germans with a mustache, Cameron Mitchell, and zombies with a sword. <br /> <br /> And, of course, Camilla Keaton's chest, which is most famous. The show takes place in the feminist classic exploitation “I spit on your grave”. We should also mention the Shepard beeps, which play a prostitute in the recent film “Cooler.” <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in the bar, in and on the boat are many martial arts masters heading to some zombie island where bad martial arts masters die or what something like that. <br /> <br /> Tops and bottoms are easily and often removed, as travelers are well lubricated by the owner of the boat. <br /> <br /> Then a catastrophe happens when their boat collapses and they land on a zombie island, where freemason monks sacrifice young girls to dead martial artists to bring them back to life. <br /> Just when you thought it had everything, there are piranhas in the water. Yum Yum Big Fat German for dinner. <br /> <br /> Just for your next zombie festival.
