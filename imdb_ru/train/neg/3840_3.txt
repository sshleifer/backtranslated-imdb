I heard about this movie a while ago from a friend, and she recently received it on DVD. There were a lot of expectations and excitement, since we both heard that this was a terrible film, really scary. How disappointed I am ?? HIGHLY!!!! Except for this one scene (we all know what bit), nothing happened !!! I expected to see a woman in black several times, and she could do some more exciting scenes, for example, appear at the window or walk down the hall or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all the reviews here say what a scary, exciting, atmospheric film it is. I just did not see it, I'm afraid. Maybe there is a difference in that people are scared in the USA, here in Britain. <br /> <br /> Strong disappointment after all the untwisted reviews: (
