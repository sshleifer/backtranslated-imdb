I have seen many, many films from China and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was "Unknown Pleasure." Last night I watched Platform and thought that the other two films of Jia Zhang Ke should be better. That evening I was again disappointed. I won't watch Xiao Wu tomorrow night because I just put all three films in the trash can! Whoever gave this film “Platform” ten out of ten, he needs to watch more movies! The photo was very bad: it was very difficult to distinguish some characters due to the lack of close-up work. The storyline was so fragmented that I quickly moved it to the end out of sheer disappointment. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Cage any day. These are true masters of Chinese cinema, not pretentious scammers!
