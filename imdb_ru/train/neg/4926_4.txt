I saw this film for two reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor guys were forced to tear down a rather stupid film. I liked the idea that Dracula is in fact a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot because she explains his contempt for everything Christian, but there was so much camp there that this idea was not implemented as much as it could. I see this film as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before he is truly recognized, and how the legendary Christopher Plummer reminds the public (me and 5 other people who have seen this film) that it still exists. I really enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the movie itself.
