Rarely seen after a theatrical release in 1970, the MYRA BRECKINRIDGE became synonymous with cinematographic disasters of legendary proportions. Now, finally, on a DVD in an unexpectedly attractive package, today it is hardly possible to win a wide audience, as was the case with the first release. <br /> <br /> Bestseller Mount Vidal of 1968 was a grim satirical statement. Most filmmakers believed that the story, structure and overall tone of the novel would not translate into movies, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights, but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen. But the studio leaders soon had cold feet: Vidal's adaptation was repeatedly rejected, and aspiring screenwriter Michael Sarn was invited to bring the film to the screen. <br /> <br /> Studio leaders hoped that Sarn would enter the youth market as the goal of the film, but Sarn was even more inappropriate to the material than the leaders themselves. Rewrite after rewrite trace. The actors who felt the catastrophe became more and more militant. In her commentary on the DVD star Raquel Welch says that she rarely had any idea of ​​the motives Mir had from stage to stage, or even inside any one stage, and that everyone involved seemed to shoot a completely different film. In the accompanying documentary film, Back Story, Rex Reed says MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a group of people who were hiding in their locker rooms, waiting for their lawyers to answer their calls. <br /> <br /> The film itself demonstrates the accuracy of these comments. The basics of Vidal’s history are there, but the history is not only devoid of all the broader consequences, it does not seem to make any sense by itself. Everything runs in different directions, nothing connects, and numerous scenes undermine any logic of the previous scenes. And although the director Sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film a pure farce, the only thing that caused laughter was an accident. <br /> <br /> The main one among these accidents is Mae West. It is true that the West was unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that it did not lose a single path with one line - but one cannot overlook the fact that she is over seventy and her belief that she is still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely disturbing to say the least. But the worst thing is that the West is beyond its era. Her efforts to transform herself into a hip and imaginative personality lead to one of the most awkward caricatures of herself in the film. <br /> <br /> The remaining cast is largely in vain. Raquel Welch, a significantly underrated actress, plays the lead role of Myra very much like the Barbie doll on steroids; Neakter Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Miron, but the whole role is essentially meaningless. Only John Houston and cameo players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper and Andy Devine leave the game relatively unharmed. Yes, this is really the debacle that all the filmmakers feared: quickly, when it should be slow, slowly, when it should be fast, tirelessly unfunny from beginning to end. It's true that director Sarna sometimes has an inspirational idea - how he uses everyone's videos from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create a counterpoint to action - but in general, whenever Sarna was presented with the choice of how to do something he did wrong. <br /> <br /> How and why this is explained in the Sarna audio commentary. Sarna did not like the novel or, for that matter, the subject in general. He did not want to write the script, but he needed money; He definitely did not want to make a film, but he needed money. He makes it very clear that he doesn’t like the authors Gor Vidal and Rex Reed (at some point he categorically declares that Reed is not a very good person), and to this day he believes that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play their “homosexual agenda” - which, when you come straight to her, seemed to be their desire for Sarn to actually shoot Vidal’s novel, not his strangely imagined takeoff. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he spends a lot of time commenting, arguing that the movie is widely liked by the gay community, Sarna never seems to understand that the film’s appeal to a gay audience stems from its ridiculously inaccurate descriptions of homosexual people. When Sarn is filmed in tandem with the film itself, it looks more than homophobic - and, frankly, is the worst choice of writers and directors who could be made for this project. <br /> <br /> In addition to the DVD release, includes Sarna and Welch’s comments and a release documentary that includes several trailers and two versions of the film: the “theater release” version and the “recovered” version. The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the “restored” version was printed in black and white. Changes made before the film entered the general release were not restored, but the documentary details of what they were. The widescreen transmissions of both are wonderful and the sound is pretty good. But at the end, where I started, this is really the film that will interest cinema historians, cinema lovers and cult cinema fans the most. I give him three of five stars just for their sake, but everyone else must pass by. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
