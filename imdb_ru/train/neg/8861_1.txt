A terrible terrible sequel to "Voyu". It begins with the funeral of Karen White (she was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crossko (unfortunately, Christopher Lee) arrives there and tells brother Karen Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. He is going to Transylvania to kill Stryba (Sybil Dunning), the main werewolf. Ben and his colleague from Karens (Annie Macinroy) join him. <br /> <br /> The terrible scenario, bad direction, inept editing and the truly terrible actions of Brown and McEnroe alone flooded him. The effects of the werewolf are mostly kept in the dark - for a good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Special effects subpara as well - although I REALLY liked the cartoon lightning emanating from Dunning's fingers. There are also werewolf orgies, which are particularly stupid, and Danning removes her top at least EVEN during the final credits! <br /> <br /> There are a few good things - I thought the village in Transylvania was funny - it looks like it happened because of the horror film of the Universal of the 1930s! There are interesting camera stunts between transition scenes; Brown and McInroy have good bodies, and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can't save it. Indeed - WHY did they do it? Where is it that hard for the money ??? This is one of the lowest rated IMDb films. That alone should tell you something. Perhaps Dunning was terrified when she saw the movie - I understand why! Be sure to skip.
