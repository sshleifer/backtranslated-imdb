I entered without knowing anything about this film, and left after half an hour, knowing all about it. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I am generally a good person, but if someone told me that they liked this film, I would probably never talk to him again. Anyone who loves it completely is likely to be a very dry, recluse. I also want to say that they think that they, too, are smart enough, like self-centered perduns, which are voiced by the film. I know that everyone has different types of humor, some may not even love me, but this is normal; I don't think it covers any range of humor though. This film is as flat and boring as Wes Anderson's mind. Come in and get ready to go out; Better get your money back too.
