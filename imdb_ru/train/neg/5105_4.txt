I guess there are some who remember Nicole Eggert from her days as a little girl on TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charles is responsible, and who is the boss? You are perverts, you! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants. No matter, you will surely forget her in this supposed comedy about aliens-cannibals. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that are meaningless and never explained. How did she know the stranger? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why didn't the alien eat it? You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Before the alien eats his boyfriend and finds his personality, you will see him in the body of Alex Menses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to view this garbage. Stay in the shower and the guy and continue to go about their business.
