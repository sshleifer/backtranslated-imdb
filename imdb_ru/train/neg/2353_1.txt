Madhur has given us the powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past. His next film was one of the worst films of all time. This obviously tells the story of some high-profile people in India. After watching the scene where a man forces another man for sexual reasons to act in films. I wanted to spit and break a DVD. Coincidentally, I did. The reason for which the film was contains scenes of child pornography and corruption. I literally vomited, and I was shocked to see a film showing naked children. Very disturbing things, it was not necessary to show the children completely naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreigners, British, in this film. I am shocked to learn that this film was a hit in some parts of India, otherwise it was a super flop in the UK, the USA and Australia. I'm from the UK, and this kind of thing makes me sick, but should not have been released in the UK.
