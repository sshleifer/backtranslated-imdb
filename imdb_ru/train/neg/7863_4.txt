THHE2 is fascinating because you will laugh and jerk a lot and probably say "oh, damn it!" and "take your face away from this damn hole, which you are stupid **" or something like that, but I don’t know if this is really worth seeing - I was very annoyed throughout the entire range of awful military characters who Do not seem to know about the battle in the first place. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, blood and more body than in the first one, but I still argue whether this feeling is canceled throughout the entire film about how funny it is (and not such a funny thing, like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would be better to spend on watching the Aji remake for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> So, dare laugh a little or try to bleed, but don’t hope to get out of it contentedly.
