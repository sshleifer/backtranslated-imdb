Brides die at the altar, and their corpses disappear. Everyone is worried, but no one seems to be able to understand why and how this happens, nor can they prevent it. Bear with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, as he extracts the cerebrospinal fluid from these young women in order to transfuse his ancient wife and support her life. Keep tolerating me. Finally, the authorities find out that someone must design death and disappearances, but, of course, they cannot understand the incredible motive. Let's just ignore the ridiculous pseudoscience and continue ... If you can get past the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated to Lugosi, who beats his lab technician for disrespecting one of the brides he killed, explaining that he finds a sleeper in a coffin much more comfortable than in beds, and other vague parodies of real horror films (such as with budgets and stories). Anyhoo - the journalist follows his nose to the culprit (and, surprisingly, the stupid police are nowhere to be seen!), And then the most interesting begins. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and acting skills are fine. There are many well-dressed, very good-looking people in this film. The direction is fair, and the script is a little better than well-deserved material. However, this film cannot satisfy the interest of everyone except the most seasoned b-film fan. The best thing about it .... It eventually ends, but not soon enough.
