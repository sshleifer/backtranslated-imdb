The film is badly cast, with the exception of some familiar old Hollywood names. Other performances under unknown names (i.e. Jennifer Gabrielle) are boring. I have seen other films of this director, unfortunately, this is one of his worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the script? <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Kim Bassinger and Pat Moritaâ€™s performance saved the film from oblivion. Although I liked Pat at Karate Kid more. There are many good films to watch, and in short, this is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
