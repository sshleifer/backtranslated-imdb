The band of us that watched this movie were really nasty. We were ready to forgive the fact that our beloved character Joe was not (this does not mean that the writers / producers could do something about it). The letter was bad, the script was below normal. What REALLY annoyed us: 1. When the two guys realized that they were meeting Natalie, they didnâ€™t just leave, they put up with this stupid (and ultimately degrading) competition - but only because they were macho guys, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite the fact that before the reunification she had no choice between the two guys, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no premonition that he was really the best guy, as if the writers tossed a coin, and then just made her spit it out at some convenient time in the film). 3. Blair says that she does not want children, and suddenly, when her husband says he wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.
