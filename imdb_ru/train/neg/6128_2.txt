This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you cannot base a whole movie on this! <br /> <br /> Characters are too stereotypical, there is no real story - only short episodes with bizarre side characters that are not so bizarre as to make the plot authentic. because most of the actors are recognized in Hungary, a mystery why they took the role. <br /> <br /> This is * not * a new hope for a Hungarian film. It was boring, although it had to be authentic or unique. They could try a lot more than that ... 2 of 10
