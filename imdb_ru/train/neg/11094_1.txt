This film is another one on my list of films, so as not to worry. Saw it 40 years ago as a teenager who went to bed late to do it, was very annoyed to find that it was about 95% romance, 4% of the rest, 1% of the story, if so. This is what I call the bait and switch movie, the one with the interesting title, the real film is a scam. This is a theme that deserves a good cinematic approach, this film almost offends those who served. The actual members of the Lafayette Squadron were not fleeing the law and were not products of abusive homes, in fact they were idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them came from a higher class than the Tab Hunter character. The flight school is not for smart ales, and everyone knows that a person like the one shown here would not have lasted two days, it would be either a picket fence or infantry. Discipline in the French army was often quite tough. In short, another Hollywierd version of the historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
