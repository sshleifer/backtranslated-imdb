Believe it or not, this film is worse than number three. He is slower, acting is worse, and the story is very weak. Thereâ€™s not much to say about this movie. Even the fight scenes are more boring than number three, and I would think that this is impossible. This is a very slow 90 minutes. In fact, I was offended. I coped with this, hoping that everything would get better. If you really want to watch this movie, you should try to find a cheap rental. It is difficult to find (for purchase, that is), and, probably, for a good reason. Like number three, this film has nothing to do with the first two. It is the same only in name. I can give the best of the best: without warning 2/10
