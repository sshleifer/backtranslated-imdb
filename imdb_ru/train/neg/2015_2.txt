I really looked forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Ian Michael Vincent, and I am an aviation idiot, and I have a serious romance with helicopters. I do not like this program, because it raises the imagination to an incredible level. The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 miles per hour by Westland Lynx several years ago. The only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. He shot down more than 300 people and was a complex helicopter, which means that at the end of his fuselage there was a pushing propeller providing thrust. <br /> <br /> In short, no helicopter can fly over 275 due to the rotation principle. winged flight. And Bell 222, the actor portraying the Airwolf, was not very fast, even by helicopter standards. And it did not last very long. <br /> <br /> During this period, a film called “Blue Thunder” was released, which was much more realistic.
