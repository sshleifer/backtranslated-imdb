This series would be much better if they just did one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code name: Diamond Head instead of Code name: Tree. The Diamond Head character needs someone who could handle the role of an attractive cheater, which McShane proved he could do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Tinnes, the real Diamond Head, is really only so-so in this role. McShane is not as good as the bad guy, Three. The character Frans Nuyen, Tso-Ching, cannot decide whether she is an unfortunate victim or a tough and ready-to-fight woman. She really earned her salary at the end, when she had to play the role of the Diamond Head lover. After watching one or two episodes, I did not care about what happened to anyone. The tree gives us a lot to hate it, but the Diamond Head doesnâ€™t give us anything to love it. Unfortunately, the spy genre in the 1970s was not exactly the same as it was in the 1960s.
