Wow, I love and respect almost everything that David Lynch did. However, this film is akin to the director’s first attempt to make a pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> Here are a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is usually a visual filmmaker, however, it had some visual artistic content (blank walls, "shots" with a ceiling in the background ). David Lynch is usually proud of the sound, but in this you can even hear the buzz of a camcorder. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the thought that he is somehow connected with this film. if only ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke on David’s part, forcing fans to search his website (for hours) just to find this nonsense. I hope so, because at least this idea is ridiculous.
