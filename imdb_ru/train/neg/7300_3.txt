This film is about a group of five friends who rent a house in the forest. One of my friends picked up a terrible carnivorous virus. Suddenly, friends lead each other in a desperate attempt not to get infected. <br /> <br /> “Fever” is a terrible movie. On the one hand, it tries to be many genres at the same time. Should it be a homage, slasher, black comedy or a scary film with an unintended comedy? No one can tell. There, first a serious scene, and then the second, it turns out funny. When a movie tries to be fun, the humor is pretty bland, with the exception of the ending. I really liked the final. <br /> <br /> But besides the final, I was very disappointed and disgusted. Violence is worthy of horror, more distracted from the screen than from fear. The tone changes in every scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes completely random. In fact, you see a karate girl in slow motion. What should we get from this? The same girl will bite one of the characters. Is this supposed to be funny? I dont know. <br /> <br /> Some performances were decent, and many were quite amateur. I didn't give a damn about most characters. I liked the plot, but the execution was awful. Like a horror movie, I didn't know what it was. I did not find it funny, tense and scary. In the end, you remain indifferent, thinking: “What have I just experienced?” Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
