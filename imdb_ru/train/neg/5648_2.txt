A Boston lawyer turned his tail and headed for the barn door and the huddle he had created! When this show first aired almost four seasons ago, it was a humorous slap in the legal system, which all actors seem to be proud of the image. It was funny, diverse and to some extent factual. The characters depicted were acceptable and somewhat real in their images. Sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen was and was beautiful, as in other TV shows, in which she took part, but now she pulls into the lowest depths of media programs of sex and violence. Julie is a great actress, she needs a more stable platform than this “production”. Rene Ajurdubua is a great actor who, from the time of “Benson” before this performance, has taken his place in the field of entertainment, always demonstrating humor and respect for the performance. Captain Kirk "is." Candace Bergan is funny and humorous, and she should be admired because she continues to act in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt about his acting ability, but he must return to his XXX origin, such as Crash, as it seems that he has a great talent and inclination in this direction. We ask that this series be destroyed as it is, and it really starts to smell !!!
