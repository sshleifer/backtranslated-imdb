I voted 3 for this film because it looks great, like the whole Greenway outlet. However, it was his usual mixture of "artistic" sex and pretentious crap. I know that many people like this film, but I am very quickly tired of it. This is definitely not for everyone. Probably, the ubiquitous MacGregor obviously took part for the sake of credibility, but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate sending anyone to the corner of a pseudonym, but please !!! On the positive side, it is visually very attractive, and I enjoyed the music, but I could not reach it to the end, and I cannot say that in many films. I usually watch all this, but it is unbearable !!
