On the way to a small town that lies far from the beaten track (but it looks suspiciously close to the freeway), a female reporter faces a strange traveler who agrees to help her direct her to her destination. Then a strange man tells a couple of horrible stories related to this area: in the first story, a couple of adultery plans to kill the woman’s husband, but in the end he herself is exposed to a much worse fate when attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of holidaymakers shortens their holidays, when an undead offender is offended by the fact that his grave signed. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by the writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to create an anthology on the subject of zombies is a good idea, but with only two stories, it is terribly short. And this is not the only way this low-budget film can’t cope: playing lousy (with Joe Haggerty, as Ebenezer Jackson tells, giving one of the strangest performances I've ever seen); places are boring; the script is depressing; there is a zero-nudity sex scene; and the ending .... well, it didn't believe it. <br /> <br /> To be honest, some of Sykes' creative camera work is effective (although the sly technique used when characters run around the forest is a bit of abuse), and Joe Castro's cheap blood is full of enthusiasm: ear is bitten off, eyeballs are torn out, removed face, crushed brains and dirty decapitation. These positive traits make the film tolerable, but keep in mind that Zombie Chronicles is not a walk in the park, even for experienced Z-class rubbish viewers. <br /> <br /> I’m giving The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously upgrading my rating to 3, since I couldn’t see the movie with the advantage of 3D (although I have a hidden suspicion that an additional dimension wouldn’t have much difference).
