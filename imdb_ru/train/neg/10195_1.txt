The author / director of this film obviously does not know anything about the film. I think that the PD in this project was connected and replaced with a monkey, because everyone he saw was either too dark or had hotter spots than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. To someone said that this film was made for fans of poker, and not for fans of the movie, that someone is kidding me (probably, it was a writer / director). No poker fan in this world loves this movie. Even your money man hates this project. To go to the casino and play a few hands, you do not need to write about poker. Save your day job. And if he plays poker, then it hurts you.
