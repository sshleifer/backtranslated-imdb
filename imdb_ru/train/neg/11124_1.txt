I usually don’t worry too much about violence in films or about a huge amount of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very good with me, and the film brings us a lot of the above. Here are beautiful photos, especially the lake and nature, good character location, good direction. One could vote for this film as a good film. However, this is flawed for two reasons, and both of these reasons make this film simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First, violence against sentient beings is used to create this film. Not violence in the movies, I'm talking about REAL violence. This violence alone can be justified, if not, and this is reason number two; the film's message was not just an introspection in which the directors confused about women. Not that all of us had any real perversions with women (respectively men). But the conclusion of the film destroys it all. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our “heroine” is finally dying (right here, with my own hand, if I remember correctly, I saw this movie many years ago, and he pissed me off, now the guy came out with a new witch from of course, I will not watch the film) and now it is even more clearly depicted as a kind of natural demon, nature growing above it, in particular its gender ... Of course, it’s the director who “kills” the woman’s heroine. Women must die, especially if men are attracted by their sexuality. This seems to be the final conclusion. ** end spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, everything that might have been nice to me if the director kept his mind to himself. But to use big pictures, cunning indications of cruelty towards living beings, it is easy to say that men can be frightened by women, and men are cruel to women. This is simply not enough. I knew that when I watched this film, he would get good critics for “philosophical, oriental and artistic” and any other approach. But for me, this film is just completely spoiled.
