Five in front of my eyes do not stand alone from the wrist, I must admit that once I was really worried, for about 30 seconds nobody made a noise, and I thought that my speakers exploded or that I was deaf from the constant cry and shouts with a high tone and the speakers are fine, now thanks for asking, oddly enough, it was the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste your time telling the plot, read other comments for this. <br /> <br /> If you bought this DVD, but have not yet unpacked it, do not take it back and do not demand your money, I wasted mine, do not do the same. <br /> <br /> I actually shouted on the telly: “They are here in the car, look for the light in the camera and call the operator first,” I left curses, but you can guess where they are going. . <br /> <br /> If someone wants to buy this film (it's really good), then it's yours for ten pounds.
