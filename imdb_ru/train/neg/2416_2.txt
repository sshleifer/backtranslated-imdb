2 stars and I'm generous. (minor spoilers) Listen, this is a low-budget film about zombies in gangster Oakland. As stated in the story, the scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a car. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film: what kind of zombies ?! All that “zombies” do is growl (which doesn’t even sound frightening) and dripping fake red blood from the mouth! No scary eyes, no decaying flesh, just a group of people roaring pathetically and running like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. In the entire film, there are only about 6 zombies, so this does not mean that the entire “hood” is replete with zombies or something else, these are just a few, and it is contained as soon as possible. it's so bad, it's fun. No one can play in this film at all (except, perhaps, one of the gang members), and it seems that a group of friends got together, decided to play their family and make a film on the weekend. <br /> <br /> Last note: since when do doctors wear tracksuits ?! Skip this one, please!
