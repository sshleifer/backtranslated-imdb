This film caused great disappointment about the direction, intellectual niva, plot and how he treated his theme - painting. It is a slow moving film, similar to the episode of “Wonderful Years,” with a terrifying lack of depth. He also cannot convincingly convey his message. <br /> <br /> The approach to the topic of painting is very elite, limited to the vague and subjective terms “beauty”. According to the creators of this film, "beauty" can only be experienced in kitsch landscape paintings in the style of Bob-Ross. Good art on this film can be achieved by applying the basic (for example, primary school level) color theory and a lot of moods. Partly the film insults, for example, at some point it is claimed (rather, it is celebrated by dancing on the tables) that mentally retarded people are not able to experience emotions or express them through painting, their works are by definition futile "nonsense" (quote). <br /> <br /> I don’t understand how the film could get such a high rating, but again, not many people rated it, and they chose only very high or very low ratings.
