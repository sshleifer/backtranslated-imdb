I, frankly, can not believe that now for fun Death (and a joke over death), violence, sexual hints, the threat to children from adults, rudeness, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, a nanny from hell , stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat people, as well as stalking children at home in the middle of the night - yes, of course, it sounds like a children's film for me - NOT !!! Add to this the dark and scary elements - a dead woman who turns into a house and holds her loving husband captive for more than 20 years, and also terrorizes the entire area - as nice for children. PARENTS - this is really what you want your children to watch - this is what you want to tell them about life ?! <br /> <br /> This film is too scary for small children, and Iâ€™m afraid that teenagers today may be living some of this movie script - so why rub it into their faces? As for the adult audience - you will not find it frightening or funny - just boring, contrived and predictable. And the characters are simply wrong - ignorant parents, ignorant policemen, stupid and annoying friends, vile and manipulative nannies, as well as guys who drink beer / babies. What wonderful stuff for kids - does it really sound like a kid's film for everyone? Even computer animation and good voice acting are not enough to buy back this terrible movie. Save your money, save your time and save the minds of your children - rent a Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - ANY of them are much better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - a shame to both of you for making such a disaster and then announcing it as a children's / family movie !!
