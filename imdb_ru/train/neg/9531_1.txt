This is a cruel movie. Two crazy young women seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give away regarding the plot or the "spoiler." I would only comment that the ending is almost the most ridiculous part of the film. Most of the film involves Locke and Camp in confusion, all the while mentally grinning at the camera. Add to this the soundtrack that repeats over and over again, including the vaudellian song about “dear old dad”, which offers an incestuous quality that the viewer never sees. Music is annoying at first, and then exposes the viewer to torture, which is worse than on the screen. The topic here is about youth, which can be angry, understandable as a reaction to the 60s, but made with a little imagination or style. Avoid it!
