The good thing about it is, at least, fresh: there are almost no films about dance music, and the club scene (if removed at all) goes to the cinema. And it radiates a lot of energy, from music to the image of Ibiza. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that he cannot decide who he wants to be. Despite the fact that in the series This is Spinal Tap definitely like to play the role of a model, the creators also realized that they did not want to play imitators. However, in jokes, it fails because it is not written very well, and most of the characters are not sufficiently developed. And in his script there is no arc and an instruction to make it up to 90 minutes, so why not edit it to 75? The production department and cinema are still trying to save the day (for example, the house of Paul). <br /> <br /> In a strange way and unexpectedly, so everything went, Pete Tong works much better, like a simple drama in the Almost Famous series. Especially the scenes with Beatrice Batarda offer some acting power. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: this is a mess, it is a little fun at the basic level, but it is better to spend the night in your favorite club.
