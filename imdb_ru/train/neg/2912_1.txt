Meatball Machine was supposed to be one of the most complex, ridiculous, horrible, and overly exaggerated sci-fi horror films I've ever met. It is about good versus evil and the story of coming of age to have fun in a bloody, slovenly and humorous context. Because of this, violence is not particularly terrible and does not cause you to squirm, but causeless bloodshed and nudity run freely. The performances of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst that I have seen, if this was not enough, it is also directed by an unheard of director named Juday Yamaguchi. This film has everything, it's bad to the bone! Be sure to look at every lover of b-movies !!! ... Simply: pleasure and rarity.
