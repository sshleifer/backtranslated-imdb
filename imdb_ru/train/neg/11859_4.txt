Well, you'd better if you were planning to sit among this amateur, polite and frivolous film about a middle-aged widowed mother, who has a little more in common with her young adult or older daughter than she would like. While in Tunisia, Mom looks around the apartment, gets nervous and decides, although reluctantly (she just can't help it), put on a costume and dance at a local cabaret. In the meantime, her daughter takes dance lessons. The common denominator is the Tunisian drummer. This film is so full of filler that I watched a DVD on x2 and read subtitles, quickly sorting through many of the very ordinary dance and insane cadres of walking (they go everywhere) and even more walking around and just idling on x4 to get at least that boring, without incident , a low-budget film that somehow gathered some pretty good critical applause. Go figure it out. (WITH)
