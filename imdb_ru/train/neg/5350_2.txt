Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis stars in this terrible third sequel to the once funny and funny “Honey, I squeezed the children”. The concept basically plays the same way as in the first film, but adults instead of children are reduced, and the inner house instead of the garden - to explore the universe. If you think it sounds interesting, think again. The film is dull at best, and embarrassing at worst. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity of the series was completely flushed down the toilet. The only remaining actor in the first film seems to be Rick Moranis. The actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing children have changed, those who play the neighbors have changed ... You name it. They are trying to make us believe that this is one and the same family, but the results, at least, are puzzling. <br /> <br /> Secondly, history is a rehash of the first, without a single originality. All a few jokes (and there are practically none) and the dangerous situations presented in the film are simply copied directly from the film “Honey, I squeezed the children”. <br /> <br /> The third problem, special effects. I'm sure this was done with a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, much worse than those appearing in the rest of the series. You must admire these tiny figures exploring the vast home territory, but you will probably end up shrinking in most cases. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem - finding action inside the house is just boring. Only a few things happen, and when they happen they don’t care at all. The first film was funny because the children dealt with the nature, the grass and the beetles that live in it. In this, adults (who seem rather boring compared to children) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why the Disney executives liked the idea of ​​releasing such a banal sequel to an already dying TV series, except perhaps they had to earn money without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I warn you: leave this tasteless trash in the place where it should remain: dust on the shelves of the store.
