After reading some good reviews about this film, I thought it was time to watch it. Well, I don't know why I was worried. In fact, this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a large cache of ancient treasures hidden by the Templars during the War of Independence. Apparently, he had to be held in the hands of the British at any cost. Firstly, why did the knights said move the treasure from Europe to America? How did the Nic Cages character find out that Charlotte was actually a ship? How do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute? And how can two people suddenly become the main thieves and steal, what is probably the best guarded piece of paper in the world? These are just some of the gaps in this meaningless Hollywood action. Cage was filming some great action movies — Face-Off and The Rock — so why did he get down to it? Is he too old? His character is really annoying - somehow, this “ordinary” guy steals the Declaration of Independence, overtakes thieves with weapons, escapes from the FBI and generally seems invincible. The whole film does not make any sense, and in general it was a disappointment.
