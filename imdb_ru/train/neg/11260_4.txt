This film should be called Plan 9 from Joseph Smith. I think his strangeness is underestimated. the playwright seems to have read Paul Ehrlich's “people's bomb” (1968) and created a musical response made especially for the Mormons. The whole point of the play is that having as many children as possible is part of the plan of the “heavenly father” (God). and everything that prevents having more children is very bad. receive? <br /> <br /> This version was dropped in 1989, which is confusing for Utah, so it looks and feels like 1983, the play was written in 1973, and, of course, theology is part of the 1840s , part of Battlestar Galactica. some actions take place on earth, and some in the “preexistence”, aimless slider room, where annoying children are waiting to get their body to go down, try not to slam the door on the missionaries, losing a shot at heavenly glory. <br /> <br /> it’s as scenic as they are, but don’t let poor theater-goers spoil your appreciation for this insane Mormon universe, where the “cool kids” are all in the control population, (presumably) advised their parents more kids !! having large families while writing the play was a cultural norm in the community and, more importantly, was considered part of God's plan. The church has since made 180, and made family planning the choice of parents, and large families are now far less than the cultural norm, creating the entire doctrinal film premise for the modern Mormon dispute! <br /> <br /> ahhh, but in reality it's only as good as the music. There are several memorable melodies that will not allow this film to die the death of the 1970s, for which it was predestined. brother and sister sing to each other a few love songs that make you think, maybe there is something else going on - wink. and cool, cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallic. so hello to all! Gather a family, make some jelly shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
