Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch the camera again. If he does, he must be arrested on the spot ... at least for petty theft. Anyone who pays even ten cents to rent their garbage should file a claim and get compensation. It was innocently my first viewing of his "work" ... and this will be my last. Ed Wood looks very good to me right now. <br /> <br /> When I return this piece of shit to the video store, I will personally ask you to remove it from the shelf. An active supporter of gay cinema, I am outraged and angry that this perverted, extremely mediocre man is allowed to distribute and pack something like this with a cute boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, fortunately, has no other valid loans in IMDb ) and an interesting synopsis on the back, used as bait, and then advertise it as a movie rental. Believe me, this is not a place on any rack; it's just not a movie in any sense of the word. Abusive, irresponsible trash, such as this, can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!). For those who are tempted to rent it because of coverage, you will be disappointed. Gabel does not look so flattering on the film as on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt - that's all. Instead, ugly Mrouavich imposes on us his own disgusting, apologetic-looking nudity of a dough boy. <br /> <br /> This “thing” that he “collected” is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habush (who, as I understand it, produces such dirty garbage) are terrible at that. Mraovich deliberately pretended to be incompetent (in all areas), desperately trying to grasp any “unfortunate” attention that he could for himself. He must be pitied.
