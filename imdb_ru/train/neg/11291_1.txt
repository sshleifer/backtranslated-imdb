Sheesh! What a horrible movie. Quirky camera work, a script with more corn than Kellogg’s, and keeping yourself so stupid that you could open a pig farm with him. <br /> <br /> To top it off, she doesn't know what audience to target - do we have Cornel Wilde or is Corney Wilde? - getting into your soap box about the dangers of smoking at any time, when someone lights a cigarette, dear, dear, and in another awkward scene we have a villain, Lobo, forcing him, um, if you like, “friend” to make a striptease dressed in bikini. Try to explain this to children ... <br /> <br /> Add an unnecessarily contrived storyline like “Treasure Island-jaw sperm,” and the result is a film so unintentionally funny that it is pleasant - I should not expect a special DVD release soon, though.
