Hello from the dark again. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He shot two of my most beloved ones in Avalon and Diner. He also had some good movies (“Rainman”), but he always gave something interesting ... until now. I think the worst thing you can say about a comedy is that it’s boring. “Envy” is the definition of boring. Never being a big fan of pure slap (“Dumb and Dumber”), I was just stunned by how terrible this film is. In all this there can be 2 laughs - if you can pay attention for so long. The best part of the film is the running title track, similar to the sound of Redbone. If the film were written the same way as the song, it would be tolerable. Rachel Weiss is a wonderful actress, and I understand that they all want to do a comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes one weakness. SNL actor actress Amy Poehler is her lead role as a trailer for a trailer park that has become a princess. Disaster of the film - Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first job gets together, flashes some promise, but after that their chemistry disappears due to a bad script. This scenario is similar to most of the ideas of the character of Jack Black - a good idea, but there is no hope of success.
