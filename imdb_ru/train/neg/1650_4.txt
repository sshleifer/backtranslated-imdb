Four best friends of young male chauvinistic pigs (with an emphasis on pigs) meet weekly at a New York diner to talk about their sex scenes in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Pete is a common denominator who meets with three bachelors in a group, which leads to conflict and the inevitable "flogging." Although the premise of the film has potential, and there are some funny moments that will take place, the film as a whole does not work, especially at the end, where girls look no better than boys, which is contrary to the point. "Whipped" is one of those films featuring one man with a dozen producers, who will probably only like those young men who think The Man Show is Emmy material.
