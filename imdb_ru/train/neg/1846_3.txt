Well, I like to be honest with the whole audience that I bought because of Kira’s sex scenes, but unfortunately I didn’t see them. All the sex scenes were short and made in a casual manner along with all the strange and banal background music, like all other B-movies - this is not very similar to two people sex. Wow !!! how shocking !!! Why don't we nominate this film for the Academy Award? I can’t imagine how bad the film would look if it had an R rating (Mine imported from the UK, rating 18). Conclusion? Put it down and go so that you do not become such an idiot like me. <br /> <br /> Account: 2/10
