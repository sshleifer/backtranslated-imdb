This shows that this is a French film, LOL, with an emphasis on young girls with adult men ... why are the French so obsessed with such things? When the age difference is so great, it really seems perverted! Valentina Worms is beautiful (she is very similar to Olivia Hussey from Zeffirelli '68 Romeo and Juliet '68, filmed in the same period), but she looks about 15, and the actor playing Tassi, her drawing instructor, looks ... well , 50 is good. <br /> <br /> Other authors have done work on explaining the historical record (unusually detailed in this case) of this Artemisia, a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period (17th century). Her story tells us in our time, especially because of the age-old accusation that “all great artists were men” - she pretty much scolded this statement to shreds - and because the story of her rape trial is so acute . Not only was she explicitly attacked and forced into humiliating sexual relations (because in those days marrying your attacker was the only way to avoid social shame), but Tassi was a serial rapist and could have killed his wife and child. <Br /> <br /> The film is a terrible disservice, turning this truly exciting and remarkable real-life story - very dramatic and not in need of "revitalization" - because in some strange, violent way, "hot" have an overwhelmed teenager pulling male genitals and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather. It's “sexy” - really boring and seems too feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> I am also concerned that this is ONLY a part of Artemisia’s life, which is considered interesting enough for filming. The fact that she painted for decades (her famous painting with Judith, decapitating Olfern, was written AFTER, not before the rape) that she was the first woman to be accepted into the prestigious Florentine Academy, that she continued to have children ... o These are boring things. In the end, this is a middle-aged woman, and they are not “hot” as teenagers. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many creative licenses for creating a film (or book) about a real historical character. You need to create a dialogue, have stories, create a dramatic structure. Of course, some details can be sacrificed - there is nothing to worry about if dates are postponed for several years, or if Artemisia is played by a blond actress (when we learn from her self-portraits that she was a brunette ... skinny Minnie), or something like that. But turning her story around and turning rape into a novel is actually sick and disturbing. This is even worse because the director is a woman. She must be terribly ashamed of herself! <br /> <br /> If you LIKE this (and I know that some people may care less about a real woman artist and just love historical costumes and hot sex), you will probably like Dangerous Beauty with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack. Similarly, based on a heavily rewritten story, with many billowing piles and cubes with gems: Bon appetit!
