When I first saw the cover of this film (a gigantic mistake chasing several nurses) and the name “Blue Monkey”, I knew that no big Hollywood movie was waiting for me. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Reilsbek in this film with cheese, which always copes well with any role that it performs ... Forex is quite banal, there is not much of a plot, still not sure why this film is called “Blue Monkey, because this film has nothing to do with a monkey. But come on people what did you expect ?? In fact, this is not as bad as it seems ... If you like old black-and-white films about the attacks on mistakes in the style of the 50s, then this is basically an updated version, without special special FX updates.
