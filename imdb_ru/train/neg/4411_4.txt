Michael Rucker is a decent actor, but he has no right to be the leader, except in a low-budget film. He really doesn't have that much charisma. Rio Ishibashi has a lot more presence on the screen, and, unfortunately, he is not really the main character. Most of the screen time is spent on the brick boat. <br /> <br /> Daniel Harris (from Halloween films 4 and 5) plays his daughter, and she is cute and interesting, but written as not very smart and one of her stupid mistakes kills one of the main characters. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldtveit and Stephen First are here in interesting roles. Just watching what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays Conciliar in front of the local mafia godfather, and it's hard to say if he works like a comedy on the film. Tim Tomerson is also in this film. He seems to be present in every film with a very low budget. Thierson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film, he felt like a cheat. Is this a parody of a movie about yakuza? It is difficult to say in some points. Of course, the yakuza act very little. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of “The Bandits and the Guns” is formidable and well raised. Some of these types of films have Gangsters who look like they work in a local comic book store or as a boy in Piggly-Wiggly. In general, this film is very uneven. In some moments it looks like a comedy or a parody. Then in other places it works like a good fighter. Then it ends. Without the contribution of Daniel Harris and Rio Ishibashi, this film would rate Zero in my humble opinion.
