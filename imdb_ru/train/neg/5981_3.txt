I just watched this movie (mostly because it’s Brady Corbet), and I have to say that I didn’t like it. <br /> <br /> Of course, computer graphics were awesome, but the storyline needed a little refinement. In addition, I think this film would have been much better with more curses and blood if it were rated as PG-13. <br /> <br /> This will definitely attract more people to see this -> teens. What would also attract more teenagers (especially teenage girls) would be a big close-up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film had its flaws, I still saw it and thought it was all right!
