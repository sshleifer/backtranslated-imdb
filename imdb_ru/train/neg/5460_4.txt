It is curious that the 6th season of the Columbo series contained only three episodes, and, at least in two scenarios, there was very little evidence of quality based on this episode "man-in-the-mac" and "Disappear in Murder." . <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is not by chance that Peter Fableman wrote both of the above scenarios (by the way, he plays the role of a killed guard here) <br /> <br /> This adventure is very rarely convincing, and many performers are simply not interested in the material. The story is rather underdeveloped with some long periods of boring conversation. <br /> <br /> Colombo is also in the shadow of a colleague (similar to The Last Salute to the Commodore), but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, the characteristic of Celeste Holm, which is intended to create a comedy, causes embarrassment, not laughter. <br /> <br /> The script is rejected to deal with the family history, and the killer does enough to present the Colombo case, although there are no credible discussions regarding the motives for her crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, what turns out to be, perhaps, the worst adventure of Colombo, is the funniest moment in the series. He tests a male barber while doing a haircut / manicure. The next 5 minutes are fun - just Colombo's hair is so perfectly groomed that he cannot afford to pay the bill, and then when he asks the jewelers, he continues to glance in the mirror to admire his hairdo! <Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only worthy moment from the script that looks like it was forged in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for Colombo graduates.
