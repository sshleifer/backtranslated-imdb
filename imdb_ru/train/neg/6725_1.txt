What could be a fascinating and emotionally intense exploration of character is completely undermined by a predictable factor. Fox is fine, like Nathaniel Ayers, a musician trained by Julliard, who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney Orchestra, until his bouts of schizophrenia drive him out and ultimately stumble. In search of a good story that contributes to his outstanding career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert 'Downey Rehabilitation Center} meets him and tells his story. Taking each element of the classic film “How we hit the skid”, borrowing very liberally from “Perfect Mind”, inventing a fake “I feel good” attitude to films like “Rocky” - you choose the number of the sequel - and also beat a great melodrama of style 30 -s, all that remains on the screen is the burnt film shell. It is trite, trite, quite predictable and too often plays on our feelings. I hate to say it, but this is the film that, if you say you hate it, people will look bad at you. I really would like to say something positive about this film, but I really can't. The current act redeems it somewhat, but not enough for me to give him more than one star. Strictly made for tv movies. Not worth your time.
