Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, although I have been using it as a reference for a long time. Therefore, I would like to welcome you all. The fact that I am Greek will inevitably affect my judgment, I hope this does not annoy you. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life (everything that we, the Greeks, in fact, did), analyzing the epic Omirus (and not Homers, as you see everywhere), rhyme behind rhyme. If I remember well, it was the Iliad (Iliad) in 8th grade and Odyssey (Odyssey) in 9th grade. Troy Warner was a big disappointment for me and my fellow Greeks on campus (I study in the UK). <br /> <br /> Eliad Iliad is one of the best works in literary history. It was compiled by the Greek poet Omirus 400 years after the war. Historians call the Trojan War around 1200 BC, and the real cause of the war is not in the beauty of Helen, but in the strategically important position of Troy. However, it can now be understood that the Omirus epic does not represent actual events (since it is not historically accurate), but it has never been the goal of this work. <br /> <br /> Reading this huge poem, one may wonder about the very definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty, and so on. The best and most educational part of these long conversations between warriors before the battle. None of this has been revealed in Troy. <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap for my eyes, as well as for other intelligent people, English Finnish and German colleagues from me. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics did all the work), and yet this is the best work of Wolfgang Petersen. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I say that you had better look at something else. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. This is a really expensive film "B". <br /> <br /> Greetings <br /> <br /> Alex
