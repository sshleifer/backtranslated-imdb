I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD came out in 1986, it was widely criticized by critics, and I say that panning is so awful that more or less put an end to Eddie Murphy’s brilliant career, so I think the film has something suitable. /> <br /> It all starts badly when Buddhist monks kneel before a child with a blank expression on their face. Bad guys enter the temple <br /> <br /> A child sits with a blank expression <br /> <br /> Bad guys hack monks <br /> <br /> A child sits with a blank expression <br /> <Bad guys they pull out a giant bird cage and stick a child in it, which is now sitting with ... Keep guessing? You have the impression that even if they took him overnight at Michael Jackson's ranch, on which he still remained with the same empty expression, this film would have been better named “WOODEN CHILD” <br /> <br / > begins the title video, and it is a film of the 1980s, in which pop pop soundtrack sounds. Obviously, at the time it was cool and funny, but now, in 2004, it seems very outdated. And not only that, but a completely bloody discovery. In fact, this is the main problem (and, of course, serious) in this film. It seems that the mood changes from scene to scene so much that sometimes it looks like watching scenes from completely different films combined together. I personally blame the director, but it should also be noted that both the screenwriter and the producer must bear the same guilt. Did anyone know before the shooting, what kind of film would it be? This is partly fantasy, partly martial arts, partly friendly movies, partly comedy and all this crap
