for those of you who are desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original film, here is your chance, and then return to the real world. <br /> <br /> The guy who hid the gold in the first movie said Twitch, so he is transferred to another prison where fighters are fighting overboard and looking thoughtfully. Twitch plans to leave prison in a month to get gold in order to start a life with her woman. <br /> <br /> Then something happens, and someone will shoot himself, and the film turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler’s daughter is captured by all of this, so he twitches to find her and the Twitch woman. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the action is below normal, there’s a lot of (really annoying) rap and badly edited fight scenes. On the other hand, he has a Latin American guy who plays a major role in every prison / action movie / action movie and closes the door to that. <br /> <br /> It is not very saturated, but at least it is harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a big fan of the original, that's fine. <br /> <br /> If not, you were warned.
