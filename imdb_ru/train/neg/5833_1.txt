3lbs is obviously a self-indulgent program for Stanley Tucci to become a producer / capricious deep doctor. Unlike House, he has absolutely no individuality, and unlike Gray's anatomy, the cases of brain surgery are not even interesting. It is assumed that this program will be installed in the leading center for neurological diseases - but there is nothing interesting or exciting about this! Even the so-called pitiful “enmity” between him and his rival adds nothing to the show, as well as these hallucinations. The pilot had a brief look at the social life of fathers in the role of father - put off! boring and pointless. <br /> <br /> This is a show in pants, there are a lot of medical dramas at the moment, and this does not make it special.
