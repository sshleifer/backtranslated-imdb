As a child, Joe Strummer was my hero, but even the film left me cold. Fortunately and unfortunately, “The Future is not written” is not a simple documentary in the style of “Behind the Music”. Rather, it is a biographical feature film, filled with interviews, shootings, home movies and mostly meaningless animated sketches taken from Farm Animals. The film is consistent but durable for about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The format of the campfire, though touchingly thoughtful, is actually quite annoying in execution. First, without names it is difficult to even understand who half of these respondents are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack lick their ass about this man? They had nothing to do with Strammer’s life, and their opinions add nothing to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture, at best, when Strummer, through videotaped interviews and conversations, touches on aspects of his life that most people didn’t know about: his elder brother’s suicide, reconciliation with the death of his parents, joy paternity. It was very touching for me, because Joe Strummer showed that this is not a punk icon that we all knew and loved, but an ordinary person who had to face the joys and sorrows of life that we all have to face. <br /> There were better, simpler documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and the MTV documentary from the early 1990s, told by Kurt Loder, come to mind.) Joe Strummer: "The future is not written" is intended only for the inflexible.
