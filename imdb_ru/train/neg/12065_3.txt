When I was a child and lived with my sister, she bought all the horror films she could find, and that was one of them. The VCR just became a household item, and we had no other than about 150 films, and we watched the hell of them all. <br /> <br /> I was on sale in the yard the other day, and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY, and I buy any horror movie I don’t have, and I knew that this movie looked familiar. I thought for a second and realized that this is the one that my sister bought. She sold it many years ago in the yard, I guess - who knows. <br /> <br /> I remembered nothing about it and looked at the evening when I bought it, and it refreshed my memory because of several scenes. I am not sure how I felt about this in childhood, but I am sure that I liked it because it was new to me, and then I watched and enjoyed everything. <br /> <br /> I’m a terrible fan, but there are certain requirements for me to consider it "good" and this one failed. It was one of those conversations, conversations, conversations and tiring me to death. What kind of death scenes you see are made using a shadow on the wall, followed by a splash of blood, and if you're lucky, you will get so much. <br /> <br /> The story is good, and I saw several with similar plots, so I think this should be buried and forgotten. Don't look at these people until you get to your feet.
