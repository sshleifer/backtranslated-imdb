When I was 11 years old, Grease 2 was like a crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric and highly addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it again and again and again, until we fainted or became too embarrassed and hostile to stand against each other. So, if you're an 11-year-old girl, and you saw this film as “brilliant,” “fun,” or “better than the original lubricant,” you should blame your young hormones, and you can be sure that this uncompromising fixation with complete trash will pass. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no reason to assume that Grease 2 was anything other than insane, unsophisticated, embarrassed embarrassment for everyone who participated in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For the sake of criticism, I now appreciated the film, explaining why it blows ?? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-performed musical, the songs should promote the narration or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with some controversial exceptions, this is obscenely meaningless for music. It seems that most of the songs speak excessively and in general terms about the suspicious allusion to sex ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin"), without making any specific statement about any from the characters of the movie or the theme. In addition, all music is inconveniently stupid, and no one in the cast does not demonstrate even the crudest similarity to the ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. T-birds should be cool, and at least somewhat cute, but instead each one is an annoying loser-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogherelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and commits him to a gang, Michael has to kick him on the ground, spit on him and dodge in order to fervently clean any part of his body he touched, But of course he takes it as if it were gold, because, despite the fact that they are a bunch of clumsy heads, there is no greater honor than being with T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Since Michael is handsome, intelligent, kind, resourceful and above average in all respects (despite his musical impotence), it is quite possible that Stephanie will eventually embrace him when he reveals himself as a man mask Stephanie, on the other hand, is untidy, with a jaw, foul odor, chewing gum, in a dirty sweatshirt, elegantly rough and trashy dingbat. Therefore, besides the fact that she is cute (I suppose), she does not have nice qualities, therefore the viewers are not given any excuse for the depth of Michael’s attraction to her. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I didn’t want to mention the serious inferiority of my predecessor, since there seems to be so many eccentrics who seem to consider such a comparison unfair. I will say this, nonetheless, to those of you who think that they want to return to this mess for the sake of olden times: Grease 2 is an experience similar to reliving your first kiss. Only you are now 32 years old, and you kiss a snotty 13-year-old child with acne and puffy braces. The magic disappeared and you were left feeling dirty and alarmed. Trust me.
