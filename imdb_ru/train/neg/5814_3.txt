The film did what it intended to do: to show how a young girl copes with poverty and reaches maturity. However, for most of us this topic has been adequately studied, and in most cases it was more complex than here. The film is fixated on a chest that soon became boring and I lost interest. If it was on TV, I would switch to the latest news in Starr Report. That's so boring, I found this movie.
