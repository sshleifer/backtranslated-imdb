I do not know what happens to the acting style or the vocal style of Donald Sutherland, but he seems to always act because of the huge wad of wet Kleenex. Is he just ... I don't know, THICK? Somnambulic? On medication? Strange. <br /> <br /> However, I just saw this film for the first time since its initial release, and, frankly, I donâ€™t remember it ended, somehow. Bad end, too, because nothing is tied. What about a dead husband? Annoying child (and was the child duplicated?)? Scotland Yard and military pursuers? I would like something to wrap up and dramatically cover all this, and not just a large panoramic gap. <br /> <br /> And what woman is sleeping with a man she knows has just killed her husband? Even if she tried to dispel the needles of the Needle to protect her child, she could always have a headache. This last meeting made me feel too itchy and uncomfortable ...
