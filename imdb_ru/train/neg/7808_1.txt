I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so, needless to say, I bought this film without even renting it or something else ... This film was so awful that I didn't even take it back to the store, I would I did not want anyone else to incur this human poison, I just threw it in the trash can, not to mention the money, it was worth the price to be able to throw it away. The game was not so bad, was not good or something like that. The story was terrible, and the ending was something I despise. He was broken by an alcoholic. his life was useless. I thought his horse, peanut, was a terrible means to show his childhood innocence, a dog would be much better. I also hate religion, so this ending has surely pissed me off. Jesus heals everyone ... I hate the fact that I know people like huge Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not heal everyone or something like that. It was a terrible film, if you have the opportunity to watch it, transfer it, or, even better, buy it or rent it, throw it in the trash and leave coffee grounds on it in the morning.
