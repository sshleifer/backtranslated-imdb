Alien Obsession Dannielin Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, she is likely to grow psychotic, depressive, or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she wanted privacy. Now, poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a recluse and said: "I want to be alone." How much does ET spend on this little girl? Does ET have anything better to report? I bet there are a lot of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were. By the way, I have never heard Anna Nicole win any of these lawsuits on her will and her inheritance. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard, and little Dannielin? Could this be ET?
