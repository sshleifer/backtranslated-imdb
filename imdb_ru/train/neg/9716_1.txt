This is without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of a movie with poor expectation and actors. It sounds as if reading directly from the manuscript for the first time. Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character, as in the Police Academy - the same stupid womanizer - and this is not suitable for the leader in what was supposed to be a thriller. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to believe that Hanson would make “LA Confidential” ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague ...
