Man, even Plan 9 from space is better than this film. This film lacks a plot for half an hour, but they managed to extend it for eternity for more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in these exaggerated fighting scenes, but things like The Legend of Phong Sai Yuk are much better than this sad thing that is better left unattended.
