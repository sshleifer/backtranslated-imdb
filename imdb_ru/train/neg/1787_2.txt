I liked Batman: Dead End. Batman's dark, sharp noir film was perfect. Batman: deadlock is good. This is not true. <br /> <br /> First of all let me start with the game. None of this is so good. The best is likely to be Clark Bartram in the role of Batman. But that says little. At first glance, he is good, and then you realize that he is who he is, a bodybuilder who turned out to be a tolerant actor. But basically the problem is that Batman has no place in daylight, he looks like a freak running around in a bat costume. Instead of a terrible scar, a man tries to make up for the mistakes of the past. Daylight also brings out the annoying gloomy sullen expression on Bartram’s face, which never disappears and is not noticeable in Batman: Dead End, probably because of the short darkness so desired in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that the frowning and stubbornly shaking his head is working, it is not, it is quite the opposite. This is called posing, which real actors avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood why Collor chose bodybuilders as the main characters. It is much more sensible to give the role to an actor who can control it, and not a bodybuilder who can manage it, but HE HE LOOKS SO SO MUCH AS A COMIX! Of course, they could do better if Kollora’s dialogue didn’t leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The whole trailer (yes, the trailer. There will not be a full-length movie) is more centered around Superman then Batman. But everything on the side of Superman is banal, cloying and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He stands around, smiles, says his lines. That's all. Although I am not surprised, as he is just a bodybuilder whom they hired and may have received several acting lessons. Once again I say Collora, rented actors. Not bodybuilders. The actors will be so attractive that we will forgive the fact that they do not look like comics. <br /> <br /> Costume is what you expect from Superman. As for the costume of Batman. Well, I think it looks good only in the dark. I say this because in some pictures the costume looks as if you were buying it from a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman is flying in this film. But this is not a good thing. These frames look especially amateur. That and most of the “movie” looks like it was taken in the backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a snapshot of Superman catching the car in his hands. And the last shot from the “Two Faces” and “Batman” at the very end. For those of you who have seen the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now, if only he could stretch that shot through the entire trailer. <br /> <br /> Finally, I ask. Why, if you are trying to show your director abilities, would you make a trailer in the form of a short film? It proves nothing when it comes to becoming a real director. My only advice for Collora here is the difference between the ability to tell a story and the ability to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End did not feel like an amateur. I can not understand where it went wrong.
