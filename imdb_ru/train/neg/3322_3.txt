Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever watched was 42nd Street. I then expected that all his things would be so good. I found that this is not necessarily the case, even here, with my favorite actor from the classical era, James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Oh, the musical numbers at the end are just as impressive as ever, but the story is similar to many others and is quite tiring. It seems they are always associated with screaming, unhappy producers of the show. In this film, Cagney shouts out things so often that after a while my head starts to hurt, and his character quickly exhausts ... quickly! <br /> <br /> Even the songs are somewhere nearby "42nd Street", songs that can be sung for years, for years, I would say. The songs in this film are not remembered. No, this is one of the few early Cagney films — and Berkeley’s films — I don’t like at all, and I was very disappointed while watching.
