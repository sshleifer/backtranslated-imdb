I do not know why I continue to do this with me !! I continue to defend the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credits and chances ... and then they hit you on the head with such rubbish as this one! Intensive care is a terrible production and perhaps the worst thing ever made in the Netherlands. This is an attempt by the Dutch to create our own horror franchise, clearly based on the classic American classic slasher, such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. Producers and writers are aiming very high for this, but have fallen very low. Intensive therapy has become an embarrassing product for everyone who participated in it, and therefore became a real cult film. It is almost impossible to track down the original copy of this, and this is only shown in special cases, such as “Night of Disgust”. For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even create a storyline ... then it turns into an unconvincing film with a cramped brain with terrible, but very funny and cheap makeup effects. The acting of the whole team is disgusting, although there are several respected names. The main male role is played by Cohen Wouters ... This guy may be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a favorite singer, a leading TV series and the idol of many young girls. However, he never mentions this thing, which starred. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he is trying to convince himself that there has never been intensive therapy.
