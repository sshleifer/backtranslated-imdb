Deal was an unforgettable film that led to the great celluloid film director Indra Kumar. The movie was followed by Beta, Ishk, Raja and Masti, and they were all great. <br /> <br /> But every successful director gives some horrible movies along with some hits. Pire Mohan is one of those films. <br /> <br /> Although comedy and tell well, but the audience does not laugh. Compared to how comedy films are made today, this is nonsense. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please do not watch it. Because a pathetic comedy makes you cry. <br /> <br /> In short, the film should be missed.
