This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen in the whole year. <br /> <br /> First, I will say that the acting was very good, and all the actors. <br /> <br /> This was apparently, it should be very unusual, and in this respect it was possible. In addition, the story revolves around an egocentric imitator, who is an ignorant, incompetent chronic liar whose source of confidence is leather slippers. <br /> <br /> It was worse than watching a car accident.
