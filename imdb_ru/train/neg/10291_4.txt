80 minutes, and it felt twice as long! A brief intersection is not short enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes or almost entirely consist of a dialogue (in fact, rather a monologue) of a woman who has reached middle age, tirelessly talking about “men”, disappointment, sex, aging, and the recent separation from the French of the teenager she met in the ship’s cafeteria. <br /> <br /> The tedious monologue continues when they go to the duty-free shop and the bar, where, finally, her self-satisfied exalted force pushes him away. Of course, this “story” cannot end there, so she persuades him to listen to her drone when she brings him to her cabin. <br /> <br /> It’s hardly enough little romance, sex or anything else of this whole movie, except for bitter ranting, if you’re not one of those who love drama, where there’s nothing interesting does not happen. Yes, the ending is very well done, but it is not very pleasant to expose yourself to what turns your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people like it. I could be wrong.
