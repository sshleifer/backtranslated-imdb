As much as I didn’t like to say “I, too,” in response to other comments, it’s absolutely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing to do with the endless movement, which includes the next 90. <br /> <br /> Being banned somewhere, the film will not be watchable. The fact that he does not look like a Hollywood product does not make him trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Even worse, in addition to the lack of a noticeable plot (except for the fact that there are many dirty places in Russia and many people, even very old women, drink a lot of vodka) some visual effects are so unnecessarily nauseous that I enter in my second pack of rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for the spoilers, well, the film is so devoid of any narrative thread. I could not have written one if I had tried. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money and do not confuse it with a good Russian cinema.
