I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators believe that children today want silly versions of good GI JOE stories ??? The Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they were not created to be Xtreme, I mean, come on !!! Tiny Toons is a great example of how to update an old idea without losing its original charm, but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate solutions that they want to create a cheap idiotic show that kids will love because hey !! ! Do kids love superheroes right ??? the whole performance is a waste of time when we see new versions of Looney Tunes, but this time in the form of a superhero it doesnâ€™t sound too bad, but the problem is that this show is trying too hard to copy TV shows such as the Batman cartoon or the new league justice result ??? bad copies of flash (road runner) or superman (who else ??? bunny beetles) the problem is that Looney Tunes should not have been dramatic, they should have been funny !!!! as I said before this show sucks, and many people wonder why anime captures the whole world ??? This show is trying to be dramatic and intense action, but this is what few TV shows and animes can do if you want to see a good update of old Tiny Toons shows, this is an example that can be brought back to life. old characters, but with a good story and respect for the original roots. Too bad the show is already dead, another corporate wise decision, I suppose.
