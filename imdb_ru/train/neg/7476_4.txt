Evil aliens owe a huge debt to Peter Jackson's early films “Bad Taste” and “Brain Dead”. I have to admit that I never got much pleasure from these films, and I say the same thing about it. Jake West is a director who clearly lacks his own inspiration, and he wants to steal from those he looks at. I lost count of how many times the main Hollywood film was quoted, especially James Camerons “Aliens.” The amount of blood and blood on the show here is also not funny, the last end of the film gets tired and pulled out. Maybe it would have worked better, like a short film. The actors are bad, the direction is weak, the plot does not exist. I see what the director was trying to do, the tribute he was trying to pay, but others did the same thing much better than the one presented here. 4/10
