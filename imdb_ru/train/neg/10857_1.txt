Check out the movie site, more time was spent creating this than writing a script for this movie. It could not be more in his boasting. Original story? Original? They must have found the scenario hidden between the Old Testament, or they had legal consequences for this horns. High quality special effects? C'mon, I'd rather cope with the Atari 7600 and the jug with earwax. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, the funniest homemade video in America is still classic. I am sure that they had little money for this title, so, of course, the SF is not so good, or a bit bad, from time to time, or just ridiculous, but this story makes this film a waste of time. and money. Four stories rolled into one, and they were all brainless pieces of what they saw and did already.
