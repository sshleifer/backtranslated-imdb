Ooh man! That's what I'm talking about! As far as bad / cheese horror films go, this film was really in its class. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First, the film was not originally in English. This is normal because voice duplication was really exceptional! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialogue (and there are many more, where did it come from) ?? "I feel a little better. I just want to drink ?? TO YOUR BLOOD! ”<br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here is a play on the play about the interaction of military and scientists ?? <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "You can not do this? It will be a disaster! ”- Military officer:“ It's just science fiction ”(then it leads to a complete disaster, as the scientist predicted). <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "If you do this, many will die !!!" - Military officer: "You do not know what you are talking about." (he does this and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Don't do this? It will kill everyone!" - Military officer: “This is nonsense” (then he kills everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (did you understand). <br /> <br /> If this is not enough? there were a few scenes that really stood out as an instant classic! In one scene, the military literally 10 guys send weapons to two unarmed men. The leader shouts: “Go, take them!” And all 10 army guys, one by one, throw the weapon and beat with a fist into battle with two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. No attention has been paid to details! This movie even had a hip / upbeat 80s soundtrack to create a mood! <br /> <br /> And believe me ?? I understand that in this review there may be some spoilers, but in this epic there are so many goodies that I really only scratched the surface. A film of this scale is released only once in ten years! A true movie watching experience! Masterpiece! Blimey!
