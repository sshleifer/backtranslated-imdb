Do not listen to the misleading name "Werewolf Woman." Europeans are well known for emphasizing sex and nudity in their horror films, not real fears, but this is too much. The "Werewolf Woman" seems to have fun at the sex scene in which the title character goes crazy and brutally kills her partner. It's funny the first few times, but after a hundred minutes it gets very monotonous quickly. She is not even a werewolf, but a shizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film cannot even define its tone, since the first ten minutes (the memory) are a legitimate supernatural horror (I thought that after that I would fall into the trash classics) for a rather meager study of the character of a woman exposed to constant violence and torture of a thriller. In the end, the director claims that it is based on a true story. Yes, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are several entertaining aspects of production. The title werewolf woman is a spectator, and she has some good bloody effects and nude scenes. However, they quickly become monotonous. In addition, the dubbed dialogue is quite cheerful in a traveling manner, especially the coolest doctor in the world (he drinks at work). Unfortunately, the film becomes quite annoying quickly. There is no real plot or anything else really. It's a shame because, reading the description, I felt that the film has real potential. The "werewolf woman" is too long, slow and a little senseless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)
