::: SPOILER WARNING ::: <br /> <br /> Sooooo, Arnie is a really good guy, but after an incident with some fights in a helicopter and some disobedience to orders, he is sent to prison (or rather, some kind of work camp) . He runs away, but after a while he will be caught again. This time ends with a strange reality show in which he will have to run for a while from a group of tough guys with different themes and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he is stronger than even the coolest of the coolest guys. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be liked, being a fan of Arnie and all that. However, “Running Man” contains too many flaws that really annoy me. For example. Reconstruction of the Arnie battle inside the helicopter, where a brief summary of the incident with 5-10 different camera angles is shown to the shocked public. This means that the military helicopter on which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras shooting crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members beats Arnie. <br /> <br /> There are other shortcomings, and the plot, which in theory seems very interesting and innovative, works for some time, then it creates a group of nonsense and unrealism, in which it drowns. <br /> <br /> Acting cannot actually say, something is better than subpar, with Arnie in the lead role, the average performance of Arnie. The rest of the cast is bypassed without being particularly good or bad. <br /> <br /> Special effects are in order, but not impressive. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3/10
