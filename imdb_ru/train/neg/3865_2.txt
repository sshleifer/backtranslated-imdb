This is so incredibly bad. Poor actors. You may say that they are trying hard to polish the poop, but we all know that you cannot. The letter is so obvious and superficial that it is sad to see how they are trying to sell it. Humor and rhythm are so difficult that it is hard to believe that any of these good actors subscribed to this. <br /> <br /> However, it is so terrible that it is difficult for us to look away from the screen. We just need to know where this train wreck goes. But this is only because we caught it on TV. If we really paid for it, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> So he gets 2 stars for being at least funny / enthrallingly bad. And random music (as opposed to a heavy indie soundtrack) is ridiculously reminiscent of Scooby-Doo's episode ... but not so good
