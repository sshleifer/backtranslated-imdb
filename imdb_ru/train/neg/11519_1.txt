This is an absolutely stupid film I've ever seen. What a waste of a great shot. This is James Cromwell, who plays the role of an ignoramus. I could go on and on, but I obviously will spend more time on this review than anyone has ever done on the script. The only thing about this film is about us against them and how to revel in the profane farce beyond the tolerance of any reasonable person. This is one of the 10 worst films I've ever seen, and I love James Garner.
