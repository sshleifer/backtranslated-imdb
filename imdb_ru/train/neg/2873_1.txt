In this film, a gorgeous brunette named Daniel Petty. She has stunning green eyes, and she is in the first few scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing in this film that does not repel. She may not have a future as an actress, because this type of film is an insulting catastrophe that kills careers. <br /> <br /> The film itself has absolutely nothing to recommend. This is not a good horror film, or a fake journalistic report, or remotely well done. There is no skill evident in its production. This is like a bad student film. The terrible elements of this story do not make you sick, and the fact that it is so poorly done makes you sick. I would give this film ZERO stars if I could.
