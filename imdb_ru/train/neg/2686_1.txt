First of all, I'm not American or Middle Eastern. Secondly, I have no religion. The closest thing to religion I have is sport and movies. Henceforth, I believe that it would be best for me to express an opinion about neutrality and to be free from bias. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are a shame. This horrible event should be used to honor the memory of all those innocent people who were killed by "some" barbaric and uncivilized idiots. Instead, much of what I saw in these short films was a vain attempt to score various political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Ken Loach Segment. Of course, we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country, but what does this have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two evils do not give the right ?! No difference! This film should be subtitled for those who have trouble listening to a partially disjointed Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The fragment of Yusef Chane’s most worried. Obviously, he has problems with logic. He justified the killings because America is a democracy, and since some Americans voted for politicians in power, all Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions taken by their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this guy really ?? Some Americans don't even vote! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle East is; some don't even know which religion they practice there; and most do not know the real political issues that are playing behind the scenes. ### Mr. Chain, the reason we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your logic. Innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from all over the world. Killed firefighters, rescuers, office workers, unauthorized persons and passengers of the flight have nothing to do with politics. And yet we are not allowed to live, because "some" people think that everyone should choose a side or religion. We are perceived as an honest game for extreme politicians. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its victims. Another director uses this event to promote his own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think of "me, me, me." Sometimes it is about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) The Idrissa Wedraogo segment is a joke and another political scorer. They obviously want money from the international community, emphasizing their poverty. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> This film tarnishes the memory of the victims of “September 11, 2001”. <br /> <br /> The best thing for this is a trash can.
