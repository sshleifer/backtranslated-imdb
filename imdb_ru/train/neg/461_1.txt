Warning: avoid this horrible, horrible movie ... if you watch it, you will be sooooooo disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are now grandmothers, what are they doing? Trying so hard to be young, innocent and sexy, just not working ALL. Pam and Denise act terribly in this movie. <br /> <br /> Plus the script is absolutely terrible, I can not believe that anyone can put forward such stupid ideas. With the development of the film industry, movie lovers are not as easily satisfied as in the last century. I can argue that viewers of the past century will also hate it. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this. I think that watching White Chicks since 2004 is a lot better than that ... without a mistake at the time, I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
