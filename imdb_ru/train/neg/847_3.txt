The film tells about two brothers who should be similar to each other - but in no case should not be smart - one surgeon and the other is able to write computer code. Geniuses, as they like to call themselves, sound very exaggerated when compared with personal characteristics that you can see from the headline material. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I didn’t like the style of the film. I believe that the anxiety, confusion and deep blues that he brings exist for a specific purpose, but what I don’t understand is why there are so many of them. The film is cheap on stage and tells the story mostly without the human aspect. It gives comics like experience. However, he visually stuns the viewer, he somehow immerses him in the blues with short dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic cutaway, music and harsh noises. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is very simple, most of what is happening is dramatically imprinted over long minutes, mostly in the confusing imitation of nonsense effects of drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I will say openly that this film did not meet my expectations.
