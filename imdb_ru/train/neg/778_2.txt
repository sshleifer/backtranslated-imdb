What has Ireland ever done with film distributors who seek to represent the country in such a derogatory way? This film begins as a textbook for cinematographers on Irish cinematic stamps: ugly priests, spitting before handshakes, cattle in the town square, riding bicycles through the meadows of the country against the background of anodic folk music. It quickly becomes apparent, however, that the main theme of the film is “Big Dad of Irish Cliches” - religious strife. This is about a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic child is studying, which seems like a reasonable desire, but not to the villagers of Weksford County in the 50s, with whom she has to live. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, she decides to go to Belfast and then to Scotland, where several more cliches are repeated. While she is there, her father (who looks creepy like George Lucas) and the family are being boycotted at home, which becomes very unpleasant. I'm not going to play the final, not because I think that people should go and see this film, but because it is not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the main character: we have to sympathize with her, but in the end, instead, we encourage her to live. Villagers are represented as fanatics whose prejudices should be confronted, but hurting your children seems like an inappropriate way to handle this. In addition, it takes on the burden under which it relentlessly staggers, trying to draw analogies with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: her lawyer tells the woman that she "must establish preconditions" for her return. The film is said to be based on a true story, but its themes were considered much more creatively and with less use of beaten stamps in the past.
