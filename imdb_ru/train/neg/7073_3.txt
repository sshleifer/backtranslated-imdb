We have an average family. Papa is a famous rapper, we have a “rebellious teenage daughter”, a foster white baby and a cute little baby. And we have a careless housekeeper, on which show was such a housekeeper? Do we have a spoiled Brady Bunch? Hooray! When he first came out, I thought it was really cool, mainly because I was young. The music was bad. The raps were so bad, and they were too appreciated. All his raps were about his family, friends and problems. Dad was the father of the type of "full house danny". Always gave advice. But he was not a pure freak. They had an economy for this. Remember? The plots were mostly from Lil Romeo had some problems, or ... not all. Oh, and maybe some kind of drama for kids. Yes this is good. Not really. But it is still a good show for children. But Nikelodean could do better.
