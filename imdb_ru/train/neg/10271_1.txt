This movie was supposed to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The game was terrible, terrible and tender, and talk about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again and will not recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the film began, I realized what I got involved in. All they did for this film was copying scenes from many other horror films and merging them into one movie. Jokes, calls, Halloween night, psycho and one knife! This is absolutely ridiculous. I wasn't scared during the movie, which I thought horror films should have done. As for making a movie, it's quite funny how they all talk about how this movie was so wonderful and so scary. I mean, as you do not understand that films are a cheap excerpt from The Dread Cinema, for example. At the very least, invite good actors there, and then maybe this will be shot like a good horror movie.
