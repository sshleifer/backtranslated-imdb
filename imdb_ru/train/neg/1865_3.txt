Well, what can I say, there are B-Grade films and B-Grade films, and this definitely refers to the latter. However, since it is obvious that even the filmmakers know that this is not a trustworthy film (take a look at the closing credits), you can forgive it. <br /> <br /> The plot is mostly convicted for killing a psychopath. He accidentally mixed his genetic material with some experimental acid, which mixed and then got lost in the snow. The killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you can believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, is chasing the rural town of Sheriff, who put him behind bars. At the same time, Jack Frost eventually kills half the city. <br /> <br /> This film lacks real panic, and the effects alone remind me of the B-Grade films of the 50s. This alone is worth a look at laughter. Film to pass the time.
