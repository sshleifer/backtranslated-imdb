I know that in this episode there are other things besides what I am going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, the fact that after we got a very negative opinion about Gene, seeing the Sun’s memories in the House of the Rising Sun, we will see Gene’s side and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But this story has an element that makes me so uncomfortable that it greatly weakens my enjoyment of the whole episode. Prior to that, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, they hinted that Sun's father was a man who had become rich using shady, illegal methods. I thought maybe he was even the boss of the mafia; In Korea, mobs work like almost all countries of the world, so this was a reasonable opportunity. However, in this episode, we learn that Song’s father is actually the boss (or top manager) of the Korean car company, and that what Jin did physically attack the official (whom they were actually going to kill) His name. <br /> <br /> I may be particularly touchy because of this, because I happened to work in the automotive industry, but I would say that it is explicitly offensive and racist even to assume that this happens in Korea. ; huge, serious companies, such as Hyundai or Kia (which should be the model for this fictitious automobile company, as they are the only ones that actually exist), work with these mafia methods, and not like ordinary automobile companies in the West. it’s just incredible for me that the authors would have had the opportunity to write something similar in history, and that there was no noise in Korea because of that. Looks like a stranger "Buy an American!" propaganda depicting foreign automobile companies as criminal, unreliable third-world outfits.
