This film started well, I felt like I was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Very soon, I began to question the situations and actions of the main characters and did not find answers to the question of why they do what they do. All the performances were great, but only a few scenes had short moments when they were really funny. Dan Cortese was awesome. I loved him in that role. His agent should show this film to agents. Look at the first few scenes, and then find something better, otherwise you will be completely immersed in this mess. I found this in a trash can in a video store. It cost me two dollars, and because of the rarity of this film, I feel that it was a good price.
