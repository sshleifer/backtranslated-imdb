This is undoubtedly one of the most boring and terrible reports about the first days of Adolf Hitler’s existence that I’ve ever watched. Robert Carlisle is a wonderful actor, but to call him Hitler is simply wrong. In order to introduce Lieb Shrieber to his long-time friend and the help of Hitler, Haifengstal must have issued cries of despair and suffering from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. J-W plays a Nazi supporter, bad bad bad casting. It was not a pleasant family film with a good historical past. It was Hollywood trash in all its glory, earned by the strength of a strong (but extremely underused) cast, which seemed to have almost disappeared from the current radar over the past 5 years. <br /> <br /> Fake German accents (vee vill vin zis var) offend German people everywhere. My mother is German and she sat buzzing at the sound of voices who continued to switch from American / English / German in one sentence. The supporting cast makes the best cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on the screen. Jenna Malone, like the doomed Geli Raubal, was gorgeous, although she caught the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who eventually ended her life to avoid what her future might be in the shadow of Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you want to get an incredibly fantastic and historically accurate account of Hitler’s early years that led to the war / Holocaust and turned it on, hire the 1983 Inside the Third Reich with Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi in the role of Hitler. It was good and made more sense than this nonsense. <br /> <br /> As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you that I reached out to my books to confirm their innumerable inaccuracies.
