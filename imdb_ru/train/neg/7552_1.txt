Wicker man has done the impossible! She replaced Catwoman as the worst movie in my mind. Yes, it really is that bad. So bad that, sitting down to write this review, I thought to myself: "If I had a choice to either watch this movie again, or stick red hot needles into my eyes," I could really go for red hot needles. <Br /> <br /> Neil LaButh created a rare film in which Joel Schumacher could sit down and say with comfort and free mind: "Yes, there is some kind of bad leadership." <br /> <br /> I think the first clue for I should have been the label: "Some sacrifices must be made." Of course, this may sound like a cheeky ominous line to intrigue you, but the victim will be all on the side of the screen audience. Believe me, the people responsible for this film should be accused of hate crimes ... or at least fraud for trying to pass it off as something like entertainment. Seriously! The film tells about the island, where men are only for reproduction, and I would still prefer to get stuck on the island of Gilligans with some photos of Condoleezza Rice, and then be stranded there. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part about this movie was the guy who tore up the loudest fart I ever heard in a movie theater. This is not a joke and not fiction. I've never been to a thriller and heard so much laughter throughout the film. I cannot tell you with certainty whether this laughter was intentional, in order to ease the cinematic tension, or if they simply really thought that this brat would fly away. Honestly, I got into a power outage or maybe a fight that broke out in the cinema, whatever, to make it more interesting, which is pretty sad, since Deese, Powder and I packed 2 beers each before the film just for a small mental stress. anesthesia (will soon become law before all Nic Cage films, write to your congressman today, do not delay). At some point I really thought that maybe this film was actually a fake, and Anna Ferris is going to show herself, oh, how I want. <br /> <br /> Nick Cage throws out so much ham per shot, which I think about having done a cholesterol test today. To think that I ever thought that Sean Penn was crap for slamming Nek in acting, oh, is he still crap, a little less than one? Yes, Dan Sean Penn has been reduced because of this film. Give us all mercy, Nick, show your strength and be pathetic losers and drunks. You can not play superman, whom you can not play in strong and energetic roles, go straight to prison, do not pass, do not collect 200 dollars. His best moments in this film are when he is finally upset and actually beats a hefty woman to steal her bear costume (like a fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review), and then begins to lose her temper like Conan O'Brien is a masturbating bear, but with half the gaiety of a bear knocking down his trash. Fortunately, he met his end soon after it turned out that he would be the victim of the crowd on the new touring show Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I just ruined the finale for you, and if you knew something better, you would build my statues in worship and sing the songs of my legend. I sat on this shitty fest, so you don't need to. <br /> <br /> About halfway through this little misadventure, which I kept thinking to myself, Jack Bower would have finished this business in 20 minutes of real time. 35 minutes if Kim is attacked by a mountain lion. Even Steve Martin in the role of Inspector Kluzo could understand it in less than an hour, and you, sir, are not an inspector of Kluzo. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you were captured, and you have the choice to watch this movie or take a bullet, take a bullet. <br /> <br /> Somewhere Uwe Ball laughs at all of us.
