Listening to the director's commentary confirmed what I suspected while watching the movie: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play in a movie. The plot is what teenagers are misled when they go through the “I could write a comedy film / screenplay / award-winning” stage. There is a germ of an interesting idea buried there (probably because it is the continuation of someone else's film), but it is completely buried according to a signed, poorly executed and ridiculously rash script. <br /> <br /> The lines are terrible and the performances are unattractive, although, again, I tend to blame the director. It seems that he did not consult with the actors at all about what was required, rather took the script in their hands, showed the camera to them and told them to continue. Who knows, having participated a little, these actors could show themselves better (tell me what you like about the musicians in the cinema, John Bon Jovi performed well in Row Your Boat and is more than acceptable in the “Lead”). <br /> <br /> In its current form, the cast has no chemistry. A great opportunity to use the classic parallel between sex and vampirism is missed when a blood transfusion is given to an infection of a character Bon Jovi with the blood of a vampire from his sick co-hunter. She had to bite him. Keep in mind, they had to look vaguely interested in each other throughout the film. The only real moment of sexual tension between two women is, by the director’s own admission, random entry. Initially, he intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for a more meaningless presentation of the plot - so I suppose the finished product could be worse. But a little. <br /> <br /> Honestly, in the course of the movie, it is badly drawn, stupid and forgotten. Even when dirty films go, it is not sexy or horrible enough to be interesting. It could have been a funny and bloody little joke, but the director stayed with a comedy for all the wrong reasons.
