The original film “The Man from the Snow River” is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. The plot of the Lady and the Vagabond in two senses - the rich girl / poor boy and the ability against the pedigree. The sequel, however, is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original, but also a ridiculous, bloated Disneyfied confusion, best named "Rambo Meets Black Stallion." Without the charm of the Black Stallion. The young hero returns after a three-year absence, and suddenly he becomes a Superman on horseback; in the original good movie, it was real and believable, but, unfortunately, in the sequel it turned into a caricature. I was hardly so disappointed in the film, and sometimes it made me very angry - they almost missed the cliche. Insolent manipulation of the audience - do the studio leaders really think that all you need to do with an audience loving horses is to put cute horses in front of them to make them happy? The mess of the movie.
