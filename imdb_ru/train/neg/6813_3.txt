Jean Rollin - artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the search for immortality. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and the photo is amazing. Dialogue is meaningless. This is a funny mess. It's great to look, but like any semblance of a horror movie or a thriller, it's just awful. I'm trying to find out if we are afraid or not. At the same time is it put on or not? This is a strange combination of a film and horror, which is never too confusing, and although it is pleasant to look at it, it does not seem to mean anything, and it is by no means scary, even if a random frame or episode creates a moment of quivering fussy chatter. . Something that can be left in the background as a live wallpaper for those who love naked women.
