Deep sh .. more like it! Eels are just shown in the cartoons above the film. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpeet" meets the "Leviathan." Very tasteless. <br /> <br /> There is no development of character or relationship. The so-called "romantic" scenes are very trite and predictable. An interesting idea, but a poorly written script and special effects of LOUSY make it certainly incomprehensible!
