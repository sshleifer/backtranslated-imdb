Chris, the adoptive son of a moral family, a loser who works in a school newspaper with Kate (Christina Lakin from the terrible sweet show Step by Step from the now fortunately non-existent ABC TGIF), learns that he has just inherited the porn empire from his parents. He loses sight of what true friendship and love are, and blah blah, some other nonsense. He also has to argue with an uncle who wants to control the family business, and a running lawyer (isn't it?), A teenage comedy just below average, which steals from the best youthful comedies (the opening alone - HIGHLY American Pie-esquire) beats your head morally at every opportunity and wasting the only stellar talent he has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shay, and if I really stretch the stellar word, Martin Starr from Freaks and Geeks and Justin Burfield from Malcolm in the Middle) . This is definitely not bad, but far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: some topless extras <br /> <br /> My rating is: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until September 29)
