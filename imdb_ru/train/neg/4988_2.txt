In a sense, Time Corridors are a success story because the film achieves its goal: to be seen by the thousands. But it doesn’t make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs was successful because this item was an original way to consider time travel: forget about “Returning Zemeckis to the future”, here comes old France, the middle knight age and its almost barbaric way of life. Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he retains his honor. Then comes the sequel. <br /> <br /> No one foresaw the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it is useless to be a cinematographer to understand that Time Corridors are made for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries to justify the continuation with time. The paradox that would be required a second time. Explanation: It is useless to try to return the jewels that Jacqui has stolen; don't you remember that red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found the money? Selling jewelry ... And this is only one of many holes that Poiret is trying to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the characters: Montmirail doesn't change, it's just a little more boring. As for the Freenegonde ... that's another story: Valerie Lemercier decided not to compromise in this sequel so as not to get stuck in a bourgeois role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in such a way that I find her so miserable that she almost felt her pain. And Poiret does not understand that a group of humorists is not enough to create a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget about time travel, digital effects, concentrate on the story, and you will see that there is enough space on the postage stamp to write it 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film is landscapes. A film for young people, say, up to 13 years.
