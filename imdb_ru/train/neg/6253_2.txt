Not a very good film, but according to the information, it is quite accurate in depicting a torture technique. The purpose of the film was to show the cruelty of the POW camps, and this was done quite effectively, with surprising frankness for the time. Whatever the technical flaws (and there are many of them), seeing this, you will see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some rather unpleasant things - again, unpleasant, because it is done north of the DMZ, and not in Guantanamo Bay. <Br /> <br /> I don’t think that any Korean veteran raised his torture when he ran for office, and if you watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to movies in Vietnam. I do not know whether people in the 54th were trapped in the concepts of the Second World War (boys, as a rule, many wise men) or war or something else, but it’s interesting to see it from the same system that 16 years later would make films like "Tell the Spartans."
