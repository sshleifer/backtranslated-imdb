Throw this lame dog a bone. Oooh bad ... you can look anyway. Cole (Ross Hagen) - intergalactic bad guy who avoids evaporation due to excessive zeal of the spacecraft commander (Jan-Michael Vincent) Cole manages to steal the shuttle, which falls to the ground. An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring the villain dead or alive. John Philip Low plays a forester / parking attendant who is wary of these two visitors from afar. The costumes are outrageous, and the script lacks intelligence. Vincent probably took the money and ran. The law shows the only sign of effort. So it's almost ridiculous. Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, PJ. Soles and Dawn Wild Blacksmith.
