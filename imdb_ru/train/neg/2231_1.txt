All I can say after watching Snitch'd - please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you do not understand what you are making films about. If you insist on making films about gangsters, I urge you to do research. It is ridiculous to watch films with absurd bandits, which sound even more absurd when they speak. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the part where Mr. Cahill goes to school where only 3 students study, and continues to beat myself in Kung Fu fashion. This film was tough as special after school. Who had the idea of ​​wearing hats that say where the particular thug came from? I suspect that the real bandits do not wear hats, claiming that there is a gang. It would be stupid, given the new laws that increase the term of imprisonment, if a person is associated with a gang. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd - THE BIGGEST movie about bandits.
