If you want to know the real story of the Wendigo, I suggest you take a copy of the original story of Algernon Blackwell. This film was not only bad, but had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I really liked the book when I read it in my childhood (“Chillers by the fire” by E. M. Freeman), and I was so excited when I saw it. the film based on it came out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that the film had too many computer (politically correct) shades that were not in the film. When the book was written, the PC did not even exist. <br /> <br /> I suggest not to waste your time and money! If you see this on the shelf of a video store, leave it there.
