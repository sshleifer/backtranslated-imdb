By all accounts, it could be an interesting film. Showing the powerful Cradle Of Filth song, in which their frontman Dany played the main role “The Future of British Horror”, I expected that Alex Chandon’s bloody festival would justify deception. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is either cliché or inept. The installation of the anthology of the story was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Admittedly, the idea of ​​a “hospital room” really made me chill, but, as is the case with most films, a bad script and acting. <br /> <br /> Chandon cannot write dialogs. Each sentence of the chief police investigator is filled with curses and arrogance (the typical formula is “policeman on the edge.” Funny, I'm sure I have already seen it somewhere else ...) No, Shandon, you are not Tarantino, or Scorsese. It sounds bad. It's ridiculous to add that OTT plays very cleverly (don't get me wrong, Dani Filt is a wonderful singer and musician, but he is not an actor), and the performances sound ridiculous, like veins. Give me Bruce Campbell any day. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are generally bad, with some terrible CGI, terrible effects of blood (for God's sake, Peter Jackson did better, and that was more than a decade ago with less budget) and editing filters that are shrill replay! As for the often erroneous use of the score of the Cradle Of Filth ... man, they must sue. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Cradle Of Fear is that he takes himself seriously, trying to create an atmosphere and rekindle terror and repulsion in his audience. too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this much better with much more powerful blood effects (like maniac, zombie eater flesh, beyond, suspiria, etc.), making Cradle of Fear, in my look, second-rate and outdated. <br /> <br /> I hope that Chandon will be able to learn from this disgusting ghoul from the film and continue to do some kind of quality horror that is really scary. <br /> <br /> Next time, luckier.
