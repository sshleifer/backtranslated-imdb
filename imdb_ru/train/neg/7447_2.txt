I first read Lorna Doone about 20 years ago, and I really enjoyed it! This is a classic historical novel, founded in the 1600s, when the western country was a few days away from London, and compliance with law and order was much more difficult. Unfortunately, this version of the book has a few liberties with history and was incredibly disappointing, in my opinion. Valid and production values ​​are in order, but the way the story was corrupted was terrible. Why do television adaptations do this? Why do they think that thousands of book fans will want them to change the story ??? One of the great mysteries of life !!! The BBC made a great version that was televised on Christmas in the early 1990s, and I'm still trying to find a copy of it! Take my advice, read the book and do not worry about this scanty version!
