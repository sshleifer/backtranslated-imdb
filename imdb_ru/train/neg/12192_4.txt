I think we all start a lot of reviews with “It could make a BIG movie.” Freshly divorced mad former prisoner, a neat suburban family - his goal. Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Regular styling of Marty from Karo syrup. But, unfortunately, somewhere in the high-rise house of Universal, a memorandum was broken: everyone takes it. <br /> <br /> Nolte speaks only with raised eyebrows, Lange sneaks through cigarettes, Lewis "Omagod!" her way, although her scenes, and Bobby D. ... well, he's on another magic carpet. Striking a sort of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he chews fat cigars and giggles at random atrocities such as “Problem Child”. And I want you to present the emphasis mentioned above. Now imagine that he jumps out with all his might of religious rhetoric on the upper volume, as if he had swallowed six bibles, and you have De Niro's nonsense here. However, the most distracting of them is his HUGE use of “the face of De Niro”, to which he so lets. Eyes squint, forehead frowns, lips curled. Krimani, Bob, you looked like a Plastic Man. <br /> <br /> The story apparently began off-screen 14 years ago, when Nolte didn’t manage to give De Niro time in the bighthouse for various attacks. After his release, he feels that Nolte has distorted him, and then gives grounds to terrorize him and his relatives. And we have to give the character De Niro a small pass, because Nolte hid information that could reduce his sentence. De Niro is one of these criminals who, despite being guilty of unspeakable actions, feels that his lack of freedom justifies the continuation of such actions outside. Mmm-kei. <br /> <br /> He goes after Notlle's mistress (in a scene from which some might want to turn away), with his wife, daughter, family dog, you know. What is one of the flaws in the Wesley Streak scenario: complete predictability. As each of De Niro's deeds becomes more and more terrible, you can pretty much name the rest of the action before it happens. Strick should not be completely discredited, as he manages several irresistible moments based on dialogue (the meager exchange of De Niro and Lewis in an empty theater is the best scene of the film), but mostly it’s all a failure. already about the terribly outdated reworked score of Bernard Hermann (I kept waiting for Wolfman to appear with a genetically enhanced tarantula). <br /> <br /> So, we arrive at the comedy part of the film. This is an unintentional comedy. You know those scenes where something horribly graphic is going on, but you can't help but joke out of sight with others? You will do it here. Nolte and Lange shouted infidelity, De Niro's flirting, dressing up and kitchen slip on a certain substance that you need to see to believe. And hellish, continuous, permanent, destructive to the mind of Bob, infinite and impartial nonsense, carrying the whole "philosophy", which he discovered in prison. I wanted to be killed, to shut up more than to save this annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate borrowing thoughts from other reviewers, but here it is necessary. This is really * Freddy Krueger * Scorsese version. The way that De Niro enjoys, speaks, pursues, confronts pain, down to his single lines, is Freddie’s vintage. After you are burned with a pan of abandoned water: “Are you trying to offer a hot drink?” Please. And this is just one example. <br /> <br /> Unless you were a fan of the original film of 1962 and you don’t want to experience the thrill of watching Balsam, Peck and Mitchum almost 30 years later (or you want a serious, stunning film experience), avoid traveling to Cape.
