I saw this movie some time ago on a Video CD. <br /> <br /> First I will mention the good points. <br /> <br /> At first, the film at least tries to show that it is not prejudiced, as not to show one character in black, and the other in white. Both protagonists are friends and coexist well in a country and an economy that does not flourish and at the same time does not fail. Their families get together and have parties, and they practice their favorite sport â€” shooting with a sporting rifle, as comrades are not competitors. <br /> <br /> But after the first 15 minutes, the plot crashes into a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason, these friends should hate each other. For some unknown reason, Bosnia is now on its way to conflict. Of course, the script adds to the television footage, which the characters seem to watch live in English, but the clips have been filmed since 1993, not since 1992, when the war began. <br /> <br /> History, elections of 1990, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The film is trying to put the blame on Karadzic, who was the presidential candidate and leader of the second largest party in Bosnia (PSD). According to the Bosnian Constitution, the SDP was supposed to preside in 1992, but there was a coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Party seized complete control and held a separate referendum in March, in which it declared itself law in Bosnia and announced its secession. <br /> <br /> IDAP history begins with Bosnian Muslim Aliya Izetbegovic, a person suspiciously absent from "STTH". He was a student of Nazism in World War II. He even wrote his own "Mein Kampf" in which he stated: "In fact, there can be no peace or coexistence between the" Islamic religion "and non-Islamic social and political institutions." <br /> In 1990, he lost the IDAP election to "moderate pro-Yugoslav" Fikret Abdick, a Bosnian Muslim who worked with Christian Serbs during the civil war and treated his supporters as brothers. Abdek was unable to come to power to Izetbegovic, who lost the election, but seized the seat of power. <br /> <br /> In the film there are no events from above, but they are the actual events that led to the war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with props. In the film, Serbian soldiers wore Soviet helmets from World War II, which they did not use. Also, one soldier had a M-1944 WW2 rifle, used only in the USSR, and not in Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and screenwriters had a chance, but they decided to rewrite the story.
