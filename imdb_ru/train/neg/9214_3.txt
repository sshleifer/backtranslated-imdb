Many things become clear when watching this movie: 1) acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the conflict between parents and child borders on a soap opera. Two other boys: an overly inflated wunderkind and your stereotypical "I-baby-but-I-very-sensitive" blonde-blue dream; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie’s dreams and episodes are disturbed (played by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of budding love ballads is a strange choice (“we are all special friends”); 5) strange lines and side scenes do not improve from horrible actions; and 5) this is a really bad movie. Expect to be disappointed - and probably worried.
