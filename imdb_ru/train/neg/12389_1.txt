Model Chris McCormack (Margot Hemingway) was brutally raped by the teacher (Chris Sarandon) of her sister Katie (Mariel Hemingway). He appeared before the court, but leaves completely free. Then he rapes Katie! <br /> <br /> An unpleasant and painful rape film. This film was advertised as an important drama concerning rape. That it is a poorly written and (for the most part) ill acting drama. This implies sympathy for a rape victim, but shoves the scene in our face. However, to be completely honest, Hemingwayâ€™s game is so bad in this sequence that it loses any real influence it could have. The judicial scenes were boring and predictable. And the film just went too far when 15-year-old Mariel was raped (fortunately, it was not shown). However, I admit that this led to a great end when Margot grabbed a gun and shot Sarandon. But seriously - the fact that the rape of a young girl is just disgusting. <br /> <br /> Acting does not help. For example, Margot was not an actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and, in my opinion, a real model), but her acting left much to be desired. It reduces the film. Mariel was fine, but it was one of her first films. Sarandon does as the rapist can. He was not bad, but the horrible script worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing that on the screening of this film in 1976, some women stood up and greeted when Sarandon was killed, so maybe this will work for some. people. I found it boring, simplistic and really sick. And 1 completely.
