Sorry, I really like Kristen Cloc and Gary Busey. But the director failed to put it together. There are many actions, many promises, but all this is not so. The director did not do his job. Promising actions fail. It seems that so much was invented in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV was named 1996) is simply not worth watching. Another director would do a better job.
