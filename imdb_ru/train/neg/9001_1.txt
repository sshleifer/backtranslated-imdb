When I watch a movie, I realize that this is “just a movie”, but, nevertheless, I like to allow myself to immerse myself in the situation as much as possible. I think this is what makes us cry, scream, laugh, or otherwise react emotionally as spectators, although deep down we know that this is “just a film.” What I don’t want is that the film reminds me that this is just a film, so I cannot slip into the above hobby regardless of the quality of the film. The director of this film decided to often use pictures from several angles simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I find it terribly distracting and downright annoying. With the same success, they can place a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen that says: “Warning: this is just a movie. Do not allow yourself to become too interested or absorbed. " If I need a picture-in-picture mode, I activate it from the TV remote, but not while watching a movie I like.
