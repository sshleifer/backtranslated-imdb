Whoever wrote the script for this film doesn’t deserve work in Hollywood at all (it doesn’t even live there), and these actors need to find another job. The most terrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just kept on watching to see if it would be better, which, unfortunately, did not happen for me. <br /> <br /> Even at the end, the credits made me worried. I think that there were not so many people behind the film, so they had to slowly withdraw the captions ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely an excellent guide to how not to make a movie. , I wish I could give 0.
