Before the release of George Romero, the defining genre of the Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had much better manners in the old days. But apart from social etiquette, what thrills offered these early zombies to the cinema public? Judging by this film, nothing. <br /> <br /> A story about an expedition to Cambodia, the purpose of which is to find and destroy the secret of zombies. One of the participants himself reveals secrets and proceeds to create his own army of zombies. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically a love triangle with zombies. But, given that this is a 30s film, the zombies mentioned are more like somnambulists than meat eaters we are thinking about today. They seem to respond to mind control, rather than insatiable appetites. And, frankly, the "uprising" is also not thrilled. All this is really very boring. Besides the lack of horror, there is no excessive melodramatic theater to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this could provide a lot of entertainment even 70 years ago. See if you need to see everything with a “zombie” in the title, but otherwise I would advise to skip this one.
