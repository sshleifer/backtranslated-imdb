This film is really stupid. I cannot say anything good about this, except for the moral truth expressed in the climax of the film, about the people in the neighborhood who are involved in the fight against crime. Besides all this, there was nothing in the film: neither good cadres, nor good acting, nor good script. I give this movie F and 2 out of 10.
