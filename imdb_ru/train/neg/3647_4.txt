Good thing I didn't watch it when I was pregnant. I would surely have ripped out my eyes and / or vomited. It was something terrible, mostly alarming. Personally, I thought the child was fascinated by his little perverted way. However, like a mom, I cringed when Beth hit her in the stomach, and when Virginia aborted her baby during her 3rd trimester with rusty dishes no less. I almost cried when she scratched the cat to the bloody pulp. However, however terribly and ominously the baby was, I was rooting for him to live. . ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... ...
