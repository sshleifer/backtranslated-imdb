Bottomless with a capital "A". It must be one of, if not the MOST, unfunny show on television right now. I am as anti-bushe as before, but this show does not even make me laugh. What you think of Bush as president, has absolutely nothing to do with whether you like this piece of shit or not. "Jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene where Lil Bush has underwear on his head: “Welcome to al Qaeda camp!” There is nothing funny about it. Does it even have to be a joke? The commercials that were shown in the weeks that preceded the show spun it out were funnier than the show itself, and that's just sad. Hopefully this is not even considered for the second season. It should not even be the first.
