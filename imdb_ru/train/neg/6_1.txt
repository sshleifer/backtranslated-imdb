From the very beginning of the film it seems that the director is trying to portray something. I mean that instead of a story that dictates the style in which the film should be made, he went the opposite way: the type of step he wanted to take and wrote a story suitable for this. And he failed this very badly. I think he was trying to make a stylish film. In any case, I think this film is a waste of time and effort. According to the director, he knows the media he works with, and I try to say that I have seen worse films than this one. Here, at least, the director knows to maintain continuity in the film. And the actors also gave a decent performance.
