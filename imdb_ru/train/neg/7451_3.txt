Sorry, not good. <br /> <br /> This starts interesting, but loses its way in a few minutes to the film. <br /> <br /> The fact that none of the usually great actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) really helps. Provides a really good performance. <br /> <br /> This may be due to the fact that I saw a duplicate version (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was especially wooden and annoying, and Danny Glover does not really look like a plausible villain. Moreover, Jared Leto's character doesnâ€™t actually contribute to the story (with the exception of saving the life of one main character at some point, but this scene is just as necessary as a wiper on a submarine ;-) <br /> <br / > Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint in fact - the intricate and played up storyline: a detective (of course!) Must settle a personal question with a villain and (of course!) Suspended from his official duties due to the courtesy of his personal involvement. The killer (of course!) * Wants * to be tracked down and for years plays the game of cat and mouse with his opponent ... I do not know how many films are built on a similar plot - most of them are better, however. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of holes in the plot and a lot of absolutely incredible and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work with the storyline at all (for example, the scene of a truck stop or a car on the edge of a cliff, etc.). < br /> <br /> To top it off, the finale tries to be original and exciting, but fails completely in this regard. We have seen * much * better finals with a similar type of ultimate train battle in an abandoned winter landscape ... In the end, a reunion of parents and children supposedly moves ... at least.
