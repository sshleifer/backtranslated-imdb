The blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film, but makes no sense. At some point, some children wander through deeper levels exploring. <br /> <br /> They start discussing what they will find there, and one of them (the girl) says that she is betting that they will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it, Absolutely irrelevant for the story, the only sad connection with the name, and I do not know why she suggested that she would find a blue monkey in the basement of the hospital. <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed that I remembered this, but someone had to remember, I suppose!
