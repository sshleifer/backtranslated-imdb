What this film doesnâ€™t respond to is how erroneous this war is (and most American wars have recently been made just to get some oil). <br /> <br /> How many innocent civilian casualties, how many lives were lost and how brazenly the criminals are stupid. <br /> <br /> So let me ask you, is it normal for an American soldier to kill women and children besides the enemy, but if the government accidentally kills its own forces with deadly chemicals, it kills many civilians well? whether? Your logic has failed, gentleman. <br /> <br /> I'll give 5 for good performance and 1 for everything else, just 3.
