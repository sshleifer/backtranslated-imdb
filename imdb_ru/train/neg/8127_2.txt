This film is currently listed in IMDb as the 42nd worst film ever made - which is why I rented it from NetFlix. Nevertheless, I am saddened to report that the film, although bad, is far from bad enough to deserve to be included in the list of the 100 best films ever made. I personally have seen at least 100 films worse than this. Hardly hot approval, but it simply does not match the expected level of horror to be included in this infamous list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stuart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their overdue honeymoon (by the way, they are also married in real life). He is a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists that they go to the next cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupidly (the hallmark of a bad movie), and they were soon bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats love attacking people, and there are vampire bats in the US — both are completely different. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, after a bite, a man doesn’t even worry about going to the hospital !! The first thing that anyone thinks about (especially the doctor) is to immediately seek medical help, but not this boob. Soon he has convulsions, but he is still not interested in helping! Again and again you keep thinking that this must be the dumbest couple in cinema history! <br /> <br /> After a while, he eventually goes to the doctor and goes to the hospital. But by that time, it's too late, and his attacks are becoming more violent, and he begins to kill people to suck their blood. When it is completely obvious to everyone that this man is a crazy killing machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for the brain) refuses to believe that he is dangerous - even after he attacks people, steals the ambulance help and starts the car a police car out of the way !! <br /> <br /> Now most of the time Moss goes through these episodes, his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person. Strangely enough, however, he developed bat-like hands a couple of times, and by the end they used several good prostheses on him to make him look like a bat. If it were really stupid, the film would have deserved one. <br /> <br /> At the very end, in a turn that hardly had any meaning, the wife inexplicably turned into a mad bat lady and had a swarm of bats kills the evil sheriff. How it all worked out was a mystery, as was the conviction of Moss and McAndrew that this film would somehow help their career - although both of them had a rather long career on television, playing bit roles since 1974. <br /> <br /> On the whole, very stupid. The plot is stupid and has no meaning and relies heavily on people acting too stupid to be real. The film is generally not very good, but it is not among the worst films of all time. <br /> <br /> NOTE. For some reason, IMDb shows graphics for three DVDs for IT'S ALIVE, and these are two sequels of the film. webpage for bats. While the people of the bats were seen with the title “It's Alive,” these two films are not related at all. The mistake is easy to understand - especially since both of them came out in 1974, but the film I just watched was shot by Stuart Moss and Marianne McAndrew, and John Ryan and Sharon Farrell were shot in another movie.
