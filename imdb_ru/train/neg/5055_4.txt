Two years ago on Sundance I liked Josh Kornblut's directorial debut - The Haiku Tunnel. So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent employee) Jacob, “The Best Thief in the World.” This is a drama about a seemingly good child growing up in a low area of ​​New York. The film is not without sharp moments. But sometimes it seems that Kornblut works too hard to state the obvious: life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More subtle and more important is our understanding of the fact that, despite all these disgusting cultural roots and antisocial behavior that they can produce, these characters do not lack goodness and humanity. We can draw back from their language and the conditions of their lives, but we cannot ignore their intentions. And in fact, their struggle to save the family in such conditions has a certain nobility, which most of us can hardly appreciate. Cornblut grew up in the area, and his compassion for people is evident everywhere. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful flaws (including the name). Characters are not very believable. The letter is uneven. And the storyline is subtle. And for many, the most disturbing is that Cornblut uses two young black boys to imitate gangsta rap between scenes. To each his own: but although I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it hurts me to see 5-year-old children talking and talking about sex with a number of women. This is an unnecessary shock value and a forced share of borrowed interest.
