Hi, I'm a friend from werewolf movies, and when I saw the name “Dark Wolf” hit the shelves, I was like, “um, at least, a simple and nice name. Although ... I wonder why I have not heard of this before. <br /> <br /> First, the film begins with boobs. A lot of boobs. Boobs - this is almost the entire budget of this film. Who cares about the werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots! <br /> <br /> So, about the mysterious character of the dark wolf (there are some spoilers in front, but who cares ...) He is your usual everyday character. biker Not even super hard, but, as the old wise woman in the film says, "he is much more powerful and dangerous than you have ever come across." Just describing her tattooed biker type guy. Pretty original. I even looked twice when they first used the “red glowing eyes” SPECIAL EFFECT! I mean, my god, this effect “lets you put red dots on the computer” has been used since the seventies. Here everything looks awful! And don't start me with a werewolf 3D-CGI. As mentioned earlier, as a bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> And finally, how I love werewolf movies, as I said. They always create their own legend about werewolves. The Dark Wolf also builds the werewolf world, about some silly legends about hybrid werewolves and ancient ancestry. BUT. Almost instantly after the creation of the rules of the engagement “a dark wolf kills any girl touched”, random cutting begins. Which simply does not make any sense, why even tell us the rules of murder when they are not even going to play with them ... Aplus, pictures from the wolf's point of view were made using Sony Handycam or something else Just add a rattling noise, and you get a super werewolf effect. The mountain is partially in order. But when a wolf wounds everyone with an open palm, just putting a hand on the victim, it does not help me ... <br /> <br /> Indeed, WHO gives money, make these heaps of garbage direct video-horrors, they are not even funny, bad films , just sad.
