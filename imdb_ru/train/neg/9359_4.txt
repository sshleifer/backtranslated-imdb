This film is probably pro-islam. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing this? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. The first 20 years he lives in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he appears to be a Muslim because of his headgear, that he retained his amulet and his common clothes. He has a six-year-old child who wears the same headdress and is therefore probably a Muslim, although his mother is a Christian. Thus, the main character chooses a Muslim, and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other male protagonists who are Christians seem to have a child. It appears that at the end of this film there are more Muslims in the world of this film.
