“Drawing Restraint 9” is a kind of film that everyone loves or hates; Fortunately or not, I left it with a strong sense of wasted time and careful propaganda that "killing a whale is bad." Aesthetically, the film might be liked, especially its first half, until it is clear that each action depicted serves as an allegory of the various aspects of whale hunting. Before that, it would be a little funny to look at the daily duties of Japanese workers, but later it becomes obvious that everything that appears on the screen is propaganda, and not a single frame is an exception. I use the word “propaganda” because the film uses mainly the old morality gaming device, where “good” and “bad” are not displayed during the action, but are in stone. Maybe it's just me, but I think this type of art is superficial and biased, even if we are talking about a noble (without sarcasm) desire to protect the environment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a cardinal sin when the film material is stretched without any justification, just for the sake of stretching. In my opinion, “Drawing Restraint 9” could be easily laid in 75 minutes, but its agonizing duration is 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting pictures, but they were not enough to leave 15-minute intervals of non-existence without notice. There is no standard script in the film, there is no character evolution, but this is not a documentary, it is rather a conceptual installation. This is an unusual form for a film, but it can still be considered as art, even if the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also believe that the director had to show some honesty and not pretend that he could be delivered in less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the musical accompaniment basically resembled the sounds of whales. How amazing. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
