** HERE WILL BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The government continued to develop the program UniversalSoldier, now called UniSol. Soldiers are now stronger and can take more damage than before. However, the government is shrinking, the project is in danger, and the supercomputer in the spotlight feels threatened, so it takes steps to ensure its own security. He activates and controls UniSols and starts to run the chaos. The only one who can stop them is Devereaux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This film is about one thing. Choreographic fight. The story is bad and will soon be drowned in all battles. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately, for this film it is not interesting to watch the fight, when you know that one part of it is indestructible. Usually you are sure that the hero will win, but you still want to feel that battles take place between two equal fighters. Not where a person is indestructible and cannot lose. Then fights will simply become a tool for stretching time. You wait until the final fight, when Devereaux miraculously finds a way to defeat his invincible opponents. To further lower my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how few women are in semi-cloud. Well, there are actually not so many of them, because the characters are the majority of men (although there is at least one UniSol woman), but almost every woman appears needlessly at least once in a bra. Women's leashes cost this, but we also go through a strip club (to use the computer as much) with much more naked women. These moments give nothing to the story, and it is simply meant to appeal to the male audience. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, boring fights. No more no less. Well maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
