I thought this film seemed to be an example of how not to make a film for the most part. As a director, I give her 2 per sequence. <br /> <br /> Problems remain from start to finish, because the plot is extremely predictable, using pieces of most, if not all, of previous successful military stories, Computer graphics were too much like watching a video game at certain points, and the director seems to did not try to add realism to the plot. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what he had to work with, but I did not find this information. <br /> <br /> It seemed that this project was too much to push the boundaries of the low-budget film, that the play, which draws the viewer along with the plot without their imagination. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
