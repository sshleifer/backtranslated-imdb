I like the cast, but the story unfolds rather slowly. Danny Glover does a good job, making you wonder if he is bad. Meanwhile, other characters are only part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have as much space in history as he could have. I thought the first scene was a bit gloomy compared to how the story unfolded. I would look it again though. I rated it 5 (I wish I could rate it 5.5)
