Well, I rented this film because of the director ... he made some interesting films in the past (if you haven't seen Vaksorka, you are missing a fun trip). In any case, I had doubts about this film from the very beginning, but I decided to come to terms with it and watch it. This is bad. Very bad. If you have not seen the movie and do not mind, spoilers, read on. First of all, the old saying “You cannot judge a book by its cover” applies here. The box for this film seems to indicate that Jill is a stone fox with long hair with highlights. On the back of the box is a cool shot of red leather Jill and a few other shots. The description makes you rent a movie because it sounds good. You start watching it and suddenly discover that the film is happening (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a fat dog, not a cover girl. The film is not as predictable as you think ... and this is not a good thing. Characters do so many stupid things without any motivation ... looking awkward. 10 minutes before the end of the film, Dolph and another woman have sex for no good reason. Besides, what's the point in having Dolph calmly kill this other lady who was helping him. Anthony Hickox, the director, was supposed to see an abomination when he read the script. If it were installed in the underworld of the new millennium and made the characters half smart, it could be decent. Installing it in the 70s does not make sense and has nothing to do with history in general. Avoid it!
