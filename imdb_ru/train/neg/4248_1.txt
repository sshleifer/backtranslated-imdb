In this film was written mediocrity, laziness and lightheadedness. If you're going to make a movie about vampires that has been shot thousands of times, then you better do a damn good job. I will be the first to say that this film simply did not cut it. Some horror / horror films simply cannot break the pattern “let's do something forbidden and abandoned for fun, because all the stories are just a lie”. Unfortunately, this film was no different, and, like all scary films, after you decide to go this way, there will be no going back. <br /> <br /> And the end? How do the characters do the same work over and over again throughout the entire movie, but then they mysteriously get entangled at the moment and cannot do the work at the end? The ending was very anticlimatic and recorded in the third part, which I will never watch. Scary film.
