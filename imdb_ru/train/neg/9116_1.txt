There is not a single decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. The guy playing Sebastien sucks too. He doesn't even look so much like Ryan Philip. More like Joshua Jackson. Two other girls are terrible too. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is also shitty. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (about three): If you can’t beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can’t beat them? <br /> <br /> Limping. <br /> <br /> The ending contradicts the whole plot of the original. The first film clearly states that Katherine and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian wanted Katherine so much, besides being Sarah Michelle Gellar, was because she was "the only girl he could not have, and it killed him." She was a tease who loved to play with him. The fact that she never gave it reinforced his desire. Then in this article, OS implies that he can have her along with the girl on the side. What kind? And we do not even see the floor. This is implied, making it not only stupid, senseless and contradictory, but also useless. <br /> <br /> And in the first case, Catherine rejects Sebastian, because he fell in love, which makes him a loser. Although he won the bet, it reduced his chances. Then in this excrement he loses And falls in love. So she does not blame "losers", but only complete losers? One more thing: it is claimed that Sebastian was never in love, so how do you call this thing a virgin? <br /> <br /> In the end, the virgin suddenly turns out to be Catherine’s evil lover. (dun dun dun) and, as I said, they fall into the lame off-screen three. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other plot contradictions. Did the author even see the first movie? A 5-year-old child can point out his things. <br /> <br /> After having threesome sex, Sebastian has sex with a blonde virgin, corrupting her innocent mind in a limousine, while Catherine and Virgin turn into evil lesbians in lame Sudden turn of the plot sit in front, listen and smile wickedly at the camera. <br /> <br /> End ... <br /> <br /> Seeing that Sebastian was a hole in the ass, in which he was able to make the first interesting film. I think all I need to make little Sebastian bad is a threesome with two hot girls. Interesting.
