The film seemed to attract me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was, of course, not as interesting as other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same banal humor and clich√© of the bad guys. The film is useless if you want to make Pokemon famous. The film is best not to associate with anime, such as Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings do not match the level of the original anime. It's a shame to even talk about this movie. I bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the film and become disillusioned with pokemon. Digimon - rather anime, and it does not look like Pokemon. The second film comes out at the end of 2002.
