Robert De Niro plays the most incredibly intelligent illiterate person of all time. This film is so useless for talent, it is really disgusting. The script is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of her, not funny. The film moves at the speed of a cochlea, it is photographed in an inappropriate way and is obnoxiously preaching. It also includes all the cliches in the book. Swoozie Kurtz perfectly plays a supporting role, but so what? <br /> <br /> No less annoying is the new IMDB rule, which requires ten lines for each review. When a movie is useless, ten lines of text are not required so that other readers know that this is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
