“Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” is another “pleasant feeling”, the so-called “warming of the heart”, and the ratings show that ABC had time to gather together. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems that these families go through. For that, I apologize. But don't you think that installing four widescreen plasma televisions, three flat-screen desktop computers, an indoor pool that occupies half of the backyard, and cabinets filled with expensive designer clothes is READER too much for ANY family? Of course, these families have experienced a lot. Of course, they deserve more pleasant things than those they had previously. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, the things that Tai Pennington and his team put into these houses are enough to satisfy the entire neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really annoys me in this show is how Ty and his team can always say something good about every little thing concerning the family or the condition of the family. Talking to a person with a wheelchair that he or she is “so strong” or “very brave” really does get old after a while. It may sound rude, but trust me; Watch this show and you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> In general, this show is overrated. If you want to watch it, go ahead. This comment is just a headline for what you will watch.
