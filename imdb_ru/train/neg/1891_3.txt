A documentary about the Persian nomads, committing a treacherous tour of the massive mountains to bring their herds to the grass. Watching this quiet black and white function, partially obscured by notes of oriental music that could not be used at the original exhibition, is even more boring than it seems. Fascinating landscapes are lost on a small black and white screen, and it is absolutely impossible to establish any storyline. I loved Nanook from the North and Marsh Penguins, but I despised this film, despite the similarity of the theme. Physical difficulties in themselves are not so interesting.
