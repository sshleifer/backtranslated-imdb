I absolutely hate it when the movie completely falls apart near the end, after you have already spent an hour on it. and that's what happened to this movie. I was intrigued by his actors and the fact that the malamud wrote his story. I did not go to read this story, but I can not imagine that it ends as this film ends. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see or rent it, because it was in my library. Ohhhh, such a waste of excellent acting (in particular, the wife was so beautiful). but cute o'Shea as a Jew? !!!! now it was funny. I did not explore his creation, but he played as if the director had lost the marble or died 3/4 of the way through the film. Up to this point, the story and characters developed, there were many interesting stories, and there was not too much time. but that in the last half hour - if it was not the most disgusting, the most useless outcome I have ever seen, I do not know what it is. I just hate it when such faith is destroyed; it looks like an act of violence.
