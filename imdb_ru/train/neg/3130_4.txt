I came to this film, really wanting to even it out. I thought the room has a lot of potential and is ripe for an interesting film. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I took it for the film "B". However, he still did not meet expectations. The historical aspect of the story is glazed, and the finale left me a bit cold. The acting in the film was very wooden. In general, I give 4 for a great idea, but the film could win a lot higher, with a little more attention to the basics of film making. Should I watch? I would not want two hours ago, but I do not know that I would recommend it to others.
