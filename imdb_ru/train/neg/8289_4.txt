Sorry, but this is such a bad movie, it's funny. Football hooligans argue in the tourist bed? Suits? Shades ?! It is clear that Alan had no idea what he was talking about when he did this. This is as far from the truth as you can understand. <br /> <br /> Casting was cruel ... Gary Oldman, like a football bully? He doesn't look scary, behaves scary and doesn't even look like a person who would like football. And as for the yeti? What the hell? Costumes, shades and sitting on a trip childishly mocking each other with "your time you put on a diaper." You are welcome. <br /> <br /> Did the Yeti gang spray MUS’s underwear? <br /> <br /> I don’t understand how anyone can take this film seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. This is perhaps the most inaccurate image of the crisis of hooliganism in the late eighties, which I have ever seen.
