It’s impossible to avoid a comparison between “The Cat in the Hat” and “The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,” so let's get this part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think the Grinch was an underrated and undervalued film. Kat was ... well, just awful. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey was abandoned because he is a brilliant physical comedian and fearlessly takes on excessive, outrageous characters. Mike Myers went back to his old bag with tricks. <br /> <br /> Why why why why Mike Myers ?? Children don't care, and the Austin Powers demographic will not spy on this movie. So what was the studio thinking about? <br /> <br /> The cat was also clearly associated with Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why New York Accent? Not exactly what Dr. Seuss ever wrote. Myers was even allowed to sneak in his Scottish ploy. I wonder how many different voices the director and studio tried to edit before they just gave up and said: “As long as you don’t say fahklempt,” you can keep the accents. Myers never found solace in costume, makeup, or communication. <br /> <br /> The jokes, which were few, were rude and inappropriate. When Myers takes a garden hoe and points at the camera: “dirty ho,” everything except the rim shot was out, and even that wouldn't help. <br /> <br /> The very same people who created Whoville clearly had a hand in creating the city and the houses in the Cat. The sets and props were very attractive, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from bad writing, directing and Myers. <br /> <br /> It was a fun time with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to know that she was filming a movie based on Dr. Suze’s classics, and remained true to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call SPCA. This cat should be neutered and should never be played again. Please, please, without continuing.
