Can only be described as terrible. Bad start, and then it gets worse. When you start, you really have to watch it, because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but do not be afraid, because it happens. Another poorly written script for an ass-director for the incompetent offspring of past movie stars. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than acting or directing is worse than both. As for the hero - well, he stumbles everyone, including one scene, where he knocks out the living day rays from a steep circle, opening the door of the wardrobe and smashing him against the window. And in another scene, he is thrown out the window and slammed 20 feet into the concrete — he doesn't even blink — then he immediately gets up and gets stuck in the bad guys. This is a really funny movie. Fortunately, it only cost me $ 1.
