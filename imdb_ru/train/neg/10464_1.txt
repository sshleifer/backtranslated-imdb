This film is not based on the Bible. This completely leaves Christ outside the film. They do not show the rapture or second coming of Christ. Not to mention this. This is not a quote from the scriptures. The end times are called the great tribulation. The film does not even show bad times. Seven bowls, seven abominations and seven pipes of judgment are reduced to a 15-second release of news about the sea, changing its structure. The Antichrist was killed three and a half years after the tragedy, and so the film ended. The only thing they got was two prophets. Of course, names were not used there because it would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. Worst of all, I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take unsaved people with me. I feel the movie is evil. It's fake, like everything the devil does. I just hope it doesn't take away from the upcoming film based on the books left. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the film - it was just bad. Bad game, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. I have seen the best episodes of Miami vice.
