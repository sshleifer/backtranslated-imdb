I don’t understand how someone who even likes Van Damn might like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a promise. I would say that the action films at the beginning of the film are excellent. Scenes with family custody trying to save the twins are a great start and a good start to the main story. However, the film from there is all down. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. That is, brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother must be experienced in martial arts, and the other brother must be experienced in firearms. How convenient, when the time comes, when a brother, who never raised a weapon, suddenly becomes a great shooter, and a brother who has not been trained in any martial arts, suddenly does split and high blows. br /> <br /> Story, action, etc., are ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damn confronts an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 yards. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damna, he makes a military cry, as if he owns a battle ax and runs at him. Van Damne begins to raise a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him ... while he is 75–80 yards away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Jung is an experienced martial artist. However, instead of choreography, a decent fight. Bolo throws barrels into Van Damna like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating film that promised so much. If you're a Van Damn fan, save your time and watch Hard Target or one of his earlier films.
