Well, I heard little about this film, so when he appeared on TV channels, I wanted to watch it, being a horror fan. I think I can do a collective "eh?" for everyone who watched it. <br /> <br /> I decided to continue my life, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw that this was happening, and some of us, seeing this, had already decided to laugh our way through this, we both proclaim the dumbest thing I've ever seen. " It was not scary; I will pass it to Roth (who, I think, is a young hacker); characters change throughout the film, ala "Cube". <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, despite your typical “rat in a cage” scenario - who turns on who, etc., this was a rather average horror. <br /> <br /> A few moments: 1.) What happened to this child? I'm not even saying that he is strange and bites people. I'm talking about the whole "slow karate movement", what was it? 2.) Well, I know that Ryder's character liked Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman, I was shocked that he just went ahead and molested her in a dream. It's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) The mouth was in the film only so that the Mouth could be in the film. Talk about meaningless writing yourself in! 4.) What was with the deputy? 5.) So she was just instantly separated by a dog? And there was little blood or not left? Just a shred of her jeans? In any case, we laughed at our asses, and I love to laugh during horror films (“Return of the Living Dead 2”, “Evil Dead”), but I don’t know if we should laugh here ...
