This is not a movie. This is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly collected scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10-year-old child with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that an extremely abrasive girl in the corridor of the train — one that had greasy hair, a close look, an iPod and a nervous tic — probably shot herself in the creative stage. <br /> <br /> If you made it further than ten minutes that I did, do not try to fit what you saw into the context of the mentality of the European Artist praised above. This is a real and complete waste of time, money and films that would make William One-Shot Beaudine cower. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the endless series of vacuum-packed characters reflects what most of humanity is passing now. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors make social contacts at Wal-Mart?
