“Wicker Man” starring Nicolas Cage is not a good movie, but I can’t say that I watch it with regret. I could continue to talk about the negative aspects of the film, such as the terrible game and the long scenes where Cage is looking for a girl, she has a hallucination, then another hallucination followed by a sequence of dreams with hallucination, etc. But it’s not worth stopping on the subject of such a film. Instead, here are five reasons why you MUST look at the “Wicker Man”, even if it’s bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It’s hard to deny that he has any really creepy ideas, the only problem is in his fun Inadvertently funny performance. If this is nothing, this is a film that can inspire you to watch the original 1973 film or even read the story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> 4. For a stupid horror / thriller, it's really aesthetic. Obviously, this was filmed on the spot, rather than using a green screen or elaborate decorations, so we will see some very nice landscapes. There are also many beautifully composed shots. This is a very beautiful film. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as a force of nature. Whether you are a fan of him or not, it seems that Cage cannot play the "normal guy." There is always some kind of eccentricity or tediousness that he brings to the characters he plays, and personally I always admire watching him in any film he makes. Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into the game, and he is never bored with watching. He is terrible in the Wicker Man, but in the most miraculous way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student could probably write a damn article about this film, as he seems to be the most powerful antifeminist film ever made. "See?" You could write: “This is what happens when women are allowed to manage society!” Moreover, the similarities between this “Summerseel” society and the bee colony are quite interesting and worth noting. <br /> <br /> 1. If you are reading this, you probably have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of “bright moments” from the film, including Cage, running around in a bear suit, and, of course, the infamous "Aahh! Bees! My eyes !!!" line. These scenes are funny out of context, and they are still quite funny when they are watched in full. <br /> <br /> I bought a used DVD for Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you decide that, that's about a dollar for a reason. This is a pretty good deal. <br /> <br /> NOTE. It is best to watch a movie without stars, it is better to watch "Theatrical" only because of the slight addition of the epilogue, which has a cameo of James. Franco.
