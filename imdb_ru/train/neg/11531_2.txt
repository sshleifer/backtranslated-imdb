The plot is so manipulative, fully relying on the most incredible and unthinkable decisions of adults in every decision for parents. Children are excellent in terms of charm and the issuance of lines, but, as I said, the whole plot depends on whether all adults are idiots, and therefore in THIS case they make more sense in their actions (and to be the only way to explain to boys the actions of complete distrust). Why do cute charming boys take a child from the shore? How did the child get ashore and at the same time become the last place to be searched? Why are 2 boys NEVER informed that a child is lost at the same time, and no one shows that they run around with food and diapers when all this excitement happens literally in every other place where he was looking? There is simply no reason to ask the audience to believe it. Attempting to believe that this may lead to a trial (even in an informal setting) is too insulting to bare.
