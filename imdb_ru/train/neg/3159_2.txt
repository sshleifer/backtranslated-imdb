Sorry guys, I already wrote my opinion about this film, but today was the first day when I watched some other reviews. There are quite a few people who agree with me, but what's scary is that some people really love this film. I do not like writing unpleasant reviews or criticizing other people's opinions, but I think it would be fair to warn anyone who can discuss whether to watch this movie. This is not a good movie. I really like movies, and I’ll watch anything, but this movie was on an incredibly short list of films I’ve watched and was happy to leave halfway. If you're really incredibly tempted, watch the trailer ... this is a mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially in the trailer ... after that there are no surprises, just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and would not like to criticize him, but I consider it my duty not to let other people spend hours of their lives on such a film !!
