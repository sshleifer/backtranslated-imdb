I saw the film late in the evening by telegram and could not believe how bad it was. I usually like bad movies, but this one was so disgusting that it wasnâ€™t even interesting. Some of the highlights of this film include absurd music, which is constantly heard throughout the film, disgusting special effects (when someone shoots a laser gun, they become neon-green and quickly dissolve), and disgusting game. Acting, in fact, is what I feel is stealing the show. I did not recognize any of the actors in the film, and I hope that I will never again have to see them. In general, I recommend renting this film (if you can find it; I cannot imagine a video store selling this garbage) so that you can learn to appreciate high-quality films after watching this garbage.
