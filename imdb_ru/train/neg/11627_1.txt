I wonder who was responsible for this mess? The jokes would not have worked for Gilligan Island. If it went into a series, would there be jokes about Auschwitz, or would Eve have to replace her oven, only so that Adolf offered a type that holds 50 ?? Another post compared this show to the fact that I love Lucy. The problem is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedy and strange situations, and this mess was simply poorly made and insulted my intellect. <br /> <br /> After the damage done by the Nazis in England and the number of people they killed, I think that the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem disgusting, and most normal people would kill this concept before any episodes. were produced.
