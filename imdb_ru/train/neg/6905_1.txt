The clichés of Polynesian men drink, fight, and make a stream of sexist, silly, and unfunny remarks. Real Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotypical, cardboard characters. Supposedly the Samoan girl did not look at all and did not play with the Samoans, looked more like a white woman who has sex with someone on a whim. With weak storylines like water, you can’t say anything about acting, even the most brilliant actors couldn’t do anything with this script. It is sad to see Polynesian actors who want to play such sad stereotypes in a film not with one good scene, but with only two or three "jokes". What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers' money, what a missed opportunity to make a great film about a dynamic community. It is better not to make films if they are as bad and thoughtless as this one.
