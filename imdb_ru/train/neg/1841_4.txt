You can look at it differently. This film sucks, its good or just weird. The third probably explains this film best. He has a strange topic and just a strange story. So who, except Christopher Walken, could play in this, no matter how bad he is, average, and even how good. <br /> <br /> The game was exactly what you expect, especially from Ben Stiller. I always liked Jack Black, so you know what you get from him, but that's not bad. Christopher Walken is always behind the wall. He is always pleased to watch, no matter how bad the film. Wise comedy is a bit funny. This, of course, means that he has his moments (although there are very few of them), but here and there it may be a little better, which makes me feel that the film just desperately needs laughter, but certainly not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Directing was also average. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and he really didnâ€™t do a good job here. It seemed that this film has much greater potential, and it does little to achieve it. Just very average and it seems that not a lot of effort was spent on making this film. <br /> <br /> Screenplay is the key to a good comedy. Obviously, this means that the recording failed here. At best, it is below average. Given that he has his own moments, it was not too terrible. This is never a good thing to say about the movie, though. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Christopher Walken and this stupid, ridiculous ending, I would give him a lower rating. He is always quite a character in his films. This is still a strange film with strange characters who will not go anywhere. Not really terrible, but I would not recommend it because it is a very forgotten film.
