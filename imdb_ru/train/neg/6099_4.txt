It was not at all an exciting short film that I recently saw between the commercials on Turner Classic Movies. While the film came out because of its very intense Technicolor, the film itself was simply not so moving, and from time to time the plot looked rather silly - as if it was made for use in class and attracting the attention of a wide audience, even consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times things happened in the film — for example, when the characters talked to her, they used to say “Clara Barton” instead of “ma'am”, “Miss Barton” or “Klara”. In addition, one painful Confederate soldier said he was “Johnny Reb, a Confederate rebel, ...” - almost like he was a cartoon character of Mojo Jojo from Powerpuff Girls. It was just a sloppy letter - period. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later “Perry White” on the TV series SUPERMAN) in the beard as President Garfield. Yes - it is under this beard.
