“Dead Letter Office” is a low-budget film about a pair of Australian postal employees who are trying to rebuild their ruined lives. Unfortunately, the game is bad, and the connection between the past misfortunes of the characters and the current thinking is presented clumsily and unnecessarily schematically. However, what is most disappointing is that the image is life in the office of the film's name: there is no mechanization, and it is absolutely impossible to establish what one of the employees actually does. Of course, part of the plot is that the office faces closure, but this type of office will probably be closed in the 30s, if it ever existed. It's a shame, because the general tone of the film is sharp and distorted, and there is some promise in the script: but some details convince. In general, he feels the work of someone who has not really experienced a lot of real life; student film, with a concept and a plan, but unfortunately a bit more.
