Let me first state that I love the stories of westerns and civil war. I also think John Ford is a great director. I also have the same strong feelings for the acting ability of John Wayne and William Holden. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember if I saw this film when it first came out in 1959. Last night I saw him for the first time since then. <br /> <br /> As for my rating of 4, I can say that I didn’t like the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I will try to talk about some of its shortcomings. <br /> <John Lee Machin, who wrote the script from the novel by Harold Sinclair, was a very gifted writer and wrote many good scripts. This script is poorly written and poorly researched. They mention the terrible conditions of the Andersonville prison. At the time of the film, Andersonville was not working. They also use rifles that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford has been making films for over 40 years and won 4 Oscars. He must have been sick while making this. His usual style was absent. It is possible that this was a film in the south and east, and not in the Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He usually had a whole company of players that he used in almost all of his films, this time most of them were missing. At this time only the insignificant stars of cowboy Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtiss have roles, and, of course, Anna Lee plays a small role. There were no other familiar faces, except 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Ford’s stock company has made most of its films a classic; Unfortunately, there is not enough. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. The duke must also be sick; he seemed out of place here. Such a role usually ideally suited his style, he was just adequate here. William Holden did everything he could, but was nowhere better than ever. <br /> <br /> It was required that an actress be in films of this type. Here in her first starring role (second film) - Constance Towers, a very handsome man, but not really an actress, she still plays roles on television. Let me be kind and say that she had a long career, based more on her appearance than acting talent. In addition, tennis star Althea Gibson plays Miss Tower as a servant. I'm glad she got into tennis. <br /> <br /> The rest of the credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films. several songs of a military type, supposedly written by a marching cavalry, are not very good. The scenes were good, but at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Ratings * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
