It is, without a doubt, one of the worst films, EVER stressed, EVER shot. Worse, my old hero Dolph is in it, and he plays a major role. Lord ... The story is actually pretty good, but from the way it went, even my body suffered. The battle scenes for beginners are about as good as the fight between two drunks crashing into the gutter. The actors, with the exception of Dolph, who also seems to suck, act so badly that you can't help but wonder why their reason is that they are all friends of the director, who, by the way, was the most absent if not All the time. This is 12 million pounds, spent in an unimaginable way, because in terms of effects and scenery, the cost cannot be a cent higher than ยง1000.
