... but I am not one of them. At least Caro Diário could be seen for two thirds of the time, but the boring and selfish third part of this film gave us an idea of ​​what was going to happen in this extremely indulgent mess. Moretti says that he feels the need to make this film, but does not want to, while the viewer feels that he must adhere to this, but in fact also does not. A film about Italian politics and elections can be fun, but this is not the film. At some point, Moretti and his friends stand outside the headquarters of the Communist Party, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with the party leaders inside, but this film is characterized by the fact that we will never see any of them. The political delirium of Moretti is connected with the events that led to the birth of his son, and the subsequent home videos about him with the child, and then with the baby Pietro (the film pulls us in several years and more than one election period). We expect to see some specific sequence or convincing argument, but they never come. I doubt that I have the patience to ever watch the film “Nanni Moretti” again. He manages to make the hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.
