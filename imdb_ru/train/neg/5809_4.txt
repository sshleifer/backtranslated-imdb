I can not understand why the filmmakers remade this film. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor, and Baldwin was an inappropriate actor. He has no passion in his play. Also the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It's almost boring, despite the fact that shooting in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t understand how Baldwin was imprisoned from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in history. <br /> <br /> So I think there was no need to redo it, or if they decided to redo the classics, they should choose a great actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
