“After the atomic bombs carried by the shot down Soviet bomber explode in the Arctic, the creature of the Hammer gets out of sleep mode. The giant prehistoric turtle sets out on its way to Tokyo and destroys everything in its path. The military and the scientific community are in a hurry to find a way to stop this monster before Tokyo is destroyed, ”the annotation says on the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> The first film in the Gamera series for an American audience, re-created, adds material in English, which is even funnier than a regularly duplicated Japanese fare. It is clear that the monster is following in the footsteps of Godzilla. Taking his cue from Faddish ABC "Batman!" The series, the funny musical theme of the musician Wes Farrell enhances the appeal of the American version. <br /> <br /> *** Hammer the Invincible (15/15/66) Sandy Howard, Noriaki Yuasa ~ Dick O'Neill, Brian Donlevi Albert Dekker, John Baragrey
