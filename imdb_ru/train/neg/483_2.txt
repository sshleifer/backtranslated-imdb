I did not think that the French could make a bad movie, but I was completely wrong. As mentioned earlier, this film essentially uses its title character as a starting point; her portrayal of her life and personality has nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The scenario is terrible - pretentious, unnatural and meaningless - and rewriting facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that too often earns a living by distortion rather than retelling history, along with some pretty decent decorations, the physical charm of Valentina Worms is the main advantage of this film, and from the very beginning it is obvious that the filmmakers knew about it; they do not spend time inventing different “erotic” sequences that have much more in common with titylation than with the development of a plot or character. Unfortunately, the attractiveness of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot and does not support this film. The game is unremarkable, and the score is too general, despite one or two interesting chords. Cinematography is fine, and there are some beautiful colors, but there are also some rather funny episodes using distorted lens effects that are more suitable for a 1960s tramp film than a costume drama. In any case, the script leaves the camera too often on Artemisia’s body, and in her paintings too rarely. <br /> <br /> Everything is said, almost complete failure. It is not intelligent or enough to be a serious film with a taste, and it is too slow and pretentious to work with soft basic pornography. So the French can fail in the end!
