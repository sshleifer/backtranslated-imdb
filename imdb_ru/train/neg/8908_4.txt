This series was the response of CBS networks to the success of the Big Valley. It was a 90-minute Western, as in the ABC program. Although it was the answer, he didnâ€™t have the material to do it last season 2. <br /> <br /> The problem really became a reality that was lost in this show. For example, in one episode, Johnny stuck a stick in his eye. Surprisingly, by the end of the show, Johnny fully recovered. Along with this, the stories about this were far from as strong as the "Great Valley". <br /> <br /> This is a show on which I would not want a DVD, and sincerely hope that they will never come out. Think, since CBS has exhausted a lot, they reused many familiar settings. It was one of the latest Western CBS series released since Westerns were not particularly popular in the 1970s.
