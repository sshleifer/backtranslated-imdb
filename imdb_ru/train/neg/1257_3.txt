If there is one thing that annoys me most when watching a bad movie, this is what experienced directors who should know better do. This “rethinking” of the Planet of the Apes could use the imagination, not to mention the essential elements of character development. Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a more developed character than Daena in this version, despite the fact that she did not say a single word. Tim Burton, a man who has so far combined incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humor, probably expected much better. All this was noticeably absent from this performance. <br /> <br /> plot development. The first big mistake was letting people talk. It was a fundamental difference between monkeys and people who made * all * the difference in the original film. Even when he was mute, his ability to communicate was what distinguished Taylor Heston from other people. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg calls for (speaking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no compelling reason for them not to revolt and restore their liberation. They are clever users of tools and have the ability to communicate to make plans, something that dumb people can't do. Man does not need to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed, since it comes from a technological civilization and finds itself in the era preceding technology, without (first) any adaptations to help it, it is Wahlberg who should be at a disadvantage, not the people who used to live there. <br /> <br /> It was sad to see that Helena Bonham Carter worked so hard to light a spark between herself and this unresponsive brick wall of Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with villain Tim Roth. <br /> <br /> People were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, after which Daena began to show some real interest in Davidson (Wahlberg), and the young boy suddenly turned from a background into an evil freedom fighter. It was a bad development of character. (Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she was capable of much more than she was given in the script). In the end, Wahlberg's bewilderment about what these people see in him, I, of course, shared, because he almost did not communicate with people everywhere. <br /> <br /> Monkey making: half plus and two minus: Monkey makeup was great for men, especially Michael Clark Duncan, who has incredibly expressive eyes (which is why he was so good at the Green Mile), and the make-up design allowed him to fully utilize them. But the female monkeys on earth did not look like monkeys, nor like humans. The minuses were jumping monkeys that looked as realistic as the Flash Gordon rocket: the jumping monkeys looked as if they had just been released from a catapult, they didn’t have a single grace of genuine monkeys. Secondly, poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar, it is quite clearly duplicated from some animal, perhaps from a cat, which makes them sound ridiculous and unreal. <br /> <br /> In the original film, various “human” things of the Monkey do and say, as easy relief (“I never knew a monkey that I didn’t like.” “Man sees, man does!”). Here the monkeys speak just like the people of the 21st century, and there is absolutely no humor in this. The only truly original idea was that Ari wrote with her feet. <br /> <br /> Nothing made me cringe more than the moment "V-Ger from Star Trek" at the end of the film. First of all, the monkeys, apparently, could read Roman letters in the distant past, so that they know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partially hidden form. Secondly, the mysterious inscription with the name is simply covered with sand, which Walberg simply erases what any monkey could have done many centuries ago. This moment was much worse for me than the end of the film, defaming much evil. <br /> <br /> However, such things are typical of most modern science fiction films. Back in the 60s and 70s, they usually did not have the budget to create convincing futuristic scenery, but they dealt with truly original themes and ideas that were truly science fiction. I think about 2001: Space Odyssey, Planet of the Apes 1967, THX1138, Soilent Green, Silent Running and Solaris 1972. The First Planet of the Apes even used the only scientifically based and physically possible way to travel in time. However, this film includes almost all the bad science fiction cliches: cosmic storms, anomalies, and wormholes straight from Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their satellites, apparently, are all visible together as large balls (in fact, from any planet, all other bodies, even their own satellites, are just points of light); the usual rocket-powered shuttle traveling from Saturn to Earth in minutes, not years; Two thousand years of equipment lights up and is fully operational at the moment when the hero presses the button. Not to mention the bullet-proof inner glass door. In a modern setting, you have to explain * why * it was bulletproof, but since this is “science fiction,” you don't need it! <br /> <br /> In general, the Burton movie is the most disappointing.
