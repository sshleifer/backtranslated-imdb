It was a really bad movie. Cole's character played by Michael Moriarty was the main cause of this failure, the actor felt that creating an incredibly awkward southern tension would make this character even more evil, but it isnâ€™t. After about 20 minutes I wanted a speech therapist to appear, this would add a bit of sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) did not do well - 2) non-sympathetic characters - 3) thin line of the subject's razor <br /> <br /> Phew! <br /> <br />
