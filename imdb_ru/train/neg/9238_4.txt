A one-note comedy that probably puzzles modern feminist teeth. The clerk of the Betsy Drake department store is in love with the idea of ​​children and marriage, pinning their hopes on women's magazines until they see the super bait in the form of a smooth bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the film moves from one trick to another as relentless Drake pursues his career. I assume that the word “perky” just in total corresponds to Drake’s approach to the role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures, I began to overdose. The role of Grant is basically secondary and minus his usual talent. However, there is one scene that almost saves this subtle exercise. Drake interrogates the unfortunate Grant after his lecture in the room of respectable women. Here, her cheerful manner has an inexhaustible freshness, which is indeed quite remarkable, and if the production did not rub our nose in this raised smile for 90 minutes, the film could have been more than a daytime nap for girls around 1948.
