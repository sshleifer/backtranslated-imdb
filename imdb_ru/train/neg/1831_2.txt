I usually like comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I do not quite understand "Envy." I mean, he has a boring content / topic, and this is not very funny. <br /> <br /> Although the game is generally good, itâ€™s not enough for the film to make it even a little interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this film. <br /> <br /> So if you are going to make a comedy, I advise you not to do it. Unless you want to get bored, and I see that I'm not the only one with such an opinion, because even Jack Black apologized for this (look at the trivialities).
