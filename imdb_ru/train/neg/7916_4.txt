Where to begin? How about an erroneous synopsis: <br /> <br /> “The Origin of the X-Men: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine’s epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed and the sinister X-Weapon program.” <Br /> <br /> His epic cruel past turns out to be extremely non-violent. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so gloomy that it is difficult to understand how they are generally connected. We are thrown from a single point in the initial scene, which shows them as children on the run, in montage of the military scenes in which they fought throughout their long life, and finally, at the present time, when they are part of a tough government team. the killers. <br /> <br /> Nothing shows their relationship like brothers. There is nothing difficult for us to believe in authenticity or even love. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the film between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and sharp. We are so immersed in romance that it's over before you can blink. Having just introduced the character, Silverfox dies in about fifteen minutes. We can only wonder why we should take care of this. Anyway, who was she? <br /> <br /> For the key element of this story about a weak race for revenge, the novel has not been unexpectedly explored. They broke into it simply because it was necessary. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, when Wolverine discovers that his love is dead, he leaves her in the forest to rot, and leaves to find Saber-toothed. Being a romantic is that he is, for him it was uncharacteristic, but still it was necessary to serve the plot in order to provoke a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As for program X with weapons, let's just say that after the painfully damaging procedure, Wolverine is running. In the end, he arrives at the house comfortably old but extremely loving couple. Surprisingly, mom and dad Kent are not alarmed when they find a naked sweaty man in their barn. Is it any wonder that fate awaits them? <br /> <br /> In previous films and comic strips, the main reason Wolverine’s amnesia was stalking him was partly dependent on what he was said to be wicked and Cold-blooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this was the case ... did he really want to remember such horrors or hide them and continue his more positive lifestyle, fighting against the villains of the world with his teammates? <br /> <br /> As hinted at in X2: “X-Men,” when Stryker reveals some of his secrets, they say that Wolverine will be concerned if he finds out about the evil things they have done together. This film sets up the team pretty well, but they do nothing. No disturbing violence, no ruthless actions, they simply disturb several natives abroad for ten or fifteen minutes, which they show on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not an evil man under Stryker. Instead, he constantly tried to tie the leash to his brother Saber-toothed, which, therefore, was a violent agent, of which we all thought Wolverine. In the end, he just leaves everything together. <br /> <br /> There is no conflict of duality here. <br /> <br /> Idiotically REMOVING that the conflict of the nature of good and evil has blunted history immensely. They might as well have given him rubber claws. <br /> <br /> There were many other mistakes in this film that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the weakest Deus Ex Machinas that ever hit the mark. scenario. <br /> <br /> Memory bullet magic bullets. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently, they are the only ones who can knock down Wolverine. However, this was obviously forgotten when an agent was sent for an agent in order to shoot him down with bullets and bombs that most certainly would not have worked on him at all. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that he tried to focus on Wolverine. throwing a ton of other mutants who did almost nothing. Interesting characters were just window dressing and did nothing for the story. Most of them were in the film for no more than 5-10 minutes, and yet you would like us to see more of them and less of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dyuks (Blob, but not the comic version) can hit a launched tank missile with minimal or no physical damage at all, but is it enough for Wolverine's lightning bolts to strike a metal rifle to stun him? <br /> <br /> The optical rays of the Cyclops (which are now more akin to lasers instead of shaking force) can burn buildings, but when they shoot at the Sabers, it just crashes into the ground without even damaging its clothes. Does the adamant coat cover anyone? <br /> <br /> Gambit (defying gravity) instead of using its signature cards turns into a kind of mad acrobat. In one poorly edited scene, he lost consciousness from Wolverine ... then, oddly enough, a few minutes later he finds himself on the roof, running towards TOWARDS Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, ran off a few blocks, went upstairs, and then ran back to Wolverine and Saber-Tooth in the middle of a scratched match — a mystery that remains to be explained. <br /> <br /> Some justify this weakness of films, claiming that it was made from comics and should therefore be weak in nature and heavy in flash. The idea that this film is comic is contrived and superficial because of this fact. <br /> <br /> The source material of the comics, the REAL origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen. It does not embellish his past and does not treat the reader as meaningless CGI addicts. This is a well-researched story, and although it is retold and corrected over time, it began with WEAPON X Barry Windsor-Smith. Much more rich and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have this magic gun? <br /> <br /> 4/10
