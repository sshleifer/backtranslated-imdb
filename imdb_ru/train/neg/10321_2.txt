This show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and they are getting worse and worse. I am one of those people who have never been big fans of Corner Gas, but at least I liked it at first, until in the second season he ended up in a rut, all the jokes were played, and the characters had nothing. Well, at least Corner Gas was good at first, the Little Mosque on the Prairie is usually a terrible comedy from CBC, in which nothing comes out of the first episode. and maybe just people who really live in the prairies? Maybe jokes for them and they work there? I don’t know a single person who loved this show and couldn’t bear it himself, the jokes are absolutely predictable, and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. I hope this does not last much longer, because the whole success of this show, it seems to me, is completely based on the premise that this show is a Muslim who is different and could / should have led to a great show.
