2 stars out of a possible 10 - and this is too generous. <br /> <br /> I thought with actors James Woods, Katie Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett Jr. and Henry Thomas - how could Miss. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what kind of drugs Sam Shepard was at the weekend when he turned this piece of dribbling. I have long suspected Sam S. that he is kind of crazy, this film based on his play confirms this. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of skillful bs that the actors love to sink their teeth, as this gives them the opportunity to endure emotions endlessly. Nevertheless, the viewer who sits in this meaningless trash, absolutely nothing to love in this film. <br /> <br /> You did not see dysfunctional families until you saw this group. Dad is crazy, mom is crazy, son is crazy, and daughter, oh yeah, crazy. They also have mouths that speak words that would make a sailor blush, especially a teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if this were not enough, the plot - and it is so Thin, you can read it completely - it has a hole the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> Ma conspires to sell his worn farm. As it turned out, Pa. Now I donâ€™t claim to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, a jointly owned property must have the signatures of both owners in order to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, the other could not legally sell it, so it would be meaningless for this person to do so. Mr. Shepard prefers to ignore this basic fact, and therefore his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that something else really worked. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason anyone could eat to watch this movie is if they absolutely desperately want to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to.
