I have seen many films and would rarely rate the movie “1”, but this film was beyond horror. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the plot was funny, the effects were unreal, and the characters were annoying. Usually, when I watch scary movies, I think it's VOLUME when the characters hear noise in the house / forest / school / etc. And then they shout: "Hello, is there anyone?" - but at least they are believable when they do it .. This film could not even make it right. <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which other B horror films are shot, such as Venom and The Fog. Look like masterpieces, award-winning academy. <br /> <br /> I always watch films in an unbiased way and I can only say that this film was a waste of time, and I am writing this comment so that anyone who thinks to watch this movie think again. IT'S HORRIBLE!
