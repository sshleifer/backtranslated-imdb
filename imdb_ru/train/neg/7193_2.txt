Last weekend I had absolutely nothing to do, and I watched a movie with friends ... any movie. And since the only film we didnâ€™t see was Inspector Gadget, we decided to do it. <br /> <br /> BIG MISTAKE. This is a movie that only children can like. Oh, and I don't like movies meant for young audiences. But this film had absolutely nothing to attract my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to bed. Better than spending hard earned money on it. Watch a movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
