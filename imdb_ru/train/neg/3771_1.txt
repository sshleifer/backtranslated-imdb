It must be one of the worst films of the 1990s. When my friends and I watched this film (being the target audience it was aimed at), we just sat and watched for the first half hour, when our jaws touched the floor, how bad it really was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theater just started talking to each other, leaving or even crying at their popcorn, that in fact they were paid the money they earned to watch this weak excuse for the film. It must have looked like a great idea on paper, but on film it looks like no one in the film has any idea what is going on. Shit acting, shit costumes. I can not understand how ashamed it is to look. Save yourself an hour and a little bit of your life .........
