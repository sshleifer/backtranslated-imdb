I took this film to replace the grim choice of daytime television and crave fatal women. As for the previous one, it’s better than daytime television .... although I’m not sure how much. <br /> <br /> He has his own advantages, but after about the first 20-30 minutes good points converge, and everyone comes to the conclusion that they are watching a film created for a TV that was put together and it’s not plenty of time to do something that holds you together. In short, a terrible movie type channel Sci Fi. <br /> <br /> He has his own points, such as the future is dirty, as shown by Blade Runner ..... of course, this is not Blade Runner. ” The captain looks like actor Robert Forster, the kind of person you want to be around. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, in the end, he feels like a bad “Andromeda”, overwhelming muscle. The crew consists of scant copies of the clever “Aliens” gunners, mystic vampire Willow, sexually enhanced, and the new captain can to be like Jan-Michael Vincent, running along the "Danger Island" in the "Banana Splits"; he just donned a uniform with epaulets; he has very little right to it. They all run with their version of power copies inside the ship, which is very similar to Eureka Maru, because they fight with the class of “people” who occupy the universe and are divided into several different tribes or sects of different Evolutionary qualities ... like the Nietzscheans in Andromeda. <br /> <br /> Michael Ironside may have a redemptive trait, but after a while there is a feeling that he took part as a scream! He probably had fun doing it, but it doesn't really help the film. <br /> <br /> This is ..... "good." It's good that you can watch a DVD once without turning it off; if they watch it with ads, they will probably change the channel. Someone might watch it once .......... but a few hours later, I wonder what made them watch it all. <br /> <br /> For me it was a femme fatale. ............ when she fought.
