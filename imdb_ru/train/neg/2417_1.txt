Without a doubt, it was the worst thing I ever spent money on. I feel dirty because I admitted that I made this “film” and paid money to watch it. This is not even a garbage assessment. No no. It is a juice that collects at the bottom of industrial garbage containers located in particularly dirty areas after an unusually wet summer. To call it garbage is to damage the garbage everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I had to sign up for IMDb and warn my friend. This character from Luva says this movie is great. One must question his understanding of reality. Let's take some of his comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> “The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a VERY good job.” <br /> <br /> Understandable. Well, if the director assumed that his audience would shrink and grimace with each sentence uttered by Ricky, or alternately burst into uncontrollable laughter at times when most directors would want a darker reaction from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did an outstanding job. <br /> <br /> “I am an aspiring actor, I myself act in a theater at my school, and I had to play a play in which I was supposed to cry, and in the scene it’s not so easy to be emotional, I give props to the actors who must make an emotional scene and can handle it. “<br /> <br /> Wow. I also have to give props to actors who can shoot emotional scenes. Luvahire, you may want to look at another job there, buddy, if you think these ruffians have done it. Still , they can help you if you need to practice. Just watch a movie. ga ga ga. <br /> <br /> “Bring a sequel” <br /> <br /> if i were your theater teacher at school , I would let you down, based only on this comment alone. <br /> <br /> I’m too disgusted to continue. Now I’ll pass the film with my help nickname Mr Bangla. <br /> <br /> Hi! If you kept reading this far, I take it for granted that you’ve already watched the movie, and now you’re looking for one of two things in this comment: 1) Extra violent humiliation the fact that you agreed was an exceptionally bad movie.2) The additional violent humiliation of what you feel was a good cinematic effort that needs to be protected from such slanderous scum as I am. If you want to help formulate your disgust or ammunition for a disturbing representative, if I say something good, it will only disappoint you - so let me assure you, such a disappointment has little chance. <br /> <br /> Other negative comments here, in IMDb, have already listed specific shortcomings of the film (for example, action, soundtrack, direction, dialogue, editing, etc.), but all these shortcomings can be easily forgiven, by oneself. Few will make a film called The Hood of the Living Dead, if they demand that these elements be first-class. However, the final failure of the "Hood" is that he did not cope with the plentiful promise of his name. The Hood of the Living Dead practically jumps off the shelf in a video store with its consequences of banal one-on-line and terribly creative murders. It was a chance to mix a raw hemorrhage with a zombie film with the realism of life in the ghetto, so that gangsta-gangster bombings bomb innocent people while they were shaking, making them lifeless pimps controlling all too mortal police in their deceived journeys. A mix of two genres could be fun. Instead, the film is more like how high school children timidly put the lines in a play that they play, but do not understand. To avoid a sense of betrayal on the part of the video rental audience, I suggest that the Kayroz brothers reissue a film with the following title: “Hood of the Living Dead: homemade horror video that we shot on our video camera with friends last weekend because we were bored.” Or maybe they could have released it as a documentary. “The Day of Creativity is dead: an exploration of how a low-budget film can still be completely devoid of clever or original ideas, despite the lack of links with the big movie Ostudia ". <br /> <br /> A potential tenant, whose interest was not suppressed, should find the following advertisement on the back of the video building:" The Quiroz brothers once again proved that you can’t see things that you can easily do yourself interesting ". - Mister. Bangla
