The comment "eliz7212-1" strikes the well-known "nail on the head" for this turkey program. But looking at William Shatner's “cavort” and “dance” is a scream (yes, the signs “” on the word “dance” are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a great parody of SNL or MAD TV - and it evaluates several stars at a time or so to see Shatner, who seems to have raised the “camp” to a new height - in the role or in the role of himself, But the guy funny. <br /> <br /> Girls who are in the booths with game data scrolls are very unlucky when this turkey is canceled - unless the revival of the whiskey-go-go genre, with a resurrected demand that slender young women danced again in the high cages. <br /> <br /> I watched the first participant, who was annoyed and literally "dumber than: the post," thanks to sheer luck, I left with a quarter or so. " The second participant, a little smarter, but who is lucky enough to get $ 1000 for “Danger”, received a card requiring an answer to a special question, which he did not know, and thus left with zilch. <br /> <br /> This is a set of game shows that hang, and sometimes award large sums to ordinary people, admittedly, are generally cheap efforts to attract viewers. Even if the owner receives a good compensation, and on average they give out six figures per episode, I believe that income versus cost may be favorable - because you do not have a comedian where several stars get six or seven figures, for an episode, with some big residual deals. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the best of them wear out quickly. This one has almost reached this point. I think that his proposals, especially with James Spader and other members of Boston Legal, should give us enough Bill Shatner's offers. <br /> <br /> Again, the above rating is just appropriate for viewing Bill Huth and Prance, perhaps once; that should be enough.
