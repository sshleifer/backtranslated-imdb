Following Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the British film industry quickly overwhelmed bad gangster films in the late 90s and early 00s, which today seem even more desperate than they did then. In one of the largest cases in the history of pearls from pigs, manufacturers of Rancid Aluminum brazenly smeared the quote “The Best Film of the Century” from a single review throughout the advertisement, omitting the rest of the sentence indicating that it was only because it was the only film that was released in 2000. Looking at him today, it’s hard to imagine how he was ever created, uniting the cast, which was briefly considered the cream of the guys from “Cool Britannia” Brigade of magicians ?? Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes are now just a guarantee of turkey every time in the tangled adaptation of James Howes' tangled novel. The fact that the plot is never explained may be due to the fact that no one really knows what it is, or perhaps simply does not think that it matters. Something connected with the fact that businessman Ifan was determined to kill Stephen Berkoff, a Russian crime lord in a money laundering or investment scheme (it's never clear what no one asks), says an Irish accountant from Fiennes who expects that the Russians will be killed by Ifans so that he can take over his insolvent company. Things are becoming more entangled and undervalued since, ifans alternates between screaming about how terrible his life is, while he juggles visits to the clinic of reproductive medicine and sleeps with her secretary and ridiculously Russian temptress Tara Fitzgerald. Drake "and Fiennes makes a decent Irish accent, arguing that the fact that he played a great writer in" Shakespeare in Love "does not mean that he can be a good judge when it comes to film scripts. <br /> <br /> When the most convincing performances come from Keith Allen and Dani Ber, you know that the film is in big trouble, while Poland is in favor of Russia, filled with people with Polish accents and a strange score that turns John Barry into spaghetti music for Ennio Morricone Western with budget with a lophone, she fails in steep bets, to which the curious overloaded, but almost conspiracy strives to be less suspended by itself, sitting there like doggy jokes.
