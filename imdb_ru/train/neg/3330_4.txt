This film shows approx. David Muir's assessment and good performance in the role of Dr. Hackenstein. The opening and ending credits show along with most of the actors and “special effects” that this is a low-budget film. There is nothing in this film that you could not find in other mad scientists, horror films / comedies or low-budget films. Not especially for lovers of naked scenes or bad movie lovers. This film is just here. Ann Ramsey and Phyllis Diller don't care either. If you are just as curious as I am, and you can find it, you will understand the truth from a one-line resume.
