First, Jon Bon Jovi seems to be out of place in a vampire movie. Together with other not very interesting characters and a bad storyline, the entire film becomes predictable. If you remember this and are a fan of vampire films, you can have fun with a few scenes. Do not expect chapters in the style of Tarantino and the story of Ann Rice. (I expect to forget the whole movie by tomorrow;)
