As we all know, Hollywood likes to change historical events for our pleasure, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood films. For example, bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started shooting at LAPD, but in the film we see them return inside twice! Another example is the number of Los Angeles police officers who were shot at the end of the film, which is far from the truth! But, of course, Hollywood should have a good bloody end, so they * add * some more blood and guts. Some events were combined, and many of the leading actors played several different people, but this is what Hollywood has always done, so what to complain about? I guess the only sad part is that I watched about one hour of documentaries about the northern Hollywood shootout on TLC, which were much better than that!
