This film reminds me of some really bad science fiction movies of the 50s and 60s. It's not scary and not interesting, but boring, stupid and stupid. The special effects are ridiculous, all the actors are ridiculous, and the ending is just awful to spend money, rent or buy something better. I give 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey rather funny because of its stupidity).
