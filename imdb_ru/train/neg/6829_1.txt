I have written at least half a dozen horrible reviews of this horrible little movie, and none of them have been published, so I must assume that someone on imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a small group of oilmen could resurrect a military tank that has been installed in the desert for more than ten years and make a fighting machine out of it again is absurd. So does the direction. Go through it.
