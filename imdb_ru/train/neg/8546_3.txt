Very improbable, incredible and inconsistent Spanish production of ... well, let me see how close I can get to it. The film begins with a woman who killed one of her cats as a young girl. Then she pleads with her lover to take her somewhere for the holidays. He calls the job and demands that he lose his vacation time, and she says he will pay for it. How important it is to guess that at the end of the movie someone guesses because the guy, a swarthy photographer, is spying on beautiful Patti Shepard, the queen of Spanish horror films, who seems to take bikini for a moment so that he can take a picture, ask her for lunch, and then for his appointment to the mountain of witches, for reasons we have never been involved in. Before they leave, Patty must go to the house and loudly, the "terrible" cries of echo in our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film continues when the two stay in a hotel, go up the hill and finally understand why the mountain is called Witch Mountain. You know, this movie has several aspects that make it better than a bad movie. There is some kind of atmosphere in it, some of the characters' characters are really quite good (especially the deaf innkeeper and old woman), leads at least adequately, and the culmination - although it doesnâ€™t make any sense at all - is well set (literally) with witches in white bras and long black hair. It simply does not make any sense, and for me it is a great ill-wisher. I could watch the movie ten more times and still did not know more than what I had learned after the first viewing. This is the main problem. Witch Mountain is a curious film from a long series of cheap, atmospheric European horror films that hid this decade. If you can get more out of it than me, then it's better for you.
