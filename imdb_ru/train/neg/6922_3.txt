On one page and in a newspaper campaign, it was suggested (as they often did) much more disgusting and cruel material than was shown on the screens of the race. Claude Brooke is actually the Americanization of Claudio Brooke, who worked in the cinema for years. This is quite difficult to find; I would like to see it again to compare with other international horrors of the day, but I donâ€™t remember especially impressed times back. Most likely, it was a split version, which got to American theaters and video. But oh, this leaf ... is still the pearl of my later collection of horrors.
