Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that everyone can like, although this is my favorite film, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. The whole approach of Siberberga is so static. Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast at the same pace. The captures of Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. What happened to the editing of the film? The result is physically tiring to watch. The viewer is never spiritually tolerated. Your impulse is to rush home and play the recording again to confirm that Wagner understood everything correctly, and Siberberg did it wrong. And this set of jewelry with these “smart” reminders of Wagner’s anti-Semitism - will there ever be a viewer of this film without prior knowledge of Wagner?
