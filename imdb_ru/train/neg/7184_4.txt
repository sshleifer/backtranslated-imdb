It was not a very good movie. There were a lot of implausible and predictable things that happened during the film ... but I think most reviewers don’t understand why this film should appeal to a wide audience. THIS MOVIE WAS MADE BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Isn't that enough to inspire us all to see this movie? You know, the film, shot by the former NBA star, does not appear every day. Beautifully stupid children in a big house fall under a psycho with an ax. Every cliché ran out for us to moan. Teen sex. And all this was done by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can't say enough about this movie! Teen uses drugs! College hijinks! And all this was done by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
