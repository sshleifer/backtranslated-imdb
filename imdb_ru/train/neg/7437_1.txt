This film is simply not worth the time or money spent. A complete clich√© and plot that makes absolutely no sense! I can not believe that so many people gave this terrible film 10 points. I think they are puppets of the film's creator. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie a zero, I would. It is a pity that IMDb does not allow this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it was because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. What is sad is that I never had high expectations from this movie from the very beginning, and yet I felt that I had changed. Take my word for it, do not waste your $ 8 on this piece of garbage. The only entertainment I got from the movie is ridiculing the name of the director. In general, it is extremely RECOMMENDED!
