Firstly, itâ€™s far from as bad as some of the other rubbish that the Sci-Fi channel has created; This is not to say that Grendel is a good film, in fact, it is very bad, but it definitely had the potential to become much better. The disadvantages of the film stem from the design of the characters, characters, ridiculous additions to the story, visual effects, music, and most of: acting. <br /> <br /> When speaking about character design, I, of course, keep in mind what our heroes and villains look like. Beowulf and other Danes seem ridiculous Vikings, not warriors of brute force - this helmet, which we wear our main character, is too stupid. Grendel is like the Hulk, but with strange attachments to his elbows. <br /> <br /> Characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from the beginning to the end, but Finn - a worthless assistant - has achieved some two-dimensionality thanks to his romantic plot, and Unifert also gets some idea as he becomes less vain. <br /> <br /> As with Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it your own, but stick to the source material. The crossbow given to Beowulf is so ridiculous that I am surprised that the actors did not leave the stage. In addition to the additions, there are omissions, such as the main themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> The special effects are awful awful. Grendel and his mother Hug badly conceived, and therefore their image on the screen is less than plausible. <br /> <br /> The music is domineering, especially when the character dies. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not the worst Sci-Fi movie to date. Not. In fact, this is one of the best films, although it still is, it is a good trash, at best, fun. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wooden here and there. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you skip this film and see how Robert Zemeckis talks about the ancient history of Beowulf, simply because this film (Grendel) is only half of the tale, and not all that this film does. three star review.
