I have never seen any of these SciFi originals before; this was the first one. I think it will be fair to judge the acting, directing / production, set design and even CGI effects in other SciFi films. Comparing this with your typical Hollywood piece is not fair. I will say, however, that in general, the Aztec Rex did not quite resemble Werner Herzog Aghirre's masterpiece, the Wrath of God. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I note that yes, I really recognize the fact that this film has more to do with cultural encounters than with dinosaurs. Despite the fact that this is a science fiction film made for television, there is some hidden context in this story that I will consider. Included symbolic elements are fairly obvious. <br /> <br /> Therefore, studying history, theology, mythology and cinema: I found the dialogue outrageous and the plot plots are somewhat offensive. I do not ask any accusations on behalf of the producers - as I said, the film is what it is. But what worries me is the fact that many of the young people in this film probably rely on television to give them lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem is most pronounced in the character of Ayakoatl (not a comment on the performance of Dichen Lachman, but just the way her character was written, although I will say that she needs to do something before she gets any nods of Emmy). It is because of her character that the actions of the Spaniards Europeans are justified. Her role in the film as a love interest Rios confirms that the European way is the right way, simply because they are European. There really is no other reason given. In fact, it remains only to assume that the viewer should associate himself with the Europeans because of the Aztecs, because their clothes, language, ideology, etc. They are more familiar than the Aztecs, therefore the Aztecs are portrayed as rival and “backwards”. ". And it's not only that the viewer stays with this assumption due to the ethnocentric perception of the audience, but in fact it seems that the story is trying to convince the viewer - as if the Aztecs were not able to come up with a plan - if not better - to lure the dinosaur to death on a bed of penji. <br /> <br /> For the sake of justice, there is a subgroup of Spaniards who are portrayed as robbing temples and intending to simply mock the locals. Mesoamericans. There is also a scene where we have a Christian saint celebrating Aztec achievements: “They have agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc.” - But in the end, it’s still an Aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the film , even over the “thunder lizards” (more on this later). He portrayed him as insidious, double-faced and tries to send a romantic European Spaniard, deceiving him, consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms that alter consciousness - an important spiritual component for certain aspects and religions of the local Meso and North Americans (again, later), so that he can save a woman which he feels belongs to him and far from the Spaniard. <br /> <br /> Now, analyzing the true nature of the story (leaving obvious Christian and pagan topics outside the table) from a symbolic point of view, the viewer can easily take these so-called mass lizards as representatives. Mesoamerican ideology / theology, which in this film is portrayed as one intention: bloodthirstiness, ruthlessness, cruelty, villainy, maybe even evil? In opposition, we have this group of Christian wanderers, led by the young Hernando Cortes, who is portrayed as naive, but generally noble lambs, trapped in the dark pagan world of the Aztecs. The name of the film is Aztec Rex, which makes you believe that we are talking about dinosaurs that eat people. However, Aztec Rex translates as Aztec king, head of the Aztec state, or in this case, “state”. (Therefore, why the name of the film was changed). So who do we see at the end as the new king of the Aztecs? This is the remaining Spaniard, Rios. Aztec Rex refers to a new European ideology that, with the help of disease, bloodshed, war and famine, defeated Native Americans. Rios symbolizes the ideal European - because the creators of this film would like to be remembered (unlike Cortes, who represents "a practical, but still noble European"). But when you explore the Holocaust of America, let's be honest: don't the symbolic components of the history of this film have the opposite? <br /> <br /> I have to say that the Aztec Rex is at worst a bit racist, or being kind at this, at best ignorant. <br /> <br /> And yes, I know that this is just a film, I understand that everything should be fun, but in the end we are left with the thought that Rios was the father of the last remaining Aztec lines? Interestingly, the Mesoamerican Indians should have thought about this ending ... as for me, I thought it was too suicidal. <br /> <br /> The best supporting work of the film - Jan Ziring's wig - although striking - this, at least, changed the appearance of Tsiring so much that I did not think that I was looking at yuppi 90210, which led a group of conquistadors to heart of Darkness. In this film, Zering actually turns out to be a more than capable actor, I actually bought his performance, or, at least, I forgot that it was, after all, Jan Ciring. I don't know who his agent is, but he should get more work. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it was also nice to see Jim McGee again. I have been a fan of him since he had too briefly stolen the scene at Scrooged in 1988. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
