I'm not sure that Carpenter wants to raise abortion issues and make a really harsh and obvious conclusion that a woman should be allowed to have an abortion if Satan is the father, but it stretches and continues. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The baby really looks stupid, basically it's a crab with a baby head on it. You can pretty much see the material on Satanâ€™s costume. What a mess This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of fatigue. Very very bad. And the ending is just ridiculous. Having learned that his child is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in immense, bloody, bloody, loud excitement? NOT! He just hangs his head and sulks from the room. Terrible.
