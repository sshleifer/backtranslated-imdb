Moron and a girlfriend perform a certain ritual to resurrect the dead, trying to prove that the dead cannot be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they resurrect a dead soul, which begins to chop them with an ax, and the next day some older people from college tell a story by the fire. The guy with the ax turns and starts hacking idiots telling the story. The group calls the policemen, the policeman sees the blood splashing everywhere, and thinks that this is a mountain lion (!?), And soon after that he is being pursued by some kind of deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> A moronic little squirting film that was filmed in broad daylight, but where several characters carry lanterns and speak as if it were night, and want to send a signal flash to get attention. One guy has a gun in one hand and cartridges in the other, but he doesn’t bother to charge him, and after he finally charges him, he has several opportunities to shoot the killer, but he doesn’t worry because it will put an end to the movie is too early. Then he throws the gun away! Also harmful are the characters who show no emotion and don't look worried after their friends are cut into pieces and lousy effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car exploded at the end was clearly a car model) and a terrible dialogue and some kind ugly female nudity doesn't help. And in the end, he tries to do without incoherence, saying that it was all an invention of the very same old people telling stories around the campfire at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer truly in the last scene breaks them apart. Again. <br /> <br /> Mediocre of its kind, good only for unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
