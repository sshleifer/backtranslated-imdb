C'mon, some previous reviewers almost wrote a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60s TV show! This episode of Star Trek is notable for the fact that the most serious kid (Joman Barrow) has ever been used on Star Trek and that he was filmed in a real place on the street. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series, which were completely limited to sound scenes. <br /> <br /> This use of the outdoor location (and baby) gives the proper depth and quality, almost like a movie, to a completely ordinary episode, which is now dated and very familiar to the show. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few notable exceptions, such as "The City on the Edge of Eternity", "Task Land" and "Tomorrow". The old Star Trek series should be seriously moth agitated and free from boring suffering. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 are a pretty bad average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the boring things Gene Roddenberry produced then, in fact, contrary to the popular belief that some people worshiped the land he walked on, he actually made a lot of garbage! He does not deserve to be talked about in the same breath, for example, with Irwin Allen. <br /> <br /> Just look at the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used shaky plywood for the floor, table chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the dashboards. You can clearly see the folds on paper! Every bill saved or what!
