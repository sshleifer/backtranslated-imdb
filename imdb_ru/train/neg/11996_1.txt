I have been waiting for this movie for a long time. Moreover, Juhi Chawla is involved in this, she is an excellent actress. <br /> <br /> This film consists of six stories. This new concept has flown in from Hollywood. So this is not a new subject. <br /> <br /> 1. Hamini (Priyanka Chopra) is dancing. She wants to become famous and has come up with a guy so that news journalists are interested in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears, and he claims to be her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When she screams, I get annoyed. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. But in serious things he is amazing. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Sime (Juhi Chawla). He gets into a midlife crisis and attracts a much younger woman, forgetting that he really has a life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor and Juhi are actors / actresses born of nature. They are cool. But this story is small for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshay Khanna) is going to marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he catches a cold and fails the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeba (Vidya Balan). She has an accident and suffers from memory loss. Now she does not know that she loves her husband more. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) - Taxi Driver. He meets Stephanie (Shannon Esrechowitz), a white woman who is in love with an Indian man, but is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju should bring Stafani to this man, but fell in love with her. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govindaâ€™s films. He is very annoying, not funny. But in this film I really liked him, as if he had grown up in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! This is Sohail Khan! He plays Rama Dayal, who just married Phulvati (Isha Kopkikar). He wants to take some serious actions with her, but every time her family is between them. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! I like his films. <br /> <br /> Now here's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. Creating one story out of six non-interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories touch each other, but have no meaning for the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka cannot act! Lose this woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should shoot more films, this role was too small for him. Salman Khan may not play comic roles, but real serious films. It is written about his life as an actor. This film sucks and is a waste of actors and actresses such as Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Hannah and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> You have the opportunity to make a film with Amitabh. Bachchan, and you just let him sing a lullaby.
