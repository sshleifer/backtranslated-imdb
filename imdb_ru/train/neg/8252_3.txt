What happened to the sound? It sounded like everything was duplicated. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. The plot = bad. Accents = bad (even Dougrey, and we live in Scotland), Acting = bad, Harp = bad, Sex scenes - bad / unceremoniously. <br /> <br /> However, we looked to the end in disbelief. How could such a good cast of actors make it so bad? Will they ever get a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Bad, bad, bad. By the way, we gave him 3, because we, at least, were tempted to watch him to the end because of his strange plot, etc. <br /> <br /> And to the senior reviewer, I completely agree, it was seems like a romantic farce of the 1940s. How did this happen in 2004? <br /> <br /> Good, good, there were some good bits. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougray had a good boat. Jennifer looked good in a small outfit. But how did the sister get all the men?
