Whatever makes Guy Ritchie remake the film Werthmüller, incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new film is a mess. When I saw this, there was another person in the audience, and she left for about an hour. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed until the end was that I never left the movie. <br /> <br /> But I was sitting through this piece of junk, stunned that Madonna and Richie might have thought that they had made a good movie. The dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is terrible, and the only pleasant thing about this film is the scenery. Richie took Lina's film and turned it into another Blue Lagoon. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you don’t even spend on watching Cinemax late at night. Time is too precious to waste on such nonsense.
