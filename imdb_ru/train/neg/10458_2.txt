I entered this film with expectations of cheating that it would be insightful and inspiring. Of course, something more than a cheap commercial for the group "Wilco". <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a lot of whimpers and whining about the “process”, the dishonest and, without a doubt, one-sided image of the members of one group. who was driven out by the prima donna’s lead singer / songwriter, the heartbreaking confession of a dead member’s friend - for about 18 years - saying that “friendship has passed,” and this tearful, insatiable story of how the record label “offends their feelings” by throwing them, just so that the band can immediately get 50 offers from other labels (oh, tension ... no!). They tried their best to make it look like tension, but I suspect that it was all the smoke and mirrors to cause a tragedy that did not exist. It does not even take into account the long segments, when we get a lot of their newest songs in full, without any plot line, understanding or even decent work in the cinema. Tense attempts at emotional sincerity or a reasonable outlook on life made me look tired. <br /> <br /> From the film, this group sounds like a bunch of nasty little children who are looking for a voice that is not heard. to have and think that they are a kind of guardian for musical art, which they definitely are not. And I thought that the music sucks, and I could not even understand the lyrics because of the slurred style of the lead singer. <br /> <br /> I give her 2/10.
