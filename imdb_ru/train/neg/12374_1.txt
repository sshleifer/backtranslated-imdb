I don’t remember seeing another horrible / mysterious movie like this. In this film about the forensic scientist who investigates the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident, there is a complete receipt for a bad movie: a bad game, a boring story, no waiting, bad humor and no drama. I remembered watching this movie on PAX, a television station known for producing low-budget and lowly films for television such as this one. TV movies, of course, do not have a marginal factor or uncertainty, like movies from the Big Screen. But this film must have hit all sour tastes. The creators of this film missed the opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" an excellent television film; The headline does offer some waiting. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, don’t watch this movie. This film alone can kill your television appetite. <br /> <br /> F grade
