So you can read some of the comments published in this film, and you can think to yourself: “Aha. There were 30 RAVE REVIEWS publications published December 30th. ” The funny thing is that most of these enthusiastic reviews sound like they belong to one person or, at best, to a small, coordinated group of fans of "Open House". True, my friends, this is what this film is really invisible. Being “independent” does not mean that he gets a free pass. If you are going to do a musical, whether in a movie or on stage, on Broadway or in a community theater, you probably should make sure that (a) your actors can sing, (b) your actors can dance (c.) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well-written score, and (e.) you have witty and charming lyrics. Even Anthony Rupp can't save it. This is one of those unsuccessful movie trips where I actually felt deeply embarrassed for all the participants.
