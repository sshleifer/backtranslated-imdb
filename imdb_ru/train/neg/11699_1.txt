The plot of The Thinner is clearly thin. And gross. A fat lawyer drives a gypsy, and the gypsy curse makes him lose and lose weight ... to the bone. Well, the gypsy curses should be interesting, but the weight loss went bad? Nope Except that Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another horror writer and screenwriter for this horrible film, also does this. A lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, but fat, ha ha! Thinner is like an immature piece of shit for a man who groans, as he never saw anything more disgusting than fatness Hey, I can only say: well, look in the mirror.
