I decided to watch this film because it was nominated for an Oscar this year. I think like a lot of people here, I really wanted this film, but ultimately boring and disappointed. The first scene was fine, but the rest of the movie in camera mode “shaking hands” is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I think that the main reason for creating such a film and its Oscar nomination is the following: <br /> <br /> The American “war machine” (people who make money from war) urgently justifying or justifying the war in Iraq is a confusion of something (a kind of) patriotic. <br /> <br /> why are these “heroic” efforts of the director and protagonist to inspire the audience with the idea of ​​“loving war as a drug”? .. Oh please, come on! what a boredom! <br /> <br /> look at this to see how low the cinema academy can go down ...
