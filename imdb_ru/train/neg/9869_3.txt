Did not care about the film, the book was better. Does anyone know where this was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your site ... I just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a fool, but I think I will send my comments anyway. and yes, bc is beautiful. *** Or why did they take her from the coastal zone of South Carolina? (this question is). The place was important for the fabric of the book, and changing it was part of my disappointment in the film. Oh, I just read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here is my other major issue with the film. Kim Bassinger was too stupid and not at all what I portrayed from the book. I know the book was a book and a film; Well, not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathetic. The book also evoked the village, almost primitive images of the monastery. Although the “castle” in the film was much more impressive, it distorted the plot feel and seemed to diverge from the characters.
