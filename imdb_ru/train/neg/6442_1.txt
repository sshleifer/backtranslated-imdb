Not only does the author of the film, Steven Greenstreet, obviously idolize Michael Moore, but he also follows in his footsteps, using a few of the tactics of making the film Moody's Propaganda. Moore has the experience of distracting the viewer from this focus, although Greenstreet is obviously less experienced here. <br /> <br /> Being familiar with all the issues related to Mura's speech at UVSC, I was disappointed to see that the main complaints of the community were that Mura was paid $ 40,000 from the educational funds of Utah to to promote John Kerry’s campaign and advertise his own liberal film — Greenstreet was pushed into the background, while lesser problems were a sensation. br /> <br /> The marketing methods for this video were equally biased and undesirable ... promoting the film, claiming "Mormon tried to kill Moore." This is not only ridiculous, but it also denigrates the main religion, with which Greenstreet obviously has some personal problems. I followed Moore’s visit very carefully, and all the major news agencies noted that Moore’s visit took place and passed without any major security issues or incidents in Utah. <br /> <br /> Greenstreet relied on this film to launch his film career to such an extent that he even dropped a film school to speed it up. This seemed to be a serious miscalculation, since Moore’s visits to about 60 other colleges and universities throughout the country in 2004 weakened interest in this rather common event. Greenstreet's suggestion that American viewers would be interested in this film due to propaganda religious and conservative views does not seem to be entirely justified. <br /> <br /> Even the name of the film “This Divided State” is somewhat wrong, as Utah voted overwhelmingly to re-elect Bush and, therefore, seems more politically united than any other state. The division in the film’s title seems more revealing from the abyss that exists in Greenstreet’s ideological differences with its religion and state. In any case, I find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this alleged documentary and Woody Allen's hilarious statement in Sleeper (1973) that “I was beaten by Quakers”.
