A female vampire kills young women and draws them with blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he must do what she orders, or turn into a bloodsucker. After several murders, the assistant repented and fell in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? That his pace is too slow, that he has some strange sound effects (the bite never sounded so strange) and the atmosphere (new jazz here, I come), and that the lights don't seem to be included in the set. It looks like a horror film "author" with all the self-sufficiency inside. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid, and, as you can guess, it is the female vampire who explains how to kill her, even if she does not. no need to do that; Of course, crosses, light, garlic and chopsticks do not work. <br /> <br /> This is not even a funny lousy movie. Perhaps, with some friends and lots of beer, this may not have its funny sides (to be honest, it's funny for 10 to 15 minutes near the end of the film). Do not be deceived by the Troma sticker, this is one of the bad films they represent.
