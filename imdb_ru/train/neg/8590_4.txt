Ridiculous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into a tearful 19-year-old boy Annakin, who for some reason seems attractive to Amidala, is 5 years older than him. Now the 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has a pair of bad dreams, and so he slaughters children, his friends and the whole world of his existence, because the crazy old man convinced him: and b) only he can prevent it. Ludicrosity squared. <br /> <br /> I think that people who like this film do not pay attention. The story is funny. The characters are incredible (literally, and not the perverted feeling of “fantastic”, “wonderful”, etc.). <br /> <br /> Obi-Wan Kenobi was a wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but at the climax, he cuts off Annaakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava and leaves him to suffer. Doesn't anyone think that this is a bit out of character? Not to mention the fact that it was pretty stupid to risk his life, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> I was expecting at least a story that would show consistent characters with believable motives. None of this is here. This story could have been written by a 10-year-old child. <br /> <br /> Yes, CGI is pretty cool.
