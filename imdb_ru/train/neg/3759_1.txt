Oh, where to start. The cinematography was excellent. When the movie was just beginning because of the initial landscape scenes, I thought I needed a good movie. Then came the bigfoot cgi. It looked like a caricature drawing of the King of the Lion and the beloved child of King Kong. He completely stripped the credibility of the character. Now I knew that there was no snowman chasing people who roam the woods â€” there is no obvious reason other than the stupid cartoon cgi. So since then, the whole movie was shot for me. The money they pushed down the toilet for a cgi, which they could spend on a suit, as Roger Patterson did. He was the best suit for the snowman, which no one could compare with his. I'm a hardcore Bigfoot fan, and I was warned about this film, but my coercion led me to watch this film, and I was disappointed because previous reviews had warned me. I know that after reading this review, you still say: "I have to watch the hunters for Sasquatch, I must watch the hunters for Sasquatch". Then you will say why I spent my good hard earned money on such a terribly boring boring movie!
