Please do not let the cover of this film fool you. And if you are looking for a cheap horror film to laugh: it is not. Usually I will go for stupidity, if it is ridiculous, but this stupidity was so stupid that it almost (or perhaps even) made me stupid. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is better than that of a PDA, but not by much, and it is possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on the Casio keyboard. These problems should by no means be an obstacle to watching a horror movie, but add this amazing cast, and you will have a real scandal. <br /> <br /> The story of a guy who invites his friends for a date. Texas family house for the weekend. He also invites his lady to fall in love with his office. On the way, they meet an unhappy woman who is then invited by other girls. <br /> <br /> Staying in the salon includes sex and undressing, and soon all the panties are in a heap, when one girl disappears, and strange things appear in the house. <br /> <br /> From there you (the audience) and the morons, the actors, are trying to figure out what is happening, and soon they begin to mistrust each other. In general, I think it sounds better than it is. The main struggle with this film is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot is invented, bad behavior and ignorant motives. Once again this could be forgiven if it were the least amusing, but alas, it is not. <br /> <br /> Ending a turn is just a turn in which no one would have guessed simply, because if you really thought out a film, it would not make sense in any case. Please do not let this review prevent you from seeing the wonders of this film. (Wow, my nose just grew eight inches.)
