This film shifts from the most indulgent moment to the most indulgent moment, promising to develop into something worth holding on to. But it is not. It is flat, shy, unimaginable and tedious. <br /> <br /> A series of installed images and backgrounds is not a movie, but a calendar. This kind of miserable socialist pseudodrama documentary (“TRUE, REALLY happened”) is not only entertaining, but not convincing, so it does not even function as a social history. A cliché mixed with a bad acting game makes this film very difficult to complete, the entertainment factor quickly disappears. Characters are one-dimensional, never developing to the extent they relate to them. The director's ego is the biggest character in this film.
