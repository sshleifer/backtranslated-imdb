After seeing the credits with only one name, which I recognize and which was the preacher in this film (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this film and was not disappointed. A man plans to kill his new wife, convincing other people that she is crazy and commit suicide. It is not known to her husband that the plastic-looking skull, which he uses, on the contrary, the ghost of a woman, obviously, his first dead wife takes revenge on her mind and uses a real skull. A simple story with a twist of irony at the end. If you are tired late at night and need a dream, it will help you sleep in this dream.
