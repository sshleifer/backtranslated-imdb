The next time you are at a party, someone will ask: “The other day I heard the expression“ The will of the author. ” Does anyone know what this means? ”Tell them to sit in“ Head Over Water. ” The only way Diaz could survive in this film is a literary device, usually used by bad writers. There are a few comic scenes, and you will have some laughter. However, the film does not stand the slightest logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of him, and not behind him? Why is she able to gag a chainsaw of course. For me, the best part of this film was that I saw it through the cable channel instead of spending four dollars in a video store.
