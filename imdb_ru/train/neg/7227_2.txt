While others may argue that watching other films of Bilal will appreciate this film better, but it failed in one of the main ways. It does not stand by itself. The plot is a confusion that confuses symbolism with content. Here is an idea to start with a certain story. Then create a symbolism around it. We start with two different narratives: this woman, who somehow turns into a man, is a “god” who is judged for some reason, but for the last time is thrown to Earth, and this mysterious character John, who seems to develop a kind of "resort" "just outside the city. Why? There is no answer to any of these questions. But we are worried about it, no. There is no development to want us to sympathize with any character in the story, the closest we get Jill, and even then development is spotty at best. Unfortunately, the film turns out to be visually impressive in general (what it is), but due to the development of motivation, I would really like it to be rewritten by someone who could distance themselves a little from the material and not feel that every image should be on the picture.
