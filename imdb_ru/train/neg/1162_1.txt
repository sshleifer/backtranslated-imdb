I went to see this film in our student theater thirty years ago, because I liked Bruce Dern in the movie Quiet Running and a Family Story. To this day (sorry, Jack Nicholson), this is still the most boring movie I've ever seen. It went on and on without a noticeable point, and then it just ended. The light came on, and I watched everyone look around shyly. The projectionist missed the coil? I never had the desire to learn. All I remember about the film is that it was not a drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most pleasant part of the film is to watch the completely mysterious afterwords of the audience. Fortunately, this was an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
