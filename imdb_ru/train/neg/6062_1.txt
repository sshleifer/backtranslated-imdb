Wow. The only people who rate this positively are Carpenter’s apologists. I know a lot of these. The guys who watch John Carpenter squatting on celluloid take out the film and announce it as a masterpiece of horror. This "movie" is complete nonsense. It looks and sounds like porn (good lord, the soundtrack is awful ...), and has subpar porn action, which is shocking, because usually Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when he did this. Most likely, "Beans, beans, beans ...", until someone fed him and rolled him in a blanket for the whole day ... They don’t say anything at all about the abortion debate, when they could have interesting central theme (how do religious anti-abortion fanatics feel when this is a diabolical child?) but instead they decided that Ron Perlman and his horribly acting children were killing a bunch of people, and terribly abandoned doctors trying to calm a hysterically poor pregnant girl. Not a single person from this episode or that you should leave unscathed. It's just awful. Like, Plan 9 From Space is terrible. Like, god, please, somebody will turn it off before I ruin myself. Try to look at this and the Thing on the same day, and your mind will explode.
