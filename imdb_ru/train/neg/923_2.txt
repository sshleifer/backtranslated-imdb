For some reason, the various young couples hiking in the Italian Alps are divided to find out which of them will be the first to reach their camp site. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds the skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator, and is obsessed with the spirit of "Tyrant" when he puts on a helmet belonging to a corpse. He then spends the rest of the film, running through the woods, tracking down his friends and chopping their limbs to add a little stew to bring the Demonic back to life. This digitally-released Full Moon release is stupid, meaningless, with terrible play and sound, and the Los Angeles National Forest is a bad substitute for Italy. However, this is a fairly high rate of unintentional laughter, mainly due to excessive performance. Do I have to believe that Kenyon's funny facial expressions and awkward delivery of Kenyon's feverish eyes run in cheap armor swinging a sword, or spew neurotic Latin gibberish about demons and resurrection. Well, at least he's not boring, like most other actors.
