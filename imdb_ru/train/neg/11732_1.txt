This film was not just bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is inconsistent, the characters are mostly cliché, with little depth, and Farnsworth’s play was especially bad. <br /> <br /> From patronizing accents to a meaningless storyline and inappropriate “graphic” elements, to repetitive dialogue and scenarios ... this sucks. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for a kind of sharper, renewed “cowboy pharmacy” with a touch of “natural killers”, but he is not as sensitive to characters as the first and not where shocking odor level fraternity) as a staircase. <br /> <br /> Most of all, someone really needed a) edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things you can build on and clearly / <br /> <br /> with a decent theme ... if this is done in his attempt.) b) edit the film. if it was reduced to the core, it could be passable. <br /> <br /> I would have dropped below 1 if I could ... as maybe zero Kelvin.
