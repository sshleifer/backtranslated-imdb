This film is a calculated attempt to make money on the success of "Sex in the city" and "Four weddings and funerals." In fact, if they called it “Sex at a Funeral”, they could have achieved more at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the film falls between two stools and can not get up. Characters spew out an incredibly vivid dialogue, but never act as a remotely recognizable person. One arbitrary, senseless action follows another to promote what is considered a conspiracy, and one soon gets tired of the falsity of the whole enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andy McDowell gets points for playing his small heart, but performing honors stolen by Imelda Staunton, like everyone else, by a police detective (they have no requirements for growth there?) Miss Staunton does not seem to be able to make the wrong move. If we could say the same about the writer-director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill annoyed you as a cheater, stay away from that. Phonus Bolognus in half.
