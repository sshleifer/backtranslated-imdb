I think you can summarize this show in about the same way as everything else. "TAS Batman" may be the worst thing that ever happened to cartoons based on comics, because everything that happens next will be compared to him, and nothing has yet been measured. It's damn good. Was Batman Out Good? "Yes, but it was not TAS." Justice League is good? “It's not so bad, but it's not TAS.” <br /> <br /> “Batman”, of course, is also not TAS, but I will not say it. That would be unfair, and besides, he would have many other problems. <br /> <br /> Batman’s younger crime fighting idea is younger, elegant, and sometimes the art is very pleasant. But for the rest of the time, art does not make sense of Americanism, and this reveals a lot of shortcomings of the show itself. This is a tempo, written and framed as an American. If I wanted to see Jackie Chan's adventures, I would watch Jackie Chan's adventures. Or I could at any moment just hit my head against the wall and get the same effect. The joker is a killer, a mentally unbalanced clown in a suit who uses his wit, unpredictability and smart devices to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight from hand to hand, he will either resort to something cheap or will be completely replayed. He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks, who knows kung-fu and can jump twenty feet into the air, accompanied by high-speed lines. If they wanted to do this with a villain, there would be other less important characters that they could use or * suffocated *, they could create a whole new one. And it's not that rethinking is bad, don't get me wrong. TAS (here I am again) took Mr. Freese from your standard villain, who owns ice weapons, and made him a memorable and morally complex character. Of course, Freeze was not a classic villain at the time, and they performed the update, but the essence did not change. What Batman does is take everything you like in the comics and knowledge of Batman, and take on a large, stinking dump. Guess what? They ate corn. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this show does not stand up to TAS, but it is on its own feet, and it still does not work for me. The plots are not good, and they do not develop better. They were written for the demographics of children under twelve. Should kids enjoy the show? Of course they should. This should not be a show for adults with abusive, nudity and unwarranted violence. But the hallmark of a really good show is that they can be enjoyed at different levels for all ages. This show does not match this mark. <br /> <br /> Is this a TAS show? No, of course not. The problem is that it is not even a JLU.
