“Don't drink the water” is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on the 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. These are the stars of Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind “Just Married.” Director Howard Morris has appeared in several comedies by Mel Brooks (“Stinks of Life”, “Anxiety”, “Silent Movies”) and made a great impression on the animation (among his characters are “Gopher” from “Pooh”, “Dzhughed” (Archie) and "Beetle Bailey") What went wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively. Allen’s original play was mocking, so she worked on Broadway and in Allen’s 1994 remake. Scenario R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beat the premise to death and make too many changes from the original game. The wife’s creation of Gleason in this version, when she was a stubborn woman in the original, is just one example of why this is not working. <br /> <br /> The game is not much better. Gleason does his best with the material, but he cannot save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also an excellent actor, as he demonstrated in Hastler and Soldier in the Rain. His abrasive personality could work here, but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance. Very bad. Estelle Parsons, the airy wife, will drive you crazy in 20 minutes. See how soon you want to strangle her. It's also a shame, because she is also a great actress who played two exceptional performances in Bonnie and Clyde and Rachel, Rachel. None of the other actors are particularly good either. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and Julia Kavner (Marge Simpson) starring. They manage to hit all the right notes, and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. This is finally on the video after a long battle for the rights. Go and find this version. All that is needed for the 1969 original is the removal of unwanted guests who are delaying the reception. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 stars
