and forget about it. Fully. If you really need to see the act of Madonna, take the “Body of Evidence”, at least Willem Defoe in it. <br /> <br /> In this film, although the scenery is beautiful, you can turn off the dialogue, you do not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood wasted, Jean Tripplehorn - support, and Madonna is so terrible that it becomes funny. Why they had to embed the original film into this mess, I will never know; I think they thought it was "acceptable." Madonna as an actress, of course, NO. <br /> <br /> If you rent an original film since 1979, then you will like it, and the actors in it can really play. 1/10
