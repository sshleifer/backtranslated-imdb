Many people here say that this show is only for children. Hmm, when I was a kid (about 7-9 years old), I first watched this show. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other children about it and, of course, about other shows and you know what? It was a disguise measure, when we wanted to emphasize the stupidity of something (on TV or something else), we said: “Well, like Power Rangers” and laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site, I could not imagine that there were actually MMPR fans. It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not like this view. But it dawned on me: maybe I lack imagination? It may be. However, this argument is not enough to evaluate it by more than 1 star.
