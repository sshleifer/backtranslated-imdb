In the beginning we see the beginning of some secret advice. Everything looks very promising from the very beginning. With the addition of some supernatural elements, the puzzle becomes more interesting every minute. The protagonist, who seems like a good guy, falls into trouble because of his demands for money, for which he is entitled (tempted), and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and want to know what exactly is happening. Usually a person in his situation would have several options. For some reason, he does not have such options. There seems to be only one solution to this film, even when it is clear that it is not his fault. Suddenly he is confronted with characters who talk about the church, prayer and God. And they give the answer to his problem. At some point in the film, it should be obvious what that decision is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it is always useful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. Although the message is good, its simplicity cannot avoid the fact that more should happen in real life to solve the problems presented in this film. The mystery that is presented to us will never be revealed. Instead, you have to deal with another topic, which essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Don't be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. Once a brilliant actor is adequate, but if you look closely, you will see that he is not at all serious. He really must desperately need money. Otherwise, what would an actor of such a level have to do in such a film.
