If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I would just like to know where the money went. A monkey could do better CGI effects than spent 3 hours on this terrible piece of garbage, although I have to admit that cars and Martians would look very, very cool in the original game for Play Station 1 and early PC games. from the mid-90s, if the game has ever been made. What puzzles me, where did the money go? Pendragon movies could be a great movie with good old-fashioned models and computer-controlled cameras, such as George Lucas, around 1975–83, and with actors who actually look like they care what they do (or destroy in this case), about the same 20 million. Perhaps this is the worst movie ever made! I would rather sit on Ishtar’s 24-hour re-show than watch this movie again. I hated it completely! I regress. I say this is the worst movie ever made, because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9, Killer Tomatoes or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, these are films that are so bad that they have a special place in their heart, you love them. There is no love for this film and there is no place in my DVD library for it. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I bet the money on the film was spent on drinks and other vices for the actors and the crew. Shame on you, Pendragon's films! I want my money back!
