To Die For (1989) was just another dtv A feature that appeared on cable television in the early nineties. The only thing that is remarkable about this feature is the last film in which Duane Jones appeared. In addition, there is no reason to watch this vampire movie, unless you like pseudo-chicks masquerading as a horror movie. A tired vampire craves love and is looking for her in the lanes of LA Will he succeed, or will Vlad just strike again, as in the last century? <br /> <br /> This film must have been a big one, because a few sequels soon followed. They are so bad that they make it look like a classic. I know this is a movie about vampires, but the filmmakers could get used to the lighting. <br /> <br /> I didn’t recommend it because I didn’t like it. <br /> <br /> - said Nuff?
