Raising Victor Vargas is one of those easy family films that you can watch and simultaneously solve the New York Times crossword. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a crown, you don't need to “stop” the DVD. Just let it roll, because you don’t miss anything really important. No twists, turns or tensions. This is not really an ethnic film, it is a film about a poor immigrant family that turns out to be Hispanic. They could be any ethnic group. It made little difference. I've seen it all a million times before. Simply connect a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family or an Irish family. Just the accents and the names were different. If the Vargas family were called Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians, the film would have been a good reason. <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics here could not understand the language. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some Bronx and another Brooklyn. Being a life-long New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family had never met anyone except other Latin Americans. They lived in an isolated small enclave. Some interaction with non-Hispanics might cause excitement, interest, or tension. Remember the West Side Story? <br /> <br /> And now about the often criticized cinematography. I don't know if it was my TV or something else, but all the pictures in the room looked very ORANGE to me. The apartment, furniture and faces were ORANGE. What was that supposed to mean? And the fit really looked pretty cramped for me. Someone here mentioned that there were very large rooms in the old apartments. Well, maybe 50 years ago. And the landlords made one big apartment for 2 or 3 very small and squeezed in as many immigrants as possible. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing ... This is the second family film that I saw and criticized this week, in which a teenage boy starred. Do we need to watch this private sex? Please spare me! What happened to these directors? <br /> <br /> So, “Victor Vargas” is a small pleasant film. It was nice that young Latin American actors got a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. But the authors let them down, giving them a flat, inconspicuous script for the work. Enjoy viewing, but keep your fingers next to the "forward" button.
