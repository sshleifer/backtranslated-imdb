Godzilla vs. King Hydor is a great example of how a great idea can be destroyed by such pitiful topics as pseudo-patriotism. Here, future travelers are trying to destroy Japan, replacing the local hero Godzilla with their puppy monster, three-headed golden dragon, King Gidora. However, they fail, and in the end Godzilla fights with Hydora. The battles between the two hippos are very cool, but the plot of the film is full of holes, and everything about “Japan is great” is really stupid. The creators of this film did not even threaten the enemies of Japan, making them stupid big blondes who are easily outwitted by clever Japanese. It’s good that, as a result, Godzilla and King Hydor almost destroyed both Japan, and these are ridiculous enemies in one (in fact, two) exciting battles. But before this battle, the film was really boring and pathetic.
