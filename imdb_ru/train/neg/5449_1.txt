The idea is that in the first ten minutes something interesting happens, so that the audience gets hooked. Late Night Shopping avoids interest much longer. When we got to the point, it was so monumental idiotic that I kept thinking that I must have misunderstood. But I did not. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of a landlord from Osaka who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time, working in different shifts and therefore did not realize that they were sharing. His friend asks: "What about the weekend?" Sean has no adequate explanation. Then Sean tells the story of his own problem, which is that he is not sure that his girlfriend still lives at home, as he works at night, and she works during the day so that they never see each other. This has been going on for three weeks. But his friend does not ask: “Yes, but, as I said, how about a weekend? Then you should see her. This makes no sense. What are you going about, Sean? Are you taking medicine or something? ? But let's be generous and suppose they both work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean checking if soap and towels are being used. (Actually, strangely, he begins to carry soap around.) But what about the conditioner and shampoo of his girlfriend, sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is anything missing? Has anyone been bought? Was there a shared bed in the bedroom or not? Is her clothes used and changed to clean? Laundry basket fuller? Is the toilet seat up or down? I mean, good grief! <br /> <br /> And to top it all off, Paul arranges to leave work early, to see if his girlfriend lives at home. Why doesn't he just call her? <br /> <br /> But things are getting worse. In the last act, although no one told Vincent where the rest of the group was going, he manages to find them. Lenny's love interest and Shona's girlfriend seem to be best friends, and also manage to find a group. There is not even the slightest attempt to explain any of these unusually unlikely coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the dialogue is fine, but not good enough to make up for weak characters or an annoying lame story. <br /> I heard one of the actors giving an interview, and he promised: "No weapons, no drugs, no corsets." I thought, "excellent." But after half an hour of exhaustion, I shouted at the screen: “I want a weapon! I want drugs! I want corsets! ”<br /> <br /> To solve these problems, it would not take a long time, but on the official website the director brags that the film has not been edited. That's all you need to know.
