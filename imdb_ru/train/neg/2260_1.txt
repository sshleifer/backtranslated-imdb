Oh, dear, Jerry may be the undisputed king of talk shows, but movies are a completely different ball game, and he comes out of his league. The screenplay of this film is so poor that you need to see it to believe, and it’s sad to see such vaguely familiar actors like Michael Dudikoff (80s action movie, king of movie stars), Michael J. White (last seen on the Sci Fi flop) “Revival "), As well as" Survival at the Games "by William McNamara (who participates in the only half-funny situation in the entire film!) Drops to a minimum when hired. If you are a fan of Jerry, then stick to his TV show, as this is a complete waste and a half hours. After I finished sitting on it, I managed to catch Rocky 5 for the last half hour on TV, which by comparison looked like a cinematic masterpiece, I think this is more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
