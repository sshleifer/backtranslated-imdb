I was ready to go with the original _Cruel Intentions._ He walked along with the plot and remained loyal to the characters of one of my favorite stories. Nevertheless, this film was, in my opinion, a terrible paraphrase with almost the same storyline and without a clear choice of character. I honestly didn’t care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their interaction, not the events themselves. Until I read IMDB, it was not clear to me that this film was supposed to be a prequel, especially since the title indicated was the number “2”. I expected to continue, but then decided that it should be a companion. In general, I have to say that this film is for reading, for me at least, as a soft version of porn from Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
