I love the books of Henry James, and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new film based on the book of this title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress, and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the leading roles. Albert Finney was wrong and poorly copes with the role. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or rather her silly, tasteless role. The real problem and what is missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the theater, watching this long, protracted and extremely boring film. There are more pauses in the dialogue than in Pinter Play. In the book, I felt a deep concern for Katherine Sloper and her life. The film had just the opposite effect. I also did not like the turn, where her aunt has a sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. Yuk <br /> <br /> Look, if you can't fall asleep, it is definitely napping. Do not look if you are depressed. After that you will need Zoloft. <br /> <br /> Of course, “The Heir” was gorgeous with starring Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift. The actor who played her father was a carefree, cold father ... still mourning his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The film was not true to the book, but not this one. <br /> <br /> This film was a box office failure. I have no doubt why.
