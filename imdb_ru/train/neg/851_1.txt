Just finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was going to happen. I had high hopes for the film because of the rating. The only reason I give this film 2 out of 10 stars is that he tried to become a film. I have a couple of highlights that I don’t like. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1 Casting. Jack Nicholson hardly fits the character of Jack Torrens. Also, I would NEVER choose Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I portrayed Wendy in a completely different way. I understand why they chose Jack Nicholson, a smile, sharp eyebrows, but he should not look "evil." He must look normal and he gets angry. In addition, they make one of the worst pairs of the film. Danny was fine, he needed more life. He acted in drone. <br /> <br /> 2. Scenario. They cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the film were either deleted, changed, or handled incorrectly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to see (hedges, hammer, elevator) were not in the film, and it was 2 and a half hours !! I was very annoyed. <br /> <br /> 3. The ending. The ending was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy did not suffer ... Overlook did not explode. The ending was so cool in the book, and the movie spoiled it so badly that I was delighted. Hallorann should never have died, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least ask Jack to use a hammer. During the entire movie you didn’t even see a rocket with a hammer. <br /> <br /> There are other things that I didn’t like about this movie, but there are things that were fine. The camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (this did not happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too annoyed that the film did not go with the book to try to get scared at all. I recommend reading the book before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King for the fact that he actually agreed to sign a contract in order not to deny Stanley Kubrick anymore. I would never do that, I would take all the rights that could have been shouting at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6-hour version, at least there are hedge animals. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
