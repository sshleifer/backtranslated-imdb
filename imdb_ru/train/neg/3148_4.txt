In fact, this is a story about man and nature, there is beautiful cinematography in this film, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film really will not start. The newlywed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband, and then turns to the plantation brigadier, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of the late father of owner Peter Finch, whose ghost casts cover over the Elephant Walk, which becomes the main point of contention between Taylor and Finch. Elephants are determined to rebuild their traditional path to the water that was blocked when the mansion was built across from them. Animals go into a rage and provide the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have good moments when she fights to remain a faithful wife, despite the fact that he had family problems with Finch.
