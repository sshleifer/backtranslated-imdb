This movie was terrible. The ending was absolutely terrible. There was no plot for the film at all. The only thing that was decent in the film was a game made by Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film didnâ€™t do any justice for their acting. If the script were closer to shooting a decent story, then it would be worth seeing. Instead, the speeches of Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones are completely in vain on the terrible storyline ... or lack thereof. Not only did I have to wait throughout the entire film for something to happen to make a film ... well, actually, a real movie ... and not just a useless dialogue between the characters, which in the end turned out to be absolutely unreasonable. It was nothing more than the usual dialogue that would take place at that time. There was nothing special about these characters. The only thing that was special was how Robert Duvall portrayed an incoherent, senile, drunk old man. Nothing decent happens throughout the entire film, including the end. When the film ended, I was amazed ... amazed at the fact that I sat through the whole film in anticipation of something interesting that would make you watch the movie. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly began to change, making it clear that the film really ended, and I realized that I wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie without any plot and no meaning. It was not even a story. The whole movie takes place in a day. That's all. It was one day in the life (and death) of some southerners on the plantation. What part of the story can happen in one day (except for the movie "Day of Education")? The cast of the entire cast was superb, but they were wasted because of such disappointment in the film ... if you can call it a film.
