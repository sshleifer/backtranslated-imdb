I really despised this film when I saw him at the age of 6-7 years old, since I was a big fan of Robin Williams, and nothing he could do was bad. Before. This complete trash ruined Robin for me for a long time. I only recently recovered from his funny but serious role on Fathers Day, but then he made another mistake, the Bicentennial Man, I think it is called, but the point is. Robin should get a much better job by now, and now he's back to the performance of the mucus that originated with this “classic.”
