The Twilight Zone has reached a certain mythology about this - very much like Star Trek. This is because there are many dedicated show fans who, no matter what they think, each episode was a winner. They expose each person to 10 points and can not objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, some time ago I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (good and bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were too positive. Now it's time to do the same for the Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Although I scored a lot of episodes 10, this one gets 3 simply because it was bad. The letter was actually embarrassingly bad. Two people from opposite sides in the great war roam around the episode. After some time, it becomes obvious that they are the only two people remaining on Earth - as you learned from a really stupid and absolutely unconvincing conclusion. Usually the turn at the end makes the episode gorgeous - this one killed it!
