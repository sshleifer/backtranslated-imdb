Dear Richard, I know that we all loved you for home improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, don't you have anything but the lame continuations of Air Bud? I would think that Tim could actually give you a small role or even become his personal assistant. I know it sounds ironic, but wage payments are much more useful. <br /> <br /> Everyone will see you around Tim and immediately think: "Tool time." You would even get roles with Bob Vila more often. Instead, you appear for 10 minutes with a golden retriever and smile. I know that the script was a bit, but you could add to it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you one. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this film does nothing for the Air Bud line. On the contrary, fake talking puppies look harder than dogs. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know this more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is the movie "F".
