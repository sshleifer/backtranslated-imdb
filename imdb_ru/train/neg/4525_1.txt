In short, not what you expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and his colleagues. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at the scene in which it is ridiculously dated when Down swears at all male scientists, accusing them of this. failure as an academic while bathing in the very soft light that Hollywood could muster. To complete this, she spends the next hour of the film, screaming and running into the arms of any guy she can find. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note to future Egyptologists: Take a year or two in Arabic for graduate school. It really helps in the long run ...
