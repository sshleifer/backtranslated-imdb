There is a big difference between the release of the original, intense, scary, scary, terrible festival, and the making, as directed by Eli Roth and his team did with "Cabin Fever" and just behaved like that. The film tells about five college graduates in a hut in the forest, which becomes fatal, because one after another gives way to this mysterious, fast-acting, meat-eating disease. Soon, friends get into each other and can hardly see each other, much less want to be in the same proximity as they are. However rude it may sound, there is a spark behind the basic premise of this film that could work in the hands of a less audacious director. Unfortunately, as a result, we get poorly drawn characters, whose sole purpose at first seems to look beautiful, to make the inevitable decomposition more contrast, the hackneyed script is so arrogant that it forces the viewer to set up a dialogue, and a few obscure plots that motivate a little more ( in one case) the appearance on the screen of director Roth. This careless filmmaking in several ways! Avoid this time eater.
