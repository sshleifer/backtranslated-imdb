I admit that the problem with Ealing's very famous films that I have seen so far could have been mine. For my taste, they are either black and amazingly funny, or so light that they are not comfortable as comedies or stories. This is a very important way to say that I like “The Man in the White Suit”, but I hardly sit out for a short time. <br /> <br /> Textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be meekly in order, but he persistently seeks progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that cannot be broken or made polluted. Using the factory lab for his last experiment, he works against the constraints, both material and human. The latter are the bosses of the mill, who do not understand what he has in mind, and then figure it out and become even more committed to his stopping. br /> <br /> “Such small minds as yours stand in the way of progress,” Syd complains, practicing in the mirror what he is trying to say to Man. <br /> <br /> One problem with the “Man in a White Suit” is that the vision of Sydney’s progress is also terribly unnoticeable, even more so than even the bosses or workers, who also take offense at his work. My problem is more elementary: for the comedy “The White Costume” is not funny. This is a rather serious scenario, which too often tries to get weak attempts at humor due to spitting, double doubles, triple doubles and dizzying doubles. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the car. Sydney works hard to beat "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" endlessly and get strange looks from every visitor, until Sydney takes his miracle out of him or blows it up. him trying Like any other random humor that functions well in this film, he relied too long. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Guinness have the same negative impact in the film, although he looks incredibly young and serious (although in fact in his mid-30s). He seems so bloodless, even more so than the wax-faced general he played in Doctor Zhivago. He is the same cold fish, whether he ignores the sad affections of the windmill that offers to give him his savings when he loses his job (Vida Hope's face as Bertha) or the more sultry charms of young Daphne Byrnley (Joan Greenwood), his only real an ally in his fight with “rubbing and filth,” as she put it, thanks to which these words sound as incredibly sexy as Greenwood could. <br /> <br /> Supporting players work as well as the White Suit. Ernest Tesinger from "Bride Of Frankenstein" plays the exclusive nasty captain of the industry who looks like Nosferatu and laughs like the rumble of death. Howard Marion-Crawford, as another factory manager, was remembered here just as he played the stupid medical officer at Lawrence of Arabia. In addition, there is an undeniable charm Mandy Miller, when she was a little girl who steals a few minutes at the camera directly from under the rest. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are played so directly that no one would think that the director Alexander Mackendrick ever worked on a comedy (his previous Ealing's comedy “Whiskey is in abundance”, alas, does not change this impression). In Roger McDougall's play, the notion of scientific progress is seen as a potential catastrophe, but he cannot imagine the boring Sydney in anything but the most pleasant light. <br /> <br /> The blind comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of the comedy. And yet the Ealings, which I saw, never did this, working only when they aggressively played against our own likes. “Kind Hearts and Coronets” and “Ledikillers” (again Mackendrick, go figure) is a classic in this sense. The “white suit,” on the other hand, is a meaningless delirium that falls apart when it should converge, just like this unfortunate costume.
