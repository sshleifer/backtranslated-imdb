Woody Allen has lost the ability to write dialogues or characters that are clearly different from each other. This is the case in Melinda and Melinda, where all the characters speak with the common pseudo-sophistication of Allen and have problems and points of view that do not apply to anyone outside of the four-quarter radius where Allen lives. They also have the same curious condition that they can afford several million dollars worth of apartments in Manhattan, which seem to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living. <br /> <br /> The only character that exists outside of this boring mindset is Will Ferrell as Woody Allenâ€™s compulsory surrogate. Although he is not just removed, just making the impression of Woody Allen (like Kenneth Brande in the terrible Celebrity), Ferrell lacks the charisma or charisma that the real Woody had when he played a role in his best films. . <br /> <br /> The end result is another series of self-indulgent bores from a once great director who has been selling his old reputation for years.
