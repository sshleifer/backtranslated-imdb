When I first watched Robotboy, I found him fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that with each episode this show tries to teach you how to behave, which is good / bad. Episodes have become predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyper-intelligent boy who is beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child, and his friends: a girl and a fat boy. Also this show has no logic. Super modern robot, powered by two AA batteries and using many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes. We see two different robots, and this rejects the main idea of ​​the show: “The robot must learn to behave in human society”
