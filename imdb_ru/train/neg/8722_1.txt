Not to be confused with Lewis Tig's Alligator (1980), which is in fact an excellent film, this “Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano” painstakingly completes the exotic trilogy of Sergio Martino, created around the end of the seventies (including the watchable “L” Isola degli uomini pesce "and not very good" La Montagna del dio cannibale "). The Jaws scenario, ugly tracking the plot, is not capable of creating any uncertainty. The creature is funny and its victims are just mean. The lame tune of Stelvio Cipriani ill illustrates the adventures of these stupid tourists pre from the very beginning as obvious elements of reptile food. There is no thrill from it, rather they laugh in reality! And we could find this pathetic film quite funny if the dialogues and the appearance of natives were not so clearly inspired by pure racism. Very soon the giggle stops in favor of sour feelings, testifying to such a protective attitude. We could justify poorly made films and bad effects, but not such a mentality. Never!
