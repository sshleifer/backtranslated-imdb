The story of Nikolai Gogol "Wii" was again filmed and released for home video in the United States through Faith Films. <br /> <br /> The original story concerns a priest who must watch over the body of a witch only with his faith in order to protect him. Significantly expanded and installed in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (houses, clothes and furnishings do not correspond to reality, despite the English signs), this is a strange film that actually does not work. Part of it is a strange setting that is trying very hard. It is difficult to be a deaf-mute America, but of course not. There are also some strange, deliberately oblique moments when the main character is a reporter at the beginning and a priest a little later. I'm not sure why they did it, even after watching a DVD recording. Another problem is rewriting, which is beyond horror. This is done so that everyone speaks when their lips are not on the camera — or, if they are voices, even remotely do not correspond to lip patches. I don’t know if Faith Films or the producers who made the film in the hope of dumping it to the West (shown in the process of making the film) are to blame. <br /> <br /> The film is not very good. As I said, he has a lot of technical problems that just make it a strange highlight. Despite some really good looking horror images, the movie never works like a horror movie. As a film that breeds faith, it is too confused in this retelling to make anyone feel anyone closer to God. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice, I would give him a pass, even at a bargain price. I would advise you to find a version of the fairy tale called “Viy” of the 1960s, which will bring both trembling and some understanding of faith in God.
