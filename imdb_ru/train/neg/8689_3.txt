The main problem with the "Force" is that it also contains meaningless characters and plots that add absolutely nothing to the film. After a while, it gets boring, lounging around, waiting for scenes that don't connect to find something that moves the movie forward. Perhaps you could give it all up for character development, but all of them are either reworked from earlier scenes in the film, or are simply flat and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to allow any of the supporting actors to flourish. He had to cut several characters (hackman, wife) and focus on others (Billings). It could be a great, hard political thriller instead of a messy mess that loses any message in a sea of ​​bad writing and acting, a fact that struck me, given the cast. Even Gene Hackman's performance was not up to par. Denzel Washington is the only true actor noted here. Gere and the others have done much better performances elsewhere <br /> <br /> Sydney Lumet should return to the ferocious man he showed in the seventies (that is, Serpico) and stop trying to regain his success with the help of “12 Angry Men” and “Fail Safe”. That hasn't worked yet, Sydney, and most likely will never work. leave the drama ensemble to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
