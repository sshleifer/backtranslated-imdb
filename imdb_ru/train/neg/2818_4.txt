Jean (Zoe Trilling) comes to Egypt to visit his hypocritical archeologist father who quotes the Bible (William Finley), and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays de Sade in flashback, ranting in his cell. Gin went astray by Muhammad (Giuliano Merr), who rides naked on horseback and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to smoking opium, which leads to wild hallucination with the participation of topless harem dancers, a woman imitating oral sex on a snake, The orgy and her father are preaching in the background! Meanwhile, cult members with black hoods are decapitated, eyeballs are knocked out and the throat is cut. When Ginka slips drugs into her tea, she presents de Sade, hanging on a cross, a woman with a gold painting in leafy thongs and bloodied on a bed covered with snakes. This is all because she is the reincarnation of de Sade’s lost love. <br /> <br /> This harry production of “Harry Alan Towers” ​​is unnecessary, untidy and rather pointless, but the scenery, the costumes, the cinematography and the work with the locations are all great and at least something always happens. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
