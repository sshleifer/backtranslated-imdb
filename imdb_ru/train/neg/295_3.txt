I got this movie because I worked in a movie store, so I got a free rental. It came in and the cover made it look good. Hot chick, with a weapon, ok, I'll check. <br /> <br /> Oh, shit, bad move. It was so terrible that I spent half the movie on watching ahead to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think CAN BE three partial nudity scenes. <br /> <br /> Shoddy dialogue, crappy violence, bad excuses of characters. I feel bad about postponing this film, because I know that it was made on a cheap budget, but “Clerks” also became a cult classic and franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
