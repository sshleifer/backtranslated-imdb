The spoilers presented in this review are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our main character, Lady Barbara Skelton, will eventually be raped and shot. And not for a moment. I would have removed the screen myself, but I was afraid that I would hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel entitled "The Life and Death of the Evil Lady Skelton" (I guess the people did not). “Whine about spoilers,” written by a woman, an English sea boy who was either worried or cynical, or both. Her heroine is stunningly beautiful, and the author seems to believe that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things matter, for example, the fact that Lady Barbara’s immediate and only reaction when someone stands in her way is murder. She kills three people in five attempts. Serial fatal woman, she has a case of dissocial personality disorder, because of which she had to be in Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vampire, she has so much makeup on her that I thought of her as the Joan Rivers of the restoration era (or Joan Rivers of the restoration era, ha!). However, Lady B. is irresistible for all three main male characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, and they all do a good job, as does Patricia Rock. Of course, all three fans in a short time understand what a psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in its orbit until one of them finally shoots her - by chance, in what should be either irony or just dessert . Given the dramatic scene of death with a crash that raises the camera through the windows and into the skies, I suppose we should not give a damn about her death. But her first corpse that doesn’t bother us.
