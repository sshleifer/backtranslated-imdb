I like bad movies. I love taking bad movies with friends and copying them for a while. Then there are disgusting films like this. Redline is not just a bad film, but also an indicative sign that, perhaps, the American film industry should, for the sake of the viewer, at least correct the scenarios before funding the film. <br /> <br /> If the stereotype takes shit, this film will be generated by this. The storyline is unbearable, and the actions around are ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may have the worst screen chemistry I've ever seen, and even individually they must be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street vendors (about the thing they are can legally claim). In addition, the way Angus Macfadyen made sure to make this film is so far away from me that I can't even come up with an analogy. I am his devoted fan, but it made me question him. <br /> <br /> Summing up. Several people want revenge for various reasons (and if you are interested enough to know who they are, you are more than me), so much so that it turns into violence (I think). The film is similar to Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, in that it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue, not suitable for human ears. This film, in fact, is one big commercial for cars in the first half of the year, and the rest of the action movie is an indiscriminate action movie that should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> I would like to find one positive point in this film, and I think this is due to the fact that in the end, the credits are really rolling. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if you sing these two songs in this film, then you are a cracker, and I hope that old age will destroy you. <br /> <br /> PSS If you are really shooting this movie in search of a ridiculous experience, listen to the lyrics of Nadia Bjorlin.
