When to start? OK, do not compare this movie with the fight club to start with - it's funny. If it were even a stain on a fight club, violence, blood, blood, etc. would be much more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factory - which is much more realistic (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look embarrassed). Fairly, the storyline is quite decent, and the fighting scenes are well set - with a decent ending, I could add. But the film is generally bad, seriously bad. Since people mentioned that accents should not spoil the film - I do not agree - either a simple casting mistake or lack of effort in teaching voices was annoying the film throughout - it was obvious from the first scene that some American / Jordi played a role. Don't get me wrong, a good looking guy who looks great with his head in the skin - but not a football bully. I could go on indefinitely about how ridiculous the football scene was - the situation with the “fake steward”. In addition, when the GSE are going to play United in the north, they go on the train, waiting for only 3 of them - it makes no sense - this is a real organization of gangsters and thugs, which is depicted in the film as some kind of mickey Mouse Cult about 5 people. In terms of accuracy, haven't West Ham and Milvoll played the last couple of years when they played in the Championship together? Hmm, ten years is fine. And I’m sure that Bother can just waltz into the Milwall pub. In fact, a very bad film that people will like if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism, you will simply feel that this film has offended your intellect. Ross george
