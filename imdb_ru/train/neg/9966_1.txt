Although I never like to be a person who denies the personal taste of another person; if you like something, that's fine. But this film was terrible, and there is no way around it. I don’t really like Ani Difranco, but she’s a great guitar player and songwriter that I can recognize. But I cannot allow any redemptive qualities in this film. Many people believe that this is an exact image of the problems faced by schoolchildren. Maybe, but everything is depicted too far-fetched. It seems there is an attempt at “Nude Gun” - like a comedy, but time has not yet come out; there is too much space between each line of actors, as if they are holding on to laughter (they were not there). The one who wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to squeeze so many controversial issues into one film, almost never fully developing any of them (especially the girl soaked with the teacher). I never laughed once for this whole movie. I was too offended by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything other than roll my eyes on the screen.
