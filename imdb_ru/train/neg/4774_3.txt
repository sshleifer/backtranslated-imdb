I'm not sure if the creators of the film were after the movie like “Saw” or “12 evil people” (people gather facts to understand the truth). Whatever it was, it was done poorly and was not worth watching. <br /> <br /> I don’t watch movies on blood and gore, but since there was nothing else in this movie, he had to show the actual murder. More. Most of them were off-screen, minimizing the horror that we should have experienced at death. <br /> <br /> I was also worried that a policeman was among the victims; he unwittingly prompted an innocent young man to go to jail by accepting corroborated evidence (given to him by the MDG) in a room for testimony. (And didn’t the MJH, the prosecutor, have access to this evidence — pulled them out and returned false evidence — anyway, so that she doesn’t need the help of a policeman?). Others, although often not realizing that they are harmful to this person, still played a large role in his final demise. The arms dealer should have known that his weapons would be used for evil purposes. The insurer rejected the person who clearly needed it, and so on. D. But the crime of the policeman seemed insignificant compared to what he did not know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have taken another step forward if he were the one who encouraged MJH to put forward evidence that would make him more guilty. And MJH shouts that he (the policeman) has drawn her into this mess, it makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> It would be more intriguing if everyone died in a way that offered a clue to the others. why he / she was there and deserved to die. For example, an insurance guy could have rejected applications that he rejected to suffocate; an eastern woman could have her eyes knocked out, because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more cruel than the death from a weapon, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not witty, there were no turns, and the finale was one of the worst (if not the worst) I've ever seen. Final broke three stars from my rating. <br /> <br /> Actors did a decent job, especially considering the garbage lines and motivation with which they had to work. <br /> <br /> Overall, a waste of time.
