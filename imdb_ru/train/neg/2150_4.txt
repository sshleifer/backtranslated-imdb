You will immediately recognize the plot. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to reassemble mom and dad. Yes, it was the “Parental Trap” theme in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here is a terrible thing. Despite the fact that Dina Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills, when she performed the roles of her daughter (s), Durbin looks much older than adults. Like all her so-called brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between an adult and a child throughout the film. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits, but they look ridiculous in them, as the director seems to be doing her best to show off her copious tops and panties throughout the entire movie. So you are constantly breaking up, thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start to “run into” them, you have the feeling that they are pedophiles, and you are probably one of them if you notice these pajamas and tops that the director points to. Teenagers or temptresses, little girls or foxes, you never understand what you think of them. <br /> <br /> Parents also seem very old, and the whole film seems very outdated. <br /> <br /> This is a rusty version of the Parental Trap, and you should avoid it, or at least make sure your tetanus shots are relevant if you don't believe me.
