It was a decent movie, in fact, I liked it. But the ending is so cool! There is absolutely no closure, and it leaves tons of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What happens to her boyfriend? Does she connect with Grant? Will she come next semester? What about Angela? Obviously, the game of Holly can knock Angela down, but nothing shows how she reacts. There is so much left in the air, and this is very unsatisfactory. I don't know if he is trying to leave room for a sequel or something else, but this is a terrible end, and I think it really makes the film a joke. I was very disappointed.
