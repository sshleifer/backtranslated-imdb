Let me start by saying that this is not like a movie. Looks like just another TV show about popular girls and boys without a real cinema language that reinforces that. <br /> <br /> Camera viewing angles are so simple that the story is told in the simplest way, never betraying the public to connect with it. This film takes us to the place where not a single film that I have seen before falls into the sphere where the cinema becomes a warm environment, providing the public with every element of interpretation. Too obvious. The big screen of the film is used only as an enlarged TV, whence we can see every attribute of these women more than life. <br /> <br /> Recently, it seems that young directors are jeopardizing the art of making a film for sale. It's very scary. Industry spoils art in the cinema. We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinema and its language really are. Not only sales and entertainment, but also a way to convey feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launching pad for young divas and athletes.
