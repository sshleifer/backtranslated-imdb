This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not express how bad it is. Honestly, I wanted to kill myself several times because of this terrible experience, just to end the pain. I recommend that instead of watching this movie, you bathe in acid, then you at least know the proportion of pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had high hopes when I read the back of the DVD case and when it was added at the beginning that Jesus was following them, I was so excited ... then at the end I wanted to kill myself. I mean twenty three minutes of acquaintance with the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... JUST PAIN! Monkeys might better edit this trash. At the very least, they would throw up the feces and wash away some of the garbage. It would be better if I did not see anything terrible. <br /> <br /> Not that I didnâ€™t get a joke, but that they were not only not funny, they repeated themselves twenty times. It seems that something is not funny if you do not see it a million times. <br /> <br /> You will not see it under any circumstances. People rated Manos in the Hands of Fate as the worst movie in the world. I also saw it and agree that this is bad ... but, alas, this is only the second worst. Fatty Drives the Bus is much worse. <br /> <br /> This deserves every harsh expression, but I can't write it here, so imagine that I swore a whole bunch.
