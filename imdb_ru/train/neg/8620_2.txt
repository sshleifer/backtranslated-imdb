I wasn't sure if Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit Malibu Express. With his film Fit to Kill, he proved that Sidaris is a serious director, not just a director. The plot written by Sidaris, which was ungratefully transmitted by the Academy, is a complex scenario involving many invisible turns. The main characters composed the work for the sexual radio station, known as KSXY. Clever, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In Fit to Kill, they confront their long-time sworn enemy Kane, who is trying to steal one of the most expensive diamonds in Russia. A well-written script is not everything, an excellent acting game helps to make this film a cult classic. This film will be appreciated by critics and box office in the coming years. Now he suffered the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but in the future he will undoubtedly become recognizable. Iâ€™m disappointed that no critics admit that Andy Sidaris makes a film about the brand. Costumes, special effects - all this helps to complement this already beautiful film. Perhaps you best ignore the dismal rating of 3 in this film and go out and rent it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the blockbuster Runaway Bride, and the action is better or equal to Last Action Hero's cinematic masterpiece. Andy, keep up the good work.
