*** A REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I will make this review short and enjoyable. I bought this film from Best Buy because it seemed interesting to me, and there were some main actors in it, such as Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad can it be, right? Well, that's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake is played by Pollack, a journalist copycat who is faced with a case that could lead to corrupt officials in the Edison Police. LL Cool J - Did, a policeman from the special forces detachment F.RAT (Tactics of the first retaliatory attack). He teams up with an “on the brink” of a bad cop named Lasers (Dylan McDermott). At the discovery, we see Lasers and Deeds taking bank robbers, but at night they ruin a couple of guys who use drugs. I don't want to give away too much, but the guys who use drugs are doing badly. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to trial with Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects a dishonest game and with the help of Ashford conducts an investigation, which turns out to be ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), who is all within F.R.A.T. the team joins Ashford to try and bring the corrupt police officers to justice. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, it can be said that Freeman and Spacey's figures are rather slim. The only person who gives a complete picture is Dylan McDermott. In this film, he is completely nuts and made a believer out of me. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He says each line the same way and shows almost the same emotion. He was much better in films like Deep Blue Sea and Any Given Sunday. The film begins with some pleasant action, but then goes through the whole movie. The ending is far from satisfying. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this movie. I will put this on ebay this weekend.
