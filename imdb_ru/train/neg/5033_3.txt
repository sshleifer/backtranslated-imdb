The killings take place in the deserted town of Texas. Who is in charge? Minor novelties of mystery and racial tension (the latter is really not suitable), but otherwise strictly for slasher fans who appreciate blood and nudity, which are two common elements for these films. <br /> <br /> Dana Kimmell (from the disgrace of Friday the 13th PART 3) plays the main role of a quasi-detective teenager. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: R rating for violence and blood, nudity and some language.
