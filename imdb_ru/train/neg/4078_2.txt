JESSICA: GHOSTLY HISTORY, as the name implies a ghostly story. The theme should be terrible, but closer to comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman who has been brutally murdered comes back from the dead. This is what this film is trying to pass off as a plot. There is nothing more. The film consists of a series of loosely related scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the introductory scenes, this film looks like a “direct-DVD” Effort. Unlike gems, such as VACANCY 2, the film does not have a sense of direction or creativity, and, of course, the films "directly on DVD" have notoriety! The direction is as bad as it can be in the absence of anxiety, fear or tension. Even the dramaturgic elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you might have experienced. <br /> <br /> The interaction is absolutely terrible, and not a single actor could show even the smallest potential of a successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between exchanges of dialogue. I'm not exaggerating! <br /> <br /> The only reason that I assign a rating of 2 rather than 1 to this film is that some of the bad roles, combined with an even worse dialogue, have made some unintended laughter. I emphasize the word “few” in this sentence. In general, this is not one of the “so bad, this is good” films, such as CAMP BLOOD or NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch these films. If you want to watch a real horror movie about ghosts, see “LEGEND OF HELL”, “CHANGE”, “RING”, “EYE” (original Korean version), “GRADE”, “ONE SENT CALL” or “TELEPHONE”. <br /> <br /> Anyone fortunate enough to avoid meeting JESSICA: GHOSTLY HISTORY to continue the good work! Just forget that this movie exists. Do not regret this thought!
