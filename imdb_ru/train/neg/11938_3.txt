The film started off quite well. He was hit by a glowing green meteorite, gaining superpowers (telekinesis, x-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, ability to speak with dogs, superspeed, thermal vision and the ability to make plants big and fast), and the fight against crime. From now on, everything goes downhill. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gets a suit from his mom, fights resident gangs and many times stops meeting gang leaders, which serves to prepare you for a disappointing, long-lasting and stunning end. <br /> <br /> It wouldn’t be too bad if it hadn’t been like a boxing match in which two fighters pretend to beat each other, and the audience stands, looking ahead, and the fighters just keep dancing. <br /> <br /> Despite all this nonsense, the film has good moments. It clearly states that if you try to defeat the gang, they will return to your home and hurt you. It says that gangs and communities should see their real enemies (big bosses who use them for their own purposes to crush honest people in the ghetto). It also says that people do not need superheroes if they want to work as a community, destroying predators that harm them. The only message that is actually missing is that voters have to make sure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George Bush) are not fraudsters either. <br /> <br />
