Well, that was funny ... except for the funny part. <br /> <br /> This is my second smallest favorite, I even thought it was worse than Lazarus and the Ghost in the car. <Br /> <br /> Let's start with the good. Teaser, this was incredibly well done and emotionally. Being a big animal lover, I was very happy to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But there is all bad, and believe me, there are a lot of it. Little did it make sense, so these animals were abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa ??? the dialogue was pretty awful too. There were about one or two citation lines. <br /> <br /> and, worst of all, the death of all these animals was very unpleasant for me. In the end ... what's the point? they all pretty much died. We didn’t learn anything, we weren’t entertained, and I couldn’t even find Sophia’s death sad ... just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> * star. shame because season 2 was so good.
