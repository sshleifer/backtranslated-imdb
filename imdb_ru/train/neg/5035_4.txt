Melissaâ€™s sixteenth birthday is just around the corner, and she only discovers her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys she spends with all are ultimately killed in this difficult 80s movie. It's up to local sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying loving puzzle of the good daughter Marcy (Dana Kimmell, Friday, 13 part 3) to get to the bottom of these murders. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mysterious and melodramatic aspects of the film, rather than on the killings themselves, and is thus able to distinguish itself from the many slasher brothers of the 80s. It's okay that Alezia has a great body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious, stating that the actress is already 18 years old, and thus convey that I am not too distorted). On the other hand, the film is hindered by several plot points that are underdeveloped and not needed, an annoying topic that is used too often, and a finale that is a bit anti-climatic. But the good outweighs the bad (barely). Rent it, but I wouldn't buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her boobs, bushes and ass <br /> <br /> My rating: C <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: entry star Alais Shirley and Intruder Director Scott Spiegel; Director and theatrical version of the film; Audio talk with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interviews with Shirley, Sotos, and Bo Hopkins; another gallery; theater trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals & Balalaika Conspiracy
