Tierney is a real tough guy, but a misfire from this film from the usually competent RKO undermines his influence at every turn. The scenario is about as plausible as that of O.J. Simpson at the dinner "Ten Commanders." Just count how many times Tierney’s incredible automotive companions swallow one weak excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché that “only happens in the movies” applies here. Then there is the guy playing the watchman, who seems to have wandered out of the drunken comedy WC Fields, destroying the threatening mood in the process. Static one-room suites do not help either, nor does the obvious lack of a director's feeling for the material. Then add the final chase for a machine that lacks imagination and feedback, and the results are fairly flat. In fact, the film takes place only in scenes where violent policemen discover the hidden power of innocent-looking tankers. It is a pity that Tini’s career never became real. I understand that this was largely due to the fact that I was the same tough guy behind the scenes, as in one dirty digging after another. His icy manner and clarity of emotions at times remind me of Lee Marvin in his cool guy. In any case, this project could work as a radio show, but as a film with a promising title noir, this is a disappointment.
