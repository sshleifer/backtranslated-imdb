It was a really tasteless movie. Performances - the third speed, and the dialogue is so unnatural that at times it seemed that he just turned over and died. My reason for renting it was simple: to find a movie with a script. I need visual assistance for the presentation, so I decided, why not use the clip? The boy was wrong. After searching my local video store, I came across this, where he was suspiciously called Starstruck. I thought, "What the hey" and decided to try. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. Maybe there was one scene I could use, and in the meantime I almost fell asleep due to the sheer banality of the film. So ... I took it and took Ed Wood. There is a film that I can use as an example. On the other hand, everything would be presentable compared to the fool "Starfucker".
