Without a doubt, this is one of the worst pictures I have ever actually paid money to see - which movie would you choose from despair at the shopping center cinema during the Christmas holidays, when you missed the start of something good, but everything still dead set to watch a movie! And this is how I saw this smelly bomb ... <br /> <br /> At a distance of the best part of three decades, I still smell the rotting fish that makes up this storyline. An incredible plot - that the killer whale is offended by a person, not by the sea - is ridiculous. And this is all, except for the completely inappropriate "love theme", which plays at the end of the film, devoid of a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is beautiful (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris just chews on the situation. He was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw), and this is not "Jaws". Fortunately, I threw out of my head most of this, and when I stumble on it on television, I immediately move on. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See current tv.v. a commercial showing how a husband and wife are watching whales (“Orca - I love Ork ...”) - at least it will all be over in sixty seconds. This film represents 92 minutes of my life, which I will never return.
