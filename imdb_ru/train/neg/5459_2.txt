It was a very short episode that appeared in one of the “Night Gallery” shows in 1971. In this episode, Sue Lyon (from the Lolita movie) and Joseph Campanella, who play the babysitter and the vampire respectively, were filmed. The vampire hires a babysitter to watch his child (who seems to be some sort of werewolf or monster) while he comes out at night for blood. The nanny doesn’t notice the vampire’s appearance when she first sees him, and only begins to fold two and two, when she notices that he is not reflected in the mirror, has a strange collection of books in the occult library and hears strange sounds while the vampire is talking to a child. She understands that the man who hired her may not be what she initially thought him to be. She runs out of the door, the vampire comes out puzzled, and the episode is over. I do not know what the goal was to make such an abbreviated episode, which lasted only 5 minutes. They should have just extended the previous episode for the same 5 minutes and skipped this one. Total wasted effort.
