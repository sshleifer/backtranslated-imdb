When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching bad television. We were all guilty of it at one time or another, but my excuse for seeing things like “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century” and “Silver Spoons” is this: I was young and naive; not knowing what makes the show really worth it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I now appreciate good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. I, a 12-year-old, would love every bit of it, every line of untidy dialogue, every unnecessary technical shading. The letter outside is tasteless; so soft and boring that makes you miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me miss the worst in Trek's history, you will have problems. <br /> <br /> Stargate is a wonderful guilt based on two serious speeches by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of exciting Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score and great science fiction ideas. With the exception of a small amount of original music, nothing that made the movie fun appears in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver watchable and interesting to Legend, seems to be half asleep in most episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget must have been very low, because the scenery sometimes resembles someone’s basement. Cinematography is not much better, the same vanilla and boring as scenarios. It surprises me that shows with a much larger style (for example, Farscape) and content (for example, the rethought Battlestar Galactica) have a smaller, less rabid fan base than this pap. It simply does not deserve it.
