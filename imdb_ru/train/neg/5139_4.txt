Many horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I will not be very popular, saying that I found it rather boring. The idea behind this was interesting, but it seems to be so addictive. I think the main problem is that it is all in the dark. Sometimes horror films set in the dark can work (for example, Humongous), but Scarecrows in the dark for the entire movie. In most cases, it is difficult to understand what is actually happening, and although some of the scarecrow shots were creepy, most were difficult to even see. If a little more lighting was used, perhaps it could be better. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, there are not so many killer stuffed movies, other than Dark Night Stuffed, which is much better. I would recommend it to the Scarecrows any day.
