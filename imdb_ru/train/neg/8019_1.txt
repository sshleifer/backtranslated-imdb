I have read half a dozen other user comments on this board, and it seems that opinions vary greatly. I have to agree with those who found this movie terrible. It pains me to write that because I was hoping that it would be great, otherwise I would not bother to see it the other day. I like to support indie films, especially if they are gay-themed, but this film is too much to endure. Those who left, as I thought, in three minutes, probably did not object to pay 11.00 dollars or simply thought that it was nowhere, quickly and would not improve. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than they .. or this, or they did not pay to enter, first. <br /> <br /> Logan is boring. He clack. He is a gay. I'm fine with that. The problem is that the main character of the film is bored, but this does not mean that the film about him should be boring! There are endless scenes with this child, just lying, like washing clothes, restoring everything that you have already learned in the first scene, in the second scene, etc., etc., etc. Nothing or no one goes anywhere. NOBODY says anything, even remotely perceptive, funny or interesting. Probably the worst thing that I did not have the slightest sympathy for Logan. This in itself is a major achievement. He did not grow up, he did not change, he did not study (no one taught him anything), he DIDN'T DO ANYTHING like the film! The scene behind the scene does not do the same movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the name does not make sense at all. 1/10
