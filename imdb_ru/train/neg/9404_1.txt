This absolute rubbish is so closely based on the fifteenth 13th series, which is almost an exact copy, take it as an Australian film with people who can not play. <br /> <br /> Once a young boy accidentally burned down while filming a music video on Lake Aildon. Now, a few years later, the boy grew up and takes revenge on everyone who comes to the lake to shoot a music video. This is a lost cliche and a waste of time and money, look at it only out of curiosity or if you are a novice actor trying to learn NOT to act (not be able to). The main role that Alan Dale filmed in the television series "Neighbors", but ultimately ended up in the "X-Files" - how did IT happen?
