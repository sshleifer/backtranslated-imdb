90 minutes Mindy ... Mindy teases Bill's boyfriend ... Mindy rides a dance in high school ... Mindy hitchhikers in Big Sur, buys a loaf of "shepherd's bread" in the store, Mindy is almost raped. Ah, the pleasures of Crown International. You must remember that these films were never intended to be watched on DVD players. They were created as a 90-minute atmosphere, so the teens of the 70s will have a soundtrack that they included in their Pinto and Quotes. The lack of rhythm and structure did not matter to the original audience - they probably tuned in only when the T & A on the screen matched their plans in the parking lot. The film is really annoying when it is viewed as a story. Talking about it is much more fun than watching. My favorite things: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. Without luggage and change of underwear, they spend 2 nights in the same room with the teacher, as in real life. 2) After being kidnapped and almost raped by depraved bikers, and after their innocent friend "Pan" was severely beaten, Mindy and her friend find a motorcycle on the road without supervision. Mindy immediately clears up and chirps: “I'm going to Big Sur !!” But then again, it’s much more fun to talk / read than to sit back.
