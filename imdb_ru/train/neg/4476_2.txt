I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I have to say that it was extremely mediocre (at best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, and I have a feeling that there were many holes in the plot. In this adaptation there is not one pleasant character because of a bad game. I just find that all the characters are too appealing when it comes to the one they love. In addition, the love of Kate and Heath seems very incestuous. They are more like brother and sister than lovers. I do not understand why the father took something like that under his roof. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of several actors that I respected and liked to watch in previous films, but, as I said, it’s very difficult to love any of the characters. Katherine Heigl’s speech was terrible, which was a complete shock. She was terrible for being Edward's older sister, and Aimee Osborne simply didn’t have enough time for me to even criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth succeeded, and it was great to see him in something recent, and although his character was a bit strange, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erica Christensen and Mike Vogel, they should have been our heroines, but they looked tearful and overly dramatic. <br /> <br /> I just didn’t really like this movie or the music in it. There was a short appearance of the Christian punk band MxPx, but this little appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a great job of convincing me that it was a movie, but it’s not. I just portrayed something completely different.
