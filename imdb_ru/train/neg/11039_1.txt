All the funny things happening in this comedy series are based on the fact that the main character Jim is a bad father, a bad husband, or simply an egoist. How can this be funny? Of course, the character in the comedy series should have flaws, but Jim's character has flaws in an extremely unsympathetic manner. <br /> <br /> And why is this so? I think this is because "he should now better." Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of everything, and he has the ability to do it. But he decides not to. This is a conscious choice that he makes when he decides not to play with his children, not to go shopping, because he does not want to buy "ladies' goods", and this is the choice that he makes when he humiliates his relatives. <br /> <br /> Other characters only seem to be on the show, so Jim can have someone who is a jerk. If Cheryl's character was a real person, she would have left him many years ago, and not left with a dead bat for 8 years. But, alas, she’s just a catalyst for Jim’s bizarre extreme selfishness.
