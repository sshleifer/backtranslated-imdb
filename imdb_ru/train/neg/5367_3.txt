I saw every episode of this spin. I thought the first season was a decent effort, given expectations from such success as Gray's Anatomy. So I kept looking. I am afraid that in the second season there is not enough charm, chemistry and, more importantly, the drama of Grey's Anatomy. Relations seem far-fetched, and acting is so-so. The letter lacks the intelligence and comic hints seen in GA. There are shows that the formula, but do not feel formal and far-fetched, unfortunately, PP is not so. I liked the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walshâ€™s life in Los Angeles is just not interesting.
