Although Frank Lesser’s songs are some of the best Broadway has to offer, they are tainted by Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s lethargic staging and boring presentation — when it ends, it seems that you watched the musical. Mankiewicz, it seems, does not know how to present the complex, but melodic melodies of Lesser for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the exponential “Lament of Adelaide”, ends with Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) coming out of the final sitting on a chaise lounge; and at the meanest spiritual Stabby Kay, "Sit down, you are a rock" - his back-chorus sits on folding chairs, and he just stands there. Mankiewicz kills all the fun, allowing static scenes to go on for too long, and his dialogue (borrowed from the stage book by Abe Burrows) does not have such wit as in his films like “Everything about Eve”. Some of the blame must go to the leaders, almost all of whom are wrong: Marlon Brando looks amazed because of why he is in the musical, Frank Sinatra plays too good a guy and does not have the slightest advantage that makes him so significant (the songs are not adapted to his style), and Gene Simmons barely registers as Shirley Jones. Only Blaine, as an actress in love with Adelaide, attracts our attention, as does the Broadway professional. The colorful artistic direction belongs to Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol, who created vivid scenery.
