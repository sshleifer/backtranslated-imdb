Enjoying Gene Arthur in “The Devil and Miss Jones”, my interest was at its peak, so I tried to sit in this gangster humorous tour about investigating the jockey's death - but I did not get to the end, Arthur, photographed in a tasteless manner from movies, or wants to get alimony from William Powell's ex-husband, or another chance for a wedding, but I never felt any relation to her, because the character is just nonsense (she’s a type of heroine, prone to funny curiosity, but once in the morgue - like all women in these 30s comedies - she ter Consciousness). William Powell has reportedly been working with Miss Arthur for a long time, but you will never know by the end result; they look awkward, standing next to each other, not daring because of their jokes. The actor playing Powell’s valet is tormenting, and pauses for the viewer's laughter are fraught with anxiety.
