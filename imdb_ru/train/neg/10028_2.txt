I had a lot of expectations from this film, and especially from the fact that it was a Yasraj film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy works at a call center, and once he was invited by Puja Singh to teach his boss Lachan Singh in English. They fall in love and decide to flee, but Pooja tells Jimmy that she cannot do this because she owes it to Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhaiji. But they decide and steal money from him, and only then Jimmy finds out that Bhyajji / Lahan Singh is Don. In the meantime, Bhyajji hires a man, Bachchan Pandya, to hunt down Jimmy and Puja. <br /> <br /> Starring Saif Ali Khan, Karina Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, the film’s director is the first director Wii “Krishna Acharya”, director Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> “Tashan” should be one of the worst films I've ever watched. Yes! The scenery is good, and Karina Kapoor (and her widely publicized weight loss) looks good. But the plot is extremely subtle and sometimes makes no sense from one scene to another - that's why I said in the beginning that I expected more from this film, since it was a Yashraj performance. As for the songs, unfortunately, I can not remember a single song. <br /> <br /> There are times when you can laugh, and this is mainly due to Akshay Kumar, and Saif could certainly have done better while Karina Kapoor played her role well. But this cannot be said about Anil Kapoor - this did not suit him at all as a villain. Finally, do not pay attention to Aditya Chopra, who in the past produced and made good films, such as Mohabbayein, what did Yash Chopra do when creating such a trash movie? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a bad movie, do not waste time, and this is my first and last impression.
