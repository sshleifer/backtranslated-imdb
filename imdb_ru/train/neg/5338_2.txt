Elvis Presley plays a half-blooded Indian (Indian) who must protect his reservation from the nasty business magnates. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight, have children. Struggle, struggle and "knocking out" each other replace the stereotypical expression "How" raised by hand? <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he has a make-up, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than he showed in previous films. ; perhaps he was preparing for his famous "return". This could not be, because the script of this film was something that could cause excitement. Joan Blondell, trying to seduce Elvis and Burgess Meredith in War Paint, should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (in fact, "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most awkward song is the Elvis love song for the Dominic bull. There are some surreal scenes, but they never become trivial enough to succeed in this genre; However, "Stay away, Joe" may laugh a little if you're in the right "mood." <br /> <br /> Otherwise stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Don't Go, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondel
