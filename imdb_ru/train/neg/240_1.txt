I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to take it very seriously. Speaking of Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost it. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with the help of awesome wedding videos. Viva is so stupid that the Badjiats have left Johar and Chopra behind. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment in the film when I could say: “Oh! at least it's good. " Aloknath makes a cliché in the role of the girl's father, Shahid Kapoor looks fat and Shah Rukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly-looking sets, bad costumes, a beaten storyline, monstrous stepmother, hard-working actors, cacophonic background music, cheap soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Now the spoiler, I warn you guys that, like in all his other films, after the movie about the accident ends in a happy note.
