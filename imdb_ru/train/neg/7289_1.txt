This is a film about a huge attraction for a relatively well-defined group (of which I am not a part). I went to the preview of this film, not knowing what to expect - I ended up finding it disappointing. The story of a horribly incompetent (often directly "perverted") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. An epic saga like this should really give the viewers something more at the end. Ultimately, such pictures of the human condition â€” this picture almost does not shed light on any of its more significant aspects.
