Turn away from your back, or you will get in big trouble because of the back of my boy! Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence, complete darkness and doom at the very moment you watch it. It's safe to say that the whole movie is falling apart, with a sarcastic approach and a tribute to zombie shows that challenge the most stupid things to do. We often get a name like "Johnny", and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no particular reason why our “dead corpse” crawls out of his grave in order to survive up to the prom, which makes the film completely useless. Without a feeling of sadness, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Johnny bites off Eddie’s hand after that. The viewer is asked a difficult question: why should a film be such a cornball? There's an answer. Any resemblance to all living or dead people is purely coincidental. “Live” is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the film. Show it to your girlfriend, and she will miss the prom, turning your life into desert ruins. Blah !!!
