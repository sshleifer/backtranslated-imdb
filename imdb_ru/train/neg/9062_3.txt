This film was distinguished by the fact that there were no typical stereotypes of gays that I used to see. But this does not change the fact that it is completely missing the plot. Iâ€™m sure there are a lot of gays who are just happy to see themselves on the screen, since black gays are rarely seen, and when they are characters, they are usually not fully developed. But how difficult it would be for the author to write the script of the story with the beginning, middle and end. Or how about a story that has been focused. It seems that there is no point in this film, and although it is a film with a low budget, this does not justify the absence of a plot or plot.
