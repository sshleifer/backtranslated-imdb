At the beginning of the film there were beautiful photos and scenes with a fox. However, the story was very slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see a fox. One thing everyone should know is that you leave wild animals wild and enjoy them from afar. This film sets a terrible example for children who will watch it, trying to turn a wild creature into an animal. I do not know the meaning of this story. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl still wanted to play with the sets. Does she ever learn a lesson? And there are other scenes showing the predator animals to the fox, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on the children watching this movie. What a disappointment it was in this movie. And what a horrible story that tells. The final narrated dialogue was so dumb when my wife and I screamed on TV! I absolutely hated this movie and never recommend it to anyone!
