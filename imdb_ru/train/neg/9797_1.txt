Nowadays, this is a kind of tendency to view all shows since the early 1990s as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and although some of these shows were / undoubtedly good, this one is just nonsense. I watched this show a lot in those days, because then there were a lot of repetitions on TV, and even as a child I didn’t like it. Even an 8-year-old can see how many people in the Power Rangers are replaying, and how many special effects sucks even then. When the show does not resort to terribly bad fight scenes, it torments the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teenagers, and from time to time they have minor social problems. I don’t know about you, but I didn’t give a rat ass at all about all this, and this is basically a filler until they have to “fight” again with some dude in a very bright alien costume with a firework or a toy -robot . You never feel "involved" in any way in this show, and the fact that most actors act as if they really have no interest, except that their wallet only reinforces the lack of feelings. <br /> <br /> There is nothing memorable about this show, and it’s pretty surprising that there were so many days off (Betlborgs is a good example). All this is just a quick way to make money though. I challenge any “fan” to tell me what exactly stands out in the episodes, which should be so good because I could not find anything that is even a little attractive for children. I guess most Power Rangers "fans" will tell me that I "just don't understand," or something like that. I really don't care; then it was crap and now it is still crap.
