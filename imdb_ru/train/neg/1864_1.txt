I can't be a critic, but that's what I think about this movie. Well, I just watched the movie on cinemax, and, first, I just have to say how much I hate the storyline. I mean, the snowman is scary, except for small children, secondly, it's pretty awful, but I bet that the film has such a low budget they probably used ketchup, therefore MY CRITICAL VOTING IS BOMB !!! good try, and the sequel will suck twice as much.
