More recently, for the first time in several decades, having revised “Lipstick”, I backed it up with “Descent”, although I heard more negative comments than good ones from other friends of the film with tastes as diverse as mine. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare the evolution of the unique niche of the film “Rape over the past 32 years,” from the full “I spit on your grave”, to the crazy sensationalism of “Lipstick”, to tastefully processed question in “Accused”. But “Descent,” although it makes some important remarks, never gives us anything really new in terms of frank meaning. No, “Descent” is so poorly made in terms of image and sound quality that it distracts from any important message that he can hope to make - a message that, upon closer examination, is not so innovative. <br /> I pretty much knew the plot was coming. What I wanted to see * was the "descent" or degeneration of Dawson's character. Being a big fan of Rosario, I was impatient to see the layers being removed, and her psyche is slowly distorted ... you know, the image that De Niro brings to Taxi Driver. Unfortunately, the script and the choice of director / writer do not provide any plausible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is the second act. It became obvious that the director’s intentions for this segment of clubbing, drug use and obsession with big black stallion Adrian (every white boy's nightmare, of course) from Q & A on DVD, but this excursion into Dawson's character will never be believable. We don’t know exactly what the hell she does half the time, what she does, or why she does it. Poor audio / video quality does not help again, but the sequence is too long and pointless. He destroys any impulses and investment in the protagonist created during the exceptionally well-done first act. By the time we get to the final, our interest has already decreased. <br /> <br /> One of the moments of success that Dawson points to questions and answers is that by the end of the “revenge” scene we’re pumped up for retribution, then realize how horrible and disgusting reality is. While this is certainly true, it does not make the scene more intriguing. <br /> <br /> If you have a DVD, watch the deleted “classroom” scene. This is an excellent 8-minute plus, which crackles with energy and provocation (albeit all oral) and really shows Dawson's slow clue, as she delightfully revives poor Francis Swift's innocent, indulgent counselor at the hostel. If more such scenes were added and the middle third was cut, we could have an interesting psychological study of the effects of senseless acts of violence. <br /> <br /> Since the film is in the final version However, all we get is what we saw before, only in a more graphical rendering. So what?
