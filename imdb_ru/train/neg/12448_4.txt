Clint Eastwood - Bronco Billy, leader of the Wild West troupe, is one of six permanent losers who make up a touring show struggling to break even. The seventh member of the group is a woman, Billy's assistant, but such women do not live long, and the situation is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke is Eastwood's girlfriend at the time). Miss Lilly, as Doc calls her (Scatman Krothers), seems to be a potential heiress who will receive the property of her long-dead father only if she is married by the time she is 30 years old, so on the eve of this birthday she becomes married to a cartoon Jeffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> What is the plot of this film? It is hard to say. There is a romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that for the first half of the film she is so arrogant and tasteless that when she suddenly becomes “one of the troupe” halfway through the film, it’s not only incredible, but the audience hasn’t take care of her. The screening of the Wild West is chronically short of funds, but this topic is not sufficiently affected to become the real meaning of the film. There is Miss Lilley, who is in a difficult position in the rural west, cut off from the means that feed her spoiled luxurious life (she is mistakenly considered her family and the press). But should we really believe that she will not be able to return to New York and wait for her if she makes a little effort? <br /> <br /> No, the meaning of this film is that Billy is the leader of a family, an attractive bunch of losers who stick together, no matter what. Is it a warm, fuzzy movie ?? or at least trying to be. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint shows us his skill with a weapon, even disrupting a bank robbery while shooting, which is grotesquely out of place in a non-violent film. One of the gangs arrested on the old charges of evading conscription; Billy bribes the local sheriff. The tent show burns down; orphanage makes them new. But numerous worldly pitfalls do not create a plot. <br /> <br /> The difficulty of the problem lies in the action or absence of it. In addition to Scatman Crothers, the cast is quite amateur. Eastwood is also not at the forefront of his game, although he looks better simply because he is surrounded by such a dull pile. <br /> <br /> And while the film lasts 116 minutes. To what point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
