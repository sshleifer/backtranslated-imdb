If this is a 2008 product from one of the largest productions of the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), then I’m afraid that we have yet to reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you can If you make a mistake in this episode with such a huge cast of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Karina, then the film has yet to be explored by everyone associated with this film. The film is lacking in almost all departments except cinema and akshay kumara. It has some good rendering dialogs, but that alone cannot make you enjoy watching a movie with great expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene, in which a car descends from a mountain into a river, has very cheap cartoon-like graphics. This in itself is a clear indicator of the director’s vision. Every actor who otherwise is an asset to the film is simply lost. Anil Kapoor’s trick with trying good English fails in most cases. And Saif will surely hit himself, wondering why he signed this film. <br /> <br /> In short, THIS IS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURCES AFTER "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even “Aaja Nachle” was a more enjoyable film than this one. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved. The most undesirable was the memory of Akshay's love story. After the wrong scenario, the weakest point of the film is its music. Vishal Shekhar gave only a few tunes for each song. The songs start very well, and suddenly the melodies fall sharply. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good in everything. Vishal Shekhar missed this opportunity. <br /> <br /> With regard to the intelligence of continuity created by the creators, just try this: Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly terrain abroad (probably in Ladakh). In the next scene, they look for Karina in Haridwar, and then return to the hills with Karina in her car. I still think who wrote it. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit to the last, the climax will be too long with silly and unnecessary stunts. You can see that all the heroes who come through a storm of bullets do not hurt, as if they were GOD. Do we still see the 2008 film with all these technical advances? So no more words about this pathetic and indulgent film, but a sincere request to the senior actors from their fan. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar! If possible, ask to preview your films after their first copy outside. As artists of this level, you have certain obligations to your fans and spectators. People still clap their hands when you enter the screen in their first scenes, respectively. I think that this kind of film should not see the light of day, as it undermines the reputation of everyone associated with the film, actors and producers.
