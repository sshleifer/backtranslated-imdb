Like most recordings at festivals, Hamilton makes for an interesting viewing a film that has all the ideas and little performance. Although the film is impressive for its obvious low budget, the film in the final turn stumbles and becomes terribly long during a long and obvious conclusion. A film about a family of rogue killers trying to survive the death of their parents. They kidnap people, drain their blood and feed something locked in their basement. There are some good dark comedies from McKellar and Firgens, and the rest are just so-so. The film never seems realistic or very disturbing in this regard. But for the first half, it knocks into a strangely funny and dark mixture, which is an amazing achievement. The next half is not as successful as it goes into oblivion of the film with unrealistic twists and turns into a ridiculously audacious ending that turns the whole movie into complete nonsense. It's a shame, although there is no doubt that some talent was associated with this performance, and although it is deeply flawed, it remains original and creative. It is a pity that when it comes to delivery, it completely fails at every level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
