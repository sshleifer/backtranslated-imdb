It could be a good film if he explored something more interesting, and not just the surface of lesbian relationships, if it were the meaning of the film ... quite predictably, not to mention the fact that the two girls are like the Russian group tATu . ..conjuncture? I do not think so. There is nothing original in this film to support this, so they had to use something that was already known. You know the recipe. Other actors ... well, I just don't know what their role is. Most of them are famous people in Romania, and I must mention that some of them are not even actors (for example, Michaela Radulescu). SO, to sum up: “a girl-group of tattoos” + desperate / advertising needs “actors” + a nonexistent conspiracy + reason to use foul language to shock = Love is sick ... too bad ... the idea was good, although ... and I seriously restrain myself from commenting on the name ...
