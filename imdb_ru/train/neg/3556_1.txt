You know that you have problems when John Cassavetes is running at half speed and not at full throttle in the film, while Incubus is a terrible worst-case scenario when a great actor experiences trying to pay bills. In fact, The script and the "baroque" artistic direction of John Hough, it can hardly be blamed. The film is somehow related to a series of murders of rapes taking place in a small town, in which a lot of supernatural hockey are mixed. Somehow the direction pulls the tension and interest from each scene, and Cassavetis seems to be PO from time to time Incubus itself, which does not appear until the last scene, is a well-made creation, but you should not expect it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
