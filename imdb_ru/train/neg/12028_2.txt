I agree with everyone above who said anything that will convince you not to waste a minute on watching this amazing amateur movie. A very bad game, arrogant production values, a completely pedestrian focus and such an inept and meaningless scenario that should never have been written, let alone created. Even Hollywood "professionals", obviously, go to work only for salary, although no one had to pay for this bad work. Instead, the career should have ended because of this inessential rubbish. <br /> <br /> OTH, there is something exciting about watching something so terribly bad. And Chad Low is terrible and invariably bad.
