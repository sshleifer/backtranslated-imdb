This is probably one of the worst "want to be a low budget hit" to believe in the dinosaur genre. The film is so predictable that you can leave, cook yourself dinner, go answer the phone or something else, and when you return, you will know for sure what happened. The special effects are so bad that you might think that Lego bricks were used, and the “super fast” dinosaurs were so tame that because of this the domestic dog looks like a super predator. The game is over cooked. They try their best, but they just don’t have enough character to understand the characters and the scientist ... Well, okay, we know exactly what will happen to the blonde in glasses. Stereotype was created for films like this. If you want to watch this film, I believe that you are not in such a serious mood as the actors and the film crew. And if you really love dinosaurs and know everything about them, don't watch this, you can break the screen - the facts are so far away.
