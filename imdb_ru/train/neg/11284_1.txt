I usually try to build enough reasoned criticism of films, but I cannot believe that this has passed the stage of the script. The dialogue is terrible, the actors are very cunning, the accents are just awful, and the direction and rhythm are sloppy at best. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember when I last saw such a horrible movie. Joseph Fiennes, no matter how handsome he was, could have just so quickly killed his career. <br /> <br /> Dr. Moreau’s island was no worse than this garbage.
