Well, first of all, let me say that I’m still amazed at how the plot sucks, <br /> <br />, but again, this is the film in which Stephen Segal’s film is being shot, only without Stephen Segal Oh my God! <Br /> <br /> just random low-budget fighters really do not make sense, I'm still amazed, I spent 90 minutes on this shit really! <br /> <br /> just rent a Jackie Chan movie or go and see wwf more fun and have no and can afford not to have the plot !!! Please avoid it! By the way, the best actor playing there is Bill Goldberg, and that says a lot !! <br /> <br /> No, he doesn’t play very well, as I said, please avoid it, pfff, I still can’t believe that I wasted 90 minutes and spent 10 more minutes to write this !! :)
