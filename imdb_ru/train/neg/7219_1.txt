It's still hard for me to understand that such a bad film could be made in Hollywood. Acting and history is just pretentious and the direction is terrible. I do not see any logic behind this garbage, except that the director had nothing to do. It took me ten minutes to realize that I wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with anxiety that I was going to spend a little more time on this nonsense. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I do not know which category it belongs to. Please avoid this movie at all costs, just do something, even hit your head against the walls, but donâ€™t go to this movie.
