In a recent move to deliver Asian films to America, this is the last film to be released here. Being a big fan of Asian films of all genres, I looked through the network and came across it soon to be re-released to the US market, so I decided to check it out in advance and rent it at a local video store. br /> <br /> Believe me ... the gunmen are incredibly disappointing, the Crowding Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blew this film out of the water. Jet Li fell asleep while watching the fighting. If you are looking for entertainment for martial arts, your time would be better with a flick of Jackie Chan !!! <br /> <br /> Moreover ... you think that you are going to see martial arts from about a girl wallowed in revenge for the death of her parents, BUT SURPRISE !!! The good hour of this film in the middle is filled with dialogue, lack of action, lack of unfolding of the tangent plot, which is largely NOTHING related to the premise with which we are confronted. It is more connected with the relationship between her and the boy, as well as the boy with his conspiracy group, in which the producer / director did not devote time for reflection, and yet devoted part of the film, delaying the problem. It would be much better if they just cut the whole hour and developed the plot itself in another film and focused on the martial arts aspect. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this, I really do not believe Iron Monkey Choreographer, did the sequence of actions in Princess Blade. I was completely offended by the frequent use of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the physical speed of the killers. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I’m warning you, PLEASE don’t waste your time / money on this film. The package is intriguing, and the trailer may even seduce you, but I'm sure this movie is NOT suitable for the public (maybe in Japan, but not in the states) and will be the worst movie transferred to the states from the Asian film industry.
