Once there was a science fiction author named H. Bim Piper, who wrote a classic book called The Little Fuzzy, which tells about a man who discovered a race of charming little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's writers began robbing his grave until his body was cold. This is the book from which they took the idea of ​​Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a blatant “Little Fuzzy” robber. I may wonder why I am the only one who has ever noticed? <br /> But don’t take my word for it. Here is a link to the Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of "Little Fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
