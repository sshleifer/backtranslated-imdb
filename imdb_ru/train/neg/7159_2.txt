I thought I would never find such a horrible film like The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but this film is competing with it. <br /> <br /> I’m not a person who falls asleep while watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the start of the trance. I woke up and began to look at it again. Why did I deserve it? The whole movie was torture, I have to use fast forward to see it in full. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why one of my favorite actors of all time (MR. WALKEN) could do it. I have to think that he did a favor to the director, or he really needed money, because film after film, which he makes, he destroys himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> How about a movie? it's not a scary, stupid plot, the characters are terrible (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), the effects are very bad, the lack of death and blood, and so on; in three words he has something. And I mean it. I can not understand how the director can make such a film. <br /> <br /> In any case, when I was more disappointed when I saw on the cover of a video that the movie was presented by “Stephen King,” I Think he will never be able to present this shit, no? (I rented it in Argentina). I do not recommend it in a million years. <br /> <br /> I rate this film as 2 out of 10. (As I said in my review “The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” films will always be worse, so it doesn't deserve 1 out of 10)
