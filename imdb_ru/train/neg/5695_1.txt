This film is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi indicate that this is a humorous gangster movie. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of the ridiculous female hero begins a series of ridiculous plot twists that can conceal little with a contrived ending. The film moves between comedy (the description is used freely) and surreal drama with the addition of uncontrolled scenes for adults. In the title role (the angel in the title) is poorly played, and the actress does not help the script, which requires an incredible, extreme character that will be depicted. James Belushi - the only one who copes well with his role, but also disappointed by a bad scenario. One to avoid.
