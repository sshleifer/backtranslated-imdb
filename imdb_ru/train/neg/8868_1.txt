Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Action, dialogue, manuscript, sound, lighting, storyline. I can't say anything positive about this, although I like Swedish films. Battle scenes are so ridiculous that you can not take it seriously. And when the lead character just loses his shirt, dodging bullets in a strip bar, I'm not sure if this should be a joke or someone really thinks that these are the ingredients in a good movie ?! Regina Lund is the only actor of half origin, but she disappears in a stream of ludicrous pronunciations and incredible reactions. It leaves you horrified that someone really spends time and money on something like this ...
