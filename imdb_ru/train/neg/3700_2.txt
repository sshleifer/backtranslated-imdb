because this is the only way you will not think that this film is a complete waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (which was at least worth a look) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. Rather, it is a means to give Rok time to film for a weak comedy that plays poorly on the big screen. Moreover, his jokes, as a rule, should be from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man, but are shown from the Rock itself. When he insults blacks and whites, chemistry is all wrong. The film is not funny, poorly filmed, acting is weak at best. Rent a Heaven Can Wait and Rock live video and you will be far ahead of the game.
