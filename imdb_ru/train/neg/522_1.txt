After 15 minutes, my wife already wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material, but because of its absence. They decided to fill in the gaps, where funny things had to be with as much language and absolutely vulgar conversation as they could. When it stopped (very rarely), we sat back and watched (not laughing, notice), and waited for the next rude or offensive comment. After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we read said how great it is. The trailer looked good, and Roger Ebert actually called him “smart” and said that this is not a rough sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, this is the only other film I've ever left ... and I have no regrets. I'm sick of watching comedies in America.
