This was not the main catastrophe I was expecting, but it is as positive as I can describe in the film. I'm not sure what was supposed to be funny in this film, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I do not find it ridiculous to watch how morons live their idiotic lives or make themselves fools on TV, but again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springerâ€™s miserable day talk show. I was not bored watching it, but I definitely never enjoyed it. If you are in the mood to watch a bad movie, but watch it is not too painful, this is a good choice.
