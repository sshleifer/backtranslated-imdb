Little Johnny is your everyday bully against an authoritative film. Little Johnny, the protagonist, branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of adults he meets along the way, he finds it difficult to change his harmful ways, yet worthy to do. Personally, I found an actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with him, but changing the tone of the film would allow most people to feel Vovochkaâ€™s emotional struggle when he wants to be good, but bad things still happen. This fight makes the film a little different from other films of the same genre, it was a little scent that I had in mind. In general, I did not really care about this film, although, most likely, it was aimed at a younger audience.
