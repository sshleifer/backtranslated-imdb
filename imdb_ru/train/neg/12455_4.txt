I remember watching it in prime time when I was about 7 years old. At that time, I was a big comic reader, and everything about superheroes was expected with great impatience. The end result, however, was stunning. <br /> <br /> I knew the stories about Emma Peel by Diana Prince, because they had just come to an end, and Diana returned to her Amazonian form. However, there was so little action that I was bored for most of the film. The final costume was an interesting idea, but he looked more like a fan than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I watched the film again in recent teenage years. This is not much improved. Thanks to The Incredible, Kathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, but her playing was no better. The script had some good ideas, such as a fraudulent Amazon and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it just didn’t work out and was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they had to create a back story better, and built the show in a more epic climax. It was too much like a soft spy movie, interlaced with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. The elements of the Amazon were intriguing, but they needed to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film really made the producers go back to the drawing board and come up with something more true, if it’s too camp and low-budget. The budget here was also quite low, and superheroes are not cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the film was available on DVD, at least as a comparative and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and he has nothing to do with this film (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). For the sake of curiosity, for inspiration and caution, look at future versions.
