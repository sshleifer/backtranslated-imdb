I just can not understand why all these relics of the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. You can clearly see how disappointed they were during the censorship of the commies, who forbade them so many things to show in their films, and now they donâ€™t know what a great freedom is in fancy Farsi, so fill the screen with vomiting swearing and any other kinds of disgusting imaginable. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is just a visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about Foreman and neorealism and other directors who could work with the aesthetics of disgrace. Those people mastered their work - well, you do not! Do us a favor, all of you, Danelyuki, Nikolaeski, Sayzesky, Mureshantsy, Marineski and Marginiana and other obsolete old men, and leave us alone! A little time to see some Romanian MOVIES on the screen, enough with your immature horrors! You are not directors, you are ILLEGAL !!!
