* Spoilers and extreme collisions are still ahead * <br /> <br /> When this show just started, I found it tolerant and fun. Fairy Oddparents is a cartoon that kids and adults liked. It also had high marks along with Spongebob. But it started to fall because of the next shit that Butch Hartman and his team pushed into the show. <br /> <br /> First, toilet humor is not that funny. You can easily cause a quick laugh from a small child with a belch, but this is almost the only audience that laughs at such a joke. Next come the children's jokes. Lol, we can see people in their underwear, and we can see people dressing up. LOLOLOL !!! I just can not stop laughing at such a happy happiness! Somebody help me! But, of course, this show would not be so bad if it were not for stereotypes. Have you seen how the team portrayed the Australians? They saw in them nothing but loving kangaroos, boomerang-giving simpletons living in the hot desert. But now ... Is this a good move, WHY this show really sucked the loudest of them ... SHOCKING WITH USE !!! The show constantly raises the same jokes (most of them are unfunny), thinking that this is the greatest thing! Cosmo is mostly to blame. I hated the way they kept mentioning “Super Toilet” (which also has a mixture of humorous humor), and Cosmo went crazy. And who could forget this stupid battery joke that every damn parent in Dimmsdale used in this episode via email? Do you know that the one in which each parent (not paying attention to what other parents say it) will EXACTLY the same sentence before rushing into his child’s room? Yes, it may be a first-class humor for some people, but for others it’s just s ***. <br /> <br /> If I'm not mistaken, I believe that Butch Hartman said something about the end of the show. Thank God! Everyone in my area says this is the nicest Nickelodeon show. I just can not agree with that ?? I think that this is just another pile of horse manure that we receive every day at our animation stations, only worse.
