Curiously, the two Stars Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who entered the new television environment and achieved even greater success, and both engaged in production and enjoyed the status of a magnate on a small screen. Lucille Ball, however, was not the main star to come with television. As for Dick Powell, he desperately wanted to leave films such as Meet The People, and his salvation in his career will come in his next film. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell made the film was because the young player from MGM was chosen by a special number, and he saw it at that time. His personal time with June Ellison was much better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks terribly dull and generally cannot evoke any emotion. <br /> <br /> He was probably tired of these musicals with silly plots, from which he ran from Warner Brothers. The original Meet The People show was not a book show, it was a review, and it was held in the 1940-41 season on Broadway for 160 performances. When MGM bought it, they abandoned everything except the title and title track. The rest of the score was compiled by various different songwriters, none of the songs were remembered. Strange, if we consider that some of the source materials are taken from Burton Lane, E.Yu. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rogers and Hart. These guys must have just emptied the material chest. <br /> <br /> The plot is more stupid than most propaganda music works of the time. Powell is the author of a review called Meet The People, he is a shipyard worker who wins the lottery with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, he is interested, they are both interested in the revue, but creative differences, of course, keep them aside until the final. This is a film in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> MGM gave Powell and Boll some good songs that are the main reason for watching Meet The People. Von Monroe and Spike Jones's big bands are here, and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr, dressed in a commodore costume, like Lou Costello, in the episode "In the Navy". The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg, who wrote Lara's number Courage from The Wizard of Oz. And since almost everyone in the world has seen this movie, you have an idea that Khiv Ho looks like. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell’s next film, “Killing My Sweet”, in which he finally offered a not very kind idea. musicals. And Lucy will have to wait for television before the world finds out what she can really do.
