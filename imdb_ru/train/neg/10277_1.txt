I feel completely cut off. Someone must reimburse the $ 4.95 I spent on Blockbuster to rent this mess. This is NOT a musical, it's a waste of time and my evening. What I donâ€™t understand is why it was distributed first and foremost ??? I saw the best films coming out of film schools, and I was in a film school, so I can say this as a fact. The quality of this work is also just very bad for viewing ... shot on DV ??? Enough. The songs are not songs, but just a banter, which sounds the same in every section. Want to see a good musical? THEN DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE.
