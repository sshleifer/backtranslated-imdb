A few days ago I was watching the documentary Fifty Worst Films of All Time, and it was here that I first heard about the INCREDIBLE FLOATING MAN. Being a lover of shocking films, I try to find some films from a documentary - not just INCREDIBLE SWOOMING. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first “bad film” that I have seen since then, and I must say that I am rather disappointed. Although it’s a really bad movie, it’s not close enough to be included in this list. <br /> <br /> Now that I watched a documentary, I liked “bad movies” ever since I read the book “The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time” by Harry Bear. Despite the same title, the book came out long before the documentary and the creators of the documentary did not attribute this concept to the Bear. From the book of Medved, I saw about 35 out of 50 films, but I was stumped - the rest of the films are simply not available on VHS or DVD. So I decided to try a movie with the same name. <br /> <br /> The reason why I was most disappointed by the INCREDIBLE MOVER was that there were some good elements in the film. Firstly, the special effects of a melting guy were generally cool and disgusting. Obviously, a professional (the famous Rich Baker) was involved in creating a realistic image. However, I should also note that there were also more than a few cheap and cheese effects, such as a floating plastic head and the way the monster ran after his left hand was cut off - you could see it. ” cleverly hidden "under his clothes! As for the story, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrates into the rings of Saturn without contrition. Then they comment on how beautiful the sun is when we see his close-ups. It's strange because Saturn is so far from of this - it should NOT look like this - it must be a big spot. Despite this, the scene immediately changes, and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in the hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yes, it's someone that assumption well e then the survivor escapes and commits a murderous frenzy when his whole body melts. <br /> <br /> Now, considering that they have a psycho running around like a melting popsicle, you might think that the government will pull out all the stops to find and stop him, right?! Wrong. The general hires one doctor to find him !! No army, no police — just some kind of stupefied doctor. Even after the bodies start to form, in no case a doctor or the general do nothing to organize a meaningful search or get a backup. <br /> <br /> Now, given the stupidity of the film, you too would not be surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the melting dude runs around the doctor’s house, the doctor gives his wife a strong sedative and leaves her in the house. <br /> <br /> When a cute old couple travels late at night, they naturally stop in the garden to collect fruits, and they are killed. <br /> <br /> When a woman sees a melting dude, she barricades the door to protect herself. It would be smart if she didn’t have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of just leaving the house and running away, she is just waiting! <br /> <br /> When the photographer and his model take pictures, the guy grabs his assistant and rips off her top. What for? Well, to give viewers a cheap thrill and make it an estimated R click. <br /> <br /> When the melting dude is finally found and the sheriff clearly shot him, the doctor stops him - although Now a monster has been killed by about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the film is replete with silly plot elements. This is a very bad movie. But, given sometimes good special effects, it was not a terrible film, as I had hoped. Of course, this is good for laughter, but nowhere near PLAN 9 from EXTERNAL SPACE in a bad way and should never have been included in someone’s worst movie list.
