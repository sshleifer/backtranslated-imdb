hg, as a rule, exploits, and it never bothered me before - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudoscience or playing heuristics. The whole movie is based on a person with an ESP caused by an electrical accident and a witch. I donâ€™t mind the witches, and I liked Carrie (the novel and the movie), but this one bothered me. I think this is due to the fact that the main character develops ESP from the electrical line. a university professor also spends time studying cases. I was not alive in the 60s to find out firsthand whether esp is a common mistake, but I assume that any theory of this kind will simply be discredited. what really bothered me was how the police described schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people in 99% of cases, and then simply break down. nothing could be further from the truth. I hate such concepts because they add to social idiocy. Many people still believe that schizophrenia is a dissociative personality disorder. Whoever wrote this script, he knew little about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some decent concepts in the film. I liked the way the witch used the men; it was a good change. I liked how she could attract herself, but did not like when she was next to her forced lovers. I was wondering how her second lover also burned his face. if the script had been finalized a few weeks before the production and was not focused solely on making the audience more stupid, it could be a decent movie.
