.... this mini does not get better with age. I saw it, and this sequel, when it was originally broadcast, and, like many others, was amazed. In early 2002, I borrowed novels for both WOW and W and R, and was even more impressed. Then I decided that I should watch both again, and put $ 200 plus in the DVD kits. I looked at both miniatures again in gloomy detail and realized that I had done everything backwards - I had to buy novels and borrow a DVD. <br /> <br /> Don't you believe that this is terribly wrong? Read the novels and see for yourself. Do not think this is from? Show it to someone not old enough to see what it originally conveyed, and watch the reaction you get (warning - reactions from such people range from horror looks to belly laughs). <br /> <br /> According to the trivia section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali McGraw and Robert Mitchum. Clap !! Quality of production, sounding of music, dialogues - a great story was turned into a TV series of the late 70s by an overly ambitious producer / director who was overhead. This item was dated the minute it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two mini-films were great when the original programs were broadcast, and for those of us who saw them then, they pulled a nostalgic string that reminded us of earlier days. IMO - this mini almost does not justify its reputation and is very disappointing.
