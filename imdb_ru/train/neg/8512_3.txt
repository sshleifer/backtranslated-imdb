I love dumb films, but that was too stupid. No matter how much I want to say that it was worth the hour that I got up, I can't. I don't think any version of the film even comes close to the book. And do not try it on children, they can go crazy. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know that labor laws were different then ... BUT FIND PEOPLE.
