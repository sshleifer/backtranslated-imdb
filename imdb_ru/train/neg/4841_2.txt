REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I'm really amazed to see glowing reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This one big pathetic, grainy, cliché. I would have laughed out loud and a lot, but I was on a date with a former military guy. I could not hide my other answer, beard. Yes, I think that my date, the flat "good old boy", was pleasant. It's not a compliment. I know that the actor wants to work .... Good for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> This was a painful tease from Ralph. I vote 2 only because Ralph looked VERY awesome. But I have to beg, Ralph, how could you? And why?? <br /> <br /> I'll go watch “The End of the Cause” to recover and recover… C1
