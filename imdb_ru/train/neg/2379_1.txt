I admit I think that Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet, and she set herself the task of seeing every movie she was in (unfortunately, including the awful Batman and the Robin, The Avengers) and this one. <br /> <br /> this is supposed to be the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes, it is even lower than the Avengers). one looks lost in it, and it is incoherent beyond faith. <br /> <br /> Even if you think that Uma is a goddess like me, PLEASE PLEASE do not expose yourself to this film. You will hate yourself the next morning for it.
