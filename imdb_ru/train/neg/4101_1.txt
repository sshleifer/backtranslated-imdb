it may be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I do not understand how this can be described as a horror film or even a thriller? it's more like awkward drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT, but since there were no scary situations, the director thought that it would be nice to use it for everyday activities such as dumping or descending the stairs. the film had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed that the authors assumed that you already knew them. they will undergo specific actions without explaining or even the key to understanding what they had in mind. it's just one of those films that talk about one thing, but about something completely different.
