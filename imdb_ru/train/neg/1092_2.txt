Well, I believe that the good news regarding William Winkler’s 2001 Double Avenger is that he manages to combine three of the wonders of Russ Meyer’s Miracle - the kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix - in one picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satan and Babet Bardo were busy that week when they were shooting this thing ... or I managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) Although the bad news (and there are a lot of them This is what this the film - if you can even call it that when it was filmed right on the video - is a complete misfire, complete abortion, terrible atrocity, absolute filth and really one of the worst pictures I've ever seen. Don't look for more for the worst superhero movie , ever made! The plot here, such as it is, has t deal with how Kitten gets superpowers after slaying a rare cocasilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (oh), and then fighting a trio of bikini dancers with a huge set back in LA. must excuse the expression) it’s flat that the film generally has ZERO actual nudity (except some old Kitten photos in its heyday), and that some shaving cream and a papier-mâché boulder are the total amount of special FX. They say that Meier’s girls are a little long in the tooth / sagging in the chest, although Sheri Don Don Thomas, as the bikini girl of Oog Bubi (!), Has managed to stand out well. So why did I give this juvenile, unfunny, failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1? Be brief: Joe Bob Briggs. His offscreen commentary on the special features of the DVD that I just watched is very funny, especially when he pulled out about 100 synonyms for the word “chest” of 1000+ in the “List of canonical beeps” of his website. This man is a national treasure, and he manages to turn this disk with plates into coaster status!
