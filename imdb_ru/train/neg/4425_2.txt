The film is about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. This contrasts with the modern story of a young, fun, black artist. <br /> <br /> If this sounds vague, it is because the movie itself. It is well directed, fairly well written, and (for the most part) well acted. Also, scenes in the past were filmed in sullen black and white. In addition, it is one of the few gay films that DOES NOT shy away from sex scenes (not so obvious or frontal). However, I basically hated it. <br /> <br /> The film is writhing everywhere, it is full of unattractive characters (including the main character) and (this is the killer) moves in the tempo of snails. Three times I thought to leave the theater, because I was very bored. But the director was there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His afterword says that it was a labor of love, and it took 6 years to complete it. I really would like me to like it more (there are A LITTLE films honestly telling about homosexuals), but I can't. If you are not very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see it.
