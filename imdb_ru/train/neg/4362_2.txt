A group of alien people, looking like humans, are sent to Earth to eat on crash-lands on the planet of prehistoric animals, instead they all eat physical procedure mushrooms and behave as backward ones. Complemented by frames from the Planet of the Dinosaurs and terrible jokes, this is definitely one that you can skip. Acting is also terrible, and although it's not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie can it be?) It's still pretty awful disgusting things. This 90-minute time sounds like an eternity, and you will probably curse life, so do yourself a huge favor and just move on, skip this crappy movie, there's nothing to watch. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to resell this shit like the MST3K style, making fun of the film they made a decade earlier, and it works to such an extent that you still can't see anything, Ariyaun Albright is hot, but Lilith Stubbs pretty unattractive voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> More info on DVD: joke comment, 17 Behind the Scenes; 7 minutes to black function; Jessica Mills Report; Photo gallery; and original trailer
