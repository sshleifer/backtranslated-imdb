This film was not programmed in Italian cinemas, I saw it at a show called "fantasy festival". I find it terrible, because some scenes seem to be music clips chaotic and dark, using fluorescent colors is a mockery, and in a movie. Music is completely outside the story, and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the film seems interesting, but after a few minutes it becomes busy. The story is interesting, but development needs a complete overview.
