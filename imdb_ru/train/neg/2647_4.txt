I will say one thing for Janette and Nelson - even when they are stuck in a meaningless, insane, painfully inept musical, like this, they still twinkle in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duet exists even when the material is thin. Even when the score is almost one-time, non-existent depending on a couple of catchy melodies. And even when the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for fantasy. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real husband, Jean Raymond, in the film “Smile through”, which, however, was by far the best movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Janette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but this is the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassed by her “hep” number from Binnie Barnes — and Nelson can only face the most ridiculous situations with a blank look. <br /> <br /> One can only wonder what it was like on Broadway in 1938. Of course, he must have had more wit and style than is obvious in this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton is going crazy in an unfunny role, and none of the supporting players can breathe some semblance of life into this mess. It looks like an amateur studio night, even though there were several professionals among the support staff. <br /> <br /> To sum up: painfully awkward rendering of the Rogers-Hart musical. I can not recommend it even to fans of Macdonald and Eddie. And even if Janette's close-ups still glow with her glowing beauty, this film is amazingly bad.
