Well, the big money machine made it again! Disney very astutely takes advantage of such assholes like me, who believe that we should own every video (good or bad), on which there is a “Disney” stamp. Why do I continue to look forward to these "sequels", because of which Don Blut on a bad day looks like Leonardo da Vinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three storylines (already a bad choice!). Isn't one of Disney's sweetest creations, at least, not worthy of a linear story? Of these three, only the latter comes close to the quality of the animation and narration that I expect. The music is brutal and modern (that is, after 2 years it is already out of date) and adds nothing to the story. Why should everything be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and loyal to the original with songs that reflect the same style? Gee, I can't wait to continue the Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we get music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So, Disney, if you are listening, remember that we are not all disorderly children here. How about throwing one or two dice to fans who have been long enough to understand the difference between craft and shit?
