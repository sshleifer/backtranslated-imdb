Superdome is one of those films that makes you wonder why it was shot. The whole story concerns someone who is trying to sabotage the Super Bowl, and all attempts to stop them. The way Tom's career and Donna Mills managed to survive this is beyond my power. However, the most disappointing thing about this was that there was no football in it at all! Avoid this if possible.
