I did not see the trailer for the film when I went to see the film, instead I based my opinions on the opinions of a friend. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this film just collapses. <br /> <br /> During the movie, Rock offers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately, the film really lacks comedy. It seems that the film wants to unite both laughter and love into one, and his attempt to fail. The love story in the movie is straightforward (fortunately), but it distracts too much from the movie, making Doom serious and soft. After all, the movie is first and foremost a comedy, where laughter should be the main concern. Not much in the film. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot is also uninteresting. Some parts were intermittent at all. If the supporting cast was supposed to be fun, they certainly didn't do a good job. A pair of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes that were dry and boring. The pairs of subordinates of the first incarnation of Rock were also soft. If there is one thing they did right, however, they made Rock more ridiculous by comparison.
