I just watched this movie on DVD last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that “I, the robot” polarized a critical viewing community here on IMDb (and also caused a lot of insults and name-calling). <br /> <br /> I find it somewhat surprising, since this film is not great (or even good), but not terrible (or even really bad). In fact, this film ... depressing. It is depressing that the population of US filmmakers is so ready to accumulate bad taste, play clips and greet them as impressive new works. This film is in the form of a “re-reading”, written everywhere, from the storyline (a difficult mix of Azimov and modern uber action) to the character of Smith (a clever cynic with a titanium skeleton) to special effects borrowed from the Matrix and several others. <br /> <br /> “I, Robot”, unfortunately, is quite possible, an ideal fighter for a modern audience: superficial plot, tasteless lively dialogue and a lot of adrenaline, Smith is mediocre, but we already knew it (he seems , the last unsuccessful attempt by Hollywood to create a black Bruce Willis). There are a lot of holes in this story, of all sizes, but I don’t think that most of the people involved in this film are critical enough to notice. Perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards, but a very B-film compared to the real winners.
