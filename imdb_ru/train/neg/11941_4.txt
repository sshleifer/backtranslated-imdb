Despite the fact that this strange joke sounds strange, humor is usually quite dry, group members often stick their faces out or resort to rude expressions and wait for the crowd to applaud the rather silly anecdotes. another comment says that I don't think this is the best RTE ever made, it is really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, there are some really funny smart jokes that would make you sincerely laugh out loud. People seem to be convinced by the well-known names of comedians, and not judged on the quality of the jokes, which are actually not so good. In general, it is mediocre, with some good laughter that you need to have, but often it can be quite mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens. I think Benny Hill is funnier.
