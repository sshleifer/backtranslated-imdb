Pathetic. That's what happens when a director comes to work just because he is paid. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, great locations and settings for a movie with epic proportions. But the performance, damn it! I swear, in some shots you can see extras in the background looking at the camera or looking at the actors, because no one told them what to do when they hear "Action!" The battle scenes are so bad that you wonder - are these people real? They could do more damage just by embracing. In slow scenes, you can see people on the battlefield walking or just standing, waving their arms. <br /> <br /> Somehow only the foreground action is emphasized. But for what? The story is so illogical and intermittent that it seems random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even so. The dialogue is stupid, the story of love is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of $ 40 million, you can see every dollar invested on the screen, at best, the end result of all this tremendous effort - a brilliant round laser disc in a thin cover on a shelf in a video store.
