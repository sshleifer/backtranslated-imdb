Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerous, is a parody of the gangster films of the 1930s, based on the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton plays the role of a middle-aged gangster looking to his life when he catches a child trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) continues to have health problems, so Keaton falls into a crime at an early age through Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival lord with Boyle, and Keaton ultimately climbs the ladder. Joe Piscopo has a fun move, like Danny Parasites, yes, that's true, Parasites! Griffin Dunn - Keaton's younger brother, who became the district attorney, Glinnis O'Connor - his wife, and Marilou Henner plays the role of Keaton. The film looks notoriously cheap, which makes it look like a television show instead of a theatrical show. <br /> <br /> The film starts off great, and then slows down, as expected, after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogue and jokes, the film maintains its first half, but then it quickly loses steam and in the second half goes down to mediocrity and vulgarity. Keaton is chewing the landscape, making the best impression on James Cagney. Stapleton has some vulgar lines that are nasty but not funny. Piscopo does too much once. Several supporting actors are trying to keep the fort, like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuis, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as office sergeant and Sude Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half turns into a “skip or skip” hit and is never restored. The final scene using The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, as is the film The Call of the Wild Clark Gable, shown on the tent previously in the film. I think that Heckerling should have known better, since the target audience would probably know about the actual release date of The Roaring Twenties in 1939. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
