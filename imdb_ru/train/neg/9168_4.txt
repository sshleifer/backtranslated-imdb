Randolph Scott leaves the US for green pastures of Canadian British Columbia. He wants to organize there a ranch for livestock with partner Bill Williams and prepare Li Tung Fu. They run in a small herd on a toll bridge erected by Viktor Jory. Later, Jorie rustles his cattle, and Williams loses his left hand during scandals. <br /> <br /> From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott created a series of good westerns for adults, some of which were considered real classics. Unfortunately, the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among its top westerns. <br /> <br /> This is more like material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry could use. This story is sometimes stupid. Williams, who was with Scott, wanted to find gold, as it was a big hit at the time. He does not blame rustles, he blames Scott for convincing him to go on a journey because of the loss of his hand. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the film when Scott, Lee Tung-Fu and Gabby Hayes are captured by the Indians. They run away because the mule Gabby was taught to beat on the team, and he kicks the Indians, allowing our heroes to escape. I'm not sure that it would play in the Rogers film. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story actually wants you to believe that the thyristor Randolph Scott stumbled upon a golden blow after only a few lessons from scout Gabby Hayes. on how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell part of the Gabby Hayes feature film. It would be better if he came out in a good western, and in fact he did some of the best with Randolph Scott before. <br /> <br /> I will say this, although not a single Caribou has appeared in a film, it is one of the few Canadian films from the past that did not have a single monty. <br /> <br /> But if I were you, if you're not a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, do the next round of the Caribou Trail.
