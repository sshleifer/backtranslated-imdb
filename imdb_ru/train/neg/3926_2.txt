This Italian film is basically a soap opera with leather. <br /> <br /> On the VHS box it was indicated “R”, but on the cassette itself it was indicated “X”. The latter makes much more sense, because at the end there is a short scene that was shocking. Even in the dark you could see Dutch actress Mariska Detmers, who had sex with this guy, and, yes, you could see his cock in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time that the “main actress” had done something like that on the screen. <br /> <br /> In several scenes, parades are naked in the nude, but her face was even better than her body. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the film is ugly .... a real waste of time and, of course, is not recommended, despite the views of Detmers.
