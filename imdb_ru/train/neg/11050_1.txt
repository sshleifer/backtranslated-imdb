Terrible use of cuts scene. All continuity is lost, either because of terrible scenarios, or because of lethargy. That villainous robot ... should have been a jazz dancer? In addition, one of the worst sound tracks I've ever heard (monologues are usually drowned out by music.) And ... where did they get their props? This ship looks like a box of milk ... I made the best special effects on 8 mm at the age of 13! <br /> <br /> I would recommend to any student of the film to watch this film (5 minutes at a time) how to learn NOT to make a film. Or ... was it an editorial mistake? <br /> <br /> This is really very bad, because the script was actually a good concept ... just a poorly executed one. (Sorry, Malcolm. You should have sent a “stuntman double.” You're too good an actor for such a stinking bomb.)
