Arg. The shuffling dinosaurs are back to rob us of sanity in this horrible third movie. This time the European terrorists (I would say the Irish) are a high-jack, army convoy that was supposed to carry uranium. They enter the shipyard, open the truck and discover our old carnosaur friends. Then come the crowds when rubber dinosaurs attack terrorists, policemen and some marines. It seems that the whole film (again) is largely inspired by “Alien” (as Carnosaur-2 did), when pathetic marines pass through a “claustrophobic” shipyard? the weapon is ready. This third opus is probably the driest and most horrible film of all, with only one blood splash, when a rubber dinosaur tears off the marine’s head. Dinosaurs are tough, shuffling creatures, as usual, and the T-Rex sounds like an angry elephant when it roars (it also has no eyes). One of the film’s stupidest scenes is when tinkers arrive on the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is stored and hear some strange noise coming from another truck. When you open it a surprise! The rubber gang of reptiles broke loose and devoured them. Why were dinosaurs locked in the second truck after escaping from the first? How were they locked because the door of the truck could only be locked from the outside? What is the point of shooting this scene ???? Oh, worry, who cares? Both thumbs down for large rubber iguanas.
