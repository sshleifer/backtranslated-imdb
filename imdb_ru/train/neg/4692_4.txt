When I first saw this film, it was called “TERROR BY TRAIN” and was the reverse part of a double film. Glenn Ford, an armaments expert, is called upon to defuse a hidden bomb on a train loaded with explosives. The voltage is slow and steady; and this black and white film lasts only about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television; tensions and drama lost most of their impact. This is still a good movie if we talk about the standards of the early 50s. <br /> <br /> Along with Ford, Anna Vernon and Maurice Denham perform. The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern.
