I am afraid that you will find that the vast majority of people who rate this film as 10 are very Christian. Not me. If you are looking for a Christian film, I recommend this film. If you're looking for a good overall movie, I'm afraid you need to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Characters and their illogical behavior irritate me. The premise of the film is that the teaching of morality without the teaching that it is Jesus who is the basis of morality is in itself wrong. One scene shows how the main character tells the boy that stealing is wrong, and then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who taught us that. I find it offensive: should we believe that “do not steal” came from Jesus? I assume he wrote the Ten Commandments? Was theft acceptable before that? I rented a movie from Netflix. I had to understand the nature of the movie from the comments. Well.
