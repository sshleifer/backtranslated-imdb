I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW in my video store because of all the controversy surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first he was captured by US customs, if he ever tried to enter this country, so I was a fan of films considered “controversial”, I really had to see for myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena, who wants to know everything she can about life. In particular, she wants to focus her attention on creating a kind of documentary film about what the average Swede was thinking about some political issues, such as the Vietnam War and the problems of race in the United States. Meanwhile, asking politicians and ordinary people of Stockholm about their opinions about politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What kills me in I AM YELLOW is that 40 years ago it is considered pornographic. Indeed, sex and nudity are few and far between, even then he didn’t shoot, somehow made cheap porn. Although my compatriots consider it shocking, in fact, sex and nudity are a staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, perhaps their answer to the good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful to the creators of the film for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown more for artistic purposes. than just shocking people and making money to show in pornographic cinemas in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for those who want to study meat and potatoes (without puns) of Swedish cinema. But in fact, this film does not have a big plot.
