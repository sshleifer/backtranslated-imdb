I saw one of the scenic performances in Denver and was never so impressed. The word "vagina" speaks for itself. Part of the body. There is nothing shocking here. I could tell my doctor: “My left hand hurts a little after tennis” or “I have a sore vagina after cycling” with the same or more social comments. These can be Tricep Monologues for all the entertaining or radical comments I have heard. Monologues were boring, but posed with drama, the topics were outdated, and I alternately bored and annoyed. Once I thought I was laughing, but obviously it was not when I should have been. Of course, this is not quite a hit. Oh, and spoilers: there was a lesbian! - Oh, wait, maybe not, think about it. And inappropriate caress! And Crack Mom! It about covers it.
