I was a fan of this film, since it was a remake of the 1970s children's television series “Escape to the Night”, which, although at times was chaotic and unnatural, was definitely strange, exciting and exciting. Acting in "Paperhouse" is a wooden, unintentionally joke. Excessive imposition did not add tension, they only reinforced what I sat and looked wrong. Casting irritated the dreary dialogue, as a result of which the relationship lacked warmth, chemistry, or conviction. Since most dim films have several good supporting activities, these people must be comforted, comforted, and assured that they will not be held responsible. Of all the possible endings, the most unexpected was chosen ... lamer than I could have dreamed of. <br /> <br /> “Escape to the night” deserves a proper remake written by someone with life experience and a director with a subtle mind.
