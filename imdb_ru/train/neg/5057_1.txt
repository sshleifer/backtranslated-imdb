A very outdated film with a terrible, cliché-filled and abominable dialogue and a very bad construction. In addition, Cassavetis and Falk constantly replay. Pseudo "good movie." It does not take time to understand how disastrous this intelligent turkey is. The first scene is a thorn, filled with stories and hysterical exchanges. The sound is terrible. Camera movements without imagination, like building characters. No poetry, no fine psychology, no interesting shots. Actors smoke all the time, and we see ads for beer drinks. Very cheap indeed. (one exception: Ned Beatty’s nice and easy way to play the assassin).
