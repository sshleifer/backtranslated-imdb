“Back of Beyond” takes place at a diner / gas station in the center of the Australian desert, run by Tom MacGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a quandary when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get something that, at first glance, is embarrassingly reminiscent of the memory in which he and his sister (although their relationship with each other is better understood later in the film) rush through the desert on their motorcycle. Subsequently, he seems terribly quiet, and sometimes moody character in the presence of newcomers. <br /> <br /> We know one thing: this is one of MacGregor’s spiritual senses, his prediction of danger and such — his clairvoyance is only a little related to history, most of which concern three diamond thieves who break the car and rely on Tom to help them from the spot without disturbing them. Of course, Tom falls in love with one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly all three of them do not trust each other. But not in a way that really leads to something big mystery or action. In fact, it seems that the whole film is always striving for something significant, but in fact this is not happening. Even the ending, which sounds like a banal tale about kindling a fire (and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It may be worth a try, if you don’t do so take on a terribly slow pace, but the mood is at least a little different from the usual.
