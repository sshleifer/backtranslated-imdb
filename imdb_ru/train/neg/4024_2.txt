This movie is just awful. Poor John Savage had to go down so low to get into another movie. He plays the role of a rare vampire who helps a woman who looks like a prostitute washed and thrown out into the street who dances in a local strip club. She accidentally feels a drop of blood from another dancer, who turns out to be one of those rare vampires when they are addicted to the floor in the locker room. Savage is then appointed the short leader of this rare breed of vampires, which looks like a cross between the 80s punk rock and one of the twin purple-haired Olsen twins. This film just goes crazy with the fact that Savage knocks and dances with a dwarf with a tattooed spider on his head, also one of the rare ones. He quotes the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durant, and I just laughed. It just gets rediculas. And then the toughest special effects they could come up with is that Corrie tosses her organs and pulls them out of her mouth. And you can say this is all fake. Her son does not know what to do with his mother's new identity and becomes more like a pest than an object of serenity. I enjoy a good vampire movie, believe me, but I just hated this one. Even the photo stinks and becomes clouded when the camera switches in this way, and it tries to make it look like the vampires are moving fast so the camera keeps up and then the camera gets brighter in the scene when Savage stalks Corrie's son around until he blinds herself. Avoid this!
