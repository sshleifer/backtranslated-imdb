The film is as fascinating as watching the sun. Sheriff Pataki is a complete, mentally retarded person who has nothing to do but sit on his thick back, releasing a ring of smoke from his magnificent cigars and drinking alcohol while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicolas Cage sucking all this so-called “Blood”, which actually looked like a “fruit punch”. <br /> <br /> Most of all, the plot seemed very terrible, even if you call this piece of shit a movie. The rest of the characters in this film are a waste of time, the ending was terrible, the outlines were cheesy, and the scenes were terrible. What else should I tell you, the viewers? I would advise you to shoot yourself from rabies if you have already watched the movie. This film can give you foam in your mouth if you have not received your latest shots.
