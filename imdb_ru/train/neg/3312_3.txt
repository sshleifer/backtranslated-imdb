... but I regret seeing it. Because IMDb ratings are relatively high (and they should have been relatively high on Netflix), I believe I put him in the queue because he is advertised as a tender comedy from the UK, a category that released many films that I liked very much. “Saving Grace,” on the other hand, falls into the category of no-laugh comedies, usually populated by Hollywood films created and filmed by the mediocre. Brenda Bletin is a capable actress, and I liked her in other films. The concept - a gardener who grows marijuana to overcome the poverty she faces after her husband dies - does not insult me. Despite the strenuous efforts on the part of the actors to create humor, the film does not stand up to criticism (it might be funnier to fall on the ass), as far as my wife and I were concerned. Be careful, oh, gentle reader, not all unusual British comedies have worked. It is nonsense.
