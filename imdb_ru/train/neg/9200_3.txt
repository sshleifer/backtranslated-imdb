Someone wonders how the script came about. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other artists do their job, but since this is not a comedy, not a romantic thriller or something else, this is all pretty frustrating. <br /> It feels as if one of the streams was continued, it could be something worthwhile. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see a real turkey from a story made shortly before the United States began to participate directly in the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics was somehow connected with an attempt to make a film for every taste, but in the end it turned out that nobody likes. <br /> <br /> However, it has historical value.
