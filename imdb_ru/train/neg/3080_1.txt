Hee hee hee This film is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it sucks. I remember the day when I first saw it on MST. The sun was shining, looked like a good day. then I saw this product of Rick Sloan, which consisted of horrible plush dolls that wreak havoc on the trashy festival grounds of the 80s. Kevin, an eccentric wuzi, is trying to impress his girlfriend, manages the work of a security guard assistant, struggles with a rake and many more things in this very poorly made series of images. The plot or story is not needed. Obviously, no game is needed, as the film proves. An army guy and his sex-obsessed girl will make you jump off a cliff, and a stupid friend who enjoys phone sex will make you say: “He has nice red shorts” Plus, I really hated the old guard and wanted him to have an accident in his supermarket trolley. Just when you think it's over, wait for the Club Scum scene. Ask about Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I advise that after watching this film, a good month to restore feelings and sanity. And if you see Rick Sloan, give him a good blow to the groin to show how much we appreciate this spinal call, called Hobgoblins.
