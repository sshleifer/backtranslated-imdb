Geez! This is one of those films that, in your opinion, you have previously watched, but did not. I mean, you are not crap, but for some reason it occurred to you. <br /> <br /> To be honest and short; this is one of the worst, boring and stupid slashers ever created. I canâ€™t say anything good about this shit, because there are barely decent sequences that could be said to be done by professional directors. <br /> <br /> Death scenes are terrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot for some reason is good given the fact that he copied Popcorn since 1991. <br /> <br /> What's worse, it's not as bad a movie as a good one. This is just bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried her best, but that was not enough.
