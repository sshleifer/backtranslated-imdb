Rosie spent a lot of time on television, talking about secretly, as if they had a very strong influence on the dynamics of the modern Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that there were Africans and Spaniards and she knows it. What is killing me is that she stands on the screen, resembling a certain fair-haired black chick (with a clearly black dad, cousins ​​and aunt), pretending to really recognize the true essence of what makes them modern Puerto Ricans, but hardly referred to as Africans influenced the way Spanish is spoken, food and music. She is so typical and I have lost much respect for her and will no longer support her. In addition, since she wants to dance around her African descent, she does not need to play more roles associated with blackness (that is, Lackawanna Blues). Next time we can find a proud black Latina (thanks to Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa De Souza). <br /> <br /> The Puerto Rican, who said they were Africans, not “black.” ...thank you. We, the “blacks,” of course, have nothing to do with “you,” so love is not lost. But since you are probably in the States and benefited from the civil rights movement, we would like you to give up any decent treatment you received through blood, sweat and tears from the backs of the “black” with whom you share nothing. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, we Puerto Ricans terrible image in the media, but we negros, do not waste time trying to show respect to you, because we know that the media loves to exploit the low point and the behavior of all minorities support meaningless generalizations. However, you obviously got into the hype that you are some kind of white or excellent ... you are not. In addition, you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is the BEST ... again, you are wrong and you need to take a leave from the hood. Try visiting Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, North Carolina. Believe me, none of these blacks want to claim your "culture."
