This film starts pretty badly with female attachment and psychological torture. This is the complete nudity of males, the dead parts of animals, dogs lick their nipples, the female loses control of the bladder. Everything is shot in gray cold color. Effective, but too much. Then we proceed to inspect the youth of the BTK murderer, as well as the present and his history of crimes. Tension is purely psychological in nature, and the scenes of a murderer entering the houses of his victims and talking to them last for quite a long time and terribly. Here we do not see fancy or good images, they look as if they were taken by your home camera. It does not look terrible, but in a sense, seeing a criminal as a criminal involves their victims for quite a long time before killing them, it is rather unusual and frightening. What is not in this film is no drama. From time to time there are scenes with the participation of the police, but there is no excitement that they find the killer. There is not much arc in this story. It could be an effective psychological thriller, the study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real shots of slaughter. It is scattered throughout the film and appears again and again. Sometimes you do not know what will happen, and you do not have enough time to look away. And this I must refuse. I am for low-budget horror films, but I do not tolerate the suffering of animals. It was unnecessary, excessive and comes without warning. I'm glad that Lionsgate is releasing things that no one else does, but they had to skip this film or edit the blood of animals. Stay away from this trash.
