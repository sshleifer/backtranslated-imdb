At least, with a teenager-geek get films about girls, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40-year-old Virgo, he is replaced by a 40-year-old boy who is popular among women, but somehow remains a virgin. But then you should not engage your brain in this film, or did I miss a bit about being in a coma for 20 years? <br /> <br /> One of a series of films in which 40 people behave like teenagers and women for some reason consider this an attractive enough quality for them to want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has created such excellent television comedies seems to believe that it must rely on coarse and superficial characters to laugh. They shot all the movies. They made it seem as if all Americans had a mental age of 15 years. Where will they go next? <br /> <br /> This film is rude and rude entertainment, and nothing can recommend it.
