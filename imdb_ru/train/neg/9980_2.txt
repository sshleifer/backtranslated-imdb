Do not spend 90 minutes of your time on "Fast food, fast women." This annoyingly episodic scenario with three storylines connected together is ridiculously bad due to predictable writing, terrifying play, and even bad music. I found that the main character of anorexia is distressed to watch every time she was on the screen. She needs fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend the 90 minutes you devote to this turkey to do something more exciting ... for example, toenails. You would have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can help in this film is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much more than this tired script. She is as powerless as the older boy she plays in the film. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION!
