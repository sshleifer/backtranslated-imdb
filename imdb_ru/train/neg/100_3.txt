OK, this is not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I could sit and watch it TWICE! The storyline was pretty awful, and during the first part of the first short story I wondered what the hell I was looking at, but at the same time it was so awful that I liked it cheap, laughs all the time. <br /> <br /> And Jbidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this film, the only thing that let him down was halfway there, he stopped calling his stupid name. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was pretty perfect, but if you are after a cheap laugh and you see it in the pound of land, go past it.
