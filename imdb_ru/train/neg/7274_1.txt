"National Lampoon Gos to the Movies" (1981), simply put, the worst movie ever made is much worse than even the inept Plan 9 from space. <br /> <br /> A film about Lamoun is told in three segments, each, presumably, a parody of the usual movie genre, but each lands at our feet with a disgusting bang. These executable vignettes have no meaning or reason, and no noticeable plot lines. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good moments of the film are nude scenes. True, Mrs. Hansel and Dusenberry erupt a little bit of flesh, and it is very nice. But the directors don't seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing like this. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments - the last one, which involves Robbie Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as a young, passionate cop working in tandem with the cynical oldtimer played by Widmark. And for a moment, those of us who are still watching this disgusting cinematic exercise are inspired by the idea that we are going to see a redemptive story of how a young, idealistic policeman brings a cleansing change in the old-timers approach to police work. But there is no such luck. As we have said, this film does not have redemptive values. This is sickening until the final disappearance - which, on the contrary, stretches longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently, the filmmakers knew that they had bad deeds, and wanted to extract a minimum from this.
