"The Curse of Frankenstein" faithfully adheres to the story of Mary Shelley for one word in the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were any good. The tragedy of the creature destroying the Frankenstein family has been completely removed and replaced ... with nothing. The heart and moral center of the story disappeared. It does not help that this Frankenstein is a cunning, insidious killer; he deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a small Frankenstein cliche checklist. Even taken on its own, it is rubbish: a soft, rambling film showing a shit-looking creature with a pudding bowl hairstyle. Since this is the first of the Hammer horror films filmed by Terrence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in horror history is safe. But that shit.
