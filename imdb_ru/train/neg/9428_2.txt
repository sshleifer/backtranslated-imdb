I usually do not take the time to comment that few people will read, few people will see films. However, in this case, I feel that I must warn all those who might think about wasting time on it. I just finished watching it just five minutes ago. Simply put, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The game is terrible, the plot is missing, and production values ​​at best are the level of poverty. I know that even a low-budget movie may be great, but not this one. There is only one thing that could save this film for the purposes of any horror fan - more blood on the screen and sharp blows! A total of three times this happens off-screen. Although this is effective and rather alarming when this happens, especially in the final scene, this is simply not enough. The film is too long, because its minimum content, too heavy dialogue and, therefore, it is almost impossible to see. What goes? In short, the three teenage rooms are irresponsible and deliberately set out on a journey through an isolated area, where more than 20 girls had been abducted and killed earlier. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to the old boring house, where three crazy people live, one of whom is a psychotic killer. All three are ultimately killed, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow rubbish. As I said, the only thing worth seeing at least once is murder. Please do not buy it or rent it just for this, and do not be fooled, as I was a deceptive description of box and film art. Save your money and your time.
