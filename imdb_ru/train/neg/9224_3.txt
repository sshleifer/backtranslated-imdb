Style, but not substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as we would like. <br /> <br /> This is another genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking. The young director is hired to complete a fantastic science fiction film from the 60s called Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davis is a longing director. He is not a hacker, he is an artist. The film he wants to make is the diary of his life. Unlikely original. <br /> <br /> All characters outside of director Jeremy Davis are as thin as rice paper. Characters that may be interesting, such as his father, his twin, or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack director, are introduced, and then show the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This film is full of sweet eyes, but when compared to other films about filmmakers, such as “Stardust” or “8 1/2”, it fades in comparison. These films are fun, provocative with well-developed characters. There are lessons in these films that apply outside of <br /> <br /> The film wants to be comical and curious, but it’s just a derivative, and there isn’t any funny scene in it. The filmmakers describe it as a joke, but what is the satirical goal? The actors say it is a tribute, but I think I would prefer the full-length version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly surprised by the setting, as can be seen from the science fiction film's visual humor. to the cinema. But he cannot explain why we should be surprised. <br /> <br /> Outside of a science fiction movie, it's just a mess. There are continuity errors, the director chooses a science fiction weapon after it has already been selected. What? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene where the director is faced with critics complaining about the lack of history, the lack of a point, the scene in which he admits an empty mind, does not mean that he addressed these criticisms. <br /> <br /> I think if your Roman Coppola will be able to make a film about a passionate idealist filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and doesn't say anything in the end. In this sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> I would watch it at Circuit City on a wall full of TVs, if I had a choice. Watch the 15-minute films codenamed Dragonfly on a DVD and send them back.
