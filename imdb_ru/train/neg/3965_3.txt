I think I agree that many of the comments here should be fake. Even if the film is not necessarily bad, it is definitely below average. “Dark Remains” is, in essence, a ghost film with the premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions chasing you. The film begins with two plots that are not related to each other. The couple loses their child, who was found in bed. They move to a country house to escape from their past and guess that ... in this house often happens. From this point on, Dark Remains starts very slowly, with some really scary moments (the first ghost appearances are good, and the flashlight sequence also works very well). Well, then ... A woman sees the ghost of her daughter, other ghosts of people killed in accidents or suicides, a man tries to solve the mystery of past homes, a woman gets depressed, strange neighbors appear. It pretty much everything was there, but the premise of being their own emotions is good, so you wait for the twist. There is no turning around, you are just confused by the story of haunted houses, a strange neighbor, a completely pointless creepy prison and abandoned dead daughter with a photo-idea that reminds me of “Shutter”. The end is ridiculous, because when you start and end such a slow film, and with piano music it becomes rather bad to include several scraps of zombie-like ghosts at once, of course, just to return to slow stimulation and piano music. <br /> <br /> In short ... Dark Remains could be a pretty scary ghostly story if the script did not try to spread everywhere and did not come anywhere. Too many stories are put together, but nothing comes out of the meaning and contradiction in the main atmosphere of the film. And besides ... please never use abandoned prisons again. It's so exhausted, and in this case it doesn't even make any sense at all. "Hey, there is this terrible prison uphill, let's shoot there." I think many of the ingredients in Dark Remains have been added to this mix.
