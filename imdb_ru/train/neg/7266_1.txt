... and yet, as we were told, one more hour and 20 minutes remained. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why was there no editor who would tell the writer / director something to take pictures of? , trim? Obviously, the author / director had previously made shorts; in short, that would be good. But the lack of dialogue begins to rub after twenty minutes. The absence of a large number of musical highlights. Background noises (conversations, traffic and especially the ubiquitous helicopter) very quickly grow old. But the worst failure in history. For the short there is a little precious. <br /> <br /> An hour later, we saw again and again variations of the same scene. I almost screamed on the screen: “We understood, we understood !!!!!” It's amazing that after it left the theater, we could go home, watch the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, get ready for bed and know that the audience was still trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to indulge your vision. You have to give the audience enough to share your vision.
