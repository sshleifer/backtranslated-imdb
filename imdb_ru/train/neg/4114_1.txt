There are some great philosophical questions. What is the meaning of life? What happens when we die? AND WHY DO THEY MAKE FILMS ON THIS BAD ??? The premise is absurd. Acting is one-dimensional. Special effects overdone. And this film is one of the endless skirmishes among some of the most disgusting shots of Hollywood. But then, if they were good shots, everyone would be dead in the first five minutes, and there would be no film. It is a pity that it did not happen. Being tempted to turn it off several times, I stuck with it to see how bad it could become. Glad I did, because (SPOILER?) The last line is the crowning folly of the whole silly, gloomy script. He is not even worthy of the status of the second function at third speed in the offseason. In addition to the general horror of the film, I am deeply concerned about its influence on the youth audience. Americans, like this, start shit, and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is truly a banal movie on the Brobding scale!
