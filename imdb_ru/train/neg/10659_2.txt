Filmography: Great, good camera angles (I donâ€™t remember having seen a movie lately, with good close-ups, before that). One could avoid horrible scenes with a soft camera. New York is well depicted. I especially liked the inverted corners (another touch). <br /> <br /> Music: not impressive. Songs are not remembered even after watching a movie. Maybe I was expecting the same quality as the Annian. Disappointment <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal must slowly move away from rigid sequences of actions. His age and belly really appear. In addition, he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward. It was very embarrassing to see a mature / elderly star still trying to play like scenes with 20 heroes. Love can be expressed at any age; when we get older, you can still beautifully express love at a distance (without touching the woman too much. For example, love expressed by Radzhinikantom in chandrmuhi). <br /> <br /> Jotika just appears for the namesake in the movie. Not sure why she took it. Well, that's not my problem, I think. <br /> <br /> Others have just a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I expected Gautham to surpass (or pick up) others. the film "Kakka Kakka". He disappointed me. The release of the film took a lot of time due to various problems. He slips in several scenes. Even unexpected things were stolen from a famous director. <br /> <br /> Overall: just a good movie. Too much graphics. DEFINITELY not for children (and adults who are expecting some kind of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thank you
