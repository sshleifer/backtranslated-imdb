I know that nobody cares, but I do. This film is historical for one reason. This is the unity of two characters from two great science fiction films of the seventies. Well, one is cool and the other is pretty bad. The great is really great, in fact it is the best. The bad is really bad, in fact it is the worst. Of course, I mean the great Star Wars, and this is the star of Mark Hamill, also known as Luke Skywalker, who is the hero of this film about a child who was hit hard by Wetta, and then he went to Vegas (on a leash ) after a series of adventures, ultimately recovering. (Since he is engaged in car repair, I think you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way, he meets a golden-hearted prostitute and eventually runs into a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the seventies sci-fi film "Laserblast", about which, as I said, the worst sci-fi film ever made. Milford plays the lead role of the villain from whom Hamill must steal his car. I understand that no one cares about this meeting of two great science fiction heroes, but I do care. And I also have to say that this is one of the best / worst films of all time. Mark Hamill is needed for acting, the plot requires extensive Jedi training, and the character of a prostitute played by Annie Potts can be the most annoying character of all time in any movie I've ever seen. But this is a fun movie to watch on weekends or on weekdays, late at night, very late. This is one of those films that wander, looking for something, but not quite finding it, and at the same time, at the same time, his whole goal, like free form jazz, is simply to exist as it is. And it is. And that is not so good, but you cannot say that it is not interesting, because within an hour and a half you may feel detached, but you will not feel deceived. So turn off your mind, relax, and enjoy this tangled stone without any expectation, and may power be with you forever.
