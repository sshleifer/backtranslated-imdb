I saw this movie last weekend, and it is stupid and meaningless. Does an ancient curse turn a person into a mummy in pajamas? The victims are scared to death and cannot escape from the slow moving old man. They throw their torches and tremble, instead of trying to drive it away or burn it. Quentin, nicknamed Mr. Fabersh from “Newlyweds,” is married to Dianne Brewster nicknamed Miss Canfield from “Leave it to the glory of Beaver,” who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the actors simply follow each other in the tombs and wait for the shouts to react and run towards them to help. Egyptian girl looks good, but not really attached to the film. Where is the mummy? In fact, the curse is unleashed. This in no way sets the Universal Mummy films on fire. Watch this movie if you need to sleep, because you will dispense.
