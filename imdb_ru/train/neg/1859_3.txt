Boy, this movie fooled me. Honestly, I thought it would be a terrible horror movie, in which there is absolutely no humor, man, I had a cold shoulder then. This film was, and I am truthful, damn good. It was not at all scary, but the courtesy and cunning humor really drove this interesting film crazy. For some horrible acts and murders, the cliches were so painful to watch, that I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I liked it. All the killings are vaguely associated with winter sports and Christmas, which made things more intriguing. The viewing angle of the POV camera was awesome. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident with a chemical truck during transportation to prison. He later resurrected in the same chemical with snow ingrown into the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. Then he, like a snowman, takes revenge on the policeman who condemned him. <br /> <br /> This movie had such a bad game, with the exception of Christopher Allport, that is funny. I will say that I am also very disappointed that this film was not a horror, but in fact a dismal sitcom. They had a great story with a good storyline, but it wasn’t executed correctly. In general, I like the movie at first, but now it’s really annoying. But this film is much better and darker than the sequel.
