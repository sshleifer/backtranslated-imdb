Some of these viewers comments are ridiculous. Doesn't it hurt to look with your significant friend? I apologized to my boyfriend the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly strange. <br /> <br /> Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were unsuitable for this, especially due to the fact that Vanessa made this ridiculous brash American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same awkward girl with wavy lips, as she was in my so-called life. She has not pushed herself in any way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was the only redemptive part of this film, she was on the screen for five minutes, and, I swear to God, she reached for the screen of the film and hit me at night. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, it was a well-made film, it was very beautiful, the setting was interestingly dressed, which made it easier for me to feel the boredom. <br /> <br /> I don’t know, it’s just quite a pity when a film with the participation of “The greatest actresses of our time” is so terrible. He probably had some noticeable mistakes when editing, and the main character (Ann) was a huge jerk. I was glad she died. But this is because I felt bad because of Leela, Ann's girlfriend, mainly because these two ladies were the best actors and made me feel a little sympathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Bad work, evening movie. You are not entertained and not even forced to think. I really hope that the book was better, so she did not waste even more people's time. 3/10
