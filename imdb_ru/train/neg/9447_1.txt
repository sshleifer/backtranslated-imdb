I can easily watch most movies, even if I don’t really like the movie. I am the person who recognizes great movies, even if I don’t like the genre. This is the first film that I could not watch. The cat in the hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The game is in order (Myers is good as a cat, it just IS REALLY annoying). The silly songs that the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience. The plot stretches and continues, and the audience must suffer because of poor dialogue. Witty parental comments are disgusting, not funny (I remember some horrible comment that a garden hoe is compared to the type of people people call ho). Although the film is really short, it seemed to last forever. . Do not waste time. I know little kids who hated this movie. If children cannot bear this, I do not know how adults can. I would like to talk more about this film, but I don’t even want to spend more time writing this review. I hated it! So in the end, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! Watch a GOOD movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I've ever given.
