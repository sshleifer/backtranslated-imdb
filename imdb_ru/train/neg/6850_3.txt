As a girl, Hinako moved from her small village to Tokyo, leaving behind her two best friends, Fumia and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised to find that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She is reunited with Fumia, and they are horrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously resurrected through the island of Shikoku. Oh, man. I rented it because I like Asian horror, and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a great actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be “fruit”. This film is stupid, boring, poorly filmed, unimaginable and, most importantly, not scary. Kuriyama has a minimal screening time as the resurrected Sayori, and her heroine is given little work.
