Even in a bad movie there is usually some kind of redemption function, something you can say, yes, it was terrible, but there was that performance, or part of the script, or this special effect, it was just terrible in everything. The action was ridiculous, the script was terrible, supplemented by a multitude of inexplicable breakfasts as recommended by Tiffany, and even the special effects were crappy at best. It was a very bad movie, and the one that even wanted Drew Barrymore was erased from the story. Look, if you want: a) to endure the sharp pain caused to yourself. b) See how bad a movie can be. This is one film in which I can use the cliché “I will never return ninety minutes in my life” with some excuse!
