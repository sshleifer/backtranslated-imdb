This is not a very good movie, but not ugly. This is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so remove it at your own peril and risk. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend and I found out this movie (we think), so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** BASIC SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> Firstly, this film is actually quite simple after you remove the whole messy trash state of the unconscious sleep state (95% of the film.) <br /> <Ignoring the trash, the following REALLY happened: once a group of school friends went to a rave at night . They leave and get into a car accident, where everyone except Cassie and Sean die. This is a simple trimmed version. (Right, said Sean, be patient.) Immediately after the accident, Cassie is in the hospital, stuck between life and death right up to the very end of the movie. Here begins part of the dream. <br /> <br /> The film is called “Survivors of the Soul,” right? After the accident, Cassie's mind and soul interact with other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 eccentrics and Jude) along with the images created by her mind (Sean, the school and everything else around her). Souls continue to do what they define as: Annie, a stray chick, two freaks-killers (from the opening scene), father Jude, still helping people, etc. a long trip, a lot of pictures (many of which are my GF and I still can not connect), but it all comes down to the fact that this is not the time of Cassie's death. <br /> <br /> At the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is again a reality. She is fine. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds a bit of zest, trying to confuse us again, showing a small fragment of her sleep in a strangled wheelchair. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to the lack of space, we didn’t cover every little thing, but feel free to Email us if you wish. <br /> <br />
