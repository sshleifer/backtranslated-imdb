What an insult for the film industry SA! I have seen the best films of SA. The comments I read about Hijack Stories, that they are worth ten out of ten, are pretty scary. The film rating should not depend on ..., "Oh, a film from a developing country. LET'S DEVELOP THEIR INDUSTRY, SAYING WHAT YOU NEED ABOUT YOUR WORK, EVEN THAT IS BAD" We have the experience to make good films. Do not judge the film industry about what people say about what they think about how good Hijack Stories are. We can tell such wonderful stories as “Cry to the Beloved Country” and “Shaka Zulu”. Crying on your beloved Country, which I will give 9 out of 10. Darryl's gorgeous directing, a great game of two great older actors, no matter where they are. Hijack Stories .., I will give 1 out of 10. These can only be people involved in the project who would give him high points. I would do the same if it were my movie.
