Ah, WINTER KILLED, based on the novel by Richard Condon, which refers to the conspiracy that killed the US president 20 years ago. I knew that Condon also wrote a “MANCHUR CANDIDATE” on a similar topic, and was looking forward to the emergence of an intellectual thriller. <br /> <br /> Winter Kills left me cold. This is not a thriller - this is a piece of useless shit, perhaps the worst movie I have seen this month, and boy, I saw a lot of bad movies in June. The problem lies in both the leadership and the script, and since William Richert was responsible for both, he must be fully blamed for this unfunny farce. <br /> <br /> There are two problems in this film. First, it is the way in which everything is presented in a completely unique way. It's not so OTT, like, say, something like a James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but all of this is crucial with the actors who are completely robbing their performances. This could be justified if the film had entertainment value, but it is not. As a satire, it is very stupid, so stupid that it becomes almost imperceptible. Secondly, the scenes seem to be cut so much that they become meaningless. Take, for example, the scene in which the hero is confronted by a blunt police leader named Dawson. Dawson tells the hero that he has 30 seconds of launch, after which the hero is on board the aircraft. Scenes begin and end without rhyme and without reason. <br /> <br /> A terrible movie that you have to face.
