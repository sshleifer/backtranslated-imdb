It was one of those late evenings “It's there,” I saw this stuff. Sometimes they are great. It was awful, but actually it should not be. <br /> <br /> The film had a really good cast. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallans? We are talking here about the winners of the Oscars. He had good special effects. He even had some really nice tits! And I mean beautifully shown, full breasts with a full nipple and at some point even a beaver. But this did not compensate for one missing ingredient - the story! The plot was ridiculous. I do not mean the "sun burst", but it was bad enough. These were the rest of the things — oh, such stupid and totally predictable evil things of a corporation. The man who just STANK! No amount of good acting or classy spaceships or battle scenes can get around this. <br /> <br /> I saw that the same actors were incredibly good. I have seen wonderful sci-fi movies that had tiny shots and budgets. The whole difference in writing.
