Anyone who thinks this film was not rated for his comic genius, had to smoke with two stoners in the film. This movie is NOT underrated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparison between this film and “Naked Weapon” or “Aircraft”, since the last two films are well written and fun. Class Reunion is not one of those things. The sad thing is that he had such potential (good cast, good storylines), but there are few good jokes and they are far from each other. Scenes that were supposed to be funny were more annoying than funny. Stoner guys, vampire, blind girl ... NOT FUNNY. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon made some really good films (Animal House, Vacation), but this is not one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.
