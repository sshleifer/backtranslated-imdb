I can only believe that Garzon Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant “Double Life” and the funny “Born Yesterday” and co-wrote such beautiful scripts as “Adam's Rib” and “Pat and Mike” with his wife Ruth Gordon, and then the one who wrote and / or directed such tiresome , sad nonsense, like Mother Bachelor, Some Kind Of A Nut, and this one. The actors try, but the script is so tired and cliché that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brands Vaccaro are defeated. The script descends to a nadir in a really offensive sequence, in which the character of Janssen checks the Drivas character to make sure that he is not gay. A terrible sequence, but unfortunately, one that can be easily played in the film today. “Ethnic” jokes are now completely groundless, but “fagots” are still “good, clean, family fun”.
