After the success of the (terrible) rerun of the film "Gilligan's Island" in the 1980s, a series of television films were shot, reunited in classic TV shows. Most of these films completely missed the boat, as they selected the humor that made the show so special. MUNSTERS REVENGE is one of the most disappointing because it concerns the comedic style of Laurel and Hardy, which actually was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a great comedian and an essential part of the series, is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90-minute film than in any one 30-minute episode. And since the roles of “Eddy” and “Marilyn” in this film are nothing but cameos, what was the point in making them younger and revising them? With very little rewriting, they could use Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although it was a pleasant touch to see some of Münster’s frightening relatives, I didn’t like Sid Caesar as a mad scientist Hammi, mainly because he was too many and not enough under-used Münsters (ironically, in the same year, Caesar’s old partner) in the comedy “ Imogen Coca also played an inappropriate role in the lead role in the reunion of the television film "The Return of Beverly Hillbilis"). Another strange unexplained moment at the beginning of the film is the Munster family, depicted as wax figures in the local horror museum. Why should they be there when they should be a “typical” (if not strange) American family, and not famous monsters? It was the last Münster project with the original cast in their roles, in the late 1980s there was a terrible revival of the series with a completely new cast and television film of the 1990s, in which DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick played roles in cameo. family dining room.
