The serum is about a crazy doctor who finds a serum that should cure all diseases with the power of the mind. Instead, he creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brain. The mad doctor creates zombies from corpses and has some problems. In all the actions a lot of time, and many scenes introduce you to the characters. The nephew of the mad doctor gets into a car accident, and the mad doctor tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not very good. This is a class C film with normal action, but some problems with directing and some continuity errors. This is not a big zombie action, and the effects, although adequate, are not special. You can quickly move through the slower parts and enjoy the action scenes. Beware of nudity and foul language.
