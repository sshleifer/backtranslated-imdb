A man discovers that his parents participated in a nuclear experiment in the 50s, and that now he has the power ... to break out! <br /> <br /> I was really prepared for this film, including with the director of the great Toby Hooper and with the participation of Joker Brad Duriff. Unfortunately, he did not rise above the average of the movie "a man with violent abilities." Spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise, unfortunately, it never justifies its potential and prolongs its plot too much. The special effects are good and help move the film to the final. <br /> <br /> The cast is quite good, Dourif really steals the show. <br /> <br /> Everything is around, not classic, but not the worst of its kind. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
