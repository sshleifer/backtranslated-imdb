Disgusting thriller with cliché makes a young couple explore the most famous murder sites in America, becoming partners along the way with a stupid young woman and her growling boyfriend - a real psycho. Skillful and alienated, the tone of the film alternates between inflated pseudoirony and stupid brightness. Perhaps beautifully done, but ultimately ridiculous. Brad Pitt’s job as a low-rent killer is monstrous. * from ****
