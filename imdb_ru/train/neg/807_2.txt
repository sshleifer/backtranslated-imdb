I did not expect much from this television movie. For any TBS movie with Antonio Sabato, Jr., you must set the bar lower than for a small movie. Nevertheless, he managed to disappoint, even without being a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> Each scene was in fact, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen films and television shows on the conspiracy of big business into the script, leaned back and said, "My work is done." It's all clich√©, everything is predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look as if they take it seriously (even when the plot events are ridiculous). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. See the X-Files if you're in the mood for paranoia. They handle it better. In addition, let someone know that sitting through the "Fatal error" is just like that.
