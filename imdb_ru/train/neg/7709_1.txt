Never watch this movie. <br /> <br /> He is trying to become a parody of the fantastic and thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s, but all he does is that it makes you very much want you to watch one of them, not him . . <br /> <br /> This is very lame. A fake should have some aspect that has some higher quality rating. This film has no such aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... just don't look.
