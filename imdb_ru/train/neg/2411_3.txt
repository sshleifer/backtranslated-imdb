The Hood of the Living Dead tells about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in Oklahoma, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then, one night, Rick's brother was shot dead by a gang that rode down the street and fought with him before. In desperation, Rick calls his research partner to bring in a new formula, on which they worked, that returns healthy blood cells to sick blood cells. The formula has not been tested on a person or even on a dead body, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of the formula, but nothing happens. So, Rick calls 911, and the body is taken away only to return to life and feed on human flesh. Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood turns into the area of ​​the dead. The hood of the living dead is one piece of garbage. The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil, the acting is terrible, especially with Rick's fake crying about his brother, the weapon is so fake, because every time the weapon is launched it sends sparks and the makeup is just a lame. This is only fake blood covered by the face of the actor. Zombies are also modified. They run, growl and must be shot in the heart! Zombies should only quarrel, moan and be shot in the brain! This film is so terrible that the only real good moments in this film. The hood of the living dead receives 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there, but it is only as successful as a low-budget limited festival.
