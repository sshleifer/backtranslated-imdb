I bought this movie on DVD to get the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, Mike, Crowe and Tom Servo are watching, because the movie itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story that can be followed, and a few actors who can act, there is nothing else. The film was so boring that I firmly confirmed that I would never watch it again without Tom, Crowe and Mike. As stated above, however, this was better than the film shown in the MST3K episode that preceded it; Mitchell.
