Storyline: The film, which lasts more than 4 hours, describes in some detail the events that occurred in the Kargil sector near LOC in 1999, when Pakistani intelligence officers crossed the LOC and penetrated deep into India and Indiaâ€™s revenge. To learn more about this story, I would advise readers to read the news related to Cargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: if you are looking for a story in this film, you can be sure that it is missing. LOC is a story about Clean sacrifices, patriotism, courage and a variety of bullets and Blood. The cinema where I saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the film shows Indian bravery. The audience of the film looked the same as the audience, as in the cricket match India vs Pak. <br /> <br /> Watch the film as a tribute to the memory of the victims of the army and the characteristics of real war heroes (4 deserved PVC heroes) who sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day. The film made a brilliant image of the army, which struggled with all the difficulties in harsh weather conditions. The disadvantages of the film is that it is too stretched, and the songs are very boring.
