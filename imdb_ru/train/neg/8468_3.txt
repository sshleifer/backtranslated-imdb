“They are among us” - at best, bad science fiction. Mediocre actor play gets stuck in this movie. Plot holes are numerous. Aliens who somehow came to Earth on a meteor and hide among us for more than 100 years, but they need a plastic surgeon to make them look like humans. In the alien form, they supposedly have exoskeletons (which is why they need plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and nails. The heroine’s father disappeared after the Blue Book project was closed, but was allegedly an F-16 pilot. And so on. If you want to watch a movie about the invasion of aliens, select "Invasion of the body thieves" and see how this is done correctly.
