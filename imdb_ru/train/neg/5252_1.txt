I read some comments on the Internet about this film, such as “... harder than a hostel ...”, “the camera never shows up when it becomes really cruel ...” But none of them is true. The camera never shields, because there is nothing there to screen. The same scene repeats over and over. Women lie on the table, the killer rapes women several times, the killer smashes women into pieces (you will never see this during the whole movie!). The police came and arrested him. Killer fools jury. The film is over. In Germany, we would say: "Viel Lärm um Nichts". All in all, one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
