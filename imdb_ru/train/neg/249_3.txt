This afternoon I saw this film in my English class and was surprised at how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George S. Scott was awesome like Scrooge, but the rest of the cast failed so badly. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at the silly game and repeating line: “Merry Christmas to all!” In other cases, I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the story of a rich man by Charles Dickens who does not consider Christmas to be anything but stupid. After 30 minutes, a rich guy is visited by three ghosts who still persuade him to celebrate Christmas. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand how this movie with such a bad script should have been written in five minutes can be so well appreciated. Instead, a piece of garbage, I recommend you comedy Bill Murray Scrooged. That, at least, was funny ...
