I think I’ve seen things like this before: college graduates, not realizing that it’s damn good at them, all the time complain that their lives are crap. <br /> <br /> This film is very derived from The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can do from this: they have almost the same plot. <br /> <br /> If something good came out of this snoring, it was music. That's all. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, I am not impressed ... but again, I never expected anything less. This film was shot by the same man who shot Batman and Robin; another movie that should only be watched blindfolded. <br /> <br /> Now the verdict is 1 out of 10.
