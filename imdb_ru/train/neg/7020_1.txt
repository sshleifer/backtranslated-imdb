Seeing Smother was probably the longest, not quite 90-minute period in my life. There was no laughter to be; in fact, I do not remember ever smiling. Diane Keaton was terribly unfunny, like a middle-aged hoofed dog, a powerful textbook mother, a ruthlessly annoying woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder. She is manipulative, cunning, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and, worst of all, boring. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should briefly mention other characters, but why bother? It was just a long line of movie clichés — a stupid, socially inept distant relative who is just trying to get into Industry, rude and long-suffering, but somehow still a sweet father, a meek wife who simply can’t tolerate in the end, it goes beyond controversy and humbly returns home), a herd of intact dogs who like to chew pillows while everyone is gone, etc. <br /> <br /> God, what a snore. I have never been a fan of Diane Keaton, and Smother just reminded me why. Replaying is replaying, no matter how many photos you took in your prime. Her attempts at a physical comedy were especially humiliating. What was the director thinking about? <br /> <br /> Although I love Dax Shepard and sometimes I can tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were so dull and boring that it was clear that none of the actors spat on this film. It was good, because I could not endlessly talk myself to Keaton, and sometimes Shepard’s dislike of her seemed sincere. By the end of the film I wanted to slap her. <br /> <br /> Awful.
