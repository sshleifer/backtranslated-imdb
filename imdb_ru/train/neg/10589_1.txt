Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst movie in history. No, this honor would have to turn to a film that tried to make a statement or to perform some kind of artistic feat, but failed in a pitiful or insulting manner. However, perhaps not a single film I have ever seen has tried so little and achieved such success as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This film is a science fiction / action parody that has little to recommend. Acting is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. The special effects are pitiful. In short, anyone who is even remotely associated with this film should be ashamed of himself. USA: Return makes the previous Van Damme fare seem innovative cinematic masterpieces. Some movies are so bad, they are good. Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what else to say here. I doubt that many people have considered the opportunity to watch this film, if they have not already done this, but just in case: no.
