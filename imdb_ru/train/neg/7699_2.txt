I expected a comedy, as in the films "Big Mom". Instead, the film was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and love stories. <br /> <br /> There are three plots in this film: the first is about how Madei and her foster child were brought up. The second concerns a woman who is engaged to a rich man who insults her. The third is the relationship between a single mother with two children and a single father. <br /> <br /> There is very little comedy in the film. The film also has some very distorted messages. For example, Madeya beats a foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner) to convince the child to straighten up. The child, in fact, turns around. Apparently, it is necessary to beat the children. <br /> <br /> There are stories about the rape of children (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men looking at young girls who are related to them. (The exclamation occurs during a family reunion.) The film shifts from plot to plot so that you are always out of balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? It's really nothing ... but a waste of time and money.
