Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny - this sums up this movie in one word. What nonsense was this “thing” as it can kill me if you use the word film!?!?! I hope the director, screenwriter and producer didn’t want it to turn out good, because it definitely didn’t work !!! The scientist turns his son into a hammerhead shark, and this shark kills a group of people whom the scientist invited to the island !!! Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this film so much that when I watched it, I laughed at all the serious roles because they were so banal and unprofessional .... and they couldn't make the shark more unrealistic, even though a slightly bigger budget than most low-end movies. All I have to say is to watch this movie, expecting laughter over all the bad actions and silly banal dialogue, because if you expect a good movie, you’ll be very disappointed.
