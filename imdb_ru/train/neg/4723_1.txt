First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> Anyone from the former Yugoslavia who are not extremist Serb radicals will agree with me. This film shows the Serbian side and only the Serbian side. No Serb crimes were reported. Fortunately, everyone can see that this film was made by the Serbs, so there is no neutrality. All the “professionals” who were interviewed are not professionals at all. One guy reads only a book written by some radical Serb, another - a denier of genocide, etc. <br /> <br /> Slovenes are even accused of this film. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for several days, and only because the Slovenes were lucky. There were not so many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not get to Slovenia through Croatia (after the start of the Croatian-Serbian war). Every Slovenian is outraged by all the accusations in this film. <br /> <br /> Every sensible Croat will agree with one thing: independence was too early. Perhaps all major conflicts can be avoided. However, the mention of the Second World War and some unrelated things was a truly pitiful attempt to justify everything. Imagine that the Japanese drop nuclear bombs in Seattle and Washington and say that this is justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence of the strangled YNA soldier and the killed Serb civilians near Vukovar. But you can find a record with a reporter who claims that his statements about Serb civilians near Vukovar were false. All over the internet. And the director forgot to mention the entire bombing of Vukovar YNA (now on the side of Serbia and Montenegro - and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrins) And let's not start with the Chetnik movement. In the beginning, it was just a resistance movement. But for some reason the director forgot to mention cooperation with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing and new fighting with the Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but all this is easy to verify. There are a lot of misleading things in this movie. Only a few of all the allegations are true. Every Croat is outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> I believe that I do not need to mention the denial of the genocide in Srebrenica, a genocide that has too much evidence. Imagine a film about Holocaust denial. This film is the same. And according to this film, Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the director forgot to mention that the Serbs quickly captured a small piece of Macedonian (FYROM) land. <br /> <br /> Croatian, Slovenian, Bosnian and Macedonian never entered the borders of Serbia. If you are not a Serb, and you really started to believe in some of the things in this film, know that the Serbs are carrying out some kind of propaganda that Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are in fact Serbs who have made up their story. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs will say that this film is “small” extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And the Serbian radicals are very, very pleased with this film (about 40% of Serbs vote for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my thoughts here. There is very little truth in this so-called documentary, and I advise everyone: introduce yourself before watching this movie. After that, you will only laugh at all the pitiful accusations. <br /> <br /> Watch real, neutral documentaries about the death of Yugoslavia.
