The fact that this film went all the way to the rolling stand in Norway is strange. This movie is just awful. This image quality is slightly better than that of a mobile phone, and the plot is very bad. The main character is just annoying, and the rest just sucks. Every person associated with this film should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this film gave their name is unusual. And distributors; did they even see it ?! This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Calling it a comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this film by buying or renting it.
