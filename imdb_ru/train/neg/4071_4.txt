A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man’s brother is imprisoned on charges of being an accomplice, but soon escapes. After escaping, a seemingly innocent person kidnaps three victims, and soon he involves his girlfriend in a conspiracy. If this is not so bad, the situation quickly turns into a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> There were good and bad sides to this movie. Its strongest aspect was leading actress Emily Haack. Leaving aside the fact that she is naked in a significant amount of this film, she presents herself as a worthy actress and a very strong character. I see no reason why she cannot take this experience and somehow turn it into a career. I was convinced that she was a ruthless person. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film were very bold and did not strike. Graphic nudity (in both men and women), coprophagy and extreme anal violence are not hidden. I like my horror films, which push the boundaries a little, and this one completely ignored them, happily passing to Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they achieved what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negative aspects. First, and most noticeably, this film has a very low budget, and the quality of the film shows it. I can excuse this - the plot was decent, it acted well, and in some scenes the low-quality film actually made the film more disturbing (more realistic). Therefore, I will not blame them for the fact that they have low-quality equipment. What I’ll blame them for is the use of bad choice in frames. Without a reason, I can install (except the plump movie), there are a large number of cemetery videos. I really do not know why, and I frankly began to doze off, because it was so long and pointless. <br /> <br /> I also disagree with the title. The idea was to deceive people by making them think that this film has some connection with the classic “I spit on your grave”. Now, there is a line that seems to imply that the main character is the woman’s daughter from this other film. And the themes are very poorly matched (a woman takes revenge on men). But there is no firm link, and the reason why this headline was chosen was for the video store buyer, so that he thought he would get a sequel. It was deceptive and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last serious complaint is that this conspiracy has no real meaning. Not even a bit. A woman is killed at the beginning without a reason. Prison Break finds time to kidnap people, to torture them for no reason (because they hurt his girlfriend?). The same person goes from good to evil without explaining the reasons. Similarly, a leading woman (Hark) turns an ordinary person into someone who is overly cruel and sadistic, for no reason, and against people who for the most part were only insignificant for her (a neighbor offering drugs for sex is wrong, but in no case be tortured). <br /> <br /> Don't let this title fool you or claim that the movie is incredibly shocking. Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the film is boring and makes you take a nap. If you see this in a video store or on Netflix, just keep browsing. Or rent it and we can sit back for hours. You have been warned.
