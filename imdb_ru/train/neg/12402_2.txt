I always thought that people were too cynical about these old Andy Hardy films. Several of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not those who usually prefer the pleasant to the opposite, so good films like these rarely get praise. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot protect this film. You may still have an outdated dialogue, but you can still laugh and cry because of the story. Watching this, you just shake your head and ask yourself: "How stupid can you be?" This is smarter than trite, if you know what I mean. It is so banal that I cannot understand how many people actually sit for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Andy (Mickey Rooney) is trying to get out of jam, because he is coming up with a story about how he is associated with some kind of debutant from New York, as if it were the best. People were much more conscious in the old days. You would hear the term “social climber,” as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make his life. Of course, this is complete nonsense, and today it looks even more amazing. <br /> <br /> However, the plot and the series are as innocent and pure (and half a dozen such Andy Hardy films were shot), just like you. could find. In addition, if you enjoy listening to Judy Garland sings, then this is your ticket, as she sings here a few songs and sings Andy's heart. Oh, man, I almost broke out even writing about it!
