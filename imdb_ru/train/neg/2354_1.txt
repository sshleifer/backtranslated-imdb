I don’t even want to call this thing a movie - it’s a movie that shouldn’t win a single award. The game was terrible, like silly scenarios. This is exactly the film that many people think serves the NRI audience, but actually hates abroad because of its awkwardness and overwhelming feeling of “trying” throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors who are fluent in English can hardly cope with this in front of the camera. I am sure that many readers know what I am talking about - all these symbolic English phrases added to the film, to Hindi and to regional cinema, for interesting moments. There are several Indian films in which English seems quite authentic - Cyrus has been recently. Although it’s not a great movie, it was a good one and the language didn’t seem to be “put on”. <br /> <br /> I’m ashamed that the P3 was awarded the 2005 NFA award. The only semi-pleasant parts of this rubbish were the Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Other than that, don't even waste your time on this movie.
