I saw this film two weeks ago at the “Festival of New Images in Japan” in Paris. Although I did not expect much from this, I have to say that I was disappointed, like many people in the audience ... if I wanted to summarize how I felt, I would say that I compared it to Princess Mononoke and Nausika from the beginning to the end. Of course it's stupid. But I couldn't help it. The stories are completely different, but the worlds depicted are very similar. And from this point of view, the "palm tree" definitely does not stand comparison with Miyazaki's masterpieces. Even if it’s technically good, the boredom remains ... after all, the complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to pay attention to it. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a bit harsh, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
