I read the comments that you should not watch this film if you are looking for a Shakespearean dialogue. Unfortunately, this is true, because the whole exciting dialogue that this wonderful piece contains is cut out and replaced with songs. I read this play, and recently I was fortunate enough to see it performed, one of my favorite Shakespearean comedies remains in it, but this film seems to take everything that I like from me. Although the princess undoubtedly did what was prescribed to her, had no royal value, and all the girls seemed to lose the acumen of their characters — they also suffered from unreasonable cuts, which not only removed the characters from women for a rare dialogue, but tore out comments from the context - it was a bit unpleasant to hear the proclamation of the princess; “We, wise girls, are making fun of our lovers!” When there was no ridicule at all. News clips throughout the film also disrupted the course and selected many beautiful scenes, since they showed information in the scenes after them and were in modern phrasing. In conclusion, a great game, spoiled by a strange concept and unwise strikes. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What were you thinking about?
