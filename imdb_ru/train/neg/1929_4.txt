Some praised Atlantis: “The Lost Empire” as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least not for minded adults. <br /> <br /> This scenario suggests starting as a live-action movie that hit someone like crap that you can no longer sell to adults. The "triangular staff" of many old adventure films was made long before that (think "The Dirty Dozen"), but Atlantis represents one of the worst films in this tune. The characters are weak. Even the background that each participant throws out seems dull and awkward at best. MD / Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we at least did not see them before, we saw the quirks of mixing and coincidence before. The story of how one of the companions, Vinnie, played by Don Novello (father of Guido Sarducci), went all the way from flower shops to demolitions is completely unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young obsessed with Atlantis, voiced by Michael J. Fox, has some depth for him. The search for Atlantis Milo continues to search for his grandfather, who brought him up. The opening scene depicts a much younger Milo, sitting lightly on his knee when his grandfather puts on a cork helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And although the characters were thin at best, the best part about -Atlantis- was voice talent. Commander Rourke loses nothing when voiced by James Garner. Although Rourke is quite a typical military type, Garner demonstrates his ability to breathe life into characters by simply placing him. Garner's vocal performance is a high point. I am sorry to say that Leonard's "The Dying King" Nimea is no more than obligatory. In addition, Don Novello, as a demolition expert, Winnie Santorini, was also known for one or two well-made, fun lines — but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Computer animation was also well done. Background animation, that is. Character animation does nothing if it does not make flat characters more even. In addition to landscapes, buildings and vehicles nothing special to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say trite or trite. I'm not sure about that. Any serviceable site can be turned into something new with appropriate processing. Shakespeare often began with a famous story and plot, and became famous only for the fact that he applied a new layer of paint. So treatment is a thing. And -Atlantis- clearly lacking this. <br /> <br /> I cannot begin to delve into all logical spaces without the spoiler section. The plot was bad. The bridges of the plot break like a string, and the ending does not make sense. To add to this, the script and animation are spiced up with annoying carelessness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> At the very beginning, when Milo discovers that the runic or Celtic characters have been mistakenly transliterated, and the "Coast of Ireland" should read "The Coast of Iceland" , we have problems. The script writers should have known that the British perceive Eire or Eiranna as “Ireland” and completely ignore the older Latin term “Hibernia”. But more than that, they need to know about the Viking plot to call the more green island Iceland and the ice island Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making this a matter of an incorrectly transliterated “letter,” the authors are doomed to the requirement of a runic version of English and an post-Roman date in the script. Since this happens long after Atlantis was supposed to plunge into its underwater cave. And without visible clues and fewer technologies than Milo had, this inscription was less credible. <br /> <br /> Shepherd’s Journal could not be written until the destruction of Atlantis, otherwise he would not know anything about a cave or a crystal. lying "in the eyes of the king." It must have been written after the dive, but even without the technology that Milo's expedition possessed, how the hell did someone get Leviathan. So how could he know more about anything after that? And why should it be written on the Atlantic? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require writing in Atlanta. So it must be some kind of automatic letter. Since no one in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of crystalline messages to the surface. It would make more sense. But in the film it could also be explained: Milo could have the shepherd discover that this power called him all his life — appeared in a dream, etc. This needed to be studied in the film. <br /> <br /> Atlants simply do not need to understand modern languages. No one expects the native Indo-Europeans to communicate in Europe, more than the Romans understand that the tough “s” or their day became French “ch” (pronounced “sh”, no less!) <br /> <br /> The current Atlanteans were alive before the cataclysm - when, apparently, they * could * read, but now they cannot read what they used to, or control such a technique. <br /> <br /> Mass illiteracy indicates a crucial flaw in the film. ANYTHING doesn’t seem to happen to this culture. It seems he is suspended in the air until Milo can save him. Even if it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to write poems or write novels, and perhaps this is a combination of Atlantic school systems going down towards the end, and the absence of a good invention that led to the fall of Atlantis. Illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kidus can be excused for not knowing how to read or control the equipment if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity began - But EVERYTHING ** DIFFICULT ** qualifies her father for deification! ! The stupidity of Kashakim almost single-handedly wiped his people off the face of the earth. He killed a heap in a cataclysm, slowed down progress (there were not too many killed, but he watched a huge decline in culture and progress) until someone could take a crystal to kill everyone if they were not first boiled in lava, because giant robots were not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> The strike of blue electricity was supposed to destroy the image of Kashakim, when Kid tried to combine the image of his father with the circle of the great kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Milo was the only one who could read Atlantic, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book that talked about gibberish and find a page on a crystal that, as he knew, he was a crystal, and not some stylized astrological or “phase”. sun chart. <br /> <br /> If Grandpa Milo told Rourke about this, he still doesn’t explain how Rourke would have suffered if Milo read it as part of the book. Tearing out a page — which was ears in Rourke’s hand, although Milo apparently didn’t find any signs of a torn page in the book — just to warn the viewer that “something was not quite right.” If the word "crystal" would not have alarmed Milo that someone would try to steal it, Milo would not have suspected anything. This is just a hunch with a dull omen. <br /> <br /> The team’s “double cross” was not a change of character. We learned that Vinnie, Sweet, Audrey and Cookies walked with Rourke from the very beginning. However, the "change of heart" is not successful. It was a change, and it had to be motivated better. It is difficult to do with characters who were given nothing to begin with. <br /> <br /> A bit like that lava flows through the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area with which we see the sequence, It is fluid; it will not flow through the protective dome until it has filled all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> End of SCREWS! - and has no other meaning than to appease political correctness. With a renewed source of energy, Atlantis is no longer a weak force that needs babysitters. Giant guardian robots and heavenly cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they should fear us less than they could. The technology is superior to ours and, of course, the beginning of the 20th century. After all, Milo needs to teach the Atlantes to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave your small, quiet, punished culture alone, and not send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** THE END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps the plot of the “Lost World” and the setting of the beginning of the century should give me a hint that this is more of a homage to the pulp. The failures that I discovered in the film agree with this idea. But I am at a loss as to why I have to pay to see thin characters and draw holes simply because they were in many dime novels. And cellulose stories are part of “bullshit that they can no longer sell to adults,” anyway. We have become a little more sophisticated, and our flesh must grow. The Raiders of the Lost Ark did not lose the sensation of the pulp and avoided so much harm. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is enjoyable, but as I think about the plot, it seeps lower and lower.
