Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this at this very moment, and I find this film terrible. A quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: “They do all this for a man!?” <br /> <br /> I find that these women have no tension, no sense of struggle between tragedy and identity, and for these men hardly worth fighting. During the dance scene where Zhang Ji Yi wins them, men look more stupid than admired. <br /> <br /> The Japanese are much more energetic than the Chinese, and the geisha is Japanese culture. I am sure that the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not coincide with the main ones. <br /> <br /> In any case, the dialogue is so mysterious, so American. If Europeans did this with Eastern Europeans, they would have done much better. <br /> <br /> I have to add: it seems that most people who liked the film are Americans. Sorry, but not surprising. Everything is written for you, not instinctively, not passionately. I think Chinese actresses are great, but I can't say that they were good actors in this film. Yes, the cinematography is gorgeous, but in fact I don’t see how you can see that these characters are complex, deep people. <br /> <br /> I am going to Japan to see the real thing. I am sure it would be great to see.
