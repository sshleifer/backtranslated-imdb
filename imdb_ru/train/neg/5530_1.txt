Of the many problems associated with this film, the worst is continuity; and many years ago, by re-editing it on VHS for a college cable channel, I tried to figure out exactly what went wrong. It seems that what happened was that they actually created a much longer film and then shot it for standard theater viewing. How much longer? to fill all the holes in the plot, like ours, it takes about three hours of narration and character development - especially considering the fact that the film we have is very slow and takes itself very seriously. <br /> <br /> This is staggering; What could the Halperins try to achieve here? Their previous film “White Zombie” was a successful attempt at low-budget duplication of early films about monsters from Universal Studios (“The Mummy”, “Dracula”, etc.), and, as such, stuck pretty close to the mythology of the zombies known in North America from popular magazines. <br /> <br /> The uprising of zombies, on the contrary, seems to have been intended as a kind of allegory for the politics of modern war. This not only explains the discovery and transformation of Dean Jagger’s character into a megalomaniac, but also explains why zombies actually do little in the film, except that they are idle, look frightening and are waiting for orders - they are just allegorical soldiers, not cannibals- the undead we all love and hate in zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I am equal to anyone in my dislike of modern war and its politics - but I think that the film should first be interesting, and then, perhaps, informative. And definitely - a film about zombies should be about zombies. <br /> <br /> Indeed one of the strangest films in the history of Hollywood, but not one that I can recommend, even for historical value.
