Dude, I really wanted these shows. I long for good television and applaud TNT for providing these “opportunities.” But, unfortunately, I'm in the minority, I think, when it comes to the cinematic Stephen King. No matter how brilliant King’s work is, the irony is that it simply does not broadcast well on a screen, large or small. With few exceptions (very few), King’s experience cannot be filmed with the same effect as the stories when reading. Many people would disagree with this, but I’m sure that, deep down, they have to admit that the best shot of King is just a faint memory of what they read. The reason is simple. The average story of the king takes place in the minds of the characters in this story. He gives us a glimpse of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes broken or unrealistic points of view. In short, King sends the reader to where the Panavision camera cannot be installed. As the audience watches the filmed King, we have less than half the information to which the reader does not have access. It’s not so hard to say that Odin becomes a character in the King’s story that they read, while Odin confines himself to petty voyeurism of the same character when shooting. As King writes, Hollywood will try to shoot everything that comes out of its word processor, regardless of whether they should. I do not blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and diligence to make the elusive adaptation of Stephen King that works. The task is akin to turning lead into gold or some mystical mastery of Zen. Well, good luck next time.
