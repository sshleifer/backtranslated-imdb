I saw an early screening of this film in New York, and I, along with my friends and almost the entire audience, were greatly disappointed. The film was not so bad, it was good; it was as lifeless as a snake bite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired of all this, and the snake effect was lame. It reminded me of one of those funny SciFi movies, except that the fun of this movie was not funny or even obscene. It all seemed worn, flat and obviously formal. I am shocked to say that I really think Anaconda was more fun. It is easy to understand that SOAP understands that it is a piece of s * it and plays with it, but the film is not able to realize a scenario that has some frightening expectations. This is the worst kind of lame film: it is bleak.
