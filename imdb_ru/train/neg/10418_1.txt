THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S FILM !!! <br /> <br /> This film is like a “bad acid trip” for children under 5 years old. Within a month, my 4-year-old child from time to time asked "Why did this rabbit bleed from his mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?". (And this was not the worst). We stopped him in about half an hour, but the damage was done. Severely painful, oppressive, cruel. Fortunately, he finally forgot about all this. Whoever decides that this film should be sold to children should be blamed. ... (Let's blame me, my conscience is clear).
