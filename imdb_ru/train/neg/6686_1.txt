There is not the slightest entertainment in this film. There is not a single scary, funny or even interesting scene in this film. He advertises himself as horror, then continues to call himself a comedy. This is not even an attempt at humor. Nor is he trying to be scary. <br /> <br /> In order not to miss this movie, you need to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth. If you like this movie, even a little bit than you do not have a standard for what you are looking at all. It is very difficult for me to understand what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with this. This is not funny, not scary, not shocking and not intriguing. So it had to be a drama? Because it really was not dramatic. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and donâ€™t watch this movie. Life is too precious to spend 90 minutes on it.
