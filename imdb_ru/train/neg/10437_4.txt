A delightfully strange, though despicable comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through a Houston Astrodome. Guided by Robert Altman, quasi-medicine with eccentric characters is so overloaded with strange characters that it begins to squeak at an early stage from the weight. Some of the cinematography brings back memories, Shelly Duval - debuts in her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every inch at the glamorous pussy as Bad Court looks at the “mother bird” (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explain this the role of her!). In the lead, Bud Cort - once again, after "Harold and Maud" - the real original; Without being distracted, like, say, Michael J. Pollard, Court manages to be disgusting, stupid and harmless, tough action that needs to be carried out. Unfortunately, this is one of the Altman misfires. He can put together an cast and showpiece like no other, but let him inflate with some kind of deceptive inspiration, and he goes down. ** from ****
