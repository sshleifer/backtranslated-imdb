1st viewing 12/26/2008 - (director Yevgeny Levy): mysterious comedic murder with a very small amount of laughter. The film seems to be based on an earlier Italian film according to the captions, but was rewritten by two quite popular American authors of the romantic comedy. But this Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers do not cut it compared to their other efforts. This story is about a couple of disadvantaged Americans who are played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stumbled upon a lost dog and hope to make a whole fortune at the expense of seeing a newspaper advertisement about a return of a dachshund. Trying to return it, they see a hand sticking out of the garage door in the residence of the lady, who, in their opinion, is attached to the remaining dead body of the woman who must give them money. They go crazy and instead of messing with the police and telling them the truth, which they see as fleeing from the scene, expecting to be set up for murder. Other characters in the film meet up on the train before and hang about the gambling resort of Monte Carlo, doing various things to get involved in the story. Other actors include actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepard, George Hamilton and others. After the police find out about death, they begin to question the main characters and, of course, they have to work through their stupid lies to find out what really happened. None of the characters mentioned earlier can bring this film out of its mediocre state, despite some funny moments, mostly provided by the Belushi / Shepard pair. This is not a terrible movie, it's just not so good. There are a lot of regular movies, and this is just another heap. Try it, maybe you will like it, maybe you will not like it.
