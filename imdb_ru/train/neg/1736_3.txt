Let me first say that I really liked Betty Grable, especially from Down Argentina, but by the time she got around this catastrophe, she also had a “circle” and, frankly, the whole movie was embarrassing. Narrated by Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been pretty desperate), the story was bad, the colors are good, and the film is too long. It contained some old reserves, such as Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner, who tried to stimulate interest, but without success. The musical accompaniment was terrible, and I must say that not a single tune was memorable in any way ... because I was such a Miss Grable fan, I would always like me to never see this song!
