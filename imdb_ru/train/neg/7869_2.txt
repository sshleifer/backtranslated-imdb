The corridors of time. The film that you can see if you are looking for a difficult way to suicide. Some use guns, ropes or gas, but do you want to ruin your brain? Do not wait anymore! The corridors of time are probably one of the biggest mistakes: the thinking of Christian Clavier is capable of acting and giving you pleasure. I do not miss the 45 francs that this poor fellow cost me: sometimes I have to reinstall the rating system, looking at the absolute zero. This film deserves 2/10, but this is only because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also plays a major role in Ronin. I think I won't like him ...
