In 1934, Shirley Temple starred in three major films and really began to earn a name for herself. Unfortunately, the studio had to experiment to see what the public liked most about it. Two of these things sang and danced. The other was a short, interesting film that caught the attention of people and distracted them from the Depression. You know the other clues to Shirley's successful films. <br /> <br /> None of the above was in this film, despite the stellar presence of Gary Cooper and Carol Lombard and a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many talkative parts that are just boring, and too many disputes between the sullen Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you didnâ€™t work out the normal good mood that the public wants. I think they learned after this movie.
