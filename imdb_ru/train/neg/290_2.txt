Killer Tomatoes films have a special kind of humor - you either love it or hate it. I personally like it, but in this fourth film the feeling disappeared. Tomatoes are not like that, jokes are not convincing, even the actors are not so funny Because this is the only thing that should be in films of this kind - funny. <br /> <br /> So now follow the plot, mocking you, annoying. They really shouldn't have done the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
