Let's make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically contains everything that happens in the show! Well, if this idea does not intrigue you, what should not be done, stay away from the ring master. I had the displeasure to see it in the theater and actually be able to sit in this mess of the film. I think Jerry Springer doesn’t play himself, as seen from the cheap details for his show (yes, it looks even cheaper than Jerry Springer’s real show), and he is known only as Jerry in the film. The plot (if you can call it that) about the daughter, while living with the mother decides to start sleeping with the life of the mother in the guy. Thus, the brilliant idea of ​​the mother - to call on the show Jerry Springer, as well as chat with her daughter's boyfriend. (Is it a coincidence that they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile, somewhere else in America, a woman finds her cheater with a friend in bed. So, of course, call the American therapist Jerry Springer! I would talk about the rest of the film, but even the thought of the film now gives me a headache. Jamie Pressley, who plays a daughter, looks completely unattractive in the film. And remember, Michael Dudikoff, master karate with ass from the American ninja series? Well, look at him now, like white drunk trash. The fact is that he really looks too awful and out of shape to call it "contact with your character." But if your idea is to have fun, then you will see Jerry Springer singing a country-style song about his own show or guys who are familiar with transvestites ... well ... JUST SEE THE SHOW INSTEAD! ... at least Steve was smart enough to stay away from this movie.
