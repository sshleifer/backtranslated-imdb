Much of "Above Her Dead Body" is so painfully unfunny that I actually wriggled in my chair due to embarrassment for the actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves that she cannot carry the film in this terrible comedy novel, and further that she doesn’t even have a comedy time. She is annoying and annoying as a ghost who returns to Earth to prevent the culinary psychic from meeting her widower fiancé. Paul Rudd plays the role of the groom, stupid and charming, while Lake Bell plays the psychic, bringing all his anemic energy to the film. I felt very sorry for Bella, as she seems to have some comic abilities and worked overtime for the material to work. Unfortunately, she is faced with the insurmountable task of creating any film in which Jason Biggs tolerates, and she is fascinated by other actors like Leo DiCaprio at the end of Titanic. <br /> <br /> “Over her dead body” actually kicked me out because of his laziness and complete lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that could not be funded, because huge amounts of money are being sent to a pacifier like this one. Seriously, Hollywood thinks such films are good enough? How stupid do they really think the public is going to the movies? <br /> <br /> Rating: F
