It started badly, it got worse, and by the time the girl attacked the old woman at the end, I literally wanted to take the DVD to the person to whom we borrowed it and strangle it with C ** T to death. Avoid this movie, a bit of good cinema and some nude shots would be almost acceptable if I was 14 years old and I didnâ€™t see Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If someone feels the need to watch this movie, I strongly recommend that you spend the time in a more appropriate way. As an example, I would say that trying to squeeze a Lego house in the ass without lubrication would be a good start. I heard that this film was not the original version, I would really like to see the original, as it seems that this stripped down version is devoid of the whole plot and, apparently, most of the nudity, can anyone please say how I can in connection with Christian Viel, he owes me an hour of my life to return!
