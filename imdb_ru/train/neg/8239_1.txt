This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. I just have no idea how someone has the courage to put it on release. <br /> <br /> Production standards are terrible. There are no complaints in cinematography. Camera work, scripts, acting and sound are incredibly rude. I think there is a conspiracy, but this could have been done in 10 minutes, saving us time to watch it. The hysterical neurotic girls in the center of this play are not credible. <br /> <br /> I urge everyone to avoid wasting time and money on this title. This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
