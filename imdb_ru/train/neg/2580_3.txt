well, it's official. they just killed an american pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this and the others were terrible. I mean, the story of the two college fraternities that fight with each other for their homes, I mean, let's talk about a weak conspiracy, the first three were about maturity, change and marriage, which are worthy points of human development. <br /> <br /> The new “Stifler” is the biggest joke, I know that it’s hard to try to compare yourself with Steven Stifler, but not with a cigar. I give this movie 3 because there are 2-3 funny episodes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this film is, of course, Jim's dad, I don’t know why he continues to make poorly designed films.
