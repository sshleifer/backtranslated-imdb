Ah, the film about sex and blood. It is a pity that they no longer do this (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turned out to be like this, itâ€™s not so bad. <br /> <br /> The film basically consists of two beautiful vampires who pick up "Jones" on a country road and take them home to their castle, have crazy sex with them, and then eat them (except for the first victim they keep for no particular reason). The situation becomes more complicated when a woman who is hiking with her husband gets too curious about the mysterious women she continues to see. It gets really awful from here. In the end, the two vampires are so thirsty for blood that they eat everything in sight, and they manage to save their captive victim. Unfortunately, so much for this secret existence. <br /> <br /> The fact that two vampires don't mind taking off their clothes and fooling around with each other is the only thing in this movie. Otherwise, it is a bloody, tangled mess (why is their grave so far from their castle?), Observed only for a scant few minutes of a vampire's game. The only thing I got from this film are two useful tips: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and do not lift prostitutes along a country road; they are probably vampires. Other than that, it really wasn't worth my time.
