Well ... unlike other previously written comments, I have to say that the only good thing about this film is that one guy in it looks like Jason Donavon, who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how he won any awards, and although I’m sure that I’ve put a lot of effort into doing this, it was all fruitless, because the final result is one that shouts about the foreign serials of the early 90s. The plot did not exist, the cinematography was hopeless, and the game was at the level of the performance level. It was, unfortunately, long, and the plots were incredibly unreal ... for example ... if your best friend had slept with your ex-boyfriend for 6 years after just 2 weeks of parting, you would not be the best friend. It was all a fantasy. It's all! Oh, yes, and the strange indie house from the 90s was just overwhelming!
