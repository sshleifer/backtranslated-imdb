Wow, that could be such a good movie. The beginning of the film with Brittany Daniels, I think it's great that we will go back, but nothing, the film will start anew with the filming of a child. This film would probably be better if it were not for acting. I mean, acting skills were mostly terrible. Although the strings faced by poor actors, I think they did everything they could. But it really messed up my movie. some acting skills .. The film pulls into the supposedly shocking conclusion .. In general, I saw the worst low-budget films, but considering that it was a hype with 8 films to die because I was very disappointed .. By the way, there were some reviewers they say that there was blood and all that. I saw the same movie .. Well, this is 4 of eight, and so far only one has been good ..
