Nacho Libre (2006) <br /> <br /> Director: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Starring Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Hector Jimenez and Darius Rose <br /> <br /> MPAA rating: PG-13 (for some rude actions and rude humor, including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Tell me what you want about this (I know some people who despise it without end) But I always thought that “Napoleon Dynamite” was a funny movie - not the brightest brick on the wall, but nonetheless a funny movie. Jack Black is also a very funny person - sometimes annoying, and he strongly overestimates the youth audience, who practically worships him, but funny. Rarely was Jack Black's comedy, which I disliked to some extent. So, I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of Napoleon Dynamite, and Jack Black come together for a film about a Spanish monk who becomes a fighter to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed too thin. Unfortunately, my only reservation was the failure of the entire film. This conspiracy, if it were made as a parody of some sort of show like “Saturday Night Live” or maybe even “Mad TV”, would work flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot is too narrow for about an hour and a half, and this comedy with one joke collapses. <br /> <br /> Nacho grew up in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling detached from the whole monastery, Nacho (Black), now a monastery cook, decides to follow his dream to become a professional wrestler. Since the finances of the monastery reached a record low, Nacho decides to join the wrestling tournament to win prize money and provide good food for the shelter of the monastery. This story sounds so cute and thoughtful. Looks like the perfect movie for Jack Black. See what he did with the “School of Rock” after all. Well, to my displeasure, this story is almost completely destroyed by offensive and rude humor that just takes the gist of the film. This is again a Hollywood way of showing that they feel that teenage audiences will only understand joking jokes and stupid humor - of course, as far as I know, maybe this is a common thought of teenagers, as many seem to enjoy this film. Watching a fussy woman running across the floor like a mouse would surely make people laugh, but don't expect to get a reward for putting her in your movie. A seven-year-old child can make the same joke. <br /> <br /> The performances in "Nacho Libre" are really good. Jack Black once again proves that he is absolutely funny and that he can make even the most idiotic, useless lines of comics ever printed on paper. Unfortunately, this film was simply not enough for him. This did not allow him to continue, and the only reason his jokes worked was because of him. I have never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that she is not only talented enough, but is also one of the most beautiful women who have ever decorated my eyesight. She just pressed the role, and it worked wonderfully. Hector Jimenez, who plays Nacho's clumsy partner, Eskeleto, was constantly laughing. He did an excellent job, and it was very effective when he was a partner with Jack Black. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did not have many lines, but what can I say, I just enjoyed it. He was adorable. The rest of the actors did their job. Unfortunately, they were wasted on such a film below par. <br /> <br /> Nacho Libre is simply not working. His plot is too stretched. The heart of all this is tainted by moronic humor and disgusting jokes that simply do not work. I rarely laughed, and if so, it’s because of Jack Black or another cast member. And that brings me to the bright side of Nacho Libre: yes, the cast. This cast was just ... well, for lack of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together, and invested as much life as possible into a flat script. After Jared Hesse's "Napoleon's Dynamite" completely entertained me throughout the entire film, I was surprised that I often get bored with Nacho Libre. Something is lost here, and I still do not understand what it was. All I know is that Nacho Libre is not a very good movie, and yet, because of its composition, it is absolutely useless. There is a small reason to look, at least to see how Jack Black works. But, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie like the plague. I like black, but I ended up with this film and with this review. <br /> <br /> Final thought: Yikes! This is a surprisingly disappointing continuation of Jared Hess in his hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite." <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: 4/10 (C +)
