Before this release, Neil Labut had something to say about the original 1973: “It's amazing how many people say that this is their favorite soundtrack. I like it, come on! You may not like the new one, but if this is your favorite soundtrack I don't know if I want you to like my movie. <br /> <br /> Neil, the word. You might want to sit for it too; as Lord Summersl says, the blows are much better absorbed when the knees are bent. You see, Neal, in the original there is that the soundtrack of Paul Giovanni is one of the most famous things in it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. Along with Richard, Danny Thompson and Bert Jansch, he practically marked the beginning of the People’s New Wave of the 1970s. To undermine this is akin to Jaw's imagination without John Williams. Or the story of Buddy Holly without Buddy Holly. The result is one of the most exciting and meaningless remakes of British cult classics from the time of Sly Stallone's “Tricks”. <br /> <br /> The original apparently left Nicholas Cage "alarmed for about two weeks." During this two-week window, he was so agitated that he put forward the idea of ​​rethinking one of the most nuanced films about interfaith struggle ever created for a writer-director, previously known for his completely awkward images of male chauvinism. It looks like some kind of living room: what would you get if Sam Peckepe took Bambi? Or Gaspar "Irreversible" Noah remade Love, really? (Actually, I would really like to see it). Unfortunately, someone took this game in the cabin seriously: all LaButu managed was to wrest the original from the inside, burdening him with his insane Sex War hobbies. <br /> <br /> Unable to save a little girl and her mother from a car accident Cage turns into a medicinal stupor. He then receives a letter from the former bride Willow Woodward (she exchanges for praise for fame), who now lives in the private island community of Summersisle. what excess 's' means 'excess' ?? and wants Edward to help find the missing daughter, Rowan. <br /> <br /> Summersail, as it turns out, is a women-dominated joint, conceived as a refuge for oppressed women and refugees from the Salem witch trials. Here matriarchs observe the ancient paths, and few males are almost dumb breed mules. It is like a lilith fair on a large scale. Summersail's main export is honey symbolic and literal headache for Edward, because he is allergic to bees. “Beekeepers!” Cries Edward. “It seems they are everywhere on this island!” Well, that’s probably because Summersail’s main export is honey. <br /> <br /> In conducting his inquiries, Edward overhears about the upcoming May ritual called "time of death and rebirth." He discovers that the harvest of the previous year failed; almost dying from bee stings; and ultimately concludes (a conclusion that admittedly could not have been more obvious if the locals had tattooed the schedule on his palms) that Rowan would be burned alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest . He also meets the Queen of the Beehive, the sister of Summersisl (Berstyn), who has her own plans for him with the participation of the same Wicker Man: "The drone must die." <br /> <br /> First, the good news: any concerns Cage will be flying through the air from the glowing jaws of the Wicker Man at the last minute can be put to rest by a fleet of CIA black helicopters: it will fry. That's all for the good news. "This is a story whose chapters were carefully written," Burstin intones with sublime irony. Despite the fact that he retained the basic premise of the cat and mouse (and the printing house “titles”), the original was subjected to a scorched earth policy. <br /> <br /> Critical for Schaffer's original script was that his Christian copper, in accordance with the ritual that came to the island of its own accord ?? and most importantly, was a virgin; perfect sacrifice. By reducing matters to sexual, unlike religious power struggles, LaBute represents the most fragile of qualifiers for a harvest victim. By the time Cage developed, he became a bait, you honestly do not care. <br /> <br /> And Cage is one of the worst things about it; Awkward, pulling a donkey ?? a caster whose tongue seems too big for his mouth. “Damn it,” he groans after hallucinating a sunken rowan, with all the agony of a man who set his morning alarm clock half an hour earlier. Can we hope that the frequent dependence of his character on the pills led him to this state? alternately tired, then full of tidy, domineering vim. If so, then this is a beautiful image of an inconspicuous IQ, supplemented with antidepressants. If not - do not think. Like Willow, Bigan with his eyes in a saucer is just as terrible, presenting his lines, as if competing with Cage for “most indecisive” delivery. While the Burstyn is completely absent the mercury threat to convince. Who is afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /> <br /> Each element that made the original great? lovingly detailed descriptions of folk customs, brilliant score, dialogues (the magnificent Lord Summersle "You did it beautifully!" was replaced by a rather less attractive one "You did it excellently!" Wow, dude!) ?? were replaced by the wandering thriller "battle of the sexes" with a random hit with a crash. Namely, imposing women; In the end, this is the movie LaBute. The hit of Buk Cage's sister is only one of the most embarrassing episodes; impotent men will happily shout about how their hippie chicks finally got what was with them, Hyuk Hyuk. <br /> <br /> The closing cod sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of a genre cliche. At the bar, two guys run into two Summersail girls who go ashore to flirt and catch fresh martyrs. At the time of their successful selection, you half expect women to turn around and give an exaggerated wink and thumbs up in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Another thing: avid credit monitors may have noticed that films with an unusually large number of producers (up to 10) are usually not many cops. All in all, Wicker Man has 18 manufacturers.
