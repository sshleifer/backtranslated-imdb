Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film is still probably one of the worst films ever made. This caused Bruce Lee to die as a result of falling from a helicopter after hitting a ninja with a knife in the back of the neck, but this does not explain how he got on the helicopter, as he was near but not on the helicopter, which was 200 feet in the air. It just becomes absurd since something from a cheap comic strip. Maybe the idea is not so rotten, but this is not done with any degree of artistry from the point of view of making the film. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean-Claude van Dam improved the genre by adding believable stories to his films and having directors who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are much better than 90 percent of martial arts films shot in the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. “Death Game II”, in my opinion, falls into the category of unwanted movies, despite the fact that Bruce Lee is involved in it.
