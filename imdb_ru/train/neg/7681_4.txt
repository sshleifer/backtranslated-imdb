Sean, you know, I think you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can't praise you for that. Comedy is not your forte. <br /> <br /> However, it was not your fault. Some things were too complicated to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you wonder where these lines come from from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... I apologize.
