The young scientist Harry Harrison continues to research his late father in the field of limb regeneration with the help of flying paints, but his mainstream mother and her lover want to sell the serum. When he finds out, there was an accident when Harry lost his arm. So he tries the serum, and the result is a genetically abnormal hand that has a mind of its own. <br /> <br /> Oh, we have seen this oh so many times before, but that raises this very nastiness and Quite rubber stuff is the performance of the icons of the movie Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. In fact, this is not a bad film Fangoria; there are just the best ones that look like vein. “Servered Ties” simply does not have its own distinctive style. The strange nature and unpleasant splashes reminded “Re-animator”, and even the touch of a farce stuck out like something from “Evil Dead 2”. <br /> <br /> This comic story is really shocked by black humor, but it can become melodramatic and a little dry in a funny factor. Surprises really arise, especially the final result of the film. Which is well received, as I thought it might cope with something more accessible. For low-budget production, FX cosmetics may look tough and very stupid, but there are some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe. Even a brush of sexual tension simplifies the story thanks to Elki Sommer’s strictly juicy performance as a mother. Oliver Reed, in a ridiculous sense, is ruthlessly cool and he does an excellent job with this task. They both distracted insanely, as the couple you loved to hate Billy Morrisett is amazing in the chaotic work like Harry. Directed by Damon Santostefano briskly walks through the film and organizes several stylish scenes of exciting and confusing horror. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is youthful and mostly stupid nonsense, but you have to pass it on to her for some undemanding entertainment.
