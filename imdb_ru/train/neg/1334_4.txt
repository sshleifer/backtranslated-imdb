So, I finally saw the film “My Left Foot” last night, after my mother told me how amazing it is ... Day-Lewis's central performance is really wonderful and amazing, but anyone who even has minimal impact on others work should expect no less. <br /> <br /> The fatal delusion in my eyes was that I became obsessed with the proof of the normality of this person; the film decided to show it a complete and complete jerk. On the one hand, I see that this is a logical correlation; humanity always has the ability to be undesirable, and disability should not overshadow it. I just wish that impartial observers would not be so forgiving of abnormal behavior, and I suppose that circumstances automatically make him excusable. They are not Playing - this is normal, and yes, people with disabilities are playing - but they do not, because they are disabled; they do it because they are unreasonable. Physical disorder does not give you the right to throw a hiss in public, simply because someone you love refuses you. <br /> <br /> There are certain things that are unwise to do if you are disabled or are capable of -bodied. One of them is giving someone a tacit permission to load a soccer ball right in your head for the sole purpose. (Admittedly, I once saved a penalty from a star school striker with my face, but I already belonged by that time. It was not for adoption.) Participating in a bar fight is another. Enjoying the fact that your father maintains friendly relations with you only after you have proved that you can jump metaphorically through physical hoops, masochism goes too far. All these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your courage does not make them less reckless. <br /> <br /> So yes; just that you overcome obstacles to achieving great goals does not make you worthless ... Being a good person is a priority; Setting an inspiring example for people with disabilities should appear down the list.
