I got into this film as soon as it started, in the afternoon, when I was at home with a little flu - otherwise I would have missed it. It would probably be the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good performers - and thought it was worth seeing. It has been proven to some extent, but only because it is one of those terrible stories that fascinates. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan has little to recommend to her talents besides her Jane Mansfield or Loni Anderson Lono. Unfortunately, her acting skills - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson appear as Garbo or Davis for comparison. <br /> <br /> The white rat of a young nutlet, the owner's cat, the business of the young nut, the evicting owner and held back in her own home, and a handful of dofus (including the case of the young nut) ran around the biological hazard object, and an absurd conclusion. I kept on waiting for at least some element of the scene or plot that would contain at least a little bit of realism, believability, or the ability to evoke some sympathy / sympathy - but this turned out to be in vain.
