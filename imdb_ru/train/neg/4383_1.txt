Bob Hope's worst comedy (and this includes heavy competition). Hope, on an island with sailors, dreams of being in the bathroom with a geisha girl who "controls his ship." Someone, of course, sent this hacker "Hope" through the rock, as Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida participate in it, and still can not restrain laughter or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
