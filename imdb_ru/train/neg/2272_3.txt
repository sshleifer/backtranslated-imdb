I’m not a regular Springer’s viewer, but I’m watching his show briefly, and I think the show is a great sense of guilt and a good way to kill time. Naturally, I'm going to watch this movie, expecting to see “Jerry Springer uncensored.” First, Jerry appears after about twenty minutes of film work. Other hours and twenty minutes are spent on creating this pseudo-farce about trailer, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks like Hellll) is a whore from a trailer who sleeps with his stepfather (very unusual looking, drunk Michael Dudikoff, who finally leaves his action hero). Mom finds out about this case, they get into a fight, they want to take her to the “Jerry” show (that's right, not the Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African American couple. They take it to the Jerry show. Characters collide. Bla, bla, damn it! Rubbish has rarely been so HORRIBLE !!!! I wondered why the hell did Springer have millions of fans, but none of them checked his film. Well, now it is completely obvious! Whether you love him or hate him, you will hate this film! How can I explain? This is a complete mess of the movie (if this is what you call it). It's so badly edited, with scenes that just don't connect, and after a while the plot almost disappears, and it's just all over the map! Imagine a predictable soap opera turned into a comic farce. Laughs rarely. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. This is as risky as possible. Don't get me wrong, the scene is pretty risky, but if you look at the whole movie comparing it with the material on the Springer program, this catastrophic farce seems extremely sanitized. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3 (out of 10)
