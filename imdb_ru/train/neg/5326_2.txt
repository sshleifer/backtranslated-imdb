Smithereens is a useless click that simply hangs among cable channels, taking up space like a silly novel in a public library. Useless nonsense and first efforts for the mediocre director Seidelman, the film harbors a bad acting game, bad sound, poor operator work and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many of the best films never enter the market, and why unnecessary films like this one do and never disappear is one of the greatest mysteries of life. (D-)
