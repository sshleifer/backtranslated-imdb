We can say that the actors will shoot the film, but this clearly proves that this statement is incorrect. Most of the characters in this movie are missing something to hold on to. They play the role of cardboard notches that move in a predictable and uninteresting way. The story is very simple. This can be summed up in a few words, but I will hold back in case any readers want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to quickly go to those parts where Jack showed us how to be an unpleasant eater. I would say that 70% of this film is about cooking, eating or cooking. Honestly, I would not waste time looking at how Jack was chewing noisily with his mouth open. Personally, I could do without mentioning shoes and jokes that permeate the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> Aside from my personal dementia, there really wasnâ€™t anything in the film that would have been worth his time. There were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was pulling. When something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It is better not to look for this.
