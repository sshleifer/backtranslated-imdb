Surprisingly, the film does have some redemptive quality when it moves to its end. On the other hand, this film is really bad and unconvincing, with a small budget, a terribly poorly written script and everything connected with it. <br /> <br /> It’s stupid when all the money is spent on Christian circles, who never seem to get enough money to make a decent movie. I am not a religious person, so I really didn’t care, but filmmaking is a good tool to attract new audiences for churches and to attract people to interests and interests, such as reading the Bible. In this regard, these films always seem to be a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Low budget really hurts the film and leads to its fall. This makes the film ridiculous to watch with its effects, and it just gives the whole film a marching B-movie like feeling. <br /> <br /> But most of all this film harms his writing. What happens in this film just insults the intellect, and then I don’t even complain or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the film is moving is unbelievable, and people in this film do such incredible things that they are offended by the audience. <br /> <br /> I also hated the way the movie resembled the series from time to time. It seemed to me that it was just hard for them to turn it into a feature film, and they added some characters and dramatic events just to fill things up. At times I just didn't give a damn. <br /> <br /> However, it must be said that the film becomes more solid and stable towards the end, when its story becomes more focused on its essence. Nevertheless, it remains predictable, but does not allow this film to be completely destroyed, and as for films of this type, it is much worse to watch, although I do not think that this film will win any new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
