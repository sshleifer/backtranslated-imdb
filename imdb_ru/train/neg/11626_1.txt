This may be the worst show I've ever seen. In addition to the sitcom’s bad taste about Hitler, it’s just not funny and not entertaining. He is very similar to the comedy series of the 1950s in his humor in cornball and in contrived situations, but although it can be done well, as in “I love Lucy,” it is simply not funny here. I think the show was based on the novelty “Look, this is Hitler as the awkward figure of a comedy series,” but it just failed in all respects. The guy playing Hitler is so boorish that it is hard for him to go through it alone. I wonder what could make the network think that it is a good idea to transmit. I thought that America had some kind of tasteless show, but the British made us win this time. America would never have released the comedy series about Hitler, although we had this show about Desmond Pfeiffer's slave to Lincoln, The Secret Diary. Most likely, you probably will never see this show, since it was broadcast only in one episode and probably never will be released on DVD.
