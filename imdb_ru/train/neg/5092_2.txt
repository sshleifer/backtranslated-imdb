Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw the living Yuri Gagarin. He was sincere, unpretentious and kind, he was calm and looked like an educated and intelligent man. I saw a clown in this movie! The actor looks like a fool with amazed gestures and facial expressions. They made a cartoon! This Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe this film! <br /> <br /> I saw this film after such films as The Taming of Fire and Apollo 13, and after reading the books Rocket and People by Chertok and Korolev: Myths. and facts "Golovanova. I was shocked by the tedious scenario, bad game and production, as well as many inaccuracies of the" Space Race ". <br /> <br /> The film is a tedious transfer of well-known historical facts in Russia. Many interesting known facts about space projects It was not demonstrated. Some facts and details were perverted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was no longer a prisoner (released in 1944), and in 1940 he was no longer in the Kolyma prison, but in a special design office of the prison. Korolev was a designer at The prison design office did not bury dead prisoners, but Korolev worked in the film as a gravedigger after 1940 (because the jailer has shoulder straps on his shoulder straps.) IMHO, the filmmakers do not have deep knowledge about this part of the story and cannot make interesting films.
