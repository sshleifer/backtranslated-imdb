Did I miss something here? In this "adaptation" is all that was in the first novel of Brookmayr. Everything except history, laughter, black humor, political intrigue, characteristics, plot and some similarity of meaning. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from beginning to end. They mocked the plot, they had a romance between Paraplan and a policeman, and what was that, Dr. Slaughter was portrayed as a witness, and who the hell was Annette Crosby to be? /> It looks like they made a three-hour adaptation, and then reduced it to 90 minutes. (Although it seemed that 90 minutes lasted forever.) Please do not do this with any of the books of Brookmayr (especially The Land of the Blind).
