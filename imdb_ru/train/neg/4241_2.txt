Yes, Madsen's character - while talking to a woman from the TV channel - is right: LAPD is a corrupt, brutal and racist police. And this film does not change anything. Well, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even the blacks, the Christian, the martyr. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. The reality is not like that. And the most important thing for fans of action: shootouts are boring. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, then you will at least have something to do. The only moral of this movie: LAPD is good now. It no longer has bad cops. If you like non-critical, euphemistic commercials for the police and military service, watch this movie. This is the longest advertisement I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
