This film about secret government experiments with the mind and the corrupt use of citizens by secretive and vile shadow figures could be a really interesting film. But for me it failed. I will not elaborate on the rather confusing storyline, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the user comment “reluctantpopstar” gives a good description of this. <br /> <br /> But it doesn’t work for me. I found it slowly, which would be good if it were not for the fact that it has not gone away. The viewer remains in the dark about too many things to truly cope with this film - in some films it can be argued that the filmmakers intended to provoke thoughts and for this reason left things ambiguous. I do not think this is the case here. <br /> <br /> Regarding the frequent long shots of two buildings that were often mentioned by other users ... I see that they have a point of view - they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing a single one " actions". And I suspect that many viewers will be happy to have some drinks on board.
