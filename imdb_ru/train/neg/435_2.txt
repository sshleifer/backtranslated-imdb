The old intellectual says that he considers art to be in the cinema. You will get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and some other things before the 80s. To hide that he has no idea what is happening in theaters these days, he adds The Matrix. <br /> <br /> But this is not only the same lame speech about artistic creation. This speech boils down to outdated psychological platitudes: this is the ego-super-ego, anal phase, sexual failure. <br /> <br /> This is adorned with the stupid effect of Zizte being edited in the films he makes. For someone who is supposed to know a lot about films, his own, cinematically speaking: yeiks. <br /> <br /> To express this in the words of Zizek himself - I saw 5 \ - \! 7 on the screen last night or, in the words of the great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Иižek), what you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard. At no point in your rambling, rambling answer, you were not even close to everything that could be considered a rational thought. Now everyone in this room is dumber listening to her. I reward you (two) points (only) and may God have mercy on your soul.
