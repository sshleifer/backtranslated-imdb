What happened? “Doubt” had such great potential to become a brilliant film, but instead he faltered because of the oversimplified, simplified storyline, because of which I wanted to stop watching. The only thing that was in the film is the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who did not doubt the Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of her best performances, she still gave us a firm and truthful character that bloomed on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, even the brilliance of the screen legend could not save this film from appearing down the slope. From the boring beginning, which had no strength or impact - to a less than convincing end, the film was really a disappointment - especially since he provided so much potential with his ads and trailers. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot, and in the end he got a boring film that dragged on for too long, too much talk and not enough action. <br /> <br /> In addition, the other Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, he was by no means worthy of an Oscar. (Especially since they completely missed performances, such as Will Smith in "Seven Pounds"). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Looking at Amy Adams was like looking at a cardboard box — it was one-sided and simple. It would be more sensible to assign her to Razzie, since I am sure that she would win. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful presentation, but the duration of her performance made me doubt whether the Academy really had to give her a nomination. <br /> <br /> Overall, I consider “Doubt” one of the most disappointing films. 2008 It was a mess of a film with so much potential, and I do not recommend it. The only bright light in the film is Meryl Streep, which, although it gives a stunning, solid work - does not even do enough to save this film. *** / ten.
