The film tells about two stories: one is the political assassination of a call girl, the other is a political party of the highest class. The point of intersection is a public relations character played by Al Pacchino, since he is a witness to the crime and the instigator of the evening. <br /> <br /> If the script is terrible without any decent dialogues and direct emptiness In any sense of drama, the performance of Ala is remembered: how many guys can be as convincing as a strong and scary person (like the Godfather), and here, as a little servant (see also Donnie Brasco). <br /> <br /> In fact, the big young lion has become tired old. This change of ages is very touching, because it makes the audience think about old age. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is just a make-up, because he can get his energy back on the church scene. <Br /> <br /> Maybe it's good that the film is so terrible, because it lights up Al's talent!
