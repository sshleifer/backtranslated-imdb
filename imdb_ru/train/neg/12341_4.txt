Horror deception is not just a 21st century thing. Even before the series “Terrible Cinema” there were several examples of this genre, mainly in the 80s. But as the franchise said, most of these films are hit or miss. Some of them, for example, “Elvira, Lady of Darkness”, mostly rise above this, and others, like “Saturday of the 14th,” and this sequel does not give a laugh. But of all these types of films, there is one particularly big offender, and this is “Transylvania 6-5000”, a big waste of time for many reasons. Some of the sluggish humor is funny. Trite, but catch the theme of the song. A few good Transylvanian locations. <br /> <br /> Cons: Worn plot. Mostly tedious move. Most of the humor just does not cut it. Monsters give little to do and little time on the screen. I thought it was supposed to be a parody of monster movies? Lame ending, which is likely to make the audience angry. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: is it a comedy? If so, then why are the really ridiculous pieces so small and so far between them? Comedies should make us roll on the floor, not roll their eyes and yawn, craving for it to end. I can't believe Anchor Bay has released this tired trash. I admit that this is not one of the worst films ever made, but it does not cost anyone time or money, even if you are a fan of any of the actors. Instead, see the Transylvanian Twist. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
