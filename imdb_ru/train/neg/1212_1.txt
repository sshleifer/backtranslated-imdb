Overall, this film is terrible, and should never have been made. One of the problems of this film is that there is no connection with the audience and the characters, for example, if it is going to be attacked, you want to feel “Oh my God, no!”, But you don’t do that, because that there is no link that would be made to recognize the character. In the trailer it seemed that the film would be great, but there is no expectation that ever really. Maybe, maybe some kind of mystery, but it is not. "All she has is a toolbox." As it was said on the back of the DVD, you would think that this film was carefully planned and skillfully made, but it is not, the “End” was just awful, very straightforward and meaningless. The effect is either average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion, it was a waste of an hour of my life. "Special Effects" and sets were also average, nothing special. There is not much blood or bloody violence, not so much blood. This film was advertised to make it sound quite amazing, but in fact you should not even look for it, I do not recommend it to anyone unless it is easily satisfied, with a few fights and a boring story.
