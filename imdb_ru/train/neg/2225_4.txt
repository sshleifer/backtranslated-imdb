Honestly, I can't understand why this film is so appreciated here, and why Bakshi himself thought it was his best film. I am a big fan of Bakshi’s early works, in particular “Intensive Traffic” and “Wizards”, but, to be honest, “Wizards” (1977) was the last good film he shot. After that, he turned to the mainstream, starting with the devil's "Lord of the Rings", and then fighting a heavyweight with a sword and magic Frank Frazetta, for "Fire and Ice." <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is stupid, television-quality animation - I insist that it is much worse than its 70s - and while “The Wizards” had real imagination, quirkiness, great background art and underground sensitivity of adults, “Fire and Ice "Only for 14-year-old boys and has the intellectual influence of Robinson Crusoe on Mars." <br /> <br /> Yes, if you liked the books about Grief, you might like it. However, in my opinion, this was another comment on the quality of the slides after The Wizards, from whom Bakshi never recovered (although he recently did some decent television work) <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10
