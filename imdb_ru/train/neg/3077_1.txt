Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master with this film. He had the brilliance to make a film with actors who could not play. On top of that, he decided to write a script based on some unsuccessful trip with acid, which went seriously wrong. Put it together, and you get a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suckers and vacuum cleaners. This film was very painful. The pain he caused is approximately equal to the pain caused by cutting out the genitals with a spoon, and then covering the entire wound with salt and hydrochloric acid.
