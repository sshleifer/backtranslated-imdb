Uninteresting, unattractive hybrid "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it is not as good as any of these Minsk classics. This is the current sheriff Artie (Taye Diggs), who is called to investigate the almost fatal drug overdose at a prestigious university of the highest class, but in order to keep it low. While he is digging deeper, he thinks that it is much more than it seems at first glance. We follow Alicia, a girl who also overdosed in memories. In about 90 minutes, if this film had been greeted from the very beginning, he would have exhausted him. This film brings absolutely nothing new. But for now this is the only film in which Miss Swain is topless, so the score is higher only for that. <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominic Swain becomes topless (correction of the "Happy Campers" error); another topless girl <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: more men in the ass than a girl
