After I just looked FIVE IN THE EYES, I must be honest ... I just did not like it. I read so many good reviews of this film, but I just didn’t understand where these reviews came from, <br /> <br /> I have a lot of time for new filmmakers, and I’m sure the directors will succeed for themselves But the main problem was the budget that they had, the whole film used two cameras (which was fine), but they seemed really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound: all these girls shouted and shouted at the same time, everyone spoke on each other - it’s just impossible to hear what they say. <br /> <br /> A good idea is in two words: they crash into a parked car and then leave. After a while, they are being chased by a car that they are knocking down, driven by a crazy woman who wants to kill them, and she has many chances to do it! ... and on the other hand, girls have many chances to escape, but do not do it! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just went through it!
