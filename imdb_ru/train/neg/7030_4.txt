One of the cornerstones of low-end cinema is to take the well-known, classic storyline and make it a complete bastard. Ghost Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes the plotline of “The Phantom of the Opera” and takes it to the shopping center of the late 80s. However, the purpose of the "Ghost" now is to simply take revenge on those who are guilty of disfiguring his face and killing his family. Special effects provide a good laugh, especially when parts of the body begin to appear in dishes with a yogurt stand. Pauly Shore plays a small role that does not allow him to be as disgusting as one would expect, mainly because his fifteen minutes of fame on MTV have not yet come. If you're looking for some good laughter at the expense of the actors and the special effects team, mark this. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
