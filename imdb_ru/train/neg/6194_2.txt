With the title “borrowed” from Werner Herzog and the liberal assistants of Kubrick, Haneke and Noah, it is painfully clear that Thomas Clay considers himself a head taller than the usual garbage that our British cinema produces. "Robert Carmichael" (for short) positions itself as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time, apparently, a critic of the war in Iraq. The problem with realism is that the characters are so clearly unrealistic and atypical - despite the sinister imagination of the “extreme” directors, most teenagers are not addicts, violent drugs. As a critic of the war in Iraq, the film about youth violence (a talented classical musician - the subtext society has damaged this sensitive person) is so infantile that it hardly thinks of anything. There are signs of technical ability, but some reviewers exaggerate this. Like Kubrick and Nou, he does show that the desire for shock associated with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic trick of a recent film. People liked "A Clockwork Orange" and "Irreversible" because they liked rape and violence, but most of all they liked to feel cultural superiority because they liked what they most hated. Too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral director) here call it one of the most moronic films in recent years. (I am not against violence in the cinema. Although it is serious to do it - a complicated trick - people in cinemas welcomed Alex in A Clockwork Orange, which shows how Kubrick’s imaginary intention was missed for miles. Than many art directors claim.)
