* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I leaned back to be fair to this movie. I knew that starring Madonna. I knew that in cinemas it lasted a whole week. I knew he got a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect a deep and thoughtful study of class, culture and sexuality, as we received in the Italian original. The advantage of doubt lasted as much as ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna is playing the rich, pretentious, crazy Gorgon, who goes on vacation with her husband with a henpecked and frivolous friends (a brunette is as bad as Madonna, showing some really dull expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first mate of the ship, whom the Madonna's heroine likes to humiliate and deal with the mud in every scene that they have together. Why is she such a bitch to him? Just because the plot requires it, so that later, when the two of them come to an uninhabited Mediterranean island, the tables will turn over, and he will teach her a lesson. It is also inexplicable how they fall in love, despite the fact that they have nothing in common and insult each other during two thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> “Swept” is a stupid, simplified, superficial film from start to finish. Madonna gives a typically wooden representation. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna sings and dances violently at the request of Giannini, a fantastic scene with Madonna and many scenes where he slaps her and kicks her ass. Guy Ritchie does his “stylish” editing, which is funny here. The film contains some of the worst conversations I've heard in the main film over the past few years. The ending is juicy and implausible. In fact, this “Blue Lagoon” meets “Overboard” minus the nakedness of the first and the sense of humor of the second. <br /> <br /> Maybe Madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to show herself as a competent actress. Please drop it, Madge, and for us, and for you. This is not her worst movie though. This distinction still belongs to Shanghai Surprise. She has done nothing worse than this ... yet.
