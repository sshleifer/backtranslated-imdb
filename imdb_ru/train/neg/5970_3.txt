Coyote Ugly would probably be much more effective if the directors made him a guilty and exploitative film that received an R rating (with more nudity). But since the PG-13 rating is what all the studios want these days, we end up with a movie like this: a click of the PG-13 “tease” that wouldn't let go as far as it should go movie. <br /> <br /> The script is quite general, It is easy to guess which point of the plot will happen 15 minutes before this happens. The game is adequate, but the characters are so thin that nothing can be done about them. There were also many moments when it seemed that I was watching a music video, not a film. <br /> <br /> The only merit of the film is surprisingly beautiful female roles. We will see them in some very narrow and quite revealing outfits ... but due to the limitations of PG-13 only so much can be shown. There are many split and toned, billowing bodies performing some well-staged dance numbers, but there is no naked body or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (she is becoming increasingly insanely beautiful with age) also has very little time in the film. Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very simple in the eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows some genuine acting potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I could see in this film were boys before puberty who are not allowed to watch films with an R rating. This audience can learn a lot from it because of the thrill, but adults viewers will feel annoyed and deceived. <br /> <br /> Rating: film-1, women-10
