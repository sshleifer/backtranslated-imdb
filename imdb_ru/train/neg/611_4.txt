Ok, “enjoy” is a pretty relative term, but flexibility is needed when you are dealing with director James Glickenhaus “Caliber.” <br /> <br /> McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous, if not counting the militants I have ever seen, without the foul edge of the Fighter. Other reviews have commented on the suspension of disbelief regarding middle-aged heroic commandos of the film, but what about making a film in the Philippines that is set in Colombia? All extras are Filipino. In fact, the only character that looks remotely Spanish-speaking is the good old man, Viktor Argo, who was so insulted by “El President”! Oh yes, we also have Maria Conchita, Alonso replays like crazy, like a rebel leader. Tons of explosions and bodies fly everywhere in this funny froth to the glory of American imperialism.
