I don’t know if I had a problem with this film in that I couldn’t capture how films were made in the past, but I believe that this one did not miss the opportunity to use any of the fashion agreements available in the 40s to make a movie. If you have nothing to do, I advise you not to watch this movie, but to read a book or walk.
