I feel that the film has not portrayed Smith historically. The purpose of this film was to present Smith’s life in such a way that it was “convenient” for the leaders of the LDS Church, historical authenticity did not seem to cause much concern. The film was designed to become “propaganda of faith,” not Smith’s balanced view of “man.” I made a commitment to study the life of Smith and read both the work of the SPD, and neither of them works. The film, like most LDS projects, was beautifully shot and well shot. However, this was not a realistic depiction of neither the beginning of Mormonism nor the relatively short life of Smith. <br /> <br /> Considerable time was devoted to reproducing the accident Smith received when he was seven years old. Although this event was undoubtedly important in shaping his mental outlook, it seems that the main reason for including him in the film is to help create a sympathetic look at Joseph Smith. Another point in the depiction of Smith's teenage years: the film says nothing about the involvement of the Smith family in magical practices in the 1820s. Another problem is that while in the film, Joseph Smith good-naturedly participates in wrestling competitions, he does not show how he sometimes lost his temper and became cruel. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. This film was in no way historical and should be viewed as a fictional film about a person. I would not recommend watching this movie for any other purpose than entertainment.
