If you like movies that wander around with a small plot exposure, flavored with weird sex, this movie is for you. On the positive side, the lead actor / actress (novice transsexual) does have an interesting presence on the screen, but this is not enough to lay down much more than a slightly interesting film - if there is one. In fact, this film tells about three social outcasts (transsexual prostitute, male fraudster and Russian, gay immigrant), who somehow established a connection. Why not understand. We are expected that these losers are the main honest people who are able to love while they are pushing their bodies on the street. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was truly in love with her ninety sweet daddy! The filmmaker shows a hard, unpleasant side of life, wanting to be believed under us that all these seriously injured people are really quite normal to the extent that they have the top three that helps them in life. Absolutely fantastic, but unfortunately, is depicted here as a real view of life on the wild side. In general, there is no plot, there is no truth, and there is no real reason to spend a lot of time here. Unless, of course, you just do not like revel kink !!!
