I saw this film literally right after the end of the book, and perhaps it was a neutral or very stupid idea. I think it was the last one. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. The first thing I noticed was that during Winston's daily life in his work, his conversations, food in the dining room, etc. He feels free to look miserable and cast suggestive glances at people without great fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that even in small events it was almost impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY MOMENT. This is also shown in scenes on the streets of the proletarians. In the book, Winston knew that it was a huge risk to roam there, and was skeptical and scared on every trip. While in the film, he does it so often and without fear that you lose the important sense of strict observation and risk immediately. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies, including Winston hiding his diary in the wall, but a very slight change, but the question arises, what is the point? It was also the most annoying thing a director could do with a book, and that was the transformation of the characters. <br /> <br /> However, the big inaccuracies were much more alarming. First of all, one of the important parts of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on reasonable, but coarse philosophy. In the film, they skip it and immediately make them think that the government is driving Hitler through technology. Which is in a sense true when directed with his fascism, but if this is all you get from Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book. The scary thing about Big Brother is that, in a sense, there are some points in his philosophy. When O'Brien chooses Winston's mind in the Ministry of Love, he HEARS everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he is listening and moving forward in his philosophy is in fact the most creepy and intriguing. In the end, (cautiously, the spoiler in front), when Winston says that he loves Big Brother, it is terrifying that you are not sure that this caused spiritual beating and torture, or the real power of philosophy. I am by no means arguing that Big Brotherâ€™s philosophy has points that attract me, but her mind and depth make this book incredibly disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also, how can someone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in a movie? It was awful, no connection. <br /> <br /> Where was O'Brien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things the book carried was Winstans' thoughts about O'Brien BEFORE he came into contact with him. In the film, they just jump from a pistol. <br /> <br /> But this sums up why this film was a terrible adaptation: because it is impossible NOT to drop weapons and change characters in less than two hours. How could anyone have thought that this film could be watched if it lasted less than two hours? At the very least, the film takes 3 hours to capture some important moods and connections. Anything less is simply meaningless. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, and I mean that TRULY loved it, you would not approve this film, and, most likely, you already knew that you would not do it. Because the book is not readable, and this film simply proves how impossible it is to squeeze something decent into a small movie. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten
