characters on bottomless robbing. You have seen all the characters in other films, I promise. the script tries to be harsh and unpleasant, but fails. it causes some kind of hangover, meets a super-bad comedy, but the jokes go far from the left field, are completely forced, and are almost completely ignored after they are hacked. a hot chick is an old woman and has no personality, she is just a blonde of the early thirties with a few wise asses, not wearing underwear, in jokes that are less than pretty. the attraction between Molly (hot chick) and Kirk (crazy love interest) is hardly reported. The attraction is nowhere to be found, it is a completely platonic relationship, until an awkward and predictable kiss happens - a random kiss. After that, they are in a complete relationship, and this is just incredibly lame. The focus of this film is not on relationships, but on an unsuccessful attempt to make an obscene “super bad Esquire” film with a semi-attractive storyline. I could compare it with a hangover, in its forced nature. I will not go into that. I could go on, but it just makes no sense. just don't pay to watch this movie.
