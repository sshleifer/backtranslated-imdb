A week before I saw Iowa, I saw the “Confidential Art School,” in which the pretentious student makes a film and cannot decide whether he wants it to be art or forced exploitation. Iowa may be the film he made. I can see elements of much better films in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to cunning, both films had good character development and consistent storylines. Iowa. This film stumbles upon a ridiculous end. I have to admit that he had consistency. This film is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part. The actors did everything they could. Rosanna Arquette deserves the best. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why should she demonstrate this in this poop?
