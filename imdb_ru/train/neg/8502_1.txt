At first, I present an interesting film, a Spanish thriller in Madrid, which is interesting today, but this is not all, in fact, the film is interesting only to future directors, who learn what not to do when shooting a film, it can be. ‚Äù Worse, in other words, even the presence of the winning Oscar (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3 spent on watching this film, the acting is terrible, and it looks like the actors were just waiting to finish the daily movie. footage to go home, it leads nowhere and boring, weak and bad, do not waste time or money on this film.
