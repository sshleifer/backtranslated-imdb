Being an independent director and a big fan of Edward D. Wood Jr., I bought this documentary, thinking that it would finally set the record for how gifted and brilliant was Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> What I received was a disappointing, self-centered, contradictory, controversial collection of bitter self-reinforcing past events. <br /> <br /> Where do people remember Ed Wood, Jr., do people really remember the second cousin of the duct tape guy who knew someone who was on Plan 9 from space? <br /> <br /> It seems that at the very moment when interest in Edward Wood is reappearing, these people are leaving Woodâ€™s work! Only in order to deliver a cruel, energetic blow to someone who actually gave them a chance when no one else does this! After 50 years, I would advise many of these people to let go of the fact that they did not receive the $ 75 they were promised! <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative director who knew how to have fun. In fact, it was EVERYTHING for which he lived. You can giggle when you watch Ed's films, but for some reason you realize that you are laughing at him, not at him. <br /> <br /> But I was distracted ... Let's return to the film at hand. If you are expecting a film about Edward D. Wood, Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a film about naughty and bitter old actors, this film is for you!
