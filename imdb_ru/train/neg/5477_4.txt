Take the SciFi Original Movie and mix a small alternative / revisionist history, and you will get Aztec Rex. Apparently, Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had to first defeat Tyrannosaurus Rex and her assistant. This is the essence of this movie. Given the plot, it might really suck; the fact that it just kind of sucked is the cap tip for authors. There are a few problems. Let's start with the fact that Cortez plays Ian Ciring. Even with a black wig, Zering in the role of Cortes is about as convincing as Axel Rose, who plays Gandhi. And although Cortez conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to play the entire Hawaiian ensemble. Throwing aside, the T-Rex (s) look pretty good, although every time one of them shoots, it just exudes CGI. And they die too easily; I believe that if T-Rex existed in real life, he probably could have been killed, or at least wounded by some rather elementary weapon of the 16th century. But it takes something from the movie. There are also several T-Rex-swallowing-human graphic scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked well. There are many activities, and the entire angle of colonization prevails everywhere, but does not suppress the dinosaur angle, unlike the other recent SciFi Original dinosaur film Warbirds. In general, a mediocre (but decent by Scifi Original standards) film that is modestly priced 4.
