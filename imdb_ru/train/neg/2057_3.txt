Sorry that I am against it, but I thought that this film is unreal, boring and too long. I am tired of looking at the long and hard struggle of Gena Rowlands with myself and the crisis she was going through. Maybe the film has some cinematic value or was an important step for the director, but for the sake of pure entertainment value I would like to miss it.
