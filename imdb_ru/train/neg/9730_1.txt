Now I shot this movie because Brad Dourif was there. He's a great actor, great in everything ... except this movie. And I think it's only because he realized how stupid this film was, and did not worry about good performance. This film is an unintended comedy. Some lines just made me mad. And there are some lines that don't make sense, and it seems that Tobe Hooper just adds lines without thinking about the plot. Oh! By the way the plot is bad! But this is one of those films that are TAHT BAD that are actually awful to watch. I recommend this only for BIG Brad Dourif fans or other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
