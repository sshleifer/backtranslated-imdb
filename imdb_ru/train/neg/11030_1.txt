I recently watched this film at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and, frankly, it was one of the worst films I've ever watched. Don't get me wrong, there are funny and entertaining bad movies (for example, “Manos - Hands of Fate”), and then terrible bad movies. (This one falls into the last category). The cinematography was incredible, and not in a good way. It seemed that the operator deliberately kept everything out of focus (except for the occasional nipple shot), the lighting was something between “one guy runs with a light bulb” and “non-existent”. The actors were as bad as soap actors, but not as bad as porn actors, and it seemed that each line was a complete surprise to them. The only distinguishing feature was the appearance of the masked killer, a classic image a la Jason Forhes from Friday the 13th. The plot was extremely poor, and the ending is even worse. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of how a horror movie should not look like, or maybe insomnia needing a dream.
