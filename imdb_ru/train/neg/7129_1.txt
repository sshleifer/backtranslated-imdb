It will be best known for Ferrari, which crashed when Eddie Griffin was promoting. <br /> <br /> The history of racing and betting is poorly made because of the numbers that seem to have a director who could not see the numbers. By and large, the case in the shooting of the plot with a group of actors for a salary. This is not a very good film, but it is bad enough to be viewed, and as a result, the film should not be disturbed, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> Mizoginism, despite the fact that one of the main roles is a woman, is a film that was clearly made to acquaint the producer and director with pretty girls. Want proof? There are long remaining pictures of women in the dirt, which serve no other purpose than perhaps getting promoted from people too afraid to shoot porn or Sports Illustrated swimsuit DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
