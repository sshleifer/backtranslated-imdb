<br /> <br /> Okay, I shot this film while I was in bed and helped painkillers, and let me say that the film did not help. <br /> <br /> A film about a man who buys a car when he is in a midlife crisis, he loves a car more than anything else, once his wife decides to borrow a car. Since I do not want to spoil (not something to spoil anything), I will let your imagination deal with the "wicked" (and I use this word lightly) tricks that follow. <br /> <br /> I had to struggle not to fall asleep through this snoring of a minute-long sleeping movie, and I would like to say that if you go to the cinema and think about adventures, please do not need it, it's a waste of the movie, it was printed on. <br /> <br /> Then again, I could be wrong ...
