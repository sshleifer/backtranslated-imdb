I saw Arthur (TV series and books) many years ago and never loved a TV series very much (if you are a fan of this cartoon, I'm sorry if I indulge you with it, but actually this is what I think). Many liked it, but I did not like it. <br /> <br /> The heroic schoolchildren seemed to fight constantly (especially Arter and D.W.), they were pleasant to each other often, but gradually I was tired of Arthur’s mournful attitude towards everyone and his sister DW (however the name was written), and DW was ADHD (or ADD) —like Arthur’s 4-year-old sister, who is sometimes demanding (perhaps that is why Arthur is annoyed by what her routines were, such as her imaginary friend, her stuffed collection, etc. e.), Arthur's friends acted like teenagers, and not how they were in Arthur’s books, and parents, well, they didn't give a damn. <br /> <br /> The biggest animated film was Rocco's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
