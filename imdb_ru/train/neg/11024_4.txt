I first saw this film in the Soviet Union, and many erotic scenes were simply edited by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I looked at it in full. So what? The plot is incredibly unreasonable - two men are experiencing a genetic catastrophe and find themselves on a planet full of feminist strong, direct and fundamentally harsh ladies. Now men are trying to fight this, and then a whole bunch of extremely stupid cliches follow — sexual desire, constant male desire for sex, feminists who are shown as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not, but idiots are certainly not), and so Further. Even the starry Jerzy Stuhr’s performance here is wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats words like “I’m in an elevator with a naked chick and didn’t do anything with it!”. It was a comedy, instead it turned into an empty farce, filled with predictable jokes and insinuations below the belt. Do not waste your time on it - it's just bad.
