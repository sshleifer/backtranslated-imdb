I think it's nice and fashionable to see amazing things in the absolute emptiness of a movie like this. With the sometimes senseless excesses of many Hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy the scene, devoid of explosions, obscene language and banal single-row phrases. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when used correctly. However, this film is not among such cases. <br /> <br /> Take long scenes without dialogue and boring, rare landscapes. I am sure that they must be of some great importance and understanding, because the implied message is enveloped in perplexity. Acting is scanty ... boring and walking ... and shows one of the worst crying scenes in the story (at the end of the film, if you can get through to the end). The scenery is dark, and the ridiculously long line of girls walking through the desert park is as pleasant as a torn tooth. I would call it anti-climatic, but since the film did not reach any climax ... even in “erotic” scenes ... that would be wrong. I am sure that the script was used during the filming, but given the number of dialogues, I think that it could have been written on a cocktail napkin. In fact, in this film there is nothing interesting or surprising ... neither a wonderful story, nor stunning ideas, nor a visual drama, nor excitement. In addition to two or three fun moments, this film is a waste of two hours. Tragically boring and dreary movie.
