I hate this program: not only the concept itself is ridiculous, but it tries so hard to be doable (something that was missed from similar programs “I confess,” for example, “Mooder: She wrote”). <br /> <br /> Sigh. Why can't the authors be smart enough in this program to put forward evidence that could confirm and win a decision in court? <br /> <br /> C'mon: after X years, if the cases are not solved, then why does EVERY CONFIRM EVERY EPISODE * CONFESS * (damn! Damn, officer, you're smart - I think if you have revealed enough to convince yourself I did it, I can also admit it and make things easier for you in court. What can I say? An honest cop. "<br /> <br /> Absolute dog and ** insult for those of us who have enough brains to even hear about iq
