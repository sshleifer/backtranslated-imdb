This is a disgusting little production, capable of giving one nightmare, as well as headaches. This is an unsightly mix of live action and ugly animation. This is strange, but this is not the fun ride that every optimist can expect. This is a cold, inhuman, unfriendly, disgusting, even eerie kind of strange. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. In the end, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did much more attractive things with the help of stop-motion. Interestingly, this is a French production. Thus, he reinforces the stereotype that the French do not have the notion of scary.
