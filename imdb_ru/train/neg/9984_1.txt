It was Sunday evening, and I was waiting for the advertised film on TV. They said it was a comedy! The film began, 10 minutes passed, after these 30 minutes I did not laugh even once. The fact is that the film ended, and I could not even laugh. PLEASE someone tickles me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
