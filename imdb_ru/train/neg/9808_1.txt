The worst show I've ever seen. The story of a group of teenagers who, for some inexplicable reason, have supernormal abilities, and when they use a special device, they turn into strange, poorly designed suits. The action, when they are not lagging behind the seeming costumes, is decent. Definitely not good, but not the worst game I've ever seen. However, when wearing costumes, acting becomes worse and worse; much, much worse. Hyper-animated idiots have a lot of unnecessary movements that they make. Even when they speak, they look as if they have cramps. Villains are dumber than Rangers. In each episode, some weak idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the Rangers. Then he / she sends a squad of hyper-animated aliens to attack the rangers. Then the Rangers initiate a 10-hour transformation animation, and then destroy the aliens. Then, a poorly designed villain who can be either an armored villain who actually looks and acts viciously, at a humanoid creature that looks like a ladybird, with pipes attached to his back, with obvious signs of mental retardation. Rangers of force beat off the villain, then the villain turns into Godzilla, be it a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they shoot nuclear weapons at creatures, and creatures turn into giants). Powerful Rangers spend 5 minutes in super-animations and summon their Zords, which are obviously toys that the producers of the show have used special effects to make them look real. The powerful Rangers are victorious, the villain is angry, they all teach a “valuable” lesson, and the show ends. That's all. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fake kung fu fights.
