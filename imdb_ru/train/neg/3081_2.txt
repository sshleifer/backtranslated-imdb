Sadness for good! Although I still claim that “Manos: the hands of fate” are the worst possible mental torture, the Hobgoblins have come very close. This ... this ... thing insults the audience at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least, films such as Space Rebellion and War of the Future can be watched on mst3k, but this was an attempt to get through. I literally writhed on the couch in misery. This thing could confuse me - one! <br /> <br /> Even if you are a dedicated MST3K fan and have made it your mission to see each experiment, think twice about this one. <br /> <br /> This is so bad.
