This film is even a big step down from the typical Bollywood fare. The performances were terrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, completely rejects OTT as a villain. The soundtrack is also not remembered. And, despite all efforts, female guides cannot be "sexy." Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better projects, while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in a similar board, but this monster is even below its limited scope as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are terrible in poorly written clich√©s. It's time for Indra Kumar to hang his director's hat. I hope that he will never direct another eye wound that way. The future of Hindi movies is now in better hands. To summarize, stay away from celluloid waste.
