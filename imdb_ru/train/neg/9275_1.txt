Omen IV (1991) was poorly made for T.V. movie. Since the 1980s are over, I think that leaders experimented with methamphetamine (the drug of choice in the 1990s), because there is no other reason to explain this parody. Why did they even bother to do this? A t.v. movie? What were they thinking about when this one appeared on the idea board? Did they think for a second that this film would become popular. Perhaps they thought it could be done as a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This film was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They had to knock off a couple of bucks instead of releasing this “extra” disc. <br /> <br /> “Omen IV” is a regular family remake of the first movie. Instead of snotty punk, we get a scary girl who everyone likes. If the family had stronger parenting skills, none of the demonic events that happened in past films would have happened. These parents need to lower the leg and truly discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, better avoided at all costs!
