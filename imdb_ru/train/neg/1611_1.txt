I think this is a terribly filmed and uncut film. Benicio Del Toro should not act in films, he should emphasize his game and that's it. Stephen Soderberg missed the whole idea of ​​the revolution, its ideals, and most importantly the life of Che Guevara and so on. The camera is terrible, as if someone with a two-day work experience takes pictures with her, music ... I don't know ... is there any music in the film ???? I will not recommend this piece w .. to anyone. It just spends about 4 hours in front of the TV or something else ... I can't understand how someone can rate this movie for more than 3 stars. Disaster .... disaster .... disaster .... disaster Do not look, please. Save yourself from this suffering "movie"
