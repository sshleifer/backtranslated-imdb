I just watched this movie in high definition on TV. I am in a wheelchair because of a neuromuscular disorder and I like to watch several films about people with disabilities. <br /> <br /> At first I found the main character a little noble and fascinating. His message about people with disabilities and how much time he spent struggling to ensure that people with disabilities are recognized and integrated into the main labor market of society is simply superb. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a wonderful person. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very sermon he preaches that I find him offensive. <br /> <br /> First of all, they didnâ€™t play anybody in the lead role with a real physical disability. Of course, they were competent actors, but it seems quite insincere to preach about hiring people with disabilities either in the film. Even more aggravated by the fact that in one of the movie scenes in the middle of the film a man is seen walking towards the catwalk on crutches and having only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so obvious that it is shameful. What kind? They could not find a real amputee for the film? For a 5 second shot, was it more financially beneficial to do CGI effects than just hiring an ACTUAL person with an amputated limb? At that moment in the film, I found him so fraudulent and completely contradictory to the message he was trying to convey that I came here to quarrel and whine like the pathetic cripple I am. <br /> <br /> Understand this.
