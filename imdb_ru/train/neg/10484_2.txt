Being an Elvis fan, I cannot understand how this project can be accomplished. This is by far the worst Elvis film of all time, completely unfunny, stupid and with a lot of mistakes about the King. Come on, Elvis Tomb in a public park? The mention of "Suspicious minds" in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast are trying to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as a copycat), Tom Hanks' cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing the young Elvis sucks. minute. If you want to watch an ultra-cheap, insane, but absolutely funny little film associated with Elvis, I sincerely recommend you Bubba Ho-Tep instead of this mess.
