If one more Hitler ever comes, it will be partly due to stupidity similar to this film, which propagandizes the absurd idea that he was clearly crazy from the very beginning. Far from following such a person and electing him to the highest post in the country, sensible people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would have died in a ditch, nameless and unknown. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads the stories of Hitler’s close comrades — for example, the autobiography of his secretary, Traudl Junge — would be struck by the fact that people found him a kind, intelligent, generous person. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seem to be bloated and annoying modern ears ignores the times when they were made, when pompous bombast was common in political speeches. As well as exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was not the main board of the early Nazis, who were primarily anti-communist, neither unusual nor unusual for those times. In the film, everything looks as if from the very beginning Hitler pursued only the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to determine the next person who will lead to the death of tens of millions, you can ignore the reckless fighters life depicted here. Instead, look for a charming, charismatic person, whose compelling speeches inspire the whole nation, and whose political work is visibly and materially benefiting the country. I am afraid that his personality will be much more similar to the personality of Barack Obama than to Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for a lot here and only got a caricature. The fools who did this committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of Reefer Madness.
