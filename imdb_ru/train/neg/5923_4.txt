During the civil war there were many cases of divided loyalty; it is obvious that many occurred "in the border states," where the north met the south due to geography. From the border, the young father Owen Moore is sent to the Union army. Soon Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regime, roams the enemyâ€™s property, desperate for water; he finds a store where the little daughter of unionist Gladys Egan sits. When Yankee soldiers track him down, Little Gladys innocently helps the Confederation hide. Later, when he returns to kill her father, the kindness of a little girl is remembered. Sweet little story from director D.V. Griffith. The location and humanity are displayed with love. <br /> <br /> **** In the border states (13.06.10) D.V. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
