As for the romantic comedies, I often rate the quality of the film by vague looks at the end of the experience. Unfortunately, for “The Date of the Wedding,” I can appreciate the film with only 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> I apologize to the fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I don’t see any special chemistry between their two characters. The premise of the film is the reverse "Pretty Woman", where Dermot plays the role of Nick, an expensive male escort hired by the heroine Debra Kat to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. Romantic relationships presumably develop between the patron and the client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And in the relationship of Nick and Kat lacked romantic sparks. <br /> <br /> In the background, Amy Adams was Kat’s outstanding sister. Whenever Amy appeared on the screen, she served as a spark plug and a catalyst for the film’s energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams played the role of Kat, the film could be more dynamic. But, as it turned out, instead of reaching Kleenex, I was looking for Visine, trying to at least pretend that this film had some kind of sincere mood and romance.
