PLEASE FIND A MINUTE TO READ A REVIEW. I do not knock on the movie by itself - ONLY VIDEO DVD AT THIS TIME. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this film even two stars. I mean, how could this rate only 1 out of 10!?! <br /> <br /> Here’s how: an epic film adaptation of Tolstoy’s novel War and Peace with historically accurate battle scenes, courtesy of the Red Army and extremely accurate adaptation of the novel to the scene would be difficult, but it would be worth spending seven hours this is what you saw. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that you don’t see it. film - anywhere, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> I’m trying to watch the RusCiCo DVD version — widely considered the best available version since it is packaged in a mailbox and restores scenes cut from other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But this is one of the worst movie productions I've ever seen on a DVD. The picture is turbid and inconsistent, often strobing. It is almost tolerable if you adjust the brightness, color and image level to the maximum .... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also very inconsistent, incredibly loud in some parts, almost unintelligible in others. <br /> <br /> As far as languages ​​are concerned, this is a HUGE problem for native speakers of English: there are some good actors in the dubbed version, and some really terrible ones, whose performances and parts of the film are simply not duplicated at all. , casually returning to Russian and even French. <br /> <br /> The subtitle option is not much better. Subtitles do not appear under the image, but above it - hiding part of the beauty (or what is left of it) in the landscape. In addition, subtitles are often a bad translation (shame, given that the script tried its best to cut so close to the real words of Tolstoy), and the subtitles, too, just seem to fall out in parts. <br /> <br /> So even if you maximize the color, brightness and image settings, as well as turn up the volume and select the English and * subtitles, you still get a movie that is annoying to watch and listen to. <br /> <br /> Can content handle this? It might be possible, but at seven o'clock - who can stand it for so long? <br /> <br /> Maybe someday someone will come and restore it - and maybe then I will see a masterpiece - but for now I just can't give more than one star to what I could stand watching in the first 12%.
