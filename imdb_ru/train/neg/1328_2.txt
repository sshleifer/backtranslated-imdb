This is really a stupid film in this typical 80s genre: the action movie. Conceptually, he reminds of Rush Hour, but he absolutely lacks action, laughter and chemistry between the main characters of this film. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and talk show host, but he just can't act. It is terrible when it tries to act tough - it barely manages to hide a smirk from this trademark when it says one-liners, which, by the way, is not very funny. And to see how he runs (even then) is not very pleasant. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - does not give a politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even start telling me about this story. I give it 2 out of 10.
