If you like the standard tricky clicks, which include excessive action, incredible stunts (incredible here are not intended to compliment) and delayed dialogue; You'll love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stallone would have to give up in his “former” days to intelligent people and shoot a militant who would put a trustworthy hero in a trustworthy situation in which history, the setting and (plausible) actions would win, I crave actions least close enough to reality so you can imagine the fear and excitement that may arise from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its consequences made at least one scene funny. Judge Dredd is only better because you know that when you enter the theater, you’ll see a comic turned into a movie. Character, the situation and everything else is incomparable with what we can face ourselves. Cliffhanger, on the other hand, turns the mountaineering guide to Rambo before you can say, “Hey, Adrian!”
