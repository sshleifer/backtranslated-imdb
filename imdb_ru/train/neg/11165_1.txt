I mean, really ... or I suddenly lost my sense of humor, or is it just a very bad movie. This is stupid, funny and just not funny EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview, I knew that it would not be a good movie, I just did not think it would be so bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the good old days, when you could find clever funny lines in any movie? When the actors didn't have to play funny roles in trying to be funny? Now we find ourselves in such films as “Borat”, “Little Men”, “Terrible Film 4”, in which I could not find funny parts !! <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of garbage <br /> <br /> PS (Sorry for my english)
