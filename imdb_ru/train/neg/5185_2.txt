A complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a waste of time. The script and the dialogues are poorly written, the direction is weak, and the actual boundaries border Hammy. This film was clearly aimed at the Rang De Basanti crowd, but it’s far from the goal, because it doesn’t even have one of the elements that made the RDB connect with its audi_great script, a terrific game, good leadership and a powerful social message that was never preached but it was shown. <br /> <br /> Compared to this almost masterpiece, Hull Bol takes a step back, resorting to such scenes. as the hero of the leak on the Persian carpet of the villain and mentor of the hero, staring at the truck with no more bullets! All of this could have been acceptable in the 1980s, when there was a decline in the quality of films, and bad films, such as DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante, became big hits, but making films has become - should be - more subtle and thoughtful. . <br /> <Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director, and I appreciate that he wants to give social information in every film he makes, but maybe he just doesn’t know how to do it! He resorts to preaching without worrying about how the audience understands what he is trying to say. Maybe he should focus on entertainment and leave social messages to Rakeish Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with everything I say, you will agree that throughout the entire show you will think that Rank De Basanti was much better, and Mr. Santoshi should have quit the raging industry on Om Shanti Om. Industry bashing? It's right !! Santoshi depicted the industry as a place of biting, quarrels and couches, on which the hero joyfully indulges in a star with a curiosity named Sania. There are people who will think that these parts show the real face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> In general, raise your voice against such films and don’t spend your hard earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * outside ****.
