She was catapulted from 13 to 30, with magical dust, kindly provided by 13-year-old Matt, but nothing was done from this except for an inexplicable device. New York, especially Central Park, but all the other places included in the film seem to be filled with hope and easily habitable, and apart from Lucy, there is no villain in Jenna’s adult life, and even Lucy doesn’t look monstrous, just as nasty 13 -year-old teenager grew up 17 years more cunning. Chris, once fascinated by Jenna's longing, is now the driver of pork, and you have seen enough films to understand that Matt will play a major role in Jenna’s future. You do not know what can prevent this before it is finally achieved, although I am here to whisper in your ear, so to speak, that the device is not unique. In fact, this is not only a variation on the theme of “The Great” Tom Hanks, although nowhere is it so good, it is also a strictly individual version of this subset of the Cinderella story.
