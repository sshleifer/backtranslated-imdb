BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; this man is constantly throwing absolute rubbish, the irony is that he loves his shit. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a film about Ulli Lommel, but I was so surprised that everyone thought his things were so terrible. Like the films I said at the beginning are not even equal to six when stacked together! After reading the comments, I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> The situation did not end as the pathetic film began, and I quickly noticed that the sound was incredibly poorly duplicated. The game was incredibly awful and the same as in the frames from the camera. Editing is easily the worst. This film had no meaning, and I could no longer tolerate it, because it did not end, and I was in the film just 45 minutes. I couldn't take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DON'T LOOK THIS CRACKER!
