I will be brief, because I know that I do not need to talk much. <br /> <br /> “Live” is a strange little film that some people certainly like, but I found it incredibly soft almost at the very beginning. The film did very little to make any of the characters enjoyable, and the story sometimes became so confusing that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know that others liked it, but I discovered that Kitamura Live is nothing but a lame, extremely boring drama disguised as a fantastic science fiction film. I felt as though I was drawn into watching this film, based on its intriguing premise and incredibly fascinating cover. <br /> <br /> My offer? Pass it on for the much more pleasant newcomer Kitamura "Versus" or his 2004 riot "Godzilla: The Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... And don’t get me wrong, I’m always ready to make a film of a good thinking person, but this is certainly not the case. There was a time when I actually cared about a single event occurring in this overly preaching film, saturated with dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about dullness.
