I had a distinct misfortune to catch up with two of the worst films of 2004 close this morning: first the incoherent CGI-driven void of The Chronicles of Riddick, and then the awkward vanity project known as “Greyndeyl.” One costs a few million, and the other costs a penny, but both are bad. Very bad indeed. <br /> <br /> At first, I have to declare that I am not Neil Young’s biggest fan in the world, but he contributed his share of classical melodies: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Jung’s compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Vintage and Mirror Ball, the man composed some really good songs. Unfortunately, there are no good songs and very few good songs in Greendale, and the film around which they are built is a truly attractive and simplistic political slogan. Without merit as an art and not as impressive as a controversy, Greendale is best left forgotten. Buy a book if you feel the need to contribute to Young's bank account.
