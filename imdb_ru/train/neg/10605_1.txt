It was a terrible waste of my time. No plot. The game was far below the nominal, it should be used as a model in the acting classes of what should NOT be done. This is just a commercial robbery of an earlier Universal Soldier who also scratches the bottom of the active barrel. It is sad that V.D. must defend his ego every few years, and itâ€™s even sadder that people will pay good money to sit on it. Kind of awful martial arts movies. For comparison, this makes Segalla, Norris and Arnold almost talented. <br /> <br /> Maybe VD should follow Leslie Nilsson and make selections of his genre. At least then we could laugh at him, not at him.
