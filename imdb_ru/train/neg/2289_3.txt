Unfortunately, Mary Harron decided to make a fictional story about the life of Betty Page to accept her own problems with men. As usual in all her works, every large male character is portrayed as weak, awkward or perverted. To add to her fiction, she designs ideas and problems that are not true, according to Betty Page herself. Betty did not leave the business because she thought it was morally wrong or she had religious problems (although she became born again in life thanks to the influence of her third husband, the minister). She left him because she was over thirty, her acting career did not go away, and she felt that she was losing her appearance. Hints of harassment and rape cannot be refuted and refuted, according to Betty, and are attempts by the director to state that any woman who did what Betty did was to be a victim of men. Harron is unable to indicate that Betty created her own clothes in almost all of her shoots (not transferred to her by “sick” fetishists). Harron also cannot say that Bunny Yeager, who did many famous Betty photo shoots, also did a lot of "mischievous" shots with Betty and was not a morally honest professional photographer depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace - Gretchen Mol is very similar to Betty. Otherwise, there are other films and documentaries, more accurate and honest with her life and the people in it.
