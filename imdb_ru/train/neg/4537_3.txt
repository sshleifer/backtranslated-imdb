I really didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw him in the camp, and we were not thrilled, we laughed at him. Of course, some parts are touching, but the action is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole idea of ​​the film is terrible (now I know it was based on a book I didn’t read, but I hope the book was better than this because To be honest, I thought this film was very bad and boring). As I said, I went to him with a group of people from the camp, and we were excited when we were there, plus I got a caffeinated drink, but, nevertheless, I tried hard not to sleep. The only thing that supported me (apart from my fear of being embarrassed when I woke up) was gunshots, which were also completely meaningless. I just really did not like it.
