There was a lot of love in Wes Anderson's “Fantastic Mr. Fox”, unfortunately, all the love for him. Of course, a lot of time and effort was spent on creating this very self-consciously bizarre universe, but if the same time and effort were invested in the script to make it fun. It is disturbing that I think this is so, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with. <br /> <br /> Animation is good at taking close-up shots of animals, however, when the camera is farther away everything becomes really sharp on the eyes, and, to be honest, it looks a bit random. There was nothing special about acting, either: Wes chose to choose his buddies and big names for more specialized actors who could make the film better. I’m pretty sure that the George Clooney voice narration consists of two episodic episodic roles in South Park, in one of which he played a dog. <br /> <br /> The film is too smug and too complex to be smart different and, as a rule, despite the fact that the film is being shot in England, all good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, while bad guys are stereotypical english with the most offensive english accents. I can not stress how much time this film spends. I have not laughed once.
