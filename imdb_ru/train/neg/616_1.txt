Let's face it; some lame child who dies and his soul turns into a scarecrow. Yes Neva will not happen! OMFG This stupid loser who can't stand up for himself gets his ass from some drunken bastard who fucks his mom. As soon as he dies, he looks at the scarecrow and lets his spirit go into the scarecrow. Drunk guy hid his death, making her seem suicidal, and thought that he got away with it. Later we see that he is thrown out of the trailer, and then earns another collision with a stuffed animal. They had a short meeting in which the drunk called him a loser, and the scarecrow bounces off: “Know, loser!” The scarecrow comes off the building, calls him “daddy” and then beheads the poor fellow. We can see how this amazing film unfolds from this. Then he kills a lot of people. He basically kills people who get him into trouble with rl, and leaves to kill some random people, just for a laugh. Don't laugh here. He adds zest to every kill too. Every time he killed someone, he made several karate shots and ended up with one of his trademark highlights. In the case of someone with a hearing problem, he would say: "Here, the ear of corn!" Then shove it in the ass. OR we can take an example from the film! He had just finished killing a cop and was about to kill the only person who ever interceded for him. Her father, the sheriff, shouted to the madman to stop, and he said: “Hey, wait!” And threw the dagger, threw it into his chest and thrust it into some tree. At the end of the film, he killed two guys and threw in the highlight of "We must split!" and killed two guys, putting a scythe in their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want to brush my pants so badly. Maybe the next time this guy makes a movie, he won't be gay.
