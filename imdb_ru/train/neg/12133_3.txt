Dane Yousef <br /> <br /> A gang of scammers. Perfect plan. Everything goes wrong. They have problems. Police outside. They are cornered. What are they going to do now? <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> It seems like the film is trying to be a combination of an acting workshop, an "indie" of film and theater. <br /> <br /> These are things that the actors love - this is a kind of workshop or performance, because they are mainly focused on the actors who act ... act maliciously, tensely, scared, talk, Intrigue, planning - giving performers a lot of free space to really think things through. <br /> <br /> A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, came up with a big scheme of robbery. ... and a wrench thrown into the work. To top it off, there is a bit of "bending wing" and one of the crooks thrown through the back of the windshield. <br /> <br /> Police are on their tail, and they stumble upon a bar, called poetically (and religiously) “Last Chance Dino”. <br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, tries to focus on the actions of the actors and the delivery of conversations. It shows a bright, passionate red cigarette advertising with steaming and smoldering Bogart. And he really hides all the violence behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and horrendous violent scenes would give the film some advantage. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it moves too slowly and suffers from an error while watching it in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Saynez seems to be thoughtful and deeply conceived to be a spineless tag. together with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as a traditional abusive, abusive, mad policeman who is all right, but he is not given anything to really do here. <br /> <br /> William Fishter is the only actor who is credible in his role of brainless grumbling who just wants to shed blood. <br /> <br /> And fraudsters are in a tense situation when they either go to jail or try to think of a way out. this. <br /> <br /> Spacey is not able to create a lot of stress and maintain it. The characters mostly talk to each other, trying to come up with a plan ... and they should be calm and articulated. There is even a scene where scammers play pool with a whole swarm of armed policemen right outside, ready to strike. At some point, one of the crooks even calls the police, which is located right near the bar. Oh brother Oh, worry. <br /> <br /> These cops will either demolish them or lock them up. Shouldn't the hiding scammers be a little scared, a little restless? Meanwhile, all real actions take place inside. <br /> <br /> Someone grabs a pistol, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation behind the scenes, and another victim happens, which ... well, pretty sad But ... <br /> <br / > Faye Dunaway also had to spend more time with the dialect coach, improving her accent in New Orleans. Skit Ullrich is good at least. <br /> <br /> A policeman who listens in a stack of matches at the worst possible time is good. And also the scene where someone passes right through the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is obviously trying to use the approach of David Mameth, and he is so polluted, but never so realistic or insightful. <br /> <br /> The film feels too much in reality ... a really low-budget film in which the actor directs other actors for the first time behind the scenes on a script that “is not bad, but requires several more rewrites”. Spacey shows that he is not a horrible director, but he lacks the feeling for “making a movie,” and it seems that he is simply shooting an act of acting. <br /> <br /> All these actors are talented and can work with the material. , but they all feel out of place. As I said, the film really suffers from mistakes. <br /> <br /> I don’t mean that the wrong actors were chosen. I think they found the right cast, but put them in all the wrong roles. I think changing some of the roles would help a lot. <br /> <br /> Mafia veteran Joe Mantanya played the leader of the group, Gary Sineze, in the role of an angry police lieutenant outside at his mouthpiece, who gave orders and barked at his troops, who kept Fishter in his “bloodthirsty hooligan”, and Matt Dillion in as a sacrificial lamb. That would be a big improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors direct, it works. They may even win an Oscar for that. But most of the time when actors are directing, they tend to just focus on acting. Just shoot the actors. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase for that. This is an excuse. <br /> <br /> The situation with hostages in real life is almost the same as in the stories of adulthood, so it is only natural that films about them will also go from point A to point B. <br /> <br /> There are some really good recordings in this genre. 'Spacey himself appeared in a similar film about hostage situations: The Negotiator. <br /> <br /> This certainly will not become a cult classic, not to mention one of the 100 AFI. Nevertheless, he has a few pleasant moments. and personal touches, but in the end, it is instantly forgotten and that film that will look best on ordinary television. It is just not worth struggling to see. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Another Spacey directorial score was reportedly a better effort. Hmmm ... maybe that's true. You must fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> Dane Yousef
