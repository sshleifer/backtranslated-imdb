Oh god, I think this may be the only funniest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the best b-movies. The first proof is that this is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, this is too mainstream for that. I got it on VHS from the cart, where in my local video store there was a lot of rental videos. <br /> <br /> If I can quote an advertisement: “In the 17th century a samurai lived in Japan, which set the standard for centuries. His name is Mayeda. He embarks on an epic journey through the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. While in the sea, a stormy storm absorbs their precious gold, intended for buying weapons, and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must overcome all difficulties in order to survive and secure the fate of his beloved Japan. " He then says: "An epic epic adventure film worth several million dollars on three continents." <br /> <br /> I probably saw another movie. It was not an epic, and it certainly was not something multimillion. No, the Maieda Shogun is simply the crazy adventures of an English-speaking Mayeda (sho kug). He's not even a shogun, but that doesn't matter. What is important is that he makes a really cool impression of John Cleese’s repeated attack on one castle in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and on his ability to move from serious scenes to demonstrating his mental samurai skills. Awesome <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is the English accent of Sho Kosugi. The film may lack almost everything that makes a good film, but compensates for it with some of the funniest lines ever created in the coolest English accent. And honestly, do you really want anything else? You can rewind the Shoegun Mayed to the end and replay the final line of Kosugi again and again. The tape probably wears out before you get tired of this line. Awesome <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Very, very cheesy.
