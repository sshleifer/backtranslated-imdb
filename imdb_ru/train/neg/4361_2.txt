Using footage looted from Planet Dinosaurs, this video snapshot (with the exception of stolen material) relates to a group of people taken into space who land on a dinosaur planet that ... don't expect this, is really earth. His five-minute draft stretched out to 90 minutes. Slightly better than Chickboxer (another of the Bad Movie Police series) - the nostalgic feel of a home movie combined with good stolen effects, this movie is still impossible to overcome. It remains for me to ponder the question: do we become so indecisive that now we are plundering old films not only for the plot, but also for the inappropriate shots? Obviously, low-budget makers are getting so desperate that they really give us everything to take our money.
