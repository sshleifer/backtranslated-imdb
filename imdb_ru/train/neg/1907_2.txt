This terribly bad piece of trash manages to be a racist, sexist and homophobic at the same time, pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. The brutal performances, cloudless script and boring direction make this film unforgettable. The two scenes were particularly offensive - the one in which Shach cleans his tongue after a kiss by another man (perhaps it was really so rude) and the scene in which Eastwood kisses Shakh's best friend who pretends to be Russian. After he leaves the room, she exclaims "f ** king of aliens"! So much for her as a cultural artist who wants to live in Paris!?! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Shek can be a cute actor on the screen, and he is amazingly good. It is a pity that he did not know more, working with advanced gay director Gregg Araki on an earlier film, and tried to save this film from descending into a chain of gay stereotypes and the dirt of homophobia.
