Rough, sometimes rough - for me this is a summing up of the latest work of Madhur Bhandarkar - Page 3. He has no point of view - only small, amusing excavations of stereotypes. What is this movie about ?? It is about reporting a clan of people (so-called types) who are so busy communicating and developing their profiles in life - that they don’t have time for anything else. And you are either in it or out of it. Is there no press to report everyday incidents? Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper, and this is just a supplement; perhaps entertainer to check who is who and what's what. Do not mix the two. And then there is the play of power - it will happen at every step of life. So, what you said at the end of all this — nothing — just a few rude jokes put together in a different direction, not in the film.
