Why watch this movie if you have great movies to watch. It is a waste of time and money. The film is so bad that I felt bad from wanting to watch it. Everything in it is BAD. The actors were bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI ever. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in a strip club. One interesting thing is that there is a character we would like him to die because he is so stupid that we get tired of him (I don’t remember the name, but was a FRIEND of the “Chosen One”) NOTE. If you want to watch a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 stars out of 10
