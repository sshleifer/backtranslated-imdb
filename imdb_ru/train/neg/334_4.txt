Bad movie for sure. This is such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of bad special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (for example, at the airport) and a real ridiculous time. (Charles Dance) is terrible as an evil guy, and he is much better (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is not a comic joke, and I heard that this sunken one has already succeeded, a great success ?? !! I will never understand why or how ?! In one television interview I heard (Eddie Murphy), when he was nominated for an Oscar in 2007, he regretted it in a comic form !! <br /> <br /> One comment said (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, no, my friend. This is a cinematic nonsense that has made a lot of RAZZI films over the years, be it the 1980s or the 1950s! <br /> <br /> 2 reasons made me write about this movie. First, I will never forget the long, tanned, charming legs (Charlotte Lewis), especially when she lay on the bed before the bad guys attacked her house, wearing only a blue shirt and Oh, BOY, the camera was looking at her bare legs, as it should be. But how strange! How did I watch her in the next films, and she wasnâ€™t so beautiful again? !! Anyway, the second reason is that I recently found the name of this movie on my list of the worst 100 films ever! <br /> <br /> Essence: bad film, Greeeeeat legs.
