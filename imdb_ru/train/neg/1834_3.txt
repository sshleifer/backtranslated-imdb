I can't say much about this movie. I think this speaks for itself (like the current ratings here). I rented it about two years ago, and I completely regretted it. I even tried / liked it by looking at it twice, but I just could not. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever again and again. And I'm not the one who throws out the film, but I truly believe that it was awful. It was not even funny. The only bits I liked were a few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can remember when I see one of their films now is a terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also very annoying. <br /> <br /> In general, I think you understand my point. By the way, the stars for Walken.
