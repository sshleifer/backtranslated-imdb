The game is bad, ALL the jokes are superficial, and the target audience is clearly very young children, if we assume that their IQ is below average. I understand that it was intended for children, but just like Malcom in the middle, but they still give up adult humor and situations. <br /> <br /> What can we expect from the Bob Saghet show, the only comedian? existing, which is less funny than the ball, striking the groin of a person, and probably, therefore, he stopped to show the most funny home videos of America. <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let your children watch this show if you do not want to save money in college. Expose your children to stupidity, and they will grow a fool.
