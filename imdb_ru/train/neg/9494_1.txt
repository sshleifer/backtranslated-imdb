The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this film is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire very much. There was absolutely no chemistry on the leashes. For a second I could not believe that between them there was something deeper than passion. The story just doesn't ring true. Add to this stupid conversation, tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot, which in principle leads to nothing, and you get a real bitch. Kay Lenz's nude scenes can be useful for those who are looking for some obscene food, but otherwise it is a huge waste of time. When I watched the movie, I thought about what it is better to call "Cheese."
