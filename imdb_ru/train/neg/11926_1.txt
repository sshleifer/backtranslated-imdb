I rarely move to make such comments, BUT after watching most of the terrible Rankin film, I feel that I really deserve the right to say what I feel about this! in fact, I could not reach the end and became one of a half-dozen or more outlets (about 1/3 of the audience) after the mutilated plot, the woeful dialogue and offensive characteristics were too big to bear. this film is all pose and no art. all style and no substance. this is aggravated by a terrible game, a really terrible scenario, an indifferent cinema and student-made production values. how it was funded, started and ended, is a mystery to me. I bet a million pounds, he never goes to the general issue. appropriate critics will tear it apart. really bad movie. shockingly bad, really very bad effort. And this is even without mentioning the extraordinary moment of the newborn kitten, which is thrown into the brazier. completely meaningless, completely light, poorly built; This film is a terrible embarrassment for the UK.
