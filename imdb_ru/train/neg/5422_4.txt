What Noise cannot do is make us understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer cope with obsessive city noises, especially car alarms. This is a strange idea for a film, in which there are as many creative likelihoods as in Death Wish. It is smart at points; especially the scene in which our hero tries to read Hagel: “I am too stupid to understand this.” He reads and rereads the paragraph in confusion, we read it and also do not receive it. Only then did the car alarm go off. Throughout the film, there is a constant intervention of alarms and city noises. Although, in general, this does not help us much to understand our hero, who allows all this to destroy his marriage and is distracted by side stories instead of delving deeper into his person. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking itself is too forgetful to notice its own problems with sound, crappy editing and visible rumbles. No, "Noise" is not so bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the ending does not fail. In general, this leads to a logistic point, which you probably did not think about. At least I did not. Although overall, ninety minutes, it could not end earlier. The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it began. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those films that you can see at the film festival, but probably will not be selected for distribution. Check it out on DVD, if you really care about someone who participates in the project. If not, skip this.
