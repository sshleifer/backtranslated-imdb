Oh my God. It was awful. There was bad, then it was. This film has no meaning. It spreads throughout the map and is not entirely clear what it says. The music seemed like Batman. The fact that "Edison" is not a real city removes. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this film and recognizing all of these places made it unbearable. Why didn't they make it a real city? The only thing that was worthy was “Tilman”, in which John Hurd did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his part realistically, and not on top of obscenity. In fact, it was a shame to see John Hurd playing such a cool bad guy with a lot of screen time, and this film will be blurred. Very bad. I hope someone important will see this, and at least give John Hurd his due when he is trustworthy, and again hire him as the leading bad guy, which should be. in list A.
