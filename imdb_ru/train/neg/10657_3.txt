I had a lot of hope for this film, and I watched it with great anticipation; mainly because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who has forever marked his steps in the sands of time. But this film turned out to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. After watching this film, cruelty and violence in tenebrae and orange-colored look much better. <br /> <br /> The main character, Raghavan, is a very brave cop. Who is tasked with investigating violent serial killings? Raghavan effectively finds a connecting thread in this case and is close to uncovering the killings and imprisoning psycho-murderers, two mentally concerned but brilliant medical students, behind bars, but they run away and again fall into the killing life. Finally, Raghavan kills both of them, sparing many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psycho-killers are those who do not allow viewers to go to the theaters. Murder, sexual harassment and rape are shown very clearly, without which the film could survive. <br /> <br /> Even imagine that teenagers and children will watch this film in the theater, and some kind of picture that he must draw in their minds is definitely not elegant. Director Gautam must understand that he also has certain obligations to society and his audience. Of course, I will never go to the cinema, similar to the name of Gautam in the production list.
