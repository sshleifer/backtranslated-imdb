Incredibly confusing, distracting and ultimately funny thriller “Horses, my God! Sometimes it's creepy, but it has one of the worst scenarios ever written for a horror movie. Look at how, in the last 10 minutes, everyone “magically” does exactly what the plot needs for “permission”. Soft performances of leading, typically eccentric Richard Lynch. Video transmission is a real hacker job: cutting scenes in half and making the film even harder to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
