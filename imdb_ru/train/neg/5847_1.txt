I enjoy the quality of crap, and this is considered one of the best. CG is out of this world, or at least precedes our world, and the madness of a 6-foot guy in rat clothes stalking people is ridiculously bad. I liked it very much, but the acting was terribly awful, and even in the obligatory naked scene there really wasnâ€™t a drop. just a complete waste of time if i have ever seen. I do not know who has spent more time, I watch it or the poor fellows who have been delayed to do so in the weak hope that this will mark the beginning of their acting career. I can assure you, it is not. However, on a brighter note, I managed to successfully make 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this film, so I think it was almost worth watching it for 91 minutes.
