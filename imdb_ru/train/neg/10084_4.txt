This film was all right, but it certainly refutes the claim that homosexuals are “born that way”, especially when a woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and just get into the arms of another woman. It seems that Kate's gender preferences are turned on and off like a switch, which makes this film a bit simplistic. <br /> <br /> In addition, as in the case of films that are trying to advance the agenda, it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval about gays were labeled as "fanatics." And there was a happy environment. Either Kate's friends and relatives fully embraced her, or they completely avoided her. This is not typical of the interaction between gays and non-gay relatives and friends. Usually it is a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. You can love people and treat them with respect, without necessarily indulging their choice. Unfortunately, the film did not feature any of these types of interactions. For a film trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, it seemed to me a very intolerable film! Then, in the end, Kate seems to decide that after all these years, she wants to be with Mack, and all this is incredibly expensive - is this what it really means to be gay? Come on!
