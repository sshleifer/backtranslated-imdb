Well, this film, of course, had a lot of hype; From the noise at the Toronto Film Festival to scathing CBC radio reviews. A refreshing, wacky, hilarious indie film. I have been looking forward to this for months. <br /> <br /> How can this be expressed? It sucked very much. Exercise in cinematic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, it was a bit funny, and at worst it caused someone. The US script is poorly directed and poorly edited in a chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> And what kind of music was 500 dB louder than the rest of the sound track? It was the only truly strange thing about this. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny, strange film with the participation of aliens, then try “Repoman”. There is no comparison!
