I am amazed by some reviews of this film. The only place that seems to be telling the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The plot is extremely lazy. This is also not scary. People who think that because she plays Sarah Michelle Geller, it seems The Grudge should forget about it. This film is more like Dark Water, except that it is even more predictable and slower than he. I was extremely disappointed with this film. It did not scare me and did not interest. Let's face it, this type of conspiracy was beaten to death at this stage, for example. dead trying to connect with the living - Dragonfly, What lies beneath them, Ghost story, Dark water, Darkness, Changeling, etc. It seems to me that only Japanese and Koreans are currently writing original horror films. Such films that come out of Hollywood are a cynical exercise in making money without the slightest respect for the viewer. They are simply knocked down.
