“New best friend” - another subgenre entry “steal another woman’s life”; the best of which are “Lonely White Woman” and “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle”; the worst of which you can catch almost any day on the channel Lifetime. For some reason, this type of identity theft occurs exclusively with women. <br /> <br /> There are only two main ways to reproduce this type of story. At first, you can make a woman angry and allow viewers to consciously observe how she bears and implements her evil scheme. Or you use the wrong direction to make her seem like a good person, since the seemingly unplanned series of events will stop in her favor until she seems angry on the climate scene. Unfortunately, the creators of the “New Best Friend” could not decide how they want to play, and things will collapse sooner or later. First we meet Alicia (Mia Kirchner), who cheats with the college financial aid office to get a scholarship. Now we know that she is a bad person and will be suspicious of considering all her subsequent activities. But the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation was made, and spent the next 50 minutes trying to deceive us into thinking that Alicia is a good person. This introduces the only element of uncertainty, not whether it’s evil, but when the director and editor come up and stop wasting our time on transparent delusions. <br /> <br /> “New Best Friend” suffers more than most from the curse of the teenage movie cast, too old to portray undergraduate students. In fact, there are only two big roles: Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirchner). They were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of production. It almost works for the 26-year-old Kirchner when she plays the muscular version of Alicia, but becomes bright when she turns into a frozen version of Alicia. Casting Monroe is just a joke about how Nicolette Sheridan is trying to play a classmate on Lizzie McGwire. She looks much closer to a midlife crisis than to a term paper. <br /> <br /> The producers must have done a lot of favors, because this age issue applies to most of the supporting characters. Tei Diggs, who plays the city sheriff, is younger than most students. <br /> <br /> The basic scheme is Hadley and two other rich party people (played by Dominic Swain, 21, and Rachel East, 35) are roommates in college. They share (as their student residence) a mansion that is nicer and better equipped than a mansion in the Real World — New Orleans (the premise is more believable than football moms playing apprentices). Alicia moves into the mansion and begins to capture the life of Hadley. At least in this way, Swain finally gets a roommate from her own generation so that both have a lesbian scene. Swain's supportive performance is the only good thing about New Best Friend, and her love scene with Kirschner is fantastic, so cool and fancy that it doesn't fit into any of the other segments, it may have been made with a good director and cinematographer. <br /> <br /> An unintentionally funny story is presented in a series of dreary memories of rampant sex and non-stop parties, each of which is accompanied by a shot of comatose Alicia in a hospital bed. About half of the screen time Kirchner holds motionless with a pipe in his mouth. Bad career, Mia. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
