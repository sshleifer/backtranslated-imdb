Blimey! This film is really terrible. I can not imagine how someone could read this poorly written script and give it the green light. The cast is level two with some really terrible acts from almost all the actors. The story is fragmented, fragmented and incoherent. Speaking, lead and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humor. Not sexy at least. The characters remain as flat as the proverb pancake. There is also a strong flow of misogyny that has become harder for the stomach as the film went on. When your leadership (Carrell) is unfunny and unattractive, from there go uphill. Despite the fake end of the turnover, when love wins over lust, I have nausea in my stomach. If this is what is considered humor and social commentary, then we are definitely doomed.
