If it were not for some immature gullible idiot, I would have insisted that I watch this “documentary”, I would never have seen this comedy! This film is full of bad scenarios and ludicrous moments. One of them, in particular, is that Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for taking pictures on the street, while they allow the operator to continue to shoot his arrest and then leave, continuing to shoot, allegedly in his luxury hotel. In addition, there is a scene in which a car crashes into another car, turned upside down and parked on the side of the road without any evidence that it had an accident or explosion. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by this currently received rating (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users make more sense.
