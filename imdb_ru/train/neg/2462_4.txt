Well, I like the blood in this film - it is terribly disturbing. Anyone who has been to the dentist will know why. The story is actually not so bad, the motives of the character Corbin Bersen make much more sense than in most horror films. <br /> <br /> I have seen the worst play, directing, screenplay, etc. But at the end of the day it's still a bad horror movie. So it all comes down to whether you like this type of thing or not. I tried to see the sequel, but it was just like this movie. Just keep in mind that if you like when people are tortured by a dentist, then this film is for you!
