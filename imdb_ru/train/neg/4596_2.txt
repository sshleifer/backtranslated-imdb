The question is for you: the family moves to a new home and is pursued by demonic forces. What movie am I talking about? Every horror movie you saw? Yes, this is true, but this is not the answer that I am looking for. I judge this by saying that there are many scenes of teenager worry. Does not help? Well, there are a lot of bits where characters are chased by the creature, and you see the characters through the creature's POV. No further? Well, is there a sequence of dreams that includes a lot of blood? Can you still say some horror movie? Oh, damn it, this can take several weeks, so I’ll say that in the film I’m talking about a lot of Australians, many of whom appeared in the films “Neighbors” and “HOME HOUSE” CUBBYHOUSE), and you understand what is at stake above? The point is to show that the THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror movie that was shot.
