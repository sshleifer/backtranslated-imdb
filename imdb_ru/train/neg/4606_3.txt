This film was an attempt to get to places that most do not fall into and may not be worth the risk. It was a similar test in a bizarre perspective from the head that we were given in the “Cage”, although not as deep as it is well depicted. The plot is built simply with the original gait of it. Then, when the film takes its intended “dramatic” turn, the plot collapses on the few legs on which it should have stood first. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is the idea of ​​a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He takes on the role of an assassin, killing a city accountant. Then he is not paid for his work; instead, he is tortured for several days, because he came up with the “brilliant” idea of ​​trying to use the backup file that he had as a lever for payment. This idiotic step in an attempt to force them to give him a counterstrike, as he is subjected to terrible and endless abuse. He begins to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, thinking that he paid for his sins and can start all over again, he visits his wife (Kari Ukhrer) the man he killed and conquers her affection. Shortly after she discovers who he is, tragedy occurs and revenge spreads through the air when the boy pursues his tormentors (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for their previous "kindness." <br /> <br /> I have to ask, however, what is with Kari Ukhrera and horror / blood films? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything she released lately was in this genre. Of course, I liked her in "Octopods Freaks", and she was fine in "Anaconda". But despite all her obvious attractiveness and appeal (wow, she is hot!), She can act much better and choose the best roles. Or maybe I am mistaken, and this is just a fallacy. For all of you guys in this film, you can see her "fully mounted", although it is rather strange and short-lived. I almost felt like she made some kind of soft porn after watching this movie (something no stranger to Kari's career). Sex simulation is such that it makes you wonder what actually happens during filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will say that there is a good game. Just don’t expect much from Daniel Balvin, whose career seems forever doomed to his brother Alex’s second career. The film really brings out a few of the old greats, George Wendt (Norm of Greetings) and Vernon Wells (Commandos, Strange Science). First of all, Chris McKenna plays a great role in the role of the main character Sean Crowley. His small acting experience and, nevertheless, his believable nature of naive youth bring some elements of the creature to the film. <br /> <br /> I would not go all out for this. If you are bored and tired of the same old episodes of Hitch, I would advise you to watch it. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please start starring in some of the best movies!
