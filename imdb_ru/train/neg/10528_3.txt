I took this one because the music was made by Hans Zimmer, a client of Metasonix modular synthesizers (made by someone dear to me). On the cover it says "version of 2003". <br /> <br /> I give her one point for a strong woman, one point for a depraved dialogue and one last point for Meg Fosterâ€™s blue eyes, which are many. Snapshots. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see David McCallum float carelessly (there is a plexiglas window in the pool!), and his mistress was chasing a psycho in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were slightly impressive, that is, the homes of wealthy people in Los Angeles and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was located. I caught myself wondering how they could remove all the dust around. The wind was not strong enough to be believable to me. I kept thinking that animal skins on furniture should be nasty ... etc. and realized that the film should be pretty boring if I am interested in these things when the intended plot unfolds. I stumbled upon such things as why she lit a fire, blew out a match, and then threw a match into the fire ?! Such stupid things. At best, it was awkward. Well. Robert Morley needs to have some fun with his strange hero and have a good time.
