I just visited the Russian forum of our channel, which showed this film. Well ... 99 percent of the active Russian audience are disappointed. We wanted to see more truthful facts about our cosmic achievements in this film. But the authors meant something else ... :( We are a big and beautiful country in which intelligent people live. We are proud of all our cosmic dreams, real achievements, on the one hand, in this area and science, on the other. Therefore I would like to ask the authors: where is our Lunokhod? And where the hell is our MIR station? Huh? I am quite sure that the events of the Lunokhod occurred much earlier than Armstrong's “Moon Walk”.
