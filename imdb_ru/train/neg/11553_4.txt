Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after the production of Apocalypse Now, which made him completely incapable of making a good movie? <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what the director of The Godfather and The Conversations were thinking about when shooting this flabby film. This gives Kathleen Turner a prime machine, playing a woman who travels back in time and gets the opportunity to remake her teens, knowing everything that her adult life taught her, and Turner, the soldier she is, does what she can, but The movie can not be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> He doesn't even have any style, and, given his director, one would expect that even if he had nothing else, he would have it. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
