Honestly, I didn’t really like “Executive Decision” - which was obvious from the template - very much, but compared to this piece of shit, it looks like a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not only are the people moving in the film (the term “actors” would be an insult to all other actors), should attend more classes of acting, and the guy who builds the scenery did not even see the plane from afar. It is so ridiculous that on the 747 on board the aircraft there are only 3 people, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of irrationality (for example: use a sleeping gas, then do not use it, then use it anyway), which finally lowered my rating. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun by rearrange the sock or drill a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.
