Hey, <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try making it about Leonard Cohen! It is filled only with enough Leonard to piss off the viewer, who will wonder why they listen, as all the other singers (some of them doubtful) say about themselves. Puleeze .... sounds like they relive their high school diary entries - who cares about you, what about Leonard? Guess that people, if you “do something” worthily, maybe someone will make a documentary about you. I find the procession of U2 members especially offensive, as if it would add confidence in this film - NO. Leonard does not need Bono or Edge to talk about their spirituality. For filmmakers, it would be nice to embody some part of his spirituality in the film. Gee, what a concept! I'll give the details to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers on Cohen's tunes - the rest of the performances were boring and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> Cohen's fans, do not say that I did not warn you!
