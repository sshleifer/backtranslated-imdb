An interesting idea related to alternative measurement inside the hospital. Recall - Stephen Kings "Langolera", "Kingdom Hospital" and the old episodes of the twilight zone. Atmospheric strong, the setting was excellent. There were also some very clever “time loop” moments that always attract attention. In this story there were many vague mentions, because of which I believed that all the following oddities - blunders of time / ghosts / strange winged demon of a bat and a rather stupid thing like a ghoul with a heavy metal will be explained. And THAT was that the Dark Floors let me down. Judging by my viewing, the film does not give an explanation of what is behind the events. While some ambiguity is always expected / welcome in such films. Dark floors raised him to a new height of uncertainty. I don’t expect things to be wrapped in a beautiful ribbon, but at the same time I shouldn’t leave the feeling "Ha? .. is that so ...? Did I dose? Maybe I missed the chapter by skipping by mistake?" The Dark Floors left me with a very unsatisfactory suspicion that “It was a whole dream,” which is a shame, because until the last movie I was very on board and enjoyed the movie.
