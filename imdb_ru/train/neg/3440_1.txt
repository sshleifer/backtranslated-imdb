never watch this movie ... it's the biggest pile of crap I've ever met in my entire life. and it says something. Acting, storyline and shooting were absolutely terrible, this is the worst movie in the world !!! seriously, doesn't it even give you a hit, because it was worth my 99 pence from the sainsburys, and it was only done in 2005? hahaha, this movie is like a cheap college movie, you can even see a camera in the corner of the screen .... although if you really want to watch it, you should watch the scary shark scene ... maybe the best part of acting is seen in my life ... haha. I mean, seriously, this is the biggest waste of 2.5 hours ever !!
