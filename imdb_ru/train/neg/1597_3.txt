This film is considered to be a classic in mood, not in the quality of film production. He moves from the incredible to the incredible, from the unreal to the absurd. <br /> <br /> An incredible plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gopher to rescue a third soldier captured by a militant. indians In the later scene, we see a complete regiment with drums and bagpipes ambushing. In the British army, the sergeant does not order a rescue attempt, and if you can cope with this, he will not attempt only with one other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a complete regiment at hand. Indian rebels are so incredibly inept that it is ridiculous ... there are hundreds of them, but they cannot hold a prisoner or kill two rescuers, of course not. At some point, we see British soldiers throwing boulders out of the battlements into the rebels, who are scattered on the mountainside in ambush ... you had to have an eggplant for the brain to think that it would do any harm. After Cary Grant is shot dead in a rescued prisoner, he lies on the floor, looking at the water boy ... hardly anyone shot in the back. A water boy boldly blows a horn (which comes from nowhere) to give an alarm ... he does it, standing high on the wall so that the bad guys can see and shoot him, and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes, when he is repeatedly shot, and the miner's call breaks into faint screams ... instead of blowing up the forge, hiding behind cover, as anyone who had less brain would do. This scene is deservedly parodied in comedy sketches. If they wanted to make Buster Keatonâ€™s comedy, they had to hire Keaton and make it better.
