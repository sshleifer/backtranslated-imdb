*** Spoilers *** Spoilers *** Spoilers *** Spoilers <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there are movies that are so terrible that they become affectionately comical in their incompetence. This is the case with Columbia Pictures "The Grudge". This cinematic atrocity began when a well-intentioned American saw a Japanese man filmed for the Ju-on television film and was inspired to remake the film in English. This marked the beginning of a virtual tsunami in which bad decisions were made, and it circumnavigated the globe around the globe until it hit the shore in Orlando on October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> In the package, and I freely use this word, there is a house in Tokyo, pursued by a skinny mom-ghost, like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her terrible friend - plump, defiant, but evil second grader Is there anything worse than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy? Of course have! Count Chokula comes to mind. To this bizarre bundle we must add a mysterious black cat, which I affectionately called Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you may have guessed, they were killed at this place of death and now they want to kill everyone who enters the room. You see, as the Japanese detective explained, when someone dies in a rage, his ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property line, as determined by the county commissioner, or something like that, I forgot. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently enough from the fact that the famous balcony, Bill Pullman, jumped to his death from the balcony. I guess Bill Pullman got this job because his children asked him to go to Tokyo Disneyland. Then we transfer the slightly interesting saga of Nurse Yoko: “Oh, do not go there,” the audience shouts, but, alas, she does not listen to terrible warnings and predictably went out like a magic lantern. After about 30 minutes of the film, we finally saw the American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar may be a competent actress, but I could not help thinking of Buffy, the vampire slayer, so much so that it distracted. This is equivalent to the role of Jennifer Aniston in the film about the adventures of six friends in New York. No matter how hard you try, you just can't stop thinking about another project that made her famous. But I was distracted, Karen, a nurse hired as a replacement for the original nurse who disappeared from us. <br /> <br /> She sniffs, meets ghosts, dies coma, and something else happens. Watching the blonde fox looking for clues, I almost expected her to find the ghost and take off his mask to show that it was actually old Gower who owned an abandoned amusement park! “I would have gotten away with it if you had not interfered in the affairs of the children and this dog of yours!” <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who claims to be the “Ed Wood of Asia”, made two unsuccessful decisions related with sound. First, he decided to use the soundtrack only when someone is going to be killed. This is a great device for destroying any wait, because the audience receives a two-minute warning to prepare for another horribly predictable murder. Secondly, he gave the ghosts a strange guttural noise, similar to rinsing a gopher. After the film, I heard several people leave the theater, making sound and laughter. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar is the only survivor. And, of course, we learn that the fire, which she set on fire to extinguish the house, was put out in time for the obligatory next chapter. However, given the audience’s humorous reactions, they didn’t want to continue, but apologized. "The Grudge" can be easily edited in a comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for its value of the camp. For that matter, it will be the greatest cinematic thriller since Godzilla vs. Megalon. I would advise you to wait until the film comes to your local discount theater, where he can get the public ridicule he deserves so deservedly.
