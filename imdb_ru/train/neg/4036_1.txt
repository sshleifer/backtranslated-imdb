Almost from the very beginning, this film is poor and lacks conviction, but on the other hand, most people will struggle to show a commitment to the script as boring as this one. The dialogue does not really take place, and sometimes, as in this case, more is less (or should have been). This is also reinforced by strange scenes (for example, the slow walk of Cemetry), which, as you think, can lead somewhere, but seem to spend only a few seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The plot is a strange combination of a comedy gangster / a situation that I was sure at the time looked like a good idea, but if there ever was an occasion when someone needed to be honest with the scriptwriter, then here it is . <br /> <br /> Martin Freeman is fine, but then he seems to have one character who always plays, so I begin to wonder if he got the script or just shot and told him to react as usual. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. It reminds me of Python's quote (I think) about Shakespeare, about his "comedies" - if he meant that this was a joke, he would have joked. Well, I have not seen one. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - I did it because I watched it with a friend and continued to hope that it would be better. <br /> <br /> This is not the case.
