The Bank (1915, Chaplin) The Bank was one of Charlie's Essanai films of 1915. While these groups of films are more watchable than their counterparts from 1914, this one seems a bit below average. A gag with a cleaning double combo lock and ending a setback in which Charlie wakes up from a dream in which he strokes the hair of the lead lady, only to stroke his head with a mop that he used as a quasi pillow, both of Chaplin's classic moments. They are both ironically the beginning and the end. The middle is filled with a fight with a rival, a janitor and bank robbery to win the girl. Mop is probably the best physical support in this film, and Charlie uses it for an expert comedy effect, regardless of whether it is the intention of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter ego, doing things he wanted to do, but not with his own hands. Interesting things, but there are better.
