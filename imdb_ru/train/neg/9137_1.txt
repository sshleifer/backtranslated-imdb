What can I say, this is a piece of brilliant filmmaking that Oscar should have won. A copy should be kept in a secure repository for posterity. This should be a must-see for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich - a genius, perhaps the most brilliant writer / director / producer / chef / nanny / welcoming Walmart, ever decorated the world of cinema with his art. <br /> <br /> How to start? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so exciting! And Mraovich like Arthur, wow, he is so attractive that I am surprised that he did not go to Mr. Universe. I could not restrain myself during the nude scene. I lent this film to my brother, and he called me on the phone and said that Arthur’s naked scene made him gay. I fully support, of course, because of this film, and these are beautifully crafted lessons of tolerance. Why just yesterday I burned the church and wrote “for Sam and Arthur” in its smoldering ash. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was the best thing in this film. When that Fed-Ex plane took to the sky among the trees of Vermont, I began to cry! Why, I did not even know that they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed-Ex planes before this film. This opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. This film inspired me to get Sam Mraovich in the school: acting, directing, writing, casting, producing, production design and real estate. I just want to say: “Thank you, Mr. Mraovich. Thank you for bringing this creation to the world. We can never pay you enough. ”
