F * CK Me! I saw some incredibly awful movies in my time, but it all goes away! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I cannot express in words how really this film is really bad. In addition to the plot, which is not in fact, comic crap, funny and terrible excuses zombies; You know that I could go on all day. Every little thing in this movie is either stupid, pointless, crap or embarrassing. I express to everyone who wants to watch this movie ... no need! <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m ashamed to say I have it on my stand. It is hidden right on the damn bottom of a huge pile. I couldn't even give this damn excuse for a movie. That's how bad it is.
