Seriously, why should American and Fresh actors, pretending to be Czechs, have to speak excellent English with a fake Russian accent? I am a man, so I enjoyed gratuitous nudity. - but a soft porn movie will have more, which, at least, will not pretend to be artistic. <br /> <br /> All political statements, where didactic- did the director hear painfully about subtlety? Acting was also woody and melodramatic, and comic relief was never funny. The characters were very small, and I just could not identify with them. <br /> <br /> I laughed a little when the directors shot archived footage of the demonstrations in Prague - and they were black and white, and then sepia according to the frames - just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I read many short stories by Kundera (not “The Unbearable Lightness of Being”), and there is something good in his writing style (although his themes are one big male fantasy) - and I must say that the film did NOT convey anything good in the style of Kunderas.
