It is useless to try to glorify any part of this film. <br /> <br /> It was just rubbish. At the very beginning, you might think that you are interested in a visually stunning piece of cinematography ... and soon after that you are beaten with a large bag (sacking) of FAIL! The fights are barely fighting, the acting is teetering on the edge, and music is not worth describing. Just one story is enough to create an excuse that this film was made. The decisions that the characters make, and how they cope with situations, are weak, and have done nothing but upset me. I think that the only reason this film was made was to act as a fan service with the help of Yumiko Shaku.
