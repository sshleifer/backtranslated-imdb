Keep in mind! <br /> <br /> This is a shit with which other shit won't even deign to be together, because they are under them! Well, don't say that, let me say something more substantial. <br /> <br /> I saw The Ashes of Time a long time ago, thinking it was a fresh look at the material, based on the very revered wuxia novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite all this, WKW was not able to adapt the novel on the screen, as many fans of the UCLA claim; basically they are just drops of water, drops of sweat, running legs of horses, etc. I could not sit most of the film. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to many years later, when I wanted to give Mr. Wong the Films - another frame after hearing a lot of praise, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his last year, 2046. A friend of mine told me to start with Chungking Express, because these are his most affordable movies. So wrong! I was just p. that I was deceived to waste my time and money on this pretentious nothing. Some professional reviewers referred to this as thinking about alienation and solitude in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It is normal if the director has a point of view, to say why all this is happening, and to tell about it. But no, it just shows what it is. The acting of Faye Wong is very typical for the style of Hong Kong: a distorted maxim, the expression of the eyes of deer in the eyes of the headlights, an attempt to be a sweet and girlish game; the rest of the cast is equally boring. <br /> <br /> I think that the word “Author” is a euphemism for a director who is trying something new and different that should be welcomed, but not someone who is not yet mastered the art of cinematic story-telling, which is Mr. Wong, for the last 17 years!
