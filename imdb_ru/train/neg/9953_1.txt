I really should see a good movie soon, because it seems like every other record or something that I despise. No matter how my story says, I must not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything connected with him suck big green banana peels. I never thought I would see a knock on a movie as loud as this one. Al Pacino does not act in this film: he poses. There are many, many scenes of his character, the rider, who just looks at the camera. He is absolutely terrible. Martha Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in a love affair, and there is no chemistry in it. Sydney Pollack shot this movie? There are no traces of genius behind Tutsi. Is this the same man for whom I supported Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself from the terrible movie experience. Run, don't go far away from Bobby Deerfield.
