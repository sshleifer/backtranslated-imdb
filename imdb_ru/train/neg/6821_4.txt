It was a good story, but not very well told. I liked the themes and the storyline, which was not as clear as it could be. Perhaps there was too much happening and the lack of ability to manage all of this. The action was normal, to be stupid, some were stronger than others, and even the stronger actors had moments of lower quality action. It took me a few months to go through the whole movie, because it didnâ€™t get my attention, and the flow was just bad. I just finished watching it, and I'm glad I did it, because the film is finally starting to move and has some continuity towards the end. Again a good story, but the delivery was low. Would recommend this for a storyline and perhaps a bit of eye candy, and I mean a bit.
