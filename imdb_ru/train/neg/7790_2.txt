Like some of the other people who watched this movie, I also felt nostalgic about it ... before I was lucky enough to watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely unreliable, and “Full Dangers of Polina” now turned out to be an embarrassing occupation in banal, racist and boring filmmaking. Even the presence of old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas cannot overcome a rancid script, a terrible musical theme and some terrible "special effects". In addition, stereotypical images of African and Arab characters make viewing painful, especially given that this was done immediately after the civil rights movement. The original "Psychotronic Encyclopedia" by Michael Weldon says that Polina's "Dangers" were originally created for television, but for some unknown reason received a theatrical release. Judging by the results, this is a very plausible (and confusing) scenario.
