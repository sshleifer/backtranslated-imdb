This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I've heard have been unwarranted. <br /> <br /> With regard to the technique of pure film production, this director is competent. It is constrained by the limited budget and VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and stage setting are quite professional. I have seen a lot of films where “directing” was much worse. At the very least, the scenes evolve in such a way that it is not confusing, and it has some clever pictures here and there. Also the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. With a VHS video camera, you can do a lot, and it does an excellent job with technical tasks. As for the artistic merit, they are not. The scene where the camera leans, so we can watch the guy urinate in the forest for 15 seconds, as if personifying the artistic style of the entire film. This is pure trash ... Full trash. <br /> <br /> Blood is decent for a film in this budget range. This is obviously a fake, but a lot of it, and it is very outlandish. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version with intentionally kind duplication. It was a good idea (and this is the only thing that allowed me to go through the film) ... Unfortunately, she overdid it, especially near the end. <br /> <br /> This is a really awful movie, but I have to recommend it, because this is the cost of the camp. It’s hard to find a film that is worse than this, and it puts it in a unique category.
