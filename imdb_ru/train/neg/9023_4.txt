I watched anime, but I'm not a fan; and I don't read manga. I say this because many of the reviewers, who are delighted with the lyrics of this film, seem to have such an origin. I saw "Hypericum", and although he was not a masterpiece of imagination, he made me pick up the "Shinobi", especially since everyone seems to like it. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it this afternoon and tried very hard to keep looking. Yes, it is very beautiful - slow water scenes, autumn leaves on the trees, even the twinkling of CGI eyes - majestically. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the battle scenes, but overall it was boring, like dirt. <br /> <br /> It seemed that someone had taken “Romeo and Juliet” - it is even mentioned in the translation that they crossed the stars to their lovers - and threw in some “X-Men” for good measure. Two characters shared Wolverine's forces - a guy dressed in a bear costume had claws, and a gray-haired man had the ability to heal himself. Then you have a girlfriend who has a poisonous kiss - this is poison ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such stupid powers? Poisonous girl shows his leg, and then kisses you to death. Dude, this is some great power for you. And another girl can create bugs from this yellow dust, which she rubs on her hands. Another woman, one of the mistresses with crossed stars, has a hypnotic look. Wow. <br /> <br /> I sort of got to the end of the movie, rewinding it forward, and saw a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some compare it to the “House of Flying Daggers” and “Hero”. Do not make this mistake. They may have the same end, but the similarity ends there. "Shinobi" was shot by an amateur, the rest of the films were made by an experienced director. <br /> <br /> I would say, avoid this movie if you are not 12-18 years old.
