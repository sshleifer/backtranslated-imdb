Considered the most abusive film ever, GUARANTEED TO STOP ALL - Guess what? It worked, I was offended that we laid out the money to rent it. My two friends and I were bored, and I decided to see if it was true that all this bull in the film that we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed us to this garbage! It was the worst movie I've ever seen since the time of Hollowin. I generally avoid shitty ones, but I was drawn out in this. Since then we beat the injection, which offers us to rent it, and his privileges of choosing the film have been canceled. There is nothing funny in this film ... even the scene of Dickman's Adventure was, at best, a sophomore ... Color me, damn it. I thought maybe production value was crap for some important reason ... no ... just sucks. NEVER LOOK THIS! for any reason. Even with a copious amount of illegal substance, this film will not be funny. It says ALOT. Please, for the love of all that is holy, if you value your sanity - never watch this movie. This is a lot of things - stupid, meaningless and useless. But most importantly, what he sought: insultingly ridiculous - failed miserably. Destroy and burn ....
