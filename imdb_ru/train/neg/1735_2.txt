I have a feeling that the producers of this mess sought to make the most painful, ridiculous westerns ever made. “PAINFUL” is the best word I can think of to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, you have a good color photo and a beautiful and well-pronounced Rhonda Fleming. I express my sympathy to Jacques Obuchon (who played the cripple), who played quite well in the annoying role, written so viciously that no actor could give a pleasant presentation. Production figures were pretty good, which only underlined the horrible story and the script. <br /> <br /> Things I hated: Stuart Granger looked so little like a Western figure, with his British accent, neat individual outfit, and a silly, flawless, always white shawl tied around his neck. It became tedious as the townspeople and his son constantly harassed and insulted Granger, and he never said or answered in reply. I know that we have to stop disbelief and appreciate Westerns as symbolic moral games, but this one broke the spell with ridiculously unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst of which is in the end when Granger miraculously, quickly and solely plants dynamite around the canyon Go through that cattle the bad guy will pass, and then Granger sits in the perfect place so that he can shoot dynamite from a very far distance to create stone hills, to bury and scare the cattle and bad guys, apparently destroying them all x except the two main bad guys. The next worst thing is all about the plot, which is loaded with scenes from a soap opera. Nothing in the film seemed believable: I could not believe what the whole conflict was about. The bad guy drove his flock to the market and wanted the cows to chew grass along the way; I do not understand why something did not work. Do you need a land title dispute? Do not worry about it.
