Wow. I read about this movie, and it sounded so horrible that I had to watch it, and damn it, I smell it in St. Louis. Where do I begin? National Lampoons tried to trace the success of Animal House 5 years later, but they completely failed to hit the target. I will go in chronological order with these short films. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Rigert (Boone from Animal House). Apparently, he didn’t work then, so the guys from National Lampoons probably called and said: “Hey, we’re making c ** ppy, do you want to be in it? Peter was like, "well, I don't do much these days, why not?" He was a great side character at Animal House, but he couldn’t carry this miserable short flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is pretty funny, Jason Cooper (Rigert) tells his wife: Leave him, she needs to find herself. It is too strange that they are actually in a happy marriage. So he drives her away, she goes there, and Cooper is in charge of the children. This, of course, leads to the fact that he sets fire to the house, loses several children and sleeps with a number of New York bimbo (including a very young Diane Lane). Then the wife returns, wants children, and the film ends with a coin toss that will decide the fate of the children. The idea was actually somewhat clever, but the director smelly. It seems to all characters that they fall asleep, they MUST be spiced up. Sorry Boone, your legacy is tainted by this flop. <br /> <br /> Short No. 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Enter Dominic Corsair. A pretty girl who recently graduated from college is not sure what to do with her life. So she becomes a slut, starts sleeping with a few mega-rich guys, takes their money when they die, and she doesn't stop until she sleeps with the most powerful person in the world, Fred Willard (Oh, I mean President United States). Once again, it could be funny, and although I was happy that Corsair (Ann Duesenberry in real life) was not afraid to bare all, her game was terrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short film number 3 <br /> <br /> I can’t believe I’ve done it so far. Here is rookie cop Brent Falcone (Robbie Benson) and veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, thinks that he can really help people, although he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times. Nagurski has really just stopped caring. He watches for robberies, assaults, you name it, and never intervenes. He believes that the world is lawless, and he will probably be sued if he does anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the Taxi run) takes part in the action, forcing the police to call him, committing a crime, but having his own lawyer to protect him. God bless America! <br /> <br /> Once again, perhaps it was funny, the performances were deliberate, but virtuous, no energy. Henry Yaglomu and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed of having their names written on this castle. I think the letter was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was carried out as well as an attempt to rescue the Iranian hostage crisis. If I were a part of this film, I would like my name to be removed, it's terrible. On the other hand, that's why I looked at it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this trash is that Dr. John made the film (repeating “Going to the Cinema” again and again), and the film is not much longer than an hour and a half. Show it in a movie lesson with the headline "What you should never do in a movie." This script should have been left on the shelf, because yes, this is so bad.
