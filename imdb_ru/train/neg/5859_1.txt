Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in world cinema. They are local and folklore, but they want to be international. This leads to kitsch-results, such as this film. <br /> <br /> The film has jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish, and they have no meaning for a non-Turkish audience. Even for a Turkish audience after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players, even Ferhan SENSOY, behave worse than average. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing is said about Cuba. Therefore, Cuba is considered a banana republic. <br /> <br /> A waste of money, a waste of time.
