What a bad excuse for making a New Zealand film. I am ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this film exists and is now being broadcast on New Zealand satellite television (August 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries, which ply daily between the two main islands and even have a company logo (dolphin), which is still on the set, including its funnel. It is assumed that this will be a cruise liner between the United States and Mexico. He has obvious signs of rust and old age everywhere, but must be a luxury ship on his first voyage. For God's sake, one of the scenes shows the snowy peaks of the southern island of New Zealand in the background! It must have been a very cold time in the USA / Mexico! The story is weak, the acting is weaker, and the New Zealand / American accents simply do not work. I expect that the New Zealand taxpayer has contributed to the cost of production of this film, and it was a waste of money better spent on actual production. I know high school students in New Zealand who could make the best films using their mobile phones. Fool: in the hold there is a truck with an inscription, and they attached a Taco company sign on the door of the truck, apparently so that it looked like an American. But some signs are above the tags - you might think that they would notice this in the section of the props, before attaching it. I would like to continue, but this is in no way a problem.
