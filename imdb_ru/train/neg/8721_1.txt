Sorry, but this is just a pity. The little girl was lousy, they didn't have nice characters, and the plot sucked. In addition, it was not even an alligator, because the film would like us to believe. If you look at the complete reptile guide, you’ll find that it’s really a Crocodile, not an alligator. Obviously, they did not hire a real animal expert, or they would know that the creature is a crocodile. This is a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the final. I almost fell asleep with this.
