Well, on paper, everything looked good, Nick Cage and Jerry Backheimer are working together again, this time on the mix of the movie about the theft, The Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But, dear, this is for Indiana Jones that Speed ​​2 is for Speed. Reasonable cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights the children's script and loses much. A film is nothing more than an expanded advertisement for masons. However, these masons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these masons are natural descendants of the Templars (and no one mentions "Out of Hell" or Jack the Ripper.) I don't think I found any plot spoilers because there are none. There are practically no expectations, no surprises and no climax - it just stops. The national treasure is aimed at Dan Brown, but reaches the same intellectual level as the Scooby-Doo episode without humor.
