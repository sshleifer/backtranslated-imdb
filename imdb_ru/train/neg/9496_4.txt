Cool romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the love relationship that develops between hippies (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly friendly in this very contrived arrangement). The script is small, but not without some thoughtful passages; nevertheless, the script has already become such a middle-aged cliche, that most of the picture looks like a child. Perhaps it worked much better with different characters: Holden and Lenz do not match well (her height is so small that it seems that she towers over her), making their intimate scenes less exciting than just uncomfortable. Outdated, blurry-romantic and mostly not memorable. ** from ****
