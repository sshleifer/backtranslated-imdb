I remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews of this film when it came out. I wanted to see how terrible it was, but after three weeks he was no longer in the theaters. The only other film you can control is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I could not think of the sheer awful attention this film was receiving was possible. Seeing this, I can understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. In the beginning there is a good shot that shows a bullet fired from a pistol, which seemed to me to be accurate. And the way monsters die in this film is pretty cool to watch; but it gets old after you see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst in this movie: Tara Reid. If a bad acting game was a sin, then Hell would have thrown Tara Reid, because it is incredibly terrible in this film, it is unthinkable. And of all the roles she plays the curator. Now, if she played a stupid, empty-headed sex toy, then maybe I can forgive her how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not realize this, although he seemed to think that if she took off his shirt in the film, people would see it. He simply did not understand that forcing her to do it in the middle of the film at the most inappropriate moment simply made the film even more ridiculous. Is this a Mexican song or something similar during the dry hump scene? I could not tell. <br /> <br /> This brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll demonstrates some of the worst directing skills you have ever seen in a movie. I mean, I would give House of the Dead F (and I only do it for very few films), but HotD would score at least B compared to this spoiled garbage. The film begins with a very, very long narrative, which causes immediate confusion (and read by a terrible storyteller), and from there, the abbreviations are really very stupid. There is one moment when Slater and Reid examine the destroyed building, and the screen darkens. When he returns, Slater and Reed shoot everywhere, and suddenly an entire army joins them. BUT? <br /> <br /> And someone did not bother to check the mistakes in this film. At some point, the team breaks the glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings change colors in the middle of one scene, and after Slater leaves the dead comrade, you can see how she starts to get up. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I was really lost. Something about the old tribe, releasing darkness, and someone "opens the way" or something like that, and all the evil monsters jump out. It’s just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced that in this film you don’t need to reload the characters) that are simply boring. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie in the hope of laughing at how incredibly stupid it is. I did not laugh, but I still think it is stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
