There are no spoilers here ... Because there is no plot to spoil. Madhen Amik - living proof that a person can make a living - talent is not required. The only bright spot is a few really good one-line players, delivered by Alice Krieg, but again, she IS the Alice Krieg. Her soft, dreamy voice gives a hint of how temptingly dangerous these strange creatures are. She is incredibly creepy in this incredible plot. How they forced her to agree to this project remains a mystery. The script writers were supposed to get the medicine when they submitted this script. He has serious problems with continuity, superficial stereotypical characters, writing horror formulas, and he simply has no meaning. Creatures, while they have neat skills, such as dullness, the question of where they come from and what they are has never been learned. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this.
