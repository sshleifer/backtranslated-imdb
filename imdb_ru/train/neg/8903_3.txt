Prophecy II, what is there to say? They completely abandoned the originality of the first film and just splashed the film by Chris Walken. It is not even written by the author of the original! <br /> <br /> If you saw Nr. I do not look nr. 2 is a real disappointment ... <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Nr. I do not look nr. 2! Go see nr. 1 experience something original and fun
