While “Santa Claus Conquers the Martians” is usually called one of the worst films ever made, this 1959 Mexican film is so bad that “SCCM” looks like “It's a beautiful life.” You have to wonder what the people who made this film thought; perhaps they meant the third world allegory of capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Nope They were just not very good. The same production company made an even more disturbing version of Little Red Riding Hood, in which the obsession of the wolf with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia. (This may have been the inspiration for the Autobahn instead of elves, his toys are made by children chosen from all over the world; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check out which kids are naughty and cute. The result is similar to the Orwellian space sweat workshop. That's enough to turn you off forever. This and other inexpensive Mexican children's films were dubbed in English and widely distributed in the United States in the early 1960s; no wonder that the sixties became such a tumultuous period in American history. Baby boomers who were forced to endure these "family" films in childhood, too sought to become revolutionary.
