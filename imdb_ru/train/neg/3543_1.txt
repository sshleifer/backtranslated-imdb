Hid for a couple of years or so. I have never been invited to publish here before, so maybe this film is worth the stars for this, but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD, missed the movie due to illness, and still have not bothered to watch it. I did not read too much about this, of course, I did not even think about the film in a few months. It was just what a friend in a store put together, so he was watched. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The picture I mentioned in the summary above is in the trailer and on the poster. From the start, Jason Statham has hair. As in no other movie GR. Or any JS movie I saw. At least not in the quantities displayed here. And Ray Liotta in shorts MUST be forewarned. It's scary and funny, but not in the spirit of ha-ha-humor. It is more in the style of TheOffice, but slightly modified, and so unfortunate, in some way humor. Each of them says the same thing: "This film is not like what you expect from this film." <br /> <br /> Now, based on the previous extensive experience of watching movies, I expected this film to be several things. Like: <br /> <br /> () Connected, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or exciting, <br /> <br /> () Not complete and full of farrago gaze, </ p> <br /> () Something more substantial than a motley bunch of poorly realized fables from what is simply a standard oriental mystical ideology, dressed as a “cool, modern, self-aware art form” <br /> <br /> ( ) Hopefully better than "Idiots." <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed in my tone, he could not put a single flag above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Poorly edited {walk around the store, 70s amateur jumps in the style of high-8, incomprehensible "plot" "turns !!!" delivered through battered photo-montages, I could go on ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Shot as if depressed by a 14-year-old goth who had just spent a weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with painted curtains < br /> <br /> (x) So, thanks to his motive / message “I'm really smart, I myself”, he feels that he decided to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure that stupid people (t .e. everyone who does not like it) in the audience should make sure that they understand, <br /> <br /> (x) A real waste of my time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the undoubted ability of some people to “extract” something from this, well. I'm glad you liked it. One of them said something that caught my attention: before the age of 25, they probably understood it better because of editing. Perhaps, but editing should make your work more accessible, and not less. As for the "Genius, the recognizable only enlightened" brigade there, go suck onions and grow. There is nothing more arrogant and self-serving than people who say that the reason why another person does not know great art is that they do not understand the “craft / materials / lunar cycle / threads of higher rational thought”, which “the author / Poet / artist / reader palm / idiot Savant "uses to explain his" vision / grandiose plan / unity with Gaia / a huge bucket of sick dogs. <br /> <br /> For me and many, many more people, his trash. <br /> <br /> Films, art, stories, poetry, everything that is intended for viewing by another person should be fascinating and touching. In some direction, be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional, or something else that you have. <br /> <br /> The only way it pushed me was to move forward in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable demise. "The biggest trick he ever did was make you believe that any part of this film meant anything at all." <br /> <br /> And now, please, by all means, fire me my buns.
