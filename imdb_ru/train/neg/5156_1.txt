“Laughter is a state of mind,” says the label, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson’s words. What could he think about while creating the Toys? When he watched haste, did he see a successful, amusing fantasy? If so, then it works in a different plane than me. This is a painful picture in which serial design is 90% (and even the colors of cartoons are disappointing). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as the brother and sister of the toy magnate who were left behind by the factory’s heirs when their father died. There is nothing remotely funny (satirical or slap) on display here. It is monotonous, ugly and one of the worst “big” movies ever made. NO STARS from ****
