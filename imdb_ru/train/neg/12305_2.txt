I am watching this movie right now on WTN, because it was the channel that the TV was connected to when I turned it on. This is not a very plausible and rather boring story about the minister's wife (Alexander Paul), lustful with a young stallion / drifter (with a washboard press), played by Cory Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey tears off his shirt, and Alexandra faints. I have a feeling that he should be bad, and that is why he is indulging in skinny Alexandra Paul. This is not very important, because, as I said, he often takes off his shirt, and I just noticed how the back split. There is a lot of saxophone on the soundtrack that just hurts.
