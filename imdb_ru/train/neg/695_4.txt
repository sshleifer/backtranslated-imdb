I heard so much about this movie that it was a great slasher and one of those films from the early 80s that just died to fans of most slash films. Well, I rented it, and I must say that, although he kept my attention, as the wait goes to most slashers, such as "April Fool's Day", "Friday the 13th" and "Prom Evening", this film could be right there with the above mentioned, only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the continuing story. The characters I discovered were unhappy in this film, it was a strange guy with curly hair who continued to crawl around the hostel and, of course, leading to his true climate role at the end when he met the murderer. Another would be a dirty dirty guy in a denim jacket, he could play more roles in this film, which could make the film more interesting, instead the film played this guy as another loser who makes unknown calls while he sleeps. with his girlfriend, and then throws his part and cuts him to the end, which was a waste, I was disappointed in his part at the end. As for the true identity of the killer, when I found out who he was, I just laughed, but everything was obvious, and he really made a real leap for himself, as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. This film should be one to watch it at least once for all fans of slasher, but donâ€™t spend your hard-earned money on it in rare collectors' inventory.
