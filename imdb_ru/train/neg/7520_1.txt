This film proves that you canâ€™t judge a movie on a stunning DVD cover. It also suggests that you should find out more about the film before you buy it (or get it for someone for Christmas). The beginning of this film actually looks somewhat promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (an old guy from the street) brings a college book full of witch spells, which he leaves in their annual haunted house (where the movie takes place). After that there is some binge, fights, and soft core porn. Then the action of the film finally occurs after an hour. <br /> <br /> In general, Hatchlings were predictable, unsuspensful, and resemble soft-gang porn. This film is probably the best to watch with a group of friends who have nothing to do, as this is a good film to laugh at. And for beginning audiences, it is really interesting to make predictions about the order of people who die.
