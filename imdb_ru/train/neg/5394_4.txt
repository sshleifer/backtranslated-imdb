I’m annoyed by Shakespeare’s modern adaptations, when the director cannot decide whether to use the original or update it. If he uses the original words in a renewed environment, it is especially difficult if it is installed in the 20th or 21st century, although it may work well in period styles, for example, Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night very late established the late Victorian period. He could have worked with the setting of the 1930s, if there were much less song and dance in it and much more text of Shakespeare. Unfortunately, this is just a banal, but very pleasant show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Bran himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the students, but more importantly, he is such an experienced Shakespearean actor that, despite all his attempts to become just another student, his acting ability is always manifested. Of course, he had to play the King - there are no problems with the environment of a mature student of the King by younger students. Instead, we had a pleasant but impressive actor for the King, thus, an unassuming so-called King without the attributes of the Kingdom. <br /> <br /> The number of songs and dances, which I found tedious, despite the good songs and quite pleasant dances, unfortunately, meant that the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be drastically reduced. Thus, everything ended in trivial and soft confectionery work, and I became very bored, including with comic turns, and I was glad when it ended. Brana did not deign Shakespeare justice in this performance. <br /> <br /> However, he appreciates Richard Biers and Geraldine McEwen as a senior couple.
