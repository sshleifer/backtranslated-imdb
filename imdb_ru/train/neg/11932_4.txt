Oliver Gruner is absolutely unknown to me. A friend of mine showed me this film because he saw Gruner, which he called a pretty good sci-fi film Nemesis. So, watching this, we quickly moved forward in the BS dramatic roles to get to incredible sequences of actions. Gruner likes to kick and kick and kick. And hit! haha <br /> <br /> Gruner is a graduate student who is forced to stay in the ghetto, close to the one in which he grew up. He watches the boy who lives with him, because he really wants to join the Mexican gang, which continues to torment his family. Instead of joining, Gruner orders the guy to fight back (against the gang? Too crazy). Gruner plays the typical character of Van Damme, who kills everyone (or cripples them very badly) and tries to rid his block of these thugs. <br /> <br /> The plot was very stupid and easy to understand. Gruner is probably not very famous due to the fact that he chose the script to compare this film with a possible choice. This ghetto is a real hell, and I enjoyed watching a colorful team of characters pass through it, as if they had a chance against the character Grüner. The music was typical action music (percussion pianos and timpani, swelling guitars), which actually wasn't as bad as I imagined. The director really needed to continue the action, and not to take a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I gave him 4/10, because he really tried to be an ordinary fighter so that Oliver Grüner played the main role, but the overall feeling of the film leaves much to be desired in what you just saw. .
