Denzel - the only thing that is correct in this film. <br /> <br /> It was possible that at some early stage it was the best movie. Someone decided to cut some actions and plot points at the beginning of the film, giving most of the storyline in about the first 5 minutes. This destroys everything that has accumulated in tempo and rhythm that the film could have before. <br /> <br /> At first it confuses you, and then repels. Dramatization goes beyond disbelief. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a feeling of injustice and anger that such films can potentially inspire viewers. Of course it is, if you are looking for it ... knock yourself out.
