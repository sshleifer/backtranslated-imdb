I draw attention to the fact that I often watch bad movies, and the original movies of the science fiction channel are usually one of the best sources for these films you can find. Thus, I am sure that you can imagine my disappointment when I saw the Sands of Oblivion. The game was uncharacteristically poor-quality, in contrast to the sadly shameful show that science fiction usually awaits us. There are a few cameos made by people that you are most likely to recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. The CGI special effects are minimal, and as such, one of the biggest sources of comedy in the sci-fi feature is missing. Of course, there are funny moments, for example, when a guy beheads a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend to die to save a girl he knows for a couple of days, but on the whole it ends up simply not having you roll on the floor laughing, and I think This is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I rated it on a 10-star scale created specifically for evaluating television films, I would probably give it 4, maybe even 5. Itâ€™s a real shame that I might have to wait 'until the next sci-fi original film to laugh, and I really hope that this film is not part of the overall enhancement of science science fiction films.
