This is just a joke from the film, they lost me already at the initial scene (Spoilerwarning), a dangerous creature kills another creature in its cage, the scientist who works there on the monitor is watching, and guess what she is doing, well, let's go to cage to check things out, my God, how stupid these authors think that people run into the same thing as jumping in an aquarium with a big white shark, because he ate your goldfish ... Pretty useless and even more stupid And I I will not even talk about the actors, because they are not worth the effort. why they didn't fire the guy who wrote it immediately, it's a mystery to me ..... And this nonsense continues the whole movie. The only good thing is where CGI is better than average for such low-budget films. <br /> <br /> If such things don't bother you, look at them, but be careful, if your IQ is above 60, you probably hate it.
