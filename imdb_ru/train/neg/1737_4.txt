The latest film for Ernst Lubicz, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubiczâ€™s untimely death during production, is a juggling of sophistication and stupidity, romance and music, fantasy and drama of costumes. In a 19th-century castle in southeastern Europe, the countess falls in love with her sworn enemy, the leader of the uprising in Hungary; she is helped by her ancestor, whose painted image magically comes to life. Betty Grable in a long light wig, decorated with flowers, has never been so beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this scenario (Samson Raphaelson, taken from the operetta of Rudolf Shantser and E. Velish) is flooded with various ideas that do not mix - or entertain. The result is beautiful, but disappointing. * 1/2 of ****
