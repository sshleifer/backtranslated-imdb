I was VERY disappointed with this movie. I was expecting more from the Thelma & Louise crime film. Instead, the women running out of prison in this film did not feel loyal to each other. They were an extremely vulgar bundle of hyenas who beat each other, crossed each other twice, and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of being insightful thieves who stuck together to plan escape and find a hidden supply of money, the runaway women were too selfish and evil to trust each other for a long time. These women were not released in a positive sense. They just turned out to be a bunch of talkative guns unable to respect themselves or each other. If you like movies about female crime crimes of the 70s, skip this bomb and watch the Great Texan Dynamite Race, which starred Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Johns.
