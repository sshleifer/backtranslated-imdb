CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Sound format: mono <br /> <br /> During a visit to Rome, a nobleman in love (Nino Castelnuovo ) falls in love with a beautiful young slut (Daniele Gober), but their unlikely romance is opposed by the rich father Castelnuovo (Massimo Cerato), and Fate deals a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> Sexual love source (Alexandre Dumas "La Dame aux Camelias") by screenwriter Michael DeForest, and filmed with special enthusiasm by Radley Metzger, who, along with performers such as Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, are credited with overriding the parameters of an “adult” cinema throughout the 1960s and 70s. Using the last format of his sights in his career, Metzger's research “la dolce vita” is rich in visual abundance (for example, pay attention to the focus on reflective surfaces), although the film’s sexual modernity seems frighteningly modest by modern standards. Production values ​​are beautiful everywhere, and the performances are interesting and humane (Castelnuovo and Gobert are especially remembered), despite the weak rewriting after synchronization. Although they are staged in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini’s astounded designs pinpoint the location of the film during its period, and Piero Piccioni’s “wah-wow” musical accompaniment has become something of a cult object among devotees to exploitation. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of the elegant eroticism of this director will not be disappointed. The next for Metzger was “LICKERISH QUARTET” (1970), which many consider his best film.
