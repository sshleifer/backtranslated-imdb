This attractive (which should not be) low-grade Spanish operation (I would add, rather modest) looks good, eh? Let me rephrase that, huh? Actually the word "eh?" will go through your mind quite a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try either. I just do not know whether it is difficult mysteriously or simply confused, but it is impossible to deny how concise without incidents, it feels strange and verbose. <br /> <br /> Related unrelated sequences (like this unpleasant discovery with the participation of a little girl), a dead cat and fire) in a scanty story with the participation of photographer Mario (played by pompous John Caffari, whose mustache is a dead ringer for the legendary Mario Nintendo What are the chances?), Who throws his girlfriend at home and meets a young lady (superb fixation on Patti Shepard), who he asks to go with him on a photographic task, where they meet some hooded witches on this remote mountain refuge . <br /> <br /> Look through the frustrated plot structure and immerse yourself in that just naughty piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing anxiety. Raul Artigo directs several unusually visual and creepy passages, but for the most part it seems sporadically non-existent and not focused in the same way as his writing. Ramona Sempere's striking cinematography creates gracefully rich landscapes when we discover spectacular views and allow time to have a good time. However, there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what is happening. Fernando García Morcillo’s ominously pompous and frazzled bill terribly combines with the intrusively created dense atmosphere. The presenters are capable, but there is also a strong group (choice of Víctor Israel) of minor appearances. <br /> <br /> Slowly with a little interest, but this dreamy setting (which seems to go even further) manages to keep you looking until it closes.
