Wow. Tonight I went to the video store because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror film and I found this gem. I looked at the cover and thought it looked like a movie for my mood. I brought it home and put it on. <br /> <br /> This film was not a B Horror film that I had in mind. It was MUCH worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got, I did not know that such nonsense exists among men. This film seemed like a 5 year old, wrote and shot it, and it's great. <br /> <br /> I’m an aspiring director, and this film so pissed me off that someone actually pays direct movies to this guy. He needs to work on the landfill of the landfill where he is. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking about renting or buying. I will tell you the same thing as I tell someone who is preparing to commit suicide. “DON'T DO IT, THIS IS NOT WORTH!” I really have nothing to say about this movie. DO NOT DO THIS!
