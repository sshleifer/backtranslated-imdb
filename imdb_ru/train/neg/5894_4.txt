How many centuries will pass until Japanese / Asian horror films give up the long-haired ghost film? Admittedly, they managed to thwart the "Ring" a million times, and often it worked well - which means that originality is not so obligatory in the horror genre (or that I am very uncritical and easy, please?). However, this time I felt a little restless, a little boring. This is not a bad movie, but it is at least half an hour longer than it should be, with its absurd duration of 110 minutes. Compared with many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks the atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the ending is confusing: it makes no sense at all. As for the ringtone: Miike could come up with a melody that would be more effective than this forgettable detail. Although it was played a dozen times, I can't even remember it - how scary it was. Speaking of Miike, this is a commercial enterprise for him, so if someone thinks that he can get a perversion like “Bijita Q” or “Audition”, they are wasting their time.
