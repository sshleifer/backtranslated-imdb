As written on the cover of "Hamlet of our time, for our time." <br /> <br /> I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet immediately after seeing the version of Kenet Branagh, and it was a really disappointing experience. /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the game, including sexuality; One is a VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think that at that time (the 60s) it was a very well-made version of Hamlet, but it cannot be compared with the full version of Bran. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found this video in my local video store (in Australia) and I am actually looking for a Kenet Brande DVD to buy if such a thing exists at all. If anyone knows, please tell me.
