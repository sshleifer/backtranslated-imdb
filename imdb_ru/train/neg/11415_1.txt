Well, it's terrible just a name. This film is a piece of trash. School comedy in a military training camp. I am sorry that I had to give this 1 star, which he did not deserve. <br /> <br /> THIS CAN KEEP SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Practically everything is absolutely forced, unconvincing and unrealistic. HEPO (military police) will not come for you if you do not appear, especially on your wedding day. The actors were rather embarrassed during this scene, because the scene did not work, as it was very unlikely. You can feel it in their voices. Even if they weren't such bad actors, they wouldn't be able to save the scene. <br /> <br /> Next, the guy has to train in his wedding suit. No, there was no time to get his form first. Dude, this is great cinematography! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are GIRLS in the camp - exciting - one of them is even a model, although it doesn't look so great - and the worst. Actress I've ever seen. I doubt that in Hollywood they will allow her to say one line in the movie "Be". <br /> <br /> Alright, girls in the army! Now it becomes fun. The girls are even placed on one floor so that we can get into their room at night! In fact, they will be located in another building at a distance of a quarter of a mile, separated by two fences with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> In our free time we can use tanks for a fun trip, which we have a lot of. No, the tanks are not locked, and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the sounds of the engine, especially at night. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of sex scenes and links, and all of them are below the rubbish line. We need them to be liked by sexually obsessed Germans. Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. Fine! <br /> <br /> One sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Of course, none of these objects will ever be blocked. Military routines are as sloppy as they can be. <br /> <br /> At the end of the insane movie, the Mafia killers are going to take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him! Because he left his bride! Of course, I buy it, the Italians are like this - a jealous bunch (no). <br /> <br /> The bad guys are trying to do it in the light of the day with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again, military training grounds (where they shoot with live ammunition) are open to the public, anyone can freely go or walk there. There are no such things as guards or fences. <br /> <br /> However, this case is hampered by a good captain who launches a rocket in a Italians car in a timely manner. The explosion knocks assassins and an angry bride down. No one at a distance of 40 feet was hurt when the car exploded into smithereens. This is comedy, remember. <br /> <br /> Good. This is a comedy, I understood it, and I can live with it. Realism is not needed. Filmmakers can easily handle this if it is fun, funny, fun or interesting, interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the case. This is just confusing. Robbery of brainless American comedies. The latter, at least, are made professionally, without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's quite boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who watch the whole movie, as I unfortunately did.
