Don't be deceived, like me, by the “glowing” reviews given on the DVD box. “Wildly fascinating”, “seriously scary freak” and, worst of all, “on equal footing with jaws”. This film is none of the above. <br /> <br /> I don’t usually worry about writing bad movie reviews, but I can’t believe this movie is resting in the comfortable 7th minute on IMDb. It does not deserve it. <br /> <br /> After such an open day attack by a monster created by some chemicals thrown off by lazy scientists, this film does not go anywhere, and it goes there untidy. In principle, it’s unbelievable that the girl is caught by a monster (I’ll give them points for the creature’s good design, but it’s not WETA’s creation), and her semi-comic family spends an hour and a half tracking down her ... in the sewers surrounding the Han River. Their search is not waiting - again, someone called it on a par with the Jaws? - and by the time they find her, you will realize that all this was almost meaningless. In addition, most of the film is devoted to state quarantine, which ends with one funny scene in which a guy spits into a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. It was bad. I am not joking. Do you want to watch a movie about a rotten monster? Rent Deep Rising. At the very least, you will save 30 minutes of your life.
