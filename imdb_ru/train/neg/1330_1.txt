There is a reason that Jay Leno himself does not recognize this film. It is always considered one of the worst films of all time. The acting is terrible, the script lacks direction, and the director himself seems not sure which way to take this film. “Friendly Film”, “Action / Comedy”, “Mystery”. It seems, halfway, he gives up, and only for the trip. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It's a shame that they spent their time and gifts in vain to create this mess in the film. Jay Leno and Pat Morita, before doing this, spent years trying to work out their crafts on the Hollywood track. Morita himself was a star, and from the mid-1960s he unswervingly acted as the star of such cult television and film-classic films as Happy Days and gloomy but affable Mr. T and Tina. And he captured the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful movie “Halfway,” “Baby Karate” and many others. Mr. Leno could be seen on television shows from the mid-1970s. And he was the best performer in comedy clubs of America. It can be seen in countless television commercials and in major films. It's a shame that they agreed to be noticed with this nonsense.
