The "seed" torture of porn ... there is no doubt. But, oddly enough, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and shot a more polished film than any other film he has created lately. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch a movie about Boll, I feel that some of the script pages must have disappeared. There are huge gaps in history and dialogue. Of course, this is nothing special. Films in this regard are somewhat surreal. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why are the six police officers who are going to arrest the seeds, parted ways and went their separate ways when they get to the dark residence, Unlike real cops, who will enter and clean the house in pairs or threes? Why do policemen never use their radios? How can bodies decompose so quickly, a process that usually takes many months? (I KNOW it's a frame-by-frame photo ... but the Seed can never stay on schedule, killing people if he always waits until the previous victim disintegrates to the shown point.) Why does the Seed wear overalls and a mask while he waits in death row instead of the usual prison form? How can a Seed enter a high-security prison, stroll through a cell block, and then go out again without stopping or even noticing? If almost 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film) were killed, then why is only one investigator working on this case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go look for the Seed in Semen's house, where he was originally arrested and where he killed his victims? (Didn’t he think to do it before?) Why does a police detective do it alone, without support and not even telling the dispatcher what he is doing and where he is going? <br /> <br /> This is especially frustrating when Ball is obviously trying his best to make sure that we understand why the electric chair does not work properly. He spends a few minutes adjusting the screen when he could spend it on making other aspects of the film at least a little more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> In short, the film serves as a basis for several different scenes (perhaps Ball would have thought of it as their "visions") about the brutal death from clubs, shots to the head, execution by electric shock, as well as the skins of live animals raised for their skins. (The initial animal skinning scenes were really unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The main adornment is undoubtedly the beating of the death of a middle-aged woman with a Seed using an ax. Obviously, a lot of time was spent on this, and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", although without the soundtrack of Steely Dan. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? Not. Worth seeing? Only if you are a staunch fan of the torture of the porno genre, or if you absolutely decided to see a sample of the torture of porn. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this film is rather disgusting and can be disgusting, it is indeed much more competent than most of Boll’s films. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a director. I can only hope that he is progressing for the torture of porn and continues more in the spirit of "Postal".
