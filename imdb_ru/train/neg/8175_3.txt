The mood of this film is pretty good, and it reflects the feeling of the 80s with some good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... The <br /> <br /> script starts out of the mill, with the exception of a couple of comedic moments, and it looks strange where I expect it should be sharp. The characters are completely dramatized, incredible and full of right-wing cliches, which the screenwriter probably saw while watching a documentary about the panorama on the national front. The biggest problem is that this film has no real story. It marks all the correct “artistic” frames, but in fact nothing happens, and in the end you are left wondering what the matter is. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
