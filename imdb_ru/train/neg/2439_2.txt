Dorna von Ruverua's Intensive Therapy is one of the worst horror films ever made. This extremely cheap film from the film "Slasher" offers a bit of blood and a lot of absurd situations. Horror veteran George Kennedy is completely lost as Professor Bruckner. Awful, slow action, and the climax is ridiculous. The famous surgeon was in a car accident. He lies in a coma for seven years, and then wakes up and falls into a bloody riot. The Intensive Therapy is clearly influenced by American slash films. including the series "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th." Murders are funny, and the dialogues are painfully dull. However, if you are in a good mood, you can take a look at this piece of garbage. You will laugh until it hurts alone â€” you can believe me!
