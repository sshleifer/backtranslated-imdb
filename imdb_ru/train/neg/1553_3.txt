This film really deserves the treatment of MST3K. Pseudo-ancient fantasy fairy tale "crack n-slash" with the participation of twin barbarians with a collective IQ of hot water, the names of the characters who seem to have been taken from the book Mad Libs, and such classic lines as "Hold it and open your stomach ! "Barbarians cross the territory" so bad, it's good. "
