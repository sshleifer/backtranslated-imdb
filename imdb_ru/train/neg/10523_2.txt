For the first forty minutes, the Empire really forms itself: it seems to be a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster click. At that time I did not know why, I thought it was good, but now I know. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this film is that it is simply and completely unpleasant. I don’t mind movies with psychos and the like to prove my point, for example, Jackie Brown, but they’re all so terrible about it, but this is clearly added for fun. You literally feel the knot in your stomach. Another major problem is the main character. He is smug, arrogant, but, oddly enough, not so bad. He doesn't look tough enough to be a female drug killer. The fact is that in the end this film is fussy. Not clever, not clever, just boring and meaningless - this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * of ***** (1 of 5)
