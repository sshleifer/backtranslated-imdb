SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: mono <br /> <br /> (black and white) <br /> <br Suffering from “ornophobia”, Ollie embarks on a “peaceful” boat trip, but he and Stan mix with the escaped convict (Richard Kramer). Chaos follows. <br /> <br /> This comedy with a full-length film is a successful recording, which nevertheless unfolds as a simple imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work, marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. Episodic in structure, the film ends with an unforgettable sea voyage after the Boys are taken hostage by the villain Kramer (who shoots a seagull to prove how strong he is!). Gags are all right, but inspiration is not enough, perhaps because of hiring an actor who became director Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for Olli's first solo performance in an era of sound (ZENOBIA, created in 1939), but whose work is not enough Measures Fair, but nothing special. Regular guests L & H Charlie Hall and James Finlayson act as guests.
