Not the best movie that you can remember Paul Our. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredston) is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro would be a shame! His only salvation came because the competition was just as bad. <br /> <br /> This film is described as an adventure and horror. Forget about the horror - it is not. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; just an adventure of Robin Hood against the evil baron (Paul Our), who wants to become king. <br /> <br /> The main feature of the film was the appearance of Graciela Nilsson, who starred in just four films in two years and disappeared for our Regrettable loss. Where did she go?
