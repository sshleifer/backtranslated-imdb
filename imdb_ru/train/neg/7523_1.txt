I took a chance again and rented this bag of shit. It is considered as horror, there was not a single scene, not a single, even remotely frightening. NOT ALONE!! Of course, there was some kind of nudity, but all the lesbian actions were a bit outdated. I suppose maybe it was the saving grace of this film? And Dan, what an annoying ass! From the very beginning I knew that it had hurt me when the first kind old man spoke. And he had to be intimidating? What a laugh !! In general, this film is terrible terrible! How the hell are such films made? If you want a movie with a few thrills, don't shoot this. This film is about as exciting as Teletubbies.
