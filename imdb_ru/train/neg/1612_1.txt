It is incredible that with all the innumerable crimes that were uncovered and unequivocally disclosed at the threshold of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the GULAG Archipelago and the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge, you can still find fans of communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and still lead the propaganda in its favor.

It goes without saying that neither his crimes nor his psychotic statements were included. The fact that both the director and the actor expect the audience to sit in this seemingly endless propaganda film demonstrates the tunnel vision they have in relation to their object of worship.
