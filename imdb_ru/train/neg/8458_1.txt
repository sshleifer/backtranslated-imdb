I bought this movie last weekend at my local cinema gallery. It was buy 2, get 2 for free, and I needed one more, so I chose this one. A terrible mistake The box says that it will be a really good movie. Well, it all starts as if it were a great movie. About 5 minutes. The film tells about a young woman, Leyla, who is killed trying to save her handsome Jack from the bull. Laila's dad, Cordoba, is the rancher owner of which the townspeople are afraid. He assumes that Jack killed Leila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes on this hunt to find him. It was the first 5 minutes, that's good. What follows will only be 100 times worse. The one who wrote the script, in my opinion, should have been on some strange trip or something like that, because nothing else made any sense. Jack is on the run and finds this DJ named Mary, who drives him up. I think Maria should be a virgin character. You know, mother of Jesus. But, who knows, I could not make of this head or tail. While they are running ... we see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly meetings, memories, etc. ... And all this is done in such a way that your brain suffers from trying to understand what is happening. Needless to say, I took the film back and traded it for something else. This is terrible, I tell you, terrible. And thereâ€™s absolutely no bullfighting in this movie. Except for the first minute of the movie. I hope I helped other people not to waste their time on this film.
