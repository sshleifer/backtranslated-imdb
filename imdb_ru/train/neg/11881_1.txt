This film is not like Office Space, except indoors. The office space was fun. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, because I have never laughed once for the whole movie. Mr. Kornbluth's smug tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexandrov in one room. If you decide to watch this movie, use the free rental or watch it in someone else's house so you can leave if necessary.
