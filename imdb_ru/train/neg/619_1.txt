WOW is all I can say if you read it or watch it or think about it. believe me, look! <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard at so many parts of this film that the worst movie ever played was very funny! I can't believe they put a mark on the school! I must have played this scene over and over again to laugh more and more each time. If such a film can be made, it gives us hope to create our own films. even the suit was bad. Looks like my 7 year old cousin could do better. Hell, I bet he could write and act better. all I know is that I have to look at the second part to see if it was as bad as the first. This is a cool idea about a killer scarecrow, but much better work could be done. hopefully another deadly dummy will come out, but not like this one.
