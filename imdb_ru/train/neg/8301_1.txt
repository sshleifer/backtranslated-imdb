Really bad. Why someone thinks this is a good movie, not to mention ridiculous, is a real mystery. I love comedies just like the next man, and I liked Christmas Carol. The fact that he has the same director and is based on the memoirs of the same author, I was completely puzzled why this film is such a complete failure at all levels. Charles Grodin is very mistakenly considered the father for beginners. On the other hand, he does not seem to have the same stimulation - he just does not flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life that penetrated the first film is completely absent here - you just want the film to end. I would not even recommend this movie to curiosity lovers who liked Christmas Carol. This is so bad. 1/10
