The film is a collection of cliches about anything. It has no focus, no goals, no real message. The symbolism is repressed, stereotypes are common and outrageous. This film cannot resist the temptation to make a drama where there is none. Every small exchange of words immediately turns into a long, unjustified dialogue, typical of the rehearsal of the actor's class. Where there is no point in this exchange, the actors (no matter how good they are usually) cannot fail to compensate for this with exaggerated emotions, in other words, “raising the stakes”. Simply put, simply put. Direction here will not help. Nothing can save this non-story. Forced, forged and bored to tears. Inaccuracies in punk rock carrying with The Who, piercings and bright 90s outfits. Characters roam without a role, detail and motive. Places are arbitrary. These are “Boogie Nights” and “Good Family” and “Saturday Night Fever” with meaning and art. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I will do it. <br /> <br /> Some films have flaws. This film is a flaw in Lee. It is sold, like everyone else. Became irrelevant. He has nothing more to say. <br /> <br /> I have no desire to see anything from this guy again (which I will not name now).
