Thank you, Hollywood. Another classic film completely destroyed by a cheap, shallow, heavy and odd remake effect. The original "Planet of the Apes" was smart and thought-provoking film with a very clear message. It was a film almost entirely dedicated to dialogue, which sounds very boring, but in fact was very interesting. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film seems to have done away with almost ALL dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we get an incredibly stupid two-hour chase movie. The dialogue has been kept to a minimum, the interaction of characters and development is absent, and in most cases it is very difficult to understand what is happening. Instead, we get a bunch of meaningless battle scenes, some funny single-row lines and very empty quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this film is that it looks absolutely fantastic. Makeup monkeys are great, and the scenery and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that “Planet of the Apes (2001)” is a very superficial and simplified film, filled with thin paper characters, silly dialogue and an almost non-existent plot. Please, Hollywood, stop spoiling the great movies by turning them into meaningless blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the final did not make us think. <br /> <br /> * of **** stars mainly for visual effects <br /> <br />
