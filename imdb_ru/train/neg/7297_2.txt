From the introductory dialogue and scenes, I knew that I knew that a train wreck was waiting for me. Did not want to look, but could not turn away. If it were not for the sweet eyes of this film, I would have given one star. The fact that the interaction between the characters and the behavioral relationships were so contrived that it was added by bad leadership and a terrible story makes this film no more than a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity for making a good movie. But this film fails so badly that there was no way to rebound. <br /> <br /> If you are stuck in the woods, your best childhood friend dies from an unknown illness, other friends die around you, in a strange place, what would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Run away from everyone and try your luck yourself. B.) Have sex with a friend of a friend. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows, including shaving your legs. D.) Hit his best childhood friend in the head and fall in love with a shovel for life. E.) All of the above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers are so contrived. In fact, they are all believable and well represented in the Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and the illogical attempt to explain what people will do in traumatic situations, throws this film in the trash in your local box office. Stay away. Stay away.
