Primal Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists get a surprise when their cargo contains live dinosaurs. An army commando team must now think quickly if they want to prevent the extinction of the human race, not reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and get the first impressions of the film. That pretty much it. Acting is only acceptable for a few characters. The story is bad, the whole film is based on the army and marines trying to kill dinosaurs. This film was released three years after the “Jurassic Park”. Instead, this film seems to have been released 13 years before Jurassic Park. Dinosaur costumes are so poorly made, and I mean costumes. Obviously, people got dressed, and this film does not try to hide it. The scene when the dinosaur is running down the corridor is created in such a way that it seems that someone is riding this creature. One good thing that comes out of this movie. Short run time. In just 1 hour and 15 minutes, it does not waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> “It's like Friday the 13th Nightmare.” - Officer (Brian Kerry)
