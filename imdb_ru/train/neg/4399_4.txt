Tapeheads, the patchwork, intermittently funny parody of the music video business, may have been the perfect short comedy film, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins effortlessly in the midst of senseless chaos. They play two half-intelligent security guards in Los Angeles who base their own company, Video Aces, making funny video clips for groups, parties and one star on their deathbed. It is a pity that the filmmakers had to invent an obscure side story to gain time to run (fraud involving the dishonest politician and his minions, who do little but take away the main force of the film, pouring out the musical culture of the late 80s). However, Cusack and Robbins create several originals here: a know-it-all, but a free, street mind, not being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same crazy wave, and they never lower each other. They are real friends in comedies. * 1/2 of ****
