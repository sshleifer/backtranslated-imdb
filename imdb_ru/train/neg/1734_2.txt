I am a big fan of old westerns and do not believe that Hollywood is able to capture its old glory. But even Rhonda Fleming and Stewart Granger cannot help this film of 1957, in which there are almost all the banal characteristics of westerns of a reformed shooter who has become a good guy. a fallen but virtuous woman, fanatical townspeople who must turn to the shooter for salvation, etc. I cannot fail to notice the name of the writer and the young “actor” who plays the son of Granger. Any nepotism there? I have seen how best to play in school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Have I already reached 1000 words?
