This is the worst that TMNT franchise has ever created. I was a kid when it came out, and I still thought it was a deuce, although I liked the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that I remember when a mafia guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's terrible. Many fans hate the show for turning on the female tortoise, but that didn't bother me. So much so that I did not even remember it, until recently I read about the series. In general, it is terribly forgettable. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure, they call it ... Nananana Ninja ...
