I have a tip for people who also made this film, if you are going to make such a film, make sure you have a d / x to support it. Also do not force to play actors from the z-list. One more thing, almost all of us have seen the Jurassic Park, so do not copy it brazenly. In general, this film sucked, f / s sucked, acted sucked, the story is unoriginal. Let's talk for a second about acting, about the guy from Carradine, whose career peaked in 1984, when he starred in "Revenge of the Fools" (it was a really great comedy). He is not quite a list, he can act. He just had to say no to this bag. He had to do what Mark Hamill did after the Return of the Jedi, and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as a “nerd,” and this should have been so. I understand that he has bills to pay, but this hardly justifies this bag. Did I already call this movie this? OK. I just wanted to be sure. If I sound a little hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2 hours of my life, I could spend it on doing something productive, for example, to watch how the peeling of paint, and I feel deceived. I will close this note. Thank you for your time.
