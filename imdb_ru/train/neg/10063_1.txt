Now I have never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what about the songs in the movie, what is the physiological significance of it? Wow, some crazy pokemon appear and they multiply, and I can get a fit from this. Animie is meaningless, her creators are meaningless, her big marketing scheme looks just cut down on songs, and they get a good rating, I think this film would be good if they released a message that you should see in all the Pok√©mon episodes that happens and this is not a movie. This is just an animation that should be on the video. <br /> <br /> PS: I will give her 1, because I just got 5 bucks, I could not give him half, because there are no halves.
