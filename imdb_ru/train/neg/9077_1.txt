If you like films such as American Pie, Autotravel and Van Wilder; Avoid this cinematic trash at all costs. This is an inappropriate, despicable, tasteless waste of resources that should never be discussed out loud; much less is actually registered and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months; numbness is bad for all 86 minutes of his work. If it had been much longer, I would not have been able to write this review without using profanity. Consider yourself warned!
