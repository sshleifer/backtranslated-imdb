Nobody is a big fan of the works of Fleerman Gerodge Macdonald Fraser than me. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see Richard Lester just being staged by Royal Flash, as I also see that he did Three / Four Musketeers with Fraser, which I, however, turned out to be pretty not bad <br /> <br /> Not very royal flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the film was released and I could not be more enthusiastic since I read all the Flashman newspapers published before that time and was intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm McDowel (I still, but he was never given a chance after that). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw it again when I was about 20 years old on TV, and it seemed even worse). <br /> <br /> None of the sharp dialogs in the books is transferred to the screen. It seemed to me that the comedy with the Flashman character was incorrectly worked out in the same way as one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it. Duel and fencing were terrible and not dramatic. <br /> <br /> Looking back with more mature eyes, the film was not able to complete the use of the direct satire features of earlier versions of The Prisoner of Zenda. <br /> If you read the book and have not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming good friends and playing the game that Rudi just invented: Russian Roulette. <br /> <br /> Pathetic betrayal of everything the book is about. <br /> <br /> My comments would have been more direct if I had seen the movie just recently, but I'm glad I did not see it. <br /> <br /> If by any chance Fraser ever reads this, I can only say that I consider him a genius — perhaps the greatest comic writer of his generation, but based on my assessment of this corpus of works, it’s difficult believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, like all those horrible Roger Moore films about James Bond.
