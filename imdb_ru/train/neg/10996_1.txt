The underground comedy film is probably one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known what would be bad when the phrase “guaranteed to insult” was written on the box ... meaning that the filmmakers would focus more on putting you out of yourself than making you laugh. <br /> <This film is an amateurish confusion of children's scenes, bad characters and worst jokes ... from the pathetic sketch of Batman to the painfully unfriendly parody of Arnold Schwollenpecker, they are simply not funny. A few funny parodies are small and far apart - for example, Michael Clark Duncan plays a gay virgin - but even they go on too long and are destroyed by Vince Offer’s incompetence in a comedy. <br /> <br /> Hold the underground comedy film underground ... bury it!
