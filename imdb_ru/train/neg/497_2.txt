This is really a dumb movie. It may be fun with cool looking aliens and country settings, but it’s not. <br /> <br /> Some aliens hear the “War of the Worlds” broadcast when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and behave foolishly. The cover of the film depicts aliens traveling on surfboards in space ... not exactly what they are doing. These are not party aliens, they are stupid caricature idiots with annoying high modulated voices. The alien with the most tolerant voice also turned out to be the fiery alien Jack Nicholson, who always wears his sunglasses. In addition to aliens, the game is terrible. This letter is clearly intended for children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid film that only children will appreciate. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 100 minutes PG for a soft tongue.
