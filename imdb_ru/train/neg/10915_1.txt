I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism and respect some elementary military principles. The star hardly does the first. The star, being a Russian war film, waited for patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic pictures, a loud musical score, Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans. What I do not need is a naive-love affair, unrealistically stupid war scenes and the abuse of a syrupy soundtrack in a film that thoroughly avoids all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, the Holocaust) only to end in passing but still offensive to our meaning of history note on the "liberation of Poland". Missed opportunity as a film, but not as propaganda, apparently.
