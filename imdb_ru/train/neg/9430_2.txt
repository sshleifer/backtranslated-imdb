I was also fooled by the packaging. I also fell in love with the bloody packaging and the DVD case, which says that “distressed fans, like every copy was pulled from the shelf” Although it was inexpensive ($ 6.99), in fact it was not worth it - no big deal limited blood. The ending was very stupid and did not bring the blow that was supposed to be. I really don't even know how it became “Video Nasty” with how it is very tamed. The story stretches, the heroes are explicit amateur actors ... it does not match the promise. The DVD bonus feature (“interview”) is very strange, since the director looks very inconsistent and not everyone. The lead actress speaks as if she appears in a Shakespearean production. This is a great laugh.
