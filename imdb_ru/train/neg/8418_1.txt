Yes, there are great performances. Unfortunately, they occur in the context of the film, which seems to have no idea what he is doing. During the first 45-60 minutes, all the music sounds like a realistic performance. Suddenly, in about an hour, the characters, who until this moment had always spoken to each other, suddenly begin to sing to each other. To be even more confused, a little further, from nowhere, they actually spend about 15 minutes of uninterrupted dialogue, then seem to discard this idea and move on to other things, such as a number that starts in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars , suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive invisible string section. On top of all this discrepancy in the way music is used, the apparent inability of composers to actually write music in a style that is supposedly depicted. While the first few pieces imitate the sound of the 1950s Motown, the rest of the film is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there is the sheer stupidity of excerpts from a group doing a bad imitation of the Jackson family and Eddie Murphy, transforming from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he began channeling Stevie Wander, I couldn't help but laugh. It was one of those films that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth, and resent that I spent two hours watching this movie.
