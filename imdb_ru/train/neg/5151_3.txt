I thought it was a great idea, but, boy, it was poorly executed. We have a general idea of ​​how complex and complex operations are behind the scenes of the show, but there is almost no information about what works from this. The producers did not seem to have found a way to tell the story or give the viewer a "through line." (This does not mean that they did not try, but the presence on the stage of the stage is linked by a brief overview of the “Ring” cycle, since the program’s narration doesn’t tell us anything about the physical installation work of the opera.) <br /> <br /> We see that a lot of things are happening, but we are told little about what people are doing and why. There is no particular sense of who is who or how the various production departments fit and work together. For example, several times we hear about a problem - then we can expect that she will see the problem and its consequences and / or how it will be solved. But instead, directors, as a rule, simply move on to something else (as a rule, quite common shots when people are pushing things or talking in a headset). <br /> <br /> In general, the film ultimately looks like a set of images that you see. mileage under the final captions of the show, and not something worthwhile to watch for its own merit.
