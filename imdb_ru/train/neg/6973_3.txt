I didn't even know that this film existed until I found its old copy of VHS hidden deep in my dusty horror cabinet. The heading on the box read “Insect”, and in the pictures behind it was clear that this was just another minor and poorly prepared horror film of the 80s. Of course, they can be fun if they do not expect a reasonable script and while you are not annoyed to see a huge amount of cheese make-up effects. Almost every important aspect that makes a horror movie worth watching is substandard here in Blue Monkey! The plot is ridiculous and extremely unoriginal, the actors' performances are painful to watch and there is a complete lack of expectation. Following the always popular trend in the “big beetle” films, Blue Monkey talks about new and unknown insect species that kill doctors and patients at a remote hospital. The creators could not be more evasive in relation to the actual origin of this giant huge creature! All we know is that it is not from space and initially crawled out of a tropical plant. Other than that, there is absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect suddenly appeared! As I said, do not rely on intelligent scenario. The first half of the film is quite interesting, with a small amount of blood and the presentation of a pair of insane characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic!), But the second half (when the entire hospital is quarantined) is terribly boring. rob old (and best) movies. Approaching the climax, they, apparently, also exhausted the budget, since the lighting becomes very bad, and the guy in the monster costume is no longer very well disguised. "Blue Monkey" is worth a look at if you are really bored or you really want to watch every 80s horror movie ever made. B-cinema fans can recognize John Vernon ("Killers-Clowns from Space", "Curtains") in the small and meaningless role of Roger, who runs the clinic.
