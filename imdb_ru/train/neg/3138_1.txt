I see people writing how great this film is. It was terrible! Acting was at best irregular. He made a lot of money because teenage girls went to watch a movie 7 times in theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to know more about the Titanic; why it sank, that ran through the minds of many people; maybe even a small conspiracy. Does anyone realize that some people did not even board the ship, because there was a fire on it before it even took off? No, because all you see is a rich girl who falls in love with a poor boy, and he draws her naked (did this banal trash even warn you that the film was stupid?). <br /> <br /> I cried during one scene though. The scene when they showed the water that filled the ship. It was like water in the pool! I think this film earned all this money, and they could not even make the water from the ocean look real? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Oooh, the band played while the ship sank ... It's just ridiculous. It was the worst movie before Pearl Harbor surpassed it in the “Nothing to do with reality” section.
