I really did not like this movie .... mainly because of the main characters! They are both immature, selfish and selfish people. They hurt everyone around by playing their stupid game. The visual effects were good, but how good they are if there are no characters with whom you communicate, or an interesting storyline. Should I be happy when these two psycho-people FINALLY end their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this film, I thought: “Is this supposed to be the No. 1 hit from France?” ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br / > <br /> As for the end: GOOD DELAY! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
