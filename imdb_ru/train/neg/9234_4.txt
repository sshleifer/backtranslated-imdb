Reworked today, this film would have been a very creepy, very disturbing dark comedy. The harassment, obsession, cobwebs of lies and manipulations are given by the gloss of 1948 "they are not so pretty." Drake plays the pursuer, a shameless user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays the victim of the pursuit, alternately angry and forgetful. Since then, I have not been able to look at classic romances with the same distrust. <br /> <br />
