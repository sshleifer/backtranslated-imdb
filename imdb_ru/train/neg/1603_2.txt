If it were not for the speeches of Barry Diamond and Art Evans in the role of stupid youths, I would have no reason to recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around a 10-year high school reunion that takes place in the supposedly abandoned high school (more like a prop from a low-cost horror movie from the 1950s), and a deranged class student made a very traumatic joke. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters too much, as only one student was killed, as well as a dining lady (Ann Ramsey from Goonies). We are led to believe that the horny doubles is killed, but we will never see the damned thing! This is a terrible film that continued the downward spiral of National Lampoon throughout the 80s and 90s.
