I read the book and the book was exciting. <br /> <br /> This film, its direction, script and acting were completely unbearable. I cringed because of the lack of a script that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity and courage to illustrate the boldness of a great story based on facts. <br /> <br /> I see why this film was not released to the general public in most cities. I do not recommend this movie to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Simply put, one of his worst adaptations, which I saw, turned into a plot, not devoted to the study of heaven on earth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was truly the only event. But how could it fail when they were filmed in a country as beautiful as Peru? <br /> <br /> For potential spectators do not waste your time and energy on this flop.
