I have to say that I hated this movie. I donâ€™t like to say this because Gerard Butler is involved. About half an hour of boring conversation, I'm sorry everyone who really cares about the plot, I turned to the scenes of Jerry. I really do not know the ending, I was bored with it. If Jerry was not in it, I probably did one of two things: I fell asleep or turned it off, but Jerry is the bright light of this film, like in most of his earlier films. If you are a fan of Jerry, do not worry, it is as delightful and valuable as always, but if you really want to watch the movie on the plot, good luck, because you need it, or something, or a lot of coffee or soda, so that you do not sleep ! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and this is only because the director had a reason to include Jerry in this film, although they had no idea how to spell his name!
