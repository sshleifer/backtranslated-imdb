Man, that was fun. This should be under COMEDY. Or stupid. It would be much easier to understand what a bunch of stinkers are. Seriously? I want someone associated with this film to act immediately. For anyone who is thinking about watching this "movie", let's look at a few plot points. Oh wait. There are none. There is literally no plot. I think that Casper Van Dien was boring, and he decided to shoot something with someone by chance, and somehow miraculously it somehow got on the videotape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. You do not trust me? Go watch it. Do it, man. Try it. But be prepared to gouge out your eyes. If you can survive this without blowing up a cow, you are very strong and brave.
