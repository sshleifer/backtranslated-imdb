For a home audience, I see how they will applaud this film. For outsiders who have no personal interests, this did not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent, and the Russians as heroes. The supposedly romantic corner was redundant and distracting. The way a young woman could “love” a lieutenant, just seeing him was nonsense. As she could, as mentioned at the end of the film, never get married just because this passion was behind me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots, and this was demonstrated in the pursuit of the swamp. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the swamp. Therefore, the Russians hid, and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and just stood there listening. I guess they didn’t want to wet their shoes, but I’m sure the officer would order 20 or 30 men into the water to search the swamp. But that would end the story. Also, the Germans entered the barn, where the Russians hid in the attic and did not shoot at the roof. At worst, some soldier would throw a grenade into the attic and not climb the stairs to look inside. <br /> <br /> I saw some reviewers who said they cried at the end. I wonder why? You knew that this small group would die, and there’s nothing to worry about.
