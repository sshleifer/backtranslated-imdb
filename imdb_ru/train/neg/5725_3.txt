2005 gave us a very decent “Gore porn” hostel flick out and 2006 gave us live food; not very decent plagiarism hostel. The Live Feed follows almost the same formula as the previous Eli Roth movie, except this time the silly children live in Asia, not in Central Europe. The plot focuses on these stupid children, and one of them annoys one of the locals, so they are in trouble. The locals decided to lock them all up in the theater and kill them. Despite the fact that I heard about this film are not the most favorable things, before watching it, I still hoped that it would be at least half decent, because director Ryan Nicholson had previously shot a very decent 45-minute film about rape and revenge “Torched,” but this film is crumbling simply because most of it is funny or boring. Obviously, the film is trying to recall the good old days of the Grindhouse cinema (which the Hostel did successfully), but in fact it did not work. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work in the field of special effects - even the blood is not impressive ... although it is much better than acting skills! I can say nothing more about this film ... it is bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!
