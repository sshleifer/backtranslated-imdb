There were no huge stars in this film, but there was a very good cast, filled with excellent supporting actors and Gene Tierney, before she became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospe Callea and Cederick Hardwick, you expect more from the movie than it really is. I suspect that much of this is due to the second-rate script, as director Henry Hathaway was a competent and authoritative person at the head. <br /> <br /> The film was made in East Africa during World War II. - just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while the subversive Nazi elements are trying to cause problems among the locals. One of the white men in the film is a double dealer working to destroy the British Empire! But the beautiful Tierney, who plays the daughter of the Sultan (!), Wants to help save the day for a good old Britain. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers have long sided with the Empire, and the 1930s and 40s saw a lot of pro-imperial films. Nowadays, with an altered sensitivity, the idea of ​​seeing happy black Aborigines dying for the queen and country seems ridiculous - and it would be difficult to root for either side! However, at one time this propaganda material was effective in increasing support for the British - although, if you watch today, the film suffers from a verbose script and stupid casting. One bright moment in the film is the final battle between George Sanders and the enemy agent. It is a pity that after such a powerful scene the film seemed to be just talking and talking, losing some of its impact.
