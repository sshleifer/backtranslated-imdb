After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb, I was delighted with this movie. But this is really a terrible film, the total time you see an alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the film is a cheap wait), an acting game at the very beginning, oh boy, what story? <br /> The story does not seem to go in any direction, at first they capture an alien (after 7 years! they finally succeed), then they don’t know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (what the hell did they capture it for?). Then the girl who plays in the first place wants to get away from this madness, then suddenly she does not do this, then she does it again, and then not. Then they conclude that killing an alien will kill the entire human race (and remember that over the years no other person has seen these permanently residing aliens) and what do they do? They torture him and take a bunch of aliens into the world. <br /> <br /> This is my first IMDb review, I'm a very lazy person who doesn’t write very soon, so listen to my warning: the movement is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
