If you look at it without the slightest idea of ​​what is at stake, then a surprise awaits you. Even then, the synopsis drew a picture of a rather sane storyline, but the actual film is completely different. <br /> <br /> In the course of the synopsis, he talks about an obsessed climber, whom you will see as a prologue before the opening credits and a text crawl, which tells about the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in the dreamy manuscripts of the mind (pay attention to yourself this causes problems with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortal, eager for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and notice all the people of this climber, and a brief overview explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intellectual sphere for meeting with a person. <br /> <br /> What this translated is a recurring part of the animation that a 5-year-old child can create. Create figures, although you should pay tribute to the style of "Stop the movement" and lead him through a vicious circle. And repeat until your eyes start closing, then move on to the next scene. In any case, the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing to conjure up this magical sphere, and spend a field day playing with it before releasing it into the “other” world. It also does not get better when a person interacts with a sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep-inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Thank God, of course, that the execution time is less than what is advertised, which is 57 minutes. (or less) against 70 declared. While solidly outdated, its dull colors, non-existent history, clumsy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will not win a single fan. Do not waste your time.
