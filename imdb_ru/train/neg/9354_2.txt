There is a key aspect of the film that Jobson seems to have forgotten - he has the opportunity to tell a story by showing it to you. You do not need to tell the audience what to think, because they will see it. The action here is interspersed with one of the most high-profile narratives unleashed on the unsuspecting public, the violet prose of the sensitive fifth ex. And this should not be unnecessary, because there is a good cast and some beautifully designed and removed visual effects. Perhaps Jobbo felt that the main story needed some support. And, perhaps, he was right, he lacks basic trust: in the 70s in Edinburgh there were not many beautiful smart girls with a penchant for the velvet underground and a weak point for a passing sociopath. From too neat and new-looking clothing that the character wears, to cod intellectualism that is trying to tie it all together - itâ€™s all too much invented, for my taste.
