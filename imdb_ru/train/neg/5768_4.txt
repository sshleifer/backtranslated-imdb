Well, at first I was excited to download an open source animated film, only to be spoiled by a demo. The animation is great, lip sync is terrible, and you continue to watch the movie, hoping to understand what is happening, only to understand that nothing is happening. You do not feel emotions to the characters, only pity for the creators that they are wasting their time. I have seen short films with doubled emotions twice! It could be a great short film if they just took the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone in Blender is happy to showcase his software and its rendering capabilities, but I'm sorry guys tell stories about what makes a movie
