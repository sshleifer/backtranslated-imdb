When to start ?! I feel ... disturbed! That's right, broken! I spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours, which I could spend on doing something more useful, for example, to see how the paint dries, on this so-called horror film. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's inactive, nothing ... <br /> <br /> Its predictability, boringness, tragedy ... <br /> <br /> Here I am I can be a little harsh, but watch this movie and you will feel the same ... or ... no, do not watch it ... unless you want to feel offended.
