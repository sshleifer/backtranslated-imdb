For a horror film created for television, the film began very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and mystery of the film. But the ending was a complete disappointment. The film moved quickly and developed, it seemed, in any case, to a very climatic end. But guess whatâ€™s the end. The film has just ended, and after almost an hour and a half, viewers are just wondering what happened. Why all the unanswered questions in the film remained unanswered. There was no explanation at all about one of the key points of the plot. This film is like watching the murder mystery and then never know who did it. Very disappointed. This film looks as if the producers simply have no money left and he never finished the film Real BOMB!
