I rented it on DVD, and I feel a little uncomfortable, as Dawson and Lugashi are so serious about comments on DVD. This is not a bad film at all, but it is one of those films that desperately want to comment deeply on human nature, not realizing that its history is practically a genre. In addition, in many ways this is a bit simplistic, and the behavior of the characters often undermines faith. I would say that this is a film from which you get something, if you donâ€™t have a lot of movies / TV / literature / life behind you (frankly, I saw almost the exact same story in horror comics). Otherwise, his point of view was made earlier and more skillfully. And this leads to a big problem, which lies in the fact that he really does not have much cinematic interest in this, except for the essence. In the end, this is a rather soft film that puts everything into the idea that the main story will be shocking and convincing, and in fact it does not pay off.
