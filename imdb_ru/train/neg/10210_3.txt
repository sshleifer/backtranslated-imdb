It is hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now, it seems, only makes Hollywood thrillers "by numbers". <br /> <br /> This is a very light material by John Grisham, crossed with the plot of a television film. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a furious and independent investigator who specializes in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her reserved cop partner Sam Kennedy, and together they create an uncomfortable duet. It is not good when two unbalanced college students (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them in pursuit of the wild goose - dropping off very clever and misleading evidence at the crime scene. <br /> <br /> Fair enough, but as long as Bullock and Chaplin cannot create any sparks, we also have to endure some boring over-melodramatic memories illustrating an important event in Cass history. Then, of course, there are frequent shots from a log cabin on the cliff side, where there is no doubt that the ending of the OTT will be fixed. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Watch any CSI episode instead. It is to the point and much more exciting.
