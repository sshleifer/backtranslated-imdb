"Pyare Mohan" can be easily included in the black list of one of the worst films of mankind. The film, one of the many films about people with disabilities that arose after the phenomenal success of blacks, is a mockery of the fraternity with disabilities. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are simply caricatures of people with disabilities. While Black depicted the urgency and emotions of a disabled woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyar Mohan shows two monkey-like monkeys that are not shy of being disabled, and beats up half the world to protect their love interests. The music of Anu Malik is fairly honest. Vivek Oberoi, who made a promising start with Saatia, unfortunately, quickly loses his balls in the Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from participating in the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just cute girls in distress who have nightmarish times in Tialand and no one can save them - except for the aforementioned desperate. Boman-Iranian, like the villainous Don Tony, is perfectly acceptable. Avoid the movie if possible.
