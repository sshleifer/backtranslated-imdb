GET STARTED SPOILER: Enough funny and memorable for the literal scene of smoking Roach Mr. Chong: Chong quietly rubs a homeless kitchen cockroach into the bowl of his pipe, lights up, coughs and brutally hacks for a seeming eternity, then with perfect aplomb and not missing a blow, the bowl, lights up again, reboots. END SPOILER. Alas, I began to lose faith in less than the middle of the process. It occurred to me that the dull duet was disgusting and less than worthy. I came to the conclusion to evaluate the relative sophistication of modern stoners, Harold and Kumar. I just prefer a bright company. Nevertheless, the film is probably ideal for the baked brotherhood brothers or those viewers who are so weak-minded that the stoner outwitted them when they ... the first sober ones. Guest appearance by Paul Rubens, spewing obscenity in uniform in front of Pee-Wee.
