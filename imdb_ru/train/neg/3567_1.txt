A family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mom Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaise Berdalh and around 3-year-old Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful house in Maine - it seems, unaware of the floor, which roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so! A neighbor on the road (wonderful Fred Gwynn) makes them feel at home ... and shows them a pet graveyard where children bury their pets. But a little further it’s sacred a land that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead are back in an unpleasant mood. <br /> <br /> "" SPECIFIED SPOILERS ** Stephen King's novel was good - it was long, but it developed characters and situations that made you take care of what happened. This film casts EVERYTHING character development and just playing blood and violence. Animals are killed by the camera (I know it is fake, but it is still disgusting); a little boy hit the floor and his box opens at a funeral (in a completely sick scene), he returned to life and assaults and murders of people including his mother Tion wonder how three year old girl could hang of it); the ghostly runner (don't ask) is trying to help the family for no reason ... The film simply makes the audience push every horrible death or violence into your face. It just struggles to shock you. ** THE END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Acting does not help. Midkiff is just awful, like a father - he is handsome and amiable, but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. Two kids are just annoying. Only Gwynn alone saves this picture thanks to his easy and good game. <br /> <br /> This picture shows complete contempt for the audience, making great leaps in logic and forcing heroes to do incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This film was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989, which led to an even worse sequel in 1992. I saw him then in the theater and was alarmed at how the public continued to encourage violence, and I was just shocked by what I saw, The sick, disgusting horror film. A 1 full. <br /> <br /> When you think it's all over and can't get worse, the Ramones sing the title song !!!!!! (“I don’t want to be buried in the pet graveyard”). Truly incredible
