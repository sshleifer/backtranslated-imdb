I'm a big fan of David Lynch, and I have everything he did on a DVD, except for the Hotel Room and the two-hour movie Twin Peaks. So when I found out about it, I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... what is it? This is a bunch of rough-drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and dirty, unbearable. Maybe I don’t know what is good, but maybe it’s just nonsense that was imposed on the public under the name of David Lynch to earn a few dollars too. Let me make it clear that I did not care about the obscene language part, but had to continue to adjust the sound, because my neighbors could have. Overall, this is a very disappointing release, and may have just been left in the suite for curiosity. I strongly recommend that you do not spend money on it. 2 out of 10.
