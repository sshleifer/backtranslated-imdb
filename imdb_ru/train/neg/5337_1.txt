There are so many negative reviews about “Stay away, Joe,” that I just can't keep silence any longer and let this injustice happen. This is the side you have not heard about. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's films are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are ideal films for pure relaxation, because I don’t need to think when I watch them, It means that I don’t need to worry about the absence of a complex plot , because there is never a proper plot to begin with. I can just throw off my shoes, take a beer, sit back, turn off my brains and enjoy all the common wacky and catchy melodies of rock and roll from the finest decade of them all. <br /> <br /> In my books, Stay Away, Joe definitely falls into the category of “so bad, it's good.” Now, if you are like me and appreciate the "value of garbage", this is the best experience of the camp of the 1960s. It's so bad that looking almost surreal, and when you think that it cannot be worse, it surprises you in the most imaginable ways. In the end, you are so amazed at all the new levels of stupidity that you simply don’t know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell: I love it because it's so damn funny that there used to be a generation that actually made such films. Although I still give him 1 out of 10 - as soon as he gets into the bottom 100, he will immediately become the classic of a bad movie.
