Well. Astronaut Steve West is sitting in a plastic space capsule, commenting that “you didn’t live until you saw the sun through Saturn's rings”, while the obvious midday sunlight streamed through the window when suddenly he has nosebleeds. West then returned home to some kind of secret hospital, a melting gelatinous mass that goes berserk and causes the nurse to run through a fake glass door. Obviously, the West "becomes stronger when it melts," which has almost the same meaning as everything in this hopelessly puristic, mixed with the brain of the movie. Then this stupid "Army Brass", which looks like Coleman Francis (director of many bad films), tries to hide the information, but the madman runs around, killing everyone he sees because he is melting. He attacks the quarreling old couple because he is melting. He makes one horrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minutes because he is melting. It melts because it melts. Star Uncle Rick Baker is supposed to be a star here, but they just look weird. The film is poorly filmed, and everything looks so gloomy and confusing that it is very difficult to figure out what's what, and not that it will help anyone. MooCow says, who cut the cheese with this ?? : = 8P PS - "Didn't you get any crackers?"
