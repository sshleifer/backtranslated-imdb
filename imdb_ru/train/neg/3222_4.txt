I was very disappointed in this 1970 film, based on the story of Bernard Malamud. This is basically a story of possible ransom, racial bias and dissatisfaction with life, based on distrust. <br /> <br /> A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) believes only in an angel (Belafte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris is basically disappointed in life and simply refuses to believe that Belafte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he believes in this, Fanny improves, but in the end he has doubts, and Fanny suffers accordingly. It would be very nice if there was an English translation in the last scene, when the dying Fanny speaks to Morris. <br /> <br /> Ian Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her brilliant Oscar presentation in the 1966s, “The Store on Main Street” also directs this film. , and her kindness in her speech really does not convey the desperate situation she faces. She continues to call on Ruti, their daughter, who did not obey them, marrying the Jewish religion. . <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is confusing, and the scene which Angel's girlfriend confronts Belafte in their apartment, memorable, but everything is too brief. <br /> <br /> We do not know why Belafte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this the film should have left the theater in a state of depression and despair.
