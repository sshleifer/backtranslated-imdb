I don't know what you guys are breathing in, but please stop. This film was complete shit. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin, and Kevin McCallister was sweet, sweet, sweet, loving and extremely funny to watch. He had this innocence, but at the same time he was strong. <br /> <br /> This new baby, Alex? Annoying like all hell! Just a blatant robber who tried to compare with the charm and grace of Kalkin, but at the same time failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Villains, complete nonsense. Harry and Marv, they were so interesting on the team screen. They were comedic, they were humorous, and they just made you really want to root for Kalkin even more, which is what a good villain should do. These guys Joe Sands and Daniel Stern are perfect for these roles. On the other hand, in 3 we have 4 new idiots who just quarrel, and again try to capitalize on the charm and duet of the first villains. Not to say that they were terrible, but they were not unforgettable or even really interesting. More on the banal side. <br /> <br /> Then we got real movies. Part 1 and 2, classic. Memorable. Perfect for watching Christmas and bringing a wonderful Christmas feeling and evoking so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story and take care of the characters. Simple, memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? A masterpiece of shit. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Everyone and everything, I donâ€™t know why people like it. I think that people really do not know what a good movie is. This crappy sequel with a lot of unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character, from which I would like the robbers to at least beat the crap out of it. And let's not even start with part 4!
