This film was shot and filmed from my hometown. I remember the fuss about it and all the fuss around the fact that Molly Ringwald was in the city ... <br /> <br /> Storyline ... <br /> <br /> Almost 20 years after the film was “laid down” by “Rest”, not finished, a group of students of the film intended to complete it - with terrible consequences. It would seem that someone does not want the film to be finished. <br /> <br /> Storyline is inconclusive. It must be remembered that this is a comedy, and therefore it needs to be stroked a little on the cheeks, but there was nothing special about it. The characters are mostly transparent, and the little information you get about them just doesn't care about you, it seems irrelevant. It is strange to hear Kylie’s accent as an Australian again and it's nice to see the child with whom I went to school in the lead role. But it does not save the film at all. God knows why the creators thought they would end up in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps because of the nature of the film (he kind of pays homage to 80s / bad horror movies), but in fact the Australian actor would have coped very well. <br /> <br /> With regard to casting, many actions seemed constipated. Some of these children (especially the two main chic - they played the "director" and "producer") looked like they were trying to act. It never looks good. In addition, the pictures had a rude feeling about them. Is that burning? Just not as smooth as before. <br /> <br /> Assassin. Lord Could this be less intimidating? There are several shock factors and a couple of rough scenes. I liked the movie, but it was not great. It lasted 90 minutes, but it could have been less. Perhaps if they tightened the script, it would be better. They had many characters killed, but there was no real way to kill them. Perhaps if they killed fewer people and really concentrated in a scary atmosphere, it would be better. <br /> <br /> Now I know this is a comedy, and the elements were funny. Or so incredible that they were funny. But I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> L.M.
