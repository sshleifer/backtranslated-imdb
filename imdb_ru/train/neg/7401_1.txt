* Sigh * Leave it to us, the Finns, to come up with a stupid idea, blow it out of proportion and try to sell it as cool. Lordi is a mediocre group at best, and one trick will help you to go far ahead. <br /> <br /> For all those who sell you, they are idiots: this is the reason for the congenital minority that they often encounter when trying to export something in Finland. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not scary. Lordi is lame. Lordi stopped. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this idiocy with a plastic face. Of course, they won Eurovision. <br /> <br /> No, wait - they won Eurovision. That's all. I think so.
