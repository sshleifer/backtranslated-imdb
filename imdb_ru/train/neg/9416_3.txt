Steve McQueen certainly has a lot of loyal fans. He was certainly a charismatic guy, one of the most charismatic people the big screen ever knew. But even McQueen cannot save this turkey from a movie shot on a camera, similar to a brownie camera, in actual locations in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen - a new child without a criminal record, introduced in the planning of a bank robbery of one of the other gangs. There is more than a general hint that there is a happy relationship between young Steve and David Clark. He is disliked by other members of the robbery, mainly due to the lack of a criminal summary. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a girlfriend in Molly McCarthy, and she suspects that something is going on, especially when he starts hanging out with Krahan Denton and James Doucas, and also with Clark, all rather rude characters. That would surely make me suspicious. <br /> <br /> In the robbery of the Great St. Louis Bank there were two directors: Charles Guggenheim and John Styx. The Guggenheim made mostly documentaries, and the Styx did nothing. One of these two jokers decided that Steveâ€™s performance would be best if you made a bad imitation of Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This movie may be the worst ever created by Steve McQueen. I bet Dick Powell and Four Star Productions already signed him to Wanted Dead or Alive, because I can't believe they would get it if they saw it. <br /> <br /> Or they would see something. the public would not have noticed if it were not for the turkey dressing.
