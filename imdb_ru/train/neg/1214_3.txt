One day, a friend of mine asked me to read his script, which was chosen by the film studio. To say that it was one of the most unskillful and bland scenarios I have ever read would be a bold understatement. And yet I never told him that. What for? Because in a world where films such as “While She Got Out” can be lit with green light and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a scenario that lacks character, content and common sense does not guarantee that will not be sold. br /> <br /> As many other reviewers noted, “While She Was Out” is a horribly written film Woman in Danger, which mocked the housewife Basinger, which was hunted by four unlikely caps on Christmas Eve. Every accusation is legitimate, from poor dialogue and bad play to stunning logic mistakes, but Beysinger is such an interesting actress, and the premise is not without promises. Here are a few things that struck me: <br /> <br /> 1) I don't care how much we should think that her husband is a jerk, the house is a mess with toys. Since when has it become child abuse to force children to take it with them? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except in Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Of course, the film is stupid. But the same can be said about the countless "thrillers" that I have met, where women are portrayed as the weeping, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I was pleased to see a woman prevail over her tormentors. <br /> <br /> 4) I LOVED the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although an earlier reviewer came up with this phrase, I really THINK that this film should be renamed “Red Toolbox of Doom”.
