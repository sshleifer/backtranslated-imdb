This film is rightly known as one of the most terrible examples of propaganda ever created. The persistent equation of the Jews with disease is simply <br /> <br /> pathological, and even worse, it becomes almost believable in a matter of short seconds <br /> <br /> due to the apparent repetition. The fact that something rude works, even if briefly, is a good lesson in itself. To survive this, you must have a strong belly and a strong grip, and I do not recommend trying unless you have good reasons.
