Why else would he do this to me? <br /> <br /> Not that I expected Dean Kane to make hit movies. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I know how ... good Dean Kane is. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it will be damp, and each cheese has its own special way of making you scratch your head. I will not call these spoilers because you cannot spoil this film more than it is. <br /> <br /> For starters ... why is this a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> Why is one scientist from Chicago and the other from Los Angeles, and none of them can be more Eastern European if they try? How difficult would it be to find an American actor, or just change this slop state sheet, which gives us a film to say that these people are not Americans? <br /> <br /> Why in two cases the film gives us a slug? We get a day helipad, and then a day cabin. And this is all who care about the schedule. To be honest, who cares even when they mentioned it, but I think it is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Does a movie really get better if you can view it through several split screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> This dragon can certainly pass through this hall ... for ... and again ... and again .... and again ... <br /> <br /> Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in cinema history? It was straight from Scooby-Doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... tell me, do you want to have dinner? Of course, but not in some Chinese place .... with the name of the Dragon !! Ah ha ha ha !! Ha ha ha !! Haha ha! I was Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> Disappear to black <br /> <br /> My God, it made me cringe, it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But never be afraid ... even if the whole building exploded ... and no one was left alive ... for some reason there is a second untouched, unmanned laboratory that survived pretty well what they can do the sequel. Cheers to all of us. <br /> <br />
