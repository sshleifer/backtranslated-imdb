This film is a new standard for bad filmmaking. Jared Rushton provides an adequate representation of a very poorly crafted character in an ill-fated movie, thereby creating the net effect of a very bad movie. The main idea of ​​the film is how a boy's temporary excursion to the Canadian wilderness after surviving alone after a plane crash allows an unhappy teenager to cope with his pain due to the discovery of his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately, this turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two especially hockey scenes involving a fight with a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this child is just sitting in the alley somewhere on the pot, inventing all this movie (and what a nightmare!). In addition, despite the publicity of some reviewers about the film’s family visibility, there are several scenes that are not suitable for viewing by very young children or family, including a graphic scene of a dead pilot underwater with one of the eyes clearly exploded. <Br /> <br /> In general, a terrible film to which no one should be exposed, and even more so innocent children.
