I just do not understand some of the important prerequisites of this episode - that Miranda is so wonderful, and that there is something so ugly that it will make you mad. Someone here made the remark that perhaps this is the frequency of light waves or something else, and not deformity. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, controversial and too talkative. I also do not quite understand why Kolos is the ambassador - why does the Federation simply not leave the damned medusans? I like the one part that Kolos says through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. Overall, I love TOS, and even at the lowest level I will always be tuned in to it. Although this episode is, um, I would not buy it, except for a used copy for $ 3.
