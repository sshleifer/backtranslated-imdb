Terribly pointless and, even worse, boring movie. Stranger Than Fiction can not say anything new about anything, no characters that go beyond the most unimaginable stereotypes, and relies on a clumsy central concept that is neither particularly original, nor to some extent innovative. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is completely wasted by the fact that he probably hoped to be his answer to the Truman Jim Carey show, and replaces his usual routine procedure (admittedly, very funny if you discount the night Talledega), well, pretty much nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is nothing more annoying (that some of the reviews I read here say about Oscar nomination are ridiculous), while Maggie Gyllenhaal does a decent job with a very weak script that allows nothing apart from establishing her character as a former law student who quit Harvard to become a baker because she liked to make people happy. You are welcome. The fact that she fell in love with Ferrell's “hero” is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Mark Forster’s attempts to cheer up the film using computer graphics only underline the boring material with which he has to work. <Br /> <br /> I had a choice: go see “Prestige” for the third time or watch it. I would like to choose Prestige.
