The same old same thing about Che. This completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg altered the same boring story of Che. The silly seductive story of an Argentine rich boy who was so shocked by poverty that he became Robin Hood, fighting with the poor until finally he was killed by the CIA. Yes, yes, heard all this before, boring and not true! The reality of Che Guevara is completely different and much more explosive! Facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messianic trait who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that at the hottest moment of the Cold War, he even begged the Soviet Union to destroy New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring it to the end of the world. Che called on Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack on US cities. For the rest of his life, he claimed that if his finger were on the button, he would have pressed it. When Khrushchev retreated and literally saved the world, Che was furious with "betrayal." If Che's recommendations had been implemented, you would not have read this review right now. As a killer maniac became a pop icon, would make the film much more interesting. It is incredible that none of the directors dared to show the real side of Che and his post-mortem transformation in the media. TO MAKE VICTORY Oscar! I thought that making an independent film meant taking REAL RISKS and being familiar! They adhere only to “safe countercultural themes”, for example: “Che is cool”, “Wall Street is bad”, “Republican = Nazi”, “Bush ex-Hitler”, “NRA is worse than the KGB”, ... d ... nauseous. "Oooh, how bold, how stunning. Tres is anti-mainstream and sharp. I wish they had real cohabitants and they were engaged in an independent movie oligarchy! That would be really brave!
