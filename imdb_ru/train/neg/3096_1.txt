To begin with, Hobgoblins is trying to protect the more successful Gremlines. It's bad enough, but they don’t even try to do something like a movie here. Instead, it looks more like a profitable basement, all that is needed to clear out embarrassing scenes, an inappropriate sound effect, act as a soft tapioca and a scenario in which everything that people consider sacred in their films throws them into an old pipe. -aroo <br /> <br /> Story? Grrrr .... Intervening children track down gremlin-like creatures from the movie before they kill people, projecting their fantasies. That sounds cool, doesn't it? Well, see that wall on the other side of your room? Run straight ahead at maximum speed. See, this is cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> dare you doubt? Quickly, name something else, one of the leaders was different than this. What other scripts did authors write since the times of "Hobgoblinov"? What is another guide for Rick Sloan? How many hobgoblin figures do you have? See? THANK. <br /> <br /> I can’t believe that I have been writing about such a horrible movie for so long. I'd rather write about more important things; as the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe and the like. But no, “Hobgoblins” is bad - bad, like your grandparents' wallpaper, bad like pink flamingos on your lawn, bad like underwear with the words “House of the Drunk” ... and I think we're on this will stop. <br /> <br /> Mike and the robots fight valiantly, but, no matter how hard they try, they can do a lot with Hobgoblins before they realize that yes, the director MUST be hit in the shin. <br /> Really, very difficult. <br /> <br /> One star for Hobgoblin, seven stars for the MST3K version.
