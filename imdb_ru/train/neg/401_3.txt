This is what I talked about over and over again in the surprisingly inept 3rd act of this pitiful excuse for a film. First, the computer effects are amazing! These computer wizards really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the film, however ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters play realistically, especially in the aforementioned, contemptible third act (I promise you will not give it up, but trust me. You shouldnâ€™t keep a secret!) A lot of laughter in the film happens unintentionally, for example, when they try to explain that the eyelids of an invisible person are not working. Please give viewers more respect than this !!! <br /> <br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do in the end if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These questions were considered much more rationally in the classic 1933 Invisible Man. In particular, there is one scene of violence that is so incredibly ambiguous and is not mentioned even once. If more attention was paid to this, Kevin Bacon's mad scientist might have a little more meaning. <br /> <br /> The movie will actually be much more successful as porn, since the room can actually be made in a unique and interesting form. But this piece of work ... go look at something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
