I had to endure adolescence, longing for high school and family conflict throughout most of the show. I really don't care about schoolchildren worrying about their relationship. I spent my time in hell, dealing with such issues, and I do not care that fictional teens go through the "lite" versions of the horrors that I have experienced. I want science fiction. This is the only reason I'm here. The show had a few seconds of science fiction. We finally see proto Cylon. It was good, but with one problem. His red eye point would be fixed on the object of interest. We all know that Cylon's eyes always scan back and forth, giving the car a map of the world. The red point of view never stops moving back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope that the authors correct this abuse before the second episode.
