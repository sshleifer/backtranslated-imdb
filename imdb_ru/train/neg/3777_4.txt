Flat, soulless computer images on a less than amazing background enliven the horribly predictable story in this film. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even say when the vocals of Brian Adams, who are always at the wrong time, enter. <br /> <br /> The main character, the Horse's Spirit, is given an annoying voice when he tells what is happening. However, the story is not necessary, since everything that happens is really obvious. You can even say what horses say, although all they do is laugh. That would be nice, but all the horses make the same sound - one for warning, one for sadness, one for laughing, etc. There is no difference between the voices of the horses. <br /> <br /> Small children can like this movie, though. It is pitiable enough for a family to sit down and watch, and there is a slight danger of someone being scared. If you have nothing else to do and you want to watch a movie with your children, this is a good choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise this is not recommended.
