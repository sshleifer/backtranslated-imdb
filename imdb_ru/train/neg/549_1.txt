I can not believe that the Indian film industry is still producing such a third grade, like Waqt. To begin with the storyline is absolutely implausible ?? pampered son is thrown out of the family home to teach his self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He quickly wins some national talent competition, performing some star jumps before the panel of judges (I, frankly, do not joke here). Meanwhile, his father dies of lung cancer, but keeps it secret from his son, but he survives long enough to see how his son became famous, see his new grandson, and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> The cast is worthy of a hangover. None of the main players in this film made any effort to try to act convincingly. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the problems of the real world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers, when such terrible films are made, are smart viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film. Actors such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar will continue to be worshiped as gods by people who have only the blind faith in Bollywood.
