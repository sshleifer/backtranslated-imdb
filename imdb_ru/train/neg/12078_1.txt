I literally fell asleep 3 times while watching this movie. Of course, this is Shakespeare, and this requires a certain way of thinking in order to interest or not. But this film transcends any barrier of long monologues, and whatâ€™s not, it may prevent many from simply not caring about Shakespeare's story. <br /> <br /> The biggest obstacle to this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often during the interaction of the character is almost impossible to determine who is what line. Of course, I believe that this film is dubbed in English. Of course, they could get voice actors who could add a little more drama to these classic, literary lines. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to evaluate this film more than 1, although perhaps it is based on the prejudices of the possible age and that it would seem a very low budget. However, it is absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
