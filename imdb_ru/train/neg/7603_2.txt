I will be stupid. I am not one of the politically correct films where a woman plays a bad ass that is not going to give up on anyone. If one of the actors wanted, they would just kill her in an instant. It was interesting on MST 3K, but you shouldnâ€™t rent the real version. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
