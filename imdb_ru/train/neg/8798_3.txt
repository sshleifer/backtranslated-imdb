I like the film, which has at least a relic of the story. This is not happening in this movie. This is a series of vignettes without unity. <br /> <br /> There are scenes when a person collects jars of pineapples. A woman with a blond wig never takes off sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the film, and we will never know why. It completely disappears in about 30 minutes. There is one more flirtatious woman who endlessly cleans a manâ€™s apartment. There are endless scenes in fast food where Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' is greatly exaggerated (I liked the song). The dialogue mainly concerns food (pineapples, salad from the chef and ordering drinks). I guess most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was eaten. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this film, because there is no story. This is supposedly romance - it is not. I'm just wondering why I didn't get into Fast-forward. Did I keep on waiting for something significant to happen? this is not true. Maybe this is the only consolation for this film - the scenes changed so quickly that you fool yourself by assuming that all nonsense will be a revelation.
