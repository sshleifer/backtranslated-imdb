Jean-Marc Barr (Be Light, Big Blue, Dogville) shot and interpreted this strange film, which is the second episode of the trilogy. I may be wrong, but I don't think this film is part of the Dogma '95 manifesto , although in fact it looks like this. I'm not quite sure what I think about this movie. All the actors are good. They give pretty good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I don't know, I don't like something in the movie. Sex scenes are too long. It turns from an interesting piece of art into erotic crap, I donâ€™t know exactly where it stands. Of course, this is not a bad film, but I will not offer people to watch it, and I will tell them not to watch. Just do what you want. If you are curious and open-minded, try it, you might like it.
