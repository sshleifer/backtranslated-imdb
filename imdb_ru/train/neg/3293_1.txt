What a snoring party. <br /> <br /> Of all the nostalgic moments that Hollywood decided to remake and renew, this is certainly one of the most senseless. Firstly, it was a completely pointless show, and we DO NOT need a “modern” update. <br /> <br /> Never mind the fanaticism and sexism inherent in the system from the very beginning, so many achievements were made socially, as the show showed that the whole point of the show (if it ever was) was lost . <br /> <br /> Also, what's the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he is NOT overweight?
