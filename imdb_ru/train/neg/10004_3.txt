“It seems that many critics find the idea of ​​Woody Allen’s drama unpleasant.” And for good reason: this is unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman. And let's not fool ourselves: critics basically supported Allen’s claims on Bergman, despite Allen’s accusatory accusations of the opposite. What I don’t understand is why Allen was generally applauded for his originality in imitation of Bergman, but his contemporary Brian DePalm was excused for hitting Hitchcock in his films about obscurity / horror? According to Robin Wood, this is a strange form of cultural snobbery. I would have to agree with that.
