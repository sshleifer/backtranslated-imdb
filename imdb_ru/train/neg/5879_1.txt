I wonder how the actors acted in this film. Annette Bening really was herself half as half, was she pretending or was she natural? It did not matter, considering that even if she walked along the ceiling, it would not change the picture of the film. Brian Cox acted really well. I almost thought that he had always acted in such a way, as cunning, dishonest, in a dirty environment where nobody cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what did she do in this film. <br /> <br /> This film is pretty disgusting and disgusting. Who will pay to see such nonsense?
