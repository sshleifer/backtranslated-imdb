Snow White, in my opinion, is a bad film from an artistic point of view. The plot is largely predictable, characters are stereotypical, editing is too exaggerated. In any case, the film does not seem to have much artistic ambition. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is a direct commercial thing. The inclusion of a character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the group with which he is touring in the film - a group called SENS UNIK) seems to be aimed at a large audience. Direct German-Swiss cinema would not be sold in the French part - and vice versa. What really got on my nerves was the placement of the product throughout the film. Some scenes are remembered from commercials! <br /> <br /> I also believe that the topic “young people who take drugs without any other goals in their lives” is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be developed with greater caution. I hope that Samir got enough money with Snow White to have his next film show his true artistic abilities.
