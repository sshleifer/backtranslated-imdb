OH MY GOD! The only reason I give this movie 2 instead of 1 is that Tom Hanks is funny like Elvis in the box. Besides, how did this half decent cast sign a contract for such a bad movie ?? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at that time ... There is no need to mention laughter, the stereotypes are pitiful, the actors are in vain, the direction is amateur. Now that I think about it, much of the blame probably lies with director Joel Zwick. He does not give anything except flat speeches of all participants. Don't waste your time like me; but then I get the pleasure of a train wreck. Damn it, now the system tells me that I need more lines - here, please, this film should be called “Return to Sender”. Well, now it was the funniest thing in the movie ...
