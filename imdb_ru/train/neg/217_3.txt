This is a film that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to be noticed. That's all. The dialogues are pathetic, and the sensuality of “sex scenes” is absolutely absent. high school students, but the subject is intended for an adult audience. This is a ruthless and shallow movie. It would be much better if it had a story and more drama. And besides, one more thing: why are inner monologues so widely used? It seems so cheap. In general, an awkward film for Romanian cinema, as well as for a mature audience trying to watch it. I know that the means are scarce, but this does not always justify the failure of a film like this. Please start using good actors in your films and stop using them with musicians (Tudor Kirila) - they cannot play!
