This film is funny and painful at the same time. Cinemagic almost captured me. Despite what they mean, “Cinemagic” is not some kind of innovative technical procedure. He was “developed” in an accident, and they used it because he hid the fact that their “monsters” looked so stupid. I also do not think it is a coincidence that the author is Sid "Pink." <br /> <br /> This movie is good for laughs if you are really looking for a movie shot in 9 days for 200,000 dollars. It is interesting; at least i can say this. The bat / rat / spider is the highlight.
