This is a terrible story. It takes about an hour before we have an idea of ​​what it should be; characters often mumble; it often seems that actions have nothing to do with each other; no one seems to be concerned about who actually killed the girl; a pair of creepy kids swims in waters that seem threatening, but nothing happens; The Irishman gets hit in the face of one of his buddies for no apparent reason ... it would be just as boring to continue as the film itself. The only half-entertaining element is landscape photography; but anyone could direct the camera to the Australian outback to get unforgettable pictures. In general, it is depressing, incoherent, pretentious - and completely annoying that it spends so much time on the viewer.
