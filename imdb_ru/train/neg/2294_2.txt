Poor Paul Mercurio. After receiving the role of Scott Hastings in "Strictly Ballroom", the best film in history, he managed to find a lot of garbage. None of the characters in this film is very unpleasant or even hateful, but the leadership of Mercurio is the person you prefer to ignore - completely unattractive, and he wears COMPLETELY. A big mistake in the design of the suit.
