Slow and penetrated by inaccuracy. Ignoring his shortcomings, this is still an interesting account of the famous and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas struggle for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis. Raul Julia as General of Santa Anna. David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler also starred in this television project. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
