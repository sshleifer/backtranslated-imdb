Every new show in the autumn lineup deserves, at least, my policy “3 hits, and you're out of the game.” I give comedies 3 chances to make me laugh, that is, 3 full episodes. After Episode 1, I actually told television: "Canceled tomorrow." It was so bad. I just watched the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and still have not managed even with a smirk. No fool, no scream, no joke, in fact, no facial movements. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode, because I am convinced that I clearly have something missing in this show. I just don’t “get” it, but I think that a comedy on a large television network in prime time is just MUST be funny; but no laughter from me yet. There is simply no way that ABC would put the funniest comedy of all time at 8:00 pm. I KNOW that there must be an internal joke that simply does not tremble in my brain. I read each of the previous comments, I "understood" its social aspect, but WHERE THE JESTS ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week, until I have a moment with a light bulb, and I do not hit myself in the head, shouting "Eureka."
