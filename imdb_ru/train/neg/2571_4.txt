With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in the movie, you think it will not go wrong. But what can I say? It was a terrible misfire. The film is about Peter Sellers as an elderly gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young man, not to mention an attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The film is incredibly fragmented, and I did not understand anything about this. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this film does not prove it. <br /> <br /> This song is about ?? arabella Cinderella 'is pretty cool, but it is. I recommend this movie only to those who like to watch an extreme movie about updates, this is almost one definition. I think that this film more than anything else is a sign of time, from the point of view of its particular experimentalism and non-standard, the problem is that the quality is completely shot, and the script, not to mention the direction, is as follows. <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers, in particular, is very impressed; throughout his career he will go from Doctor Strangelove and “Be There” to stupid films like this, and “The Magic Christian”, which was very similar to this in context and style, but this film had some funny moments. It makes no sense, and I am sad that a great man like Peter Sellers appeared in this film. No one is recommended.
