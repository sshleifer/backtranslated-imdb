Hearing how funny this movie is, I finally rented it at the video store <br /> and maybe for 75 minutes I laughed 3 times. This <br /> <br /> film, a compilation of scenes ridiculing television, is a messy <br /> <br />. Jokes were not successful, humor deals with <br /> <br /> problems of the 1970s, which are no longer relevant, and <br /> <br /> jokes last too long (almost like new SNL misses <br /> <br /> last few years). Yes, Chevy Chase is in it, but maybe just <br /> <br /> about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that it was very rude and full of nudity, but wasn't it funny? Do <br /> <br /> yourself a favor and rent the movie "Kentucky Freed", which is <br /> <br /> an excellent movie made in
