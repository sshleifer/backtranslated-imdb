I am a good guy and I like to think of myself as genre-resistant. And, I think by that I mean that I try to view the film in the context of the genre in which it is located. If nothing else, it saves me from feeling that I have to say really nasty things about people or movies that I don’t like to do. <br /> <br /> The plot in this was clearly obvious, production values ​​are very low and set, simply. From time to time, acting became a “good for playing in high school” territory. I felt that it was filmed in one day - please tell me what it was. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, sex, although abundant, was rather mundane, difficult, at least in my example, “sounding”, which did not correspond to the action (climatic moans and howls, lying on the bed unbuttoning bra ???). There was definitely no “edge” in this - nothing distinctive or interesting and with surprisingly quick cuts. <br /> <br /> Then my voice is “1” with the following brief statement: it would be better if the filler material in the club was expanded and the rest of the film was condensed.
