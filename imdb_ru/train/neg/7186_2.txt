I apologize to all the fans, but this is a useless movie. The acting is bad, even wooden, in the early stages it greatly exaggerates the fear factor and does not quite work. I think that in the end there should have been a turn, but it just led to a crazy confusion. What the hell? The dude who killed everyone was one of the hunters? Try again. <br /> <br /> This is hardly original, and itâ€™s not even particularly good as a straight slash. And it says something. <br /> <br /> I think, whoever takes part in the castings, whoever writes the script, and whoever thinks about the concept, should be ruthlessly fired and deported. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. If someone puts it on at a party, throw the disk out the window and put on a good horror film, such as Silence of the Lambs or Shine.
