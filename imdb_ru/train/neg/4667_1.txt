Visually cluttered, the plot is smaller, incredibly stunning garbage. Even close to Greenway's best work. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> The overlapping effects of a “split screen” are no more confusing, the film is very dark for a long time, and the “artistic” creation of images is pretentious in extreme conditions. . <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend in this film; even nudity is unbelievably incredible, and seeing how it fills most of the film soon becomes very boring. <br /> <br /> Also, how someone can say that Even McGregor's acting is great, I can't do it. He showed more abilities in the Star Wars series, and that says something. <br /> <br /> I haven’t been so impressed with the film since I saw Darby O'Gill and the Little People!
