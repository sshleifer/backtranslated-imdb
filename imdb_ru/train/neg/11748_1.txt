This film must be one of the worst I've ever seen to get on DVD !!! The storyline might have clicked if the film had more means and authors who cut out the senseless and painful scenes that I strongly warn parents of ... But the storyline looks like a free gun. If there was such a thing as driving through a film director, then this could be due to this. It reminded me of a lot of fast movies released in the 1960s, poor scripting and filming. <br /> <br /> Bartender and beaver were the only reasonable characters in the entire film. The rest of the film could have been easily made by high school children. I give this film a rating of 1, as it is really terrible and left my whole family with a sense of deception. My advice - do not look!
