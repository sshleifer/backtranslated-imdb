So, after watching this invigorating film and spending an hour and many minutes of my life, hereâ€™s a basic summary: Jin comes out of the ghetto box, gives this child with shaggy hair 3 desires, the child loses his desires, I forgot that Shaq sucks in rap, and I think that's all. <br /> <br /> So basically, I laughed, I cried ... but mostly I laughed at the comedy about sex, which came from the great acting abilities of nba player / rapper and boy with shaggy hair. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film for college kids who sit and drink beer with their close friends, and they need a serious laugh. <br /> <I'm going to give him only 3 out of 10, because the film is based on 3 magical desires. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes, I could erase this horrible movie. and so that everyone pretends that Hollywood doesn't spend money on it.
