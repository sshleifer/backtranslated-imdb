Those who are familiar with the two previous films about Cuba, to a large extent know what they can expect: a small group of people locked in a pile of mined rooms, paranoia, a bad game ... This film is a little different. Approximately half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we watch people watching people inside the cube (or at least five of them). <br /> <br /> I believe that Cube Zero aims to explain that you can deal with a cube, but you really donâ€™t know much more than was covered in the first two films. Of course, there is some explanation here, but it looks rather unconvincing compared to what was suggested in the first film. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks pretty cheap (like its predecessors), and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only underlines this feeling. I also said with confidence that there is no risk that any of the actors will receive any rewards in the foreseeable future. However, they brought traps from Cuba 1 (I mean, they are almost the same, which is a bit embarrassing). <br /> <br /> I know that many people I appreciate this film and its connection with the first one, but I just feel that this is an absolutely unnecessary contribution to the franchise, which was not so good to begin with.
