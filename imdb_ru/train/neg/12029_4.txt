As a rule, I found that if you didn’t hear about the film before you saw it on DVD, there’s probably a good reason for this. I did not hear about this film until the other day I was in a blockbuster and did not see it on the shelf. Since all the good films had already been leased (the ones I wanted to watch, anyway), I decided that I would take this picture. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is not much different from other films in the genre, such as The Singles Ward or RM. If you like films of this type, you will probably like it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon, this film probably will not please you. There is no way to avoid the frankly religious (Mormon) message contained in it, and sometimes it looks juicy and cheesy. Ultimately, if you do not fall into the demographic situation of the Mormons, you probably should look for something else. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were some very funny moments in the film, but I didn’t think that was enough to save the film as a whole.
