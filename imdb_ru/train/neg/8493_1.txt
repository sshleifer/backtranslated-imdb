Many days after watching The Conception of Ada, Iâ€™m still delighted that any group of people would have spent so much time making such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> No one should watch this film in the hope of finding out anything important about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues, or the result of her efforts. <br /> <br /> No one should watch this movie in the hope of having fun. <br /> <br /> Like a science fiction movie. This will surely be a terrible setback. Somehow, the main character manages to revive the past and interact with him on his personal computer - with the help of advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary. I doubt that anyone can suspend their disbelief so much that it does not look absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> Like a dramatic film, this is undoubtedly a terrible failure. Somehow, the writer / director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with a constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama, essentially nothing. I doubt that anyone might feel that the whole drama in the film serves only as an annoying distraction. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to fully express my degree of contempt for the Conception of Ada. The circumstances under which I saw it forbid me to leave the theater, but there is no doubt that I would have been otherwise. I'm still angry that I wasted the time it took to see it. Only in order that I could more effectively criticize this film, I would like me to be more clearly worded.
