Seriously, I read some reviews of this film, and I have to ask if you were people who were watching the same film. <br /> <br /> Yes, I am very grateful to the directors for the opportunity to recreate the vintage Los Angeles of 1930, so what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters are cute, the story seems purposeless, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just unsightly. (and his character Homer Simpson makes me dream of an animated version. Yes!) Then you had a creepy kids actor, a creepy Billy Barty, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of these films that film lovers love, and the rest look at each other and say: “What the hell!”
