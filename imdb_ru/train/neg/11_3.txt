If you look at Corey Bolshoi’s information here on IMDb, there’s obviously a movie called “Recharge” in production (as of June 2008) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, how did such a shitty movie ever deserve a sequel ... and secondly, wasn't Sebastian killed at the end of "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I watched it in the early morning hours when I was struggling with insomnia, and so I drifted until it was turned on. I'm sure I missed some of the plot points, but overall it seemed very weak. Speech Large was (for me) one of the strengths of the film. I'm also a little surprised that people are commenting on beautiful girls, since I thought the actress who played Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.
