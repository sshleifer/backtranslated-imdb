There is nothing unique in the series or in the film. This is a prequel to the TV show, which is nowhere else in life and entertainment. And before David Lynch the disgusting style of storytelling, and after. <br /> <br /> Since then, the body of a poor, lost girl has been washed on the beach. And being familiar with some of the most stunning and dark immoral characters of Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> The mind-boggling almost pedophilia is disgusting, as the film seems to be romantically telling about the destruction of Human Life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the movie Twin Peak: Fire, walk with me. <br /> <br /> I looked at all this, just to make sure I didn't miss anything. I'm not. This is just one male obvious sexual fetish extends over a long series of under the steam of ridiculous overly pornographic film. Keep your confidence in the agony of the unknown and watch something else that at least has the ability to tell a story and then seduce you into some kind of mental porn movie. <br /> <br /> I have heard a lot of reviews, rants and admire how great David Lynch is. Because of his ability to define suffering and and tragedy and turn it into some amazing thing. This is not life imitating art, but some kind of perverted version of art, doing everything possible to inspire a meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.
