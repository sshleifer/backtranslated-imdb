I expected the film to be completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment will be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the film, but it was also fun to mock the nonsense that takes place in single chambers. <br /> <br /> However, there were many things in The Singles Ward that were completely annoying. The whole film was poorly dubbed and made mouths to watch, listening to their voices, very annoying. This lack of professionalism was surpassed only by the cameos of Mormon celebrities who are not in business. <br /> <br /> This film has established itself well among the Mormons, especially in student communities where there are lonely congregations. However, this conclusion does not bring hope to the poor losers who were not married. (Only pretty girls in the ward for lonely marry, fat, ugly - no, but all the ugly men). Ultimately, we understand that the entire movie was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com.
