Marlon Brando has long lost interest in acting when he starred in this film. His performance in the role of “Swede” is the worst in his career, and this is exactly what he wanted. He does not replay. Instead, he simply acts in a strange way and makes fun of his embarrassingly gigantic girth. The scene where Brando climbs through the toilet is probably the worst, funniest moment in cinema history. When we see how he fell headlong into the toilet, it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in The Streetcar Name Desire, On the Embankment and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I guess the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in recent years. Is he tired of the movie business? Did he just like to make a fool of himself? I think we will never know. But this film serves as a fascinating exploration of what a bad acting is. <br /> <br /> On this note, you will see how veteran actor Donald Sutherland struggles to show his lines, embarrassed by the fact that he agreed to participate in this parody.
