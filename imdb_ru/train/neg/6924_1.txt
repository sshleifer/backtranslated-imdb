If this film were worse, it would have been shot by Uwe Boll. This senseless mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It has been a long time since I saw this steaming pile, but I remember that I wanted to inflict serious bodily harm on everyone involved. The way someone can give this film more than 1 star amazes me with the grace of all those who watched this prank. I give him one star because there is no rating below. All copies of this film should be burned on the ground, sown with salt and reserved as a dump for the most toxic waste. No, one copy should be kept in ultra-high security and shown only to filmmakers as an example of how not to do this.
