“Respect for Action” by Uta Hagen is a standard textbook in many college theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to character development as an actor: a presentational approach and a representative approach. In the presentational approach, the actor focuses on the most honestly aware of the character, introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. In a representative approach, an actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control over movement and sound. <br /> <br /> A representative approach to acting is still partly in vogue when this Hamlet was made, the British Theater has a long history of this style of acting, and it can be said that Olivier was the final king of a representative school. <br /> <br /> Time was not kind to this acting school or to this film. Almost every working actor today uses a presentational approach. At the modern look, a very proclaimed, stylized delivery Olivier is boring, tough and crap. Instead of creating an internally conflicting Hamlet, Olivier made from a sad Dane a proclaiming, self-assured megaphone - an acting style that would fit well with the back rows of the larger London theaters, but too prim modern Hamlet. <br /> <br /> And today the film squeaks without sympathy. Olivier’s e-nun-ci-ate tendency makes some lines of Hamlet inadvertently ridiculous: "Instead, you must acquire and receive a gloomy purr that can give him ... Smoothness!" Instead of crying, meeting his father's ghost ( any real actor), bright pupils of light in Olivier's pupils make such an impression on us. <br /> <br /> Eileen Hurley is the only other actor noted in this Hamlet, a good essay about the queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). Other actors in this film have no chance to do anything else meaningful, given Olivier’s tendency to want to save! camera! on him! absolutely! time! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, you feel the vulnerability of a Shakespearean actor who lacked the confidence to portray the frail Hamlet, and instead he decided to portray a kind of Elizabethan megaphone. Final analysis: “I would like this guy to be whipped for the work of Thermagante; he surpassed the hero Herod: pray for you, avoid it. "
