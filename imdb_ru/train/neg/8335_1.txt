The package implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn commit a huge bank robbery, but this is not what I got from this! I got nothing! In the first half there is a new character (without an introduction) in any other scene. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, and the rest is just one long, annoying, stressed chase scene. There is always an annoying sound in the background, be it the ticking of a loud clock, a loud siren, the train whistle, or even the horrible Quincy Jones score. There are many parts that are ridiculously bad too. Like, the bad guys are chasing Beatty on thin ice with a CAR! Or the police arrived at the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
