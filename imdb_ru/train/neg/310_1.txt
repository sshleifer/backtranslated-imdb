I had never heard of this film by Adam Sandler until I saw it on the wall in Blockbuster. Being a fan of Adam Sandler at the time, I rented it. Honestly, I could only watch about 30 minutes. This was terrible. Do your best to keep it in the hands of the public. I sincerely hope that this film will soon be released in the PLO, and I hope that it will remain so!
