POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> “The spy who seduced me” is a reappraisal and reappraisal of a sequel. The International Man of Mysteries came out of the blue. It was a lonely star, about which few have heard. But it was amazingly original, had a subtle humor and enough humor, always kept good taste and brilliant shade. The spy who seduced me was much more commercially advertised and advertised. <br /> <br /> Well, I admit, when I first saw this film, I thought it was very funny, but it was only after I watched it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The game was fine, but Heather Graham cannot act. Her performance did not look very convincing, and she was not as good as Liz Hurley in the first. Those characters that bloomed in the first, (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) are thrown into the background to hear and do not get a lot of individual scenes. The film is just full of cameos. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated how they completely ignored some scenes in IMOM. When they killed Vanessa from the very beginning and made Basil sit down, he knew that she was a fombot all the time. What was the point? They killed number 2 in the first, and now they return it without giving a reason. It is assumed that this is a fake, I do not think that any of the characters even holding a gun in the film. He just follows the trail, further and further from the bottom line. <br /> <br /> New characters are very undesirable. The whole joke of Mini-Me "making fun of my size" is aging very quickly. Fat bastard - just sucks reason for rude humor. In total there are about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this was the first film in the series, then, probably, it would be easier for me. But the series began with a touch of dryness of mind, and then plummeted to the level of full humor. Therefore, I say, watch this film only if you have not seen its predecessor, because “The Spy Who Seduced Me” is one of the main disappointments.
