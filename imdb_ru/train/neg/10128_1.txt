he was my hero at all times, until he went along with {if you can call it a movie} I went to the show to watch it and get out, and not just asked to return my money, but asked to double the money, that's how bad my the hero's acting game and the hole was ............. I can't believe that Stephen Segal's career reached such a low level that it was reduced to making 4th level films with minor actors of the 5th level I watched this move, expecting to see how he dumps shit from some people, as he usually does. When it comes down to using one judo chop between the shoulder blades to kill an opponent, and the guy drops like a ton of bricks, something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals and read this story as a novel, you still have a question why you even took the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal considers the movements and it seems that he is only doing this because he is obliged. He shows no effort and enthusiasm, and in some scenes he does not appear at all. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t want to repeat other people's comments, but I use footage for the cut scenes and for visual effects. Airplanes in flight are pathetic. The condition of these scenes was precarious, and the scenes themselves seemed to deteriorate over time. The film "Zapproder", showing that President John F. Kennedy was killed, is more stable and clean. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste time watching this movie, it does not meet the standards of his work as a flickering person or out of a wound. I read one review saying that the film had a budget of 12 million dollars (Segal paid 5 of this), and that the film still came within the budget. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is a direct DVD movie, since no bona fide cinema would play this movie.
