When I found out that there is a film that starred my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Winona Ryder, I went through the roof! But after watching this unfortunate film, I had a big fall, and I still have a bruise. Jeremy Irons (an actor whom I still admire even after this disappointment) plays just awful. He treated his family like shit, especially the sister played by Glenn Close. I couldn't get closer or sympathize with any of the characters, and I'm not a prude, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary, or they could be relaxed. The characters Vinona and Antonio could develop much more, and their romance could be much more passionate. What happened to Meryl's character and her “mystical abilities”? Why didn't they go for it anymore? This film had a lot of dead ends, and the point is that this is a really lousy movie, and there was a lot of untapped talent.
