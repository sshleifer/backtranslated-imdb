I can always tell when something becomes a hit. I see it or hear it, and I get a good feeling. I did not have a good feeling when watching the preview. I was not thrilled with this film, and Iâ€™m not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films. In fact, I was right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that left me is the name. Not that I had problems with ebony (by the way, I'm black), but for the film they could use a better headline, and this time use the heading without bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, saw the acting skills, and all I could do was make faces. <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme of the dance film was overdone. At least "You have received the ministry" was better than this, in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not impress me.
