A model group is looking for an apartment to live in and is shown by a local real estate agent. However, it is not known to the models and the agent that the “hellish threshold” is in the apartment, and when it is crossed, the demon “Detman” is called in to kill everyone who is on its way. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist who was accused of murder. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I am a champion in low-budget, micro-budget and independent films, I cannot praise this film. The creators are proud of their 24-hour filming schedule, and at least one actor is bragging on the DVD with his acting skills, but I can't turn around around that. Why make a movie within 24 hours if the extra one or two hours of editing will make all the difference? And why are you proud to act poorly, meaninglessly and lead to poor delivery of a few lines? <br /> <br /> For most of the film, real estate shows models of parts of an apartment. agent. The dialogue was clearly driven into himself, because no script writer could come up with such an empty diction. In addition, the agent obviously does not know anything about housing ... she focuses on aspects of the house that nobody could care about, incorrectly explains the heat source (did she see the radiator?) And said that the pest problem would be solved when they called the "terminator." Please write a script - some deviations - this is normal, but it was a mess. <br /> <br /> Why did the girls move in models? Their career had no meaning in the plot, and it seemed like a forced situation. At some point, the actress violates the character and says something like “dude, they will be (upset),” which sounded more natural than any other line, although inappropriate because of another bad dialogue. /> <br /> The demon did not make sense. I appreciated the attempt to explain how the “threshold of hell” jumps to random places on Earth (including fireplaces in apartments), but why not explain where the demon came from? Its origin concerns a person whose love is killed by another person. How does that make you a demon? (Besides, why do we need all these Victorian memories without dialogue and views across the field? This was exaggerated.) <br /> <br /> The dramatic pauses between the lines were terrible. Sam Bishop's character was the worst, and the interviewer did not fall behind. Each question requires a pause, a funny face and an answer ... followed by a pause, funny face and an answer? I was so upset. For me, the only goal was to delay the time ... but I would prefer to have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of terrible delivery (and then spend more time scrolling through the same credit twice). /> <br /> Who was Sam Bishop’s character? Allegedly, he "saw" all this and was accused of killing girls, but he was never in the history of girls. So how did he see them? And if he didn't, how did he know that Detman killed them? And if he did not see Detman, how did he know that Detman is the spirit of the Apostles? I was so lost ... Was there even a plan for a conspiracy when it was written? <br /> <br /> The only part that I liked about this movie was the scene with one of the models in the bathroom. Not that it was really important or anything else, but it was the only break from boredom that was given to me. I wonder what the director Felix Diaz was thinking? His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes for his improvised play), but I am surprised at his film making skills. Although, of course, the best part of the DVD was the trailer for his “Superhero Excelsior” (one trailer was better than all this waste of time). <br /> <br /> Sorry, I have to be so sharp, I would like to think that this film was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun, and the idea was never to make a quality movie. But if “Superhero Excelsior” is any indicator, Diaz can make quality ... so why did he decide to avoid it here? Perhaps the world will never know.
