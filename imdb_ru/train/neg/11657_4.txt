“Scary Movie 2” is the movie “Scary Movie”. Scary movies 1, 3 and 4 were good, but this one was boring and not very funny. Fortunately, they shot their act after this and shot two more wonderful “Scary Movies”. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of teenagers who were tricked by a professor into going to a haunted mansion for the night. Everything starts to go wrong, and then they realize that they must escape. <br /> <br /> This film is not so terrible, but they could improve a lot of things. It's a little fun, and if you like other movies from the Scary Movie franchise, then give them a watch - but I don't think you like them that much either.
