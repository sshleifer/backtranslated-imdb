They sell it like a horror movie, it should be a thriller, but I find it quite funny (comedy? I don’t think), I laughed at the whole movie, I think it was because of a ridiculous game and plot. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but OK I think Killian is a very good "bad guy." I liked his play at Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams ... wow! she is beautiful and also a good actress, but let's try to be a little objective here, the story is mm mm ... the direction is mm mm ... she lacks a lot of good anticipation, in fact this is a really boring movie, but there is one good thing, this a short film, just 1 hour and 30 minutes (for me it was 10 minutes under water!) <br /> <br /> I just don’t know why this film is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher is bad good, rational and objective criticism?
