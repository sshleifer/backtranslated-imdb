*** SPOILERS *** With a meeting of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean John Carradine, to hear his last will and testament, they are somewhat surprised that Dean’s fortune is about 140 million dollars. The money should be divided between them, but only after they have successfully spent a week in Dean’s mansion. It seemed that there was confusion in this story, when we later learned that it was indeed an overnight stay, and not a week-long vacation, in a guest house to claim Dean's money, since almost everyone ends up dying by sunrise. br /> <br /> The first victim of the curse of Dinah has nothing to do with the receipt and money from the late Christopher Dean estate of local sheriff Dana Garcia, Rodolfo Acosta. Acoste was beheaded in the fridge, and then served on a dish to a shocked group of guests. Later that evening, cute little Chin Greg and Laura, Jeff Morrow and Mary Anders, a small domestic dog found dead outside, swimming in a pond. <br /> <br /> In the film, all the people staying at the Dean Mansion are removed one by one, until it becomes clear who the killer really is. Then we have what seems to be a double twist in history, where the original killer was suddenly killed along with the last two remaining guests. The real killer ends up not only receiving all the loot, $ 140 million, but then he ends up not having to share him with his accomplice, making him or her, giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot. br /> <br /> The madman who did this, and the haunted house, the film with the participation of such immoral and unattractive characters that even mothers, and especially the spectators, do not like. There is everything you can think of in this movement, including selected guests, including S & M incest sadism and, of course, double appeal and striking back, even without murder. You just do not care which of the guests will survive, to collect the state of Dean at the end of the film, hoping against all hope, then none of them will do. <br /> <br /> Even a big surprise at the end is not Actually very surprising, since the killer’s identity is revealed when the filmmaker forgot to keep his face in the shadows, so that you actually see who he is, even before how he manifests himself! Then we have a plot twist that eliminates the killer along with the number of guests remaining to make the film a little more confusing than it already is. The final plot twist, which you can see at a distance of just ten miles, was just to show how clever that very obvious killer was, who deceived almost anyone who watched the movie.
