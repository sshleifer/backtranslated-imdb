This film was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is no plot in it, but at that moment when you realize that this is far beyond the beginning of the film, you will have to recognize for a long time the complete incompetence of the director, that is, the sloth who plays the tampon chick in and we do not believe that Willem Defoe in this film is a clone, because the real Dapho, as we know from Apocalypse Now and the Saints of Benefactor, would never agree to such a scenario. <br /> <br /> Spirit, yes, the enemy wrote this bill along with his twenty-year-old child. This film begins with two credits the main characters, Defoe and Kolagrande, and then the two writers, Defoe and Kolagrande, and then the director Kolragranda. <br /> <br /> Bottomline fucked. <br /> <br /> Name in the Netherlands; Black widow (another name, the same garbage). <br /> <br /> DON'T LOOK THIS FILM !!! This is the total waist of time !!!
