This movie is terrible. CGI is a very cheap gray drop of CGI. The crocodile looks like a big gray spot. Worst of all, no effort is needed to make him walk or look alive. Basically this is a CGI with photos that fits into scenes, and you almost expect to see a hand that moves a CGI spot around the screen. This is one of the worst CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of very bad movies on the Sci-Fi Channel. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrible lack of special effects, the cast consists of typical low-cost actors who probably work as waiters / waiters at local eateries while they are waiting for their big breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this film is when one of the bad guys tries to rape Kate, and the giant crocodile jumps out of the water to the second floor of the villains headquarters and pushes the bad guy Kate out of the balcony and instead of crashing through the building and crush Kate), Krok just flies back at the same angle into the water. No laws of physics can apply to this film or special effects. At least among the crocodiles there is an honor.
