The first two I really liked, really. Moreover, the second is not just an attempt to make another as good as the first. And this story stands alone. You do not need to know the first movie. I also liked the films "Free Willy". <br /> <br /> But ... third, it is absolutely useless here! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop in a good half hour. It's all right with the movie, it has fun parts. What for? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. For me, Lion King 1 1/2: a hard attempt to get even more pleasure from the first movie than it already was, plus a story with a story from their point of view. What for? I would really like to know. You know, the idea that the two of them are sitting in a movie and watching the first one is really good. But what comes after is basically not necessary. I think many people liked Timon and Pumba, and I, too. However, for me, many parts were very constructed with an attempt to be ridiculous. No chance, much of this was anything but funny, at least for me. Btw. What is the film about? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to get more pleasure from the first film? I tend to choose option b, and I am very disappointed with this. <br /> <br /> If you like stories like: “The Story Behind Xy”, you should see “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really fun, and don't try to get more from Hamlet than it is.
