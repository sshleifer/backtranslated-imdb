“I'm Curious: Yellow” is a disgusting and pretentious heap of fumes. It does not matter what his political views are, because this film can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the statement that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, it is not. I have seen R-rated movies with male nudity. Of course, they only offer some passing views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulva and smacking lips? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same applies to those stupid cable shows: the shlongs sway in the wind, but the clitoris is not visible in sight. And these pretentious indie films, such as The Brown Bunny, in which we are treated to pulsating Johnson Vincent Gallo, but there are no traces of pink on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) a “double standard” in matters of nudity, a mentally stupid person must take into account one inevitably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals shown by naked actresses and this cannot be said for men. In fact, you generally will not see female genitals in an American film in anything short porn or overt erotica. This supposed double standard is a less double standard than, admittedly, the dismal ability to culturally agree with the internal organs of the female body.
