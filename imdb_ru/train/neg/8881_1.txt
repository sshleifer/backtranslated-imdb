The acting is a bit tough, as if this is the first time a person from the actors has appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the best actresses, Jean Simmons (played many roles on television, as in "Star Trek in TNG" and "In the heat of the night"), quickly dies, and after that its action can be missed noticeably. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ballard plays the main role in the role of Cliff Robertson. Cliff has to carry this film in his own body language most of the time. He doesn’t do a bad job, but it’s a little unnecessary to ask the actor to connect the oceans to an empty screen, during which the characters spend their time, NOT talking, and also NOT acting. The most memorable role of Robertson could be Ben Parker in the last 3 films about Spider-Man (starring Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. A husband kills his rich wife for her money. after that, the wife seems to come back and pursue her husband, driving him to distraction until he jumps out of a high window (fearing the ghost of a dead wife approaching him) on a day when, as expected, he will die no less. <br /> <br /> The second driver who Mr. Ballard hires is very similar to the English brand Hamill. Strange really! The only thing that stands out is the complete disregard for the dialogue. Many minutes pass in silence, nobody speaks, and few act. It's a shame the guys from MST3K never got hold of this movie. It could have been much better if not so predictable, with more dialogue or shorter “nothing” scenes. <br /> <br /> I continued to expect G'Mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and announce that he is working for the “nothing” that dwells in this film.
