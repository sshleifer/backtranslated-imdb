Jennifer Jason Lee and Mare Winningham are a good friend, depicting completely different brothers and sisters, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or significant to her role. Lee, a singer in a bar group and an alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly relies on her older sister Georgia, a famous folk singer in the form of Johnny Mitchell. Perhaps because of her double responsibilities as co-producer in the film, Lee seems to have driven herself into a corner: she is not credible as a singer and, even if it is deliberate, gives herself too much screen time on the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour de force, Lee is dragged by the wire, nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent in this character (Lee is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that shield us from her). If Sadie had even the slightest charisma or attraction, we could accept the idea that she gets the (small) breaks she takes. In fact, the likelihood that she will ever get on stage is small. Directed by Ulu Grosbard creates several intense dramatic episodes, and editing in the final matches Sadie's bar performance with a sold-out show in Georgia - both sing the same song - and this is a sad moment ... but really, what to indicate? * 1/2 of ****
