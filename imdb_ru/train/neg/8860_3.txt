Well, as everyone has already noted, this film is a complete dog. To some extent, this is because it was a terrible sex film, in which a lot of material was cut out (or darkened almost to invisibility), in order to avoid the X-rating of the censor; but there are many other flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> For a start, the screenwriter seems to have confused his werewolves and vampires. The villains in this film are fluffy and do not like silver, but in all other respects they behave like vampires. Now you just can't do it with a shitty genre click, you have to stick to the rules of the genre, or fans get confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. In fact, the whole (tangled and poorly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but doesnâ€™t make any sense in a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, werewolf costumes are the worst for you. never saw. Anyone in the werewolf film industry should know that the costumes and transformations of werewolves are something that fans critically evaluate, but some of these werewolves are just stupid. <br /> <br /> There are some good points. I really liked the bill. Others mentioned boobs Sybil Dunning. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing can exist) <br /> <br /> I also really liked the plan of attack on the werewolf stronghold. There are so many horror films that rely on the stupid behavior of the characters, but in this case, they first acquire a very reasonable and effective arsenal against werewolves and kill monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have pretty powerful firearms these days. Should not be too difficult to connect two and two, eh? But in a typical style, this film goes beyond and adds another very funny and amusing anti-licanthropic weapon.
