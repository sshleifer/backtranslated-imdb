A tense comedy, similar to a sketch of the revue, which was originally a means of demonstrating the former radio star Jack Perl, but now it is best remembered as the introduction of America to Three Puppets. In fact, Larry, Curly and Mo are shown together with comedian Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Puppet. Despite the fact that Jimmy Durante (who is completely mediocre because of the dull material) and Zas Pitts starred in the lead roles, the only audience of the film these days are the drug addicts Stoges, and even they will not find much applause here. Incredibly loud and domineering, he shows how far Hollywood had to go in order to reach a certain level of sophistication. * 1/2 of ****
