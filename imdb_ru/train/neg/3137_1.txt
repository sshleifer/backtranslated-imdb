I, like many people, saw this film in the theater when it first came out in '97. At best, it was a film below average, provocative, and not the “masterpiece” that all these Titanic fans love to show. First, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter what you look at. People just love him because of his looks. His acting “skills” are essentially to utter many silly phrases and try to behave sexually. Secondly, the film itself was quite a boring and simple plot: the girl falls in love with the guy, loads him into the sink, many wacky love scenes after that. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize that this is not brilliant in any way. And not original. Plus, the director felt the need to stretch it for more than 3 hours. I could squeeze it into a 1-hour block, without losing a single plot. In conclusion, Titanic is the most overrated film to date. Why so much attention and money I miss.
