this film is outrageous, outrageous, I mean horrible. It was much more interesting for me to watch the paint dry in my local hardware store on August day, suffering from migraines and heat stroke. acting was getting worse and worse as the “cinema” progressed, and the director's use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached. when Misty was shot, she decided that it would be prudent to blink after death. it was not reasonable. frankly, Stevie Wonder could catch it with his eyes closed. if you decide between playing with a nail gun while intoxicating and watching this movie, keep in mind that this gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
