I’ve seen a few crappy movies in my life, but this must be one of the worst. Definitely the bottom 100 materials (i.e., i.e.). <br /> <br /> We are following two couples: Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earle and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalllah (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in one car on the road Reno. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Lonnie is not too happy with his sex life, so he cheats on his wife from Candy, who is desperately trying to have a baby. , Roy, meanwhile, is not too sure that his sperm is in order, so he checks her with a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now I read the back of the DVD, but my friend didn’t, and after about 20 minutes she blurted out: “Oh yes, she will get pregnant, but her husband cannot have a child.” Find how this movie is sooooo predictable. Like boring. And annoying. It makes no sense. Offensive. Awful. <br /> <br /> An example of how this film stinks. The two couples went to their big car in the direction of Nevada when they were stopped by 2 policemen, since they did not stop at the stop sign. The guys know each other and, finally, bribe two officers with a box of beer. This scene is not only meaningless and not important (or even relevant) for the film, it takes about 5 minutes! Just talk, talk and talk, and not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Although I still need to think about the ending. Obviously, Roy has no problems there, so he is the father of the child. How many times does this happen in a movie ... try something new! The deceived wife eventually forgives her husband and best friend for the affair, and they all live happily ever after. Muck <br /> <br /> The best scene of the film is at the very end, with a couple of shots of the Grand Canyon. Why couldn't they just keep the camera turned on for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> One would expect more from this actor (although Thornton does try), but you can't blame them. Writers, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
