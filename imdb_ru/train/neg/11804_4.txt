This 1973 television remake of the classic Billy Wilder is inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a terrific Burton Keys. Of course, he is not as good as Edward G. Robinson, but he is the only reason to watch it. The only improvement on this remake compared to the original is that it reduces the role of Lola Dietrichson, the fatal daughter of Phillis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And this is all for good things. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of bad things. The director records everything indifferently: if you are watching a film with a muffled sound, you are unlikely to get the impression that something particularly interesting is happening. Due to modern bad taste, the film should be color, not black and white. Because of the bad taste of the 1970s, all the scenery is disgustingly ugly. In particular, the expensive apartment of Walter Neff is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Modern furnishings harm many small things. Train rides were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so Mr. Dietrichsonâ€™s decision to take the train seems trickier. The men stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair, posing as a gray-haired Mr. Dietrichson. The women in mourning stopped wearing the veil, which deprives Samantha Eggar of the props Barbara Stanwyk beautifully used in the key scene. (Oddly enough, Lola still has a line where she shows that her stepmother tried on a black hat and veil before she needed them.) <br /> <br /> Steven Bochko stores most of Billy Wilder's script Raymond Chandler is the same. But he makes a lot of tiny, inexplicable changes to the dialogue that leave the script a little flabby when it was lean and muscular. Outrageously, the famous motorcyclist banter has disappeared, but look closely and you will see what looks like post-production where these lines should have been. Bochco may not be to blame. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is as demolished as Walter Neff. What could have made this version tolerable was Phillis Dietrichson, who was really great. Instead, we get Samantha Eggar, who, like Barnaby Jones, goes crazy with a standard problem. But who can blame Eggar? With a director who seems to have little interest in what happens in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwick herself work well together?
