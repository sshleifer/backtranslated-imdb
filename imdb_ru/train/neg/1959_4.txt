The tooth fairy is about a ghost of an old distorted witch who lures children to her home to get a prize for their lost tooth and then takes their lives. The first few minutes introduce you to the beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy in 1949, and then move on to today. The terrified horror story is largely preserved by the solid game. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and several other scenes, but in general the bloody scenes were bloody but quick, which had a minimizing effect. Eye candy is very good for both sexes. Working with the camera is good. The dialogue is honest, but cheesy. I expected the film to be naked, with a small budget, a slasher with very few saving factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
