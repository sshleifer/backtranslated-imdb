* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First of all I rated this movie 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but in the movie there are too many stupid mistakes make it a mental drama as it could be. First of all, she never fights alone. After the initial very strange doubt from her mother (which is implausible when the mother turns out to be so supportive and loving later in the film) the victim of rape is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also incredibly naive, always falling into strange crew traps. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly disgusting. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing I find is that Ethan does not control the team when he changes his mind. Ethan - the leader of the team that he is right, and his former friend is wrong. Everyone just hates him ... why ?? The film does not give an explanation. How did he become a leader? <br /> <br /> It's funny that my girlfriend thought I was watching Beverly Hills when she entered. Two actors from the same successful series .... a cheap way to get viewers?
