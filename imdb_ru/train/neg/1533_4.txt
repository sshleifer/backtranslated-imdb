I will not spend much time and energy on this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive that I felt that I just had to let people know that not everyone was so excited, not to mention that they were intellectually provoked by this attempt to create an exciting philosophical cinematic puzzle. Some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but could not stand the rest. I felt like I was stoned again, after semi-philosophical conversations with other teenagers. <br /> <br /> What a futile attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights. I would prefer to see how Jesus is Palestine, without any pretensions and with direct humor, and also to raise questions about life and the realities that we create for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and, apparently, never will be.
