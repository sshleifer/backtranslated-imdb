Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon appeared, there has been a lot of talk about reviving the Hong Kong film industry. Do not believe this. People who are making films in Hong Kong now give a new meaning to the word “rude”. Ending time 2 is a great example. Ekin Cheng is a toss-up, but for the most part of the movie he just grins idiotically and tosses a coin. He tosses a coin over and over, over and over. What for? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman who is chasing a cute boy throwing coins. But once again: who knows why? In the main role there is a cute actress who runs a company, and she has to pay a ransom or something like that, but basically she looks like she would prefer to be in a spa or shopping center, and not in front of the camera. Nothing makes any sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All that is is the name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? What's the difference?
