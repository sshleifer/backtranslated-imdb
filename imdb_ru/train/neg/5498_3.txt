I think my summary sums it up. I found this pointless and stupid. I also saw the end a mile of the way. Everyone copies this finale more when doing a crossover for TV / Theater. Sometimes it's better to leave a movie alone. <br /> <br /> Others, it is better to forget about the film. This is one of the others ....
