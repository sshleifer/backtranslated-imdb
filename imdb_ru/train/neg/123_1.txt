Oh, brother ... hearing about this ridiculous movie for years, all I can think about is Peggy Lee's old song .. <br /> <br /> "Is that all there is ??" ... I was still a teenager when this smoked fish came to the United States. I was too young to get into the theater (although I managed to get into Goodbye, Columbus). Then the film appeared in the local cinema museum. I was finally able to watch this film, but now I was as old as my parents were when they watched it !! <br /> <br /> The ONLY reason this film was not Convicted by the anonymous sand of the time was due to the obscenity caused by its release to the USA. Millions of people flocked to this smelly, thinking that they were going to watch a sex movie ... Instead, they received many close-ups of disgusting, repulsive Swedes, interviews on the streets in empty shopping centers, as well as political claims ... and weak ones cares about simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, Holy Grail, historical artifact ... Whatever it is, destroy it, burn it, and then pour the ashes into the lead box! <br /> <br /> Elite aesthetes are still trying to find value in their boring pseudo-revolutionary political fabrications. But if it were not for the censorship scandal, he would have been ignored and then forgotten. <br /> <br /> Instead, the "I Am Blank, Blank" rhythymed title repeated endlessly for many years, like titilation for porn movies (I'm Curious, lavender for funny movies, I Am Curious, black for black people film actors, etc ..) and every ten years or so, the thing rises from the dead to be seen by a new generation of suckers who want to watch this "naughty sex film" that has evolved the film industry "... <br / > <br /> Yes, avoid like a plague .. Or, if you MUST see it, rent a video and transfer to the dirty parts, just to get it over with. <br /> <br />
