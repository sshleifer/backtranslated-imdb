Wow ... what can I say ... First of all, IMDb says that at the end of the 60s ... which means that Carlito will be very close to going to prison, he went out at 75 and said he was for 5 years. They used a bunch of actors by anyone, and a story that didn't even make sense. They return only one actor, Guzman, and he plays a completely different guy. Why did it end with him and this puerto rican? Where is Gale? He said he loved her before. Where is Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You would think that he was in it. And if that makes sense, where is Rocco and the black dude in the first? It was just silly ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first film.
