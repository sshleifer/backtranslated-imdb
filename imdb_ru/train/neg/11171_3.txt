A very big film of the times - extremely long episodes without dialogue, bad memories and almost completely male actors. The two women who appear have a total of less than 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. <br /> <br /> O'Tul attracts when he speaks; unfortunately, he spends most of his time peering into the bushes. Alastair Sims is always happy to see, but he, too, is terribly undervalued. <br /> <br /> The film has another positive aspect, which reflects many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (for example, an accident). the appearance of Mosley graffiti) that many people today do not know. Too many of today's films about World War II paint the Allies as all good, and the Axis all evil, when history tells us that people are much more complicated! <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie when you are recovering from the flu and are on the couch and are not able to absorb too much. If you need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize, this film is for you.
