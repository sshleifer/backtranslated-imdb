If this series should be improved in comparison with “Batman” - “Animated series”, I, for example, believe that it has failed terribly. Drawing a lousy character ... (Catwoman, for example, looks terrible ...) But what really annoyed me was the fact that Batman looked like a weakling who simply can't take care of himself in a battle without the help of two, even three assistants. For God's sake, I mean Batman! I know comics, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl must be Batman's allies, except Robin, but still ... make Batman say that he needs help from them ... What, he can't take several blows? In BTAS, he could easily run into a dozen opponents ... Is he aging? C'mon ... <br /> <br /> And again: I really don’t think that Batman would allow such a child as Tim Drake to join the battle soon, without many years of hard training. Firstly, this is irresponsible (and Batman is all, but irresponsible), and secondly, this is not what happened in the comics if we want to remain faithful to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - the animated series went down in history, with its animation, stories and characters ... This is really a legend about Batman. The New Adventures series turned the legend into another Batman movie.
