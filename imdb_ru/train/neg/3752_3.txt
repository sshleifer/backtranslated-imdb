I grew up watching and loving TNG. I just recently finished watching the entire ST Voyager series on DVD, which may have increased my disgust for this episode, since the difference in style and approach between the two shows could not be more dramatic. The idea would probably be good if it were used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, as it would probably be perceived in VOY. They could have memories that were “new” to the audience, and not just spewed out old clips. Incoming and outgoing transitions between “memories” and “real” in this episode begin as a cliché at the beginning and very quickly become unbearable when the tired image continues to grow. Bar is not the worst episode ever.
