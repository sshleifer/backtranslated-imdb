Predictable, beaten and poorly written. Foolishly, I thought that such an outstanding cast would not be involved if he was not worthy. I believe that the competition among actors these days is so intense (and will only get worse) that you canâ€™t choose any more. At the very beginning, they gave us a hint, which played an important role in the murder, and since then we have had a sore throat. There was no intrigue in the film, which gave us a little insight into the victim and only one of the possible motives for the murder. Frankly, some of them were embarrassing! It is hard to believe that someone will even think, let alone commit themselves to spending tens of millions of dollars on this prank.
