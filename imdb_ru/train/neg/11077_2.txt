The only reason I decided to shoot was due to the presence of Oscar-winning Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is that it was the biggest waste of a good actor ever filmed. As far as I could tell, Borgnin was the ONLY actor in this. Other performances were so terrible that I was surprised that the studio would actually pay "performers" for the appearance. Combine this level of talent in the acting department with a story so dismal and tasteless that I thought that my eyes would start to bleed by the time the credits begin, and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. Obviously, the film was created in order to please the children's audience, and, to its credit, it was better than most of the original programs on the Disney channel and in similar areas focused on children. But frankly, it says little.
