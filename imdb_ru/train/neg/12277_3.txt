I found the “Arab plot” in the trash can and thought that I had found the lost treasure. People, there is a reason why you don’t hear much about this movie. The plot is dirty, the pace is slow, Cornelia Sharp is about as bouncy as regular cold tofu, and the ending leaves you indifferent. Even Sean Connery can't save it.
