Spilling chemicals turns people into zombies. Up to two doctors survive after an epidemic. This is a film by Andreas Sznaas, so you know what the course will be. Bad game, terrible terrible special effects, and there is no budget to talk about. Rewriting is ridiculous with a capital R, and the saddest thing is that I feel obliged to write one word about this piece of excrement, not to mention the ten mandatory lines, because of the guidelines imposed on IMDb. My initial review is just one word: “The shit won't fly,” so I have to review it and tell more about how bad it is. But I don't know if I can, so ... wait, I think I may have enough words or lines to get this review through. What a cool i think. So in conclusion: this film sucks eggs, do not watch it. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
