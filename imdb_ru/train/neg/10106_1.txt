Yes, I am sure that it really can be a nation. If four of them all stood in four corners of the world, and the other two cloned themselves several billion times. Dude, I'm very glad I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of shooting it. I'm a big fan of George Romero films, and I'm sure that if he saw this film, he probably would have burst out laughing too much. I mean, what about the raccoons who pretended to be zombies and walked like Charlie's devils? It also helped that the music composer chose crappy music for a fashion show when zombies approached their killer, especially in the part where they go to the warehouse, posing as a furniture store / police station / apartment / apartment / whatever room neither was the gong in the background, and the living woman argued about the closed furniture store. I could not even tell what nationality the murderer was, and the fact that his accent pointed to several different nations did not help either. Oh, well, what can I expect from a film where, for no particular reason, they throw a scene of a random fight in a warehouse, where they obviously send air boxes around the world. So, for all those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like to play bad C films (C for Craptastic), then this film is for you. , , or not.
