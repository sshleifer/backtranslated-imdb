Sean Bean is great as the photos, locations and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat confused, and the conclusion is even. The plot has been significantly modified from the novel Cornwall, and not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watching. Sharpe was too narrowly traced here, unlike his literary alter ego, which seems smarter and more determined, despite his fears in his new role as an officer elevated to the rank. I really liked the short scene in which Sharpe stumbled over the “real” officer, and after a quick pause and piercing gaze pushes the surprised and terrified officer back. He sets the tone for his subsequent trials as a commander. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" of "10".
