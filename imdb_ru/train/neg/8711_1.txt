OK ..... This is the third of a series of carnosaurs. Let's start with dinosaur dolls! At the beginning of the film, you cannot see the cause of the Dino, when the body count begins, you can only see Dino's vision, rather clever enough to hide the bad puppets! and maybe some 16 minutes later in the film, some special forces team with Scott Valentin in the role of Rance leader, the team enters the warehouse, and then they begin to find body parts and corpses after Dinoâ€™s fury, after some time some big box failure in the team, and you can hear the cry of velociraptor, pretty creepy !!! and then the black girl goes forward, and now one ball is found! She raises the hand of a predator and cuts her face, but if you pause when the hand of the predator comes, you will see that this is just a guy with a puppet! WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorists attack some kind of truck because they wash some kind of weapon there. 2. They, where they are mistaken, seem to be dozens of tons of predator and one giant t-rex! How did the T-Rex fit in ??? 3. Rance and some botanists will kill dinosaurs! Unfortunately, some stupid blond girl told him to catch one of them alive = (4. Holy Jesus, the predators have wheels on their exploits! 5. The dinosaur is now on a boat in the Pacific. 6: Strange, I did not know that T-Rex had a weird thing around your neck 7. END. The movie is good if you want to laugh. 5/10
