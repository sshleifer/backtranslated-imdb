I wanted to vote zero or lower. I liked the comment. This is the worst film ever made, and “unbearable” is the perfect word for him, unless there is something worse that Roghet never thought of. I also cannot come up with anything negative enough to accurately describe Bo Derek. The best thing about her is that she is consistent.
