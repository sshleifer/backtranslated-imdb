Recently, I was online, browsing a website that hosted shared movies. In their long list of films was this film, and I thought that I should be hallucinating in such an offensive title and premise. But no, this is really what it was. And since the film lasted only about 27 minutes, I decided to try. If it turned out some porn movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the strangest film I've ever seen. A film crew from Denmark tried with a budget of about $ 49 to make a movie in the Star Trek style about a film crew of very cheerful men traveling around the galaxy, who destroy female oppression, killing all the women, as they did on the Earth! And in each case, they were greeted with applause and gratitude from the now gay planet. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. With some of the most obscene and youthful character names I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without deleting my review! However, despite all the rubbish of all this, it was strangely watchable and worth a look. But, as I mentioned, due to coarse names and strange subjects (albeit without nudity), this film is for adults only. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film left me 1001 questions about how WHO would do it, WHY do it, and WHO was the target audience ?! Perhaps this is not the worst thing I've ever seen, but perhaps this is the strangest and perhaps the most offensive!
