** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The title heroine rescues one more beautiful little girl and her father (an eccentric professor whose ordinary cork helmet is broken with one shot and completely in the next) from the eaten moth Shop mummy and nasty nazis to - what else? - to build the Fourth Reich. Misty's costume, like that of some other Wimmen, is becoming poorer when the film is being played. The last part of the film is devoted to long-term lesbian activities; these shots actually become very boring, very fast, which means more about the creature behind the camera than about the tortuous creatures in front of it. MISTY first quickly removes its nominal plot, and then pays all attention to nudity and sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a return to films made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this miracle were created four decades ago, it would have played for years on 42nd Street with WHAM BAM, THANKS TO YOU SPATIAL and KISS ME QUICK. In fact, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to home video. Grab your own, quickly, before it goes out of print.
