I believe that the young people who participated in the creation of Necromancy (also known as Witch, plus a bunch of other names) should have felt a little strange on the horror movie with a man who: participated in a proletarian play with John Houseman "The cradle will swing"); scared people to think that aliens were invading ("War of the Worlds"); and directed and starred in the greatest film of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles starred in the third film about the satanic cult. <br /> <br /> There is nothing creative about this movie. A lot of nudity, but background music is always distracting. Even if the film was not particularly predictable, it was still not worth watching. How low Wells plunged. Fortunately, for the last thirteen years of his life, he told the documentary “Bugs Bunny Superstar” (about Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1940s) and hosted the documentary “The Man Who Seen Tomorrow” (about Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkin.
