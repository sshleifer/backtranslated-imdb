After hearing and hearing Harvey Bernhard's commentary on Omen II, I was shocked to find that he was also behind this absolute rubbish. It looks like a really bad TV movie that you can see in the middle of the day, when you have the flu and you are too sick to reach the remote. I think that at the moment when Michael Lerner was confronted with what I can only describe as the cast of Les Miserables, my mouth opened with disbelief. And then my mouth went up and down, because I laughed so much. Dire. I don’t know why I need to write at least ten lines, I summarized my point of view, there’s nothing clever in this modern verbiage.
