It seemed that this film would be better than in the end. The cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue was not too hard ... but then, for about twenty minutes, there was a long scene with the Doctor, who, as you know, is actually a patient in a shelter, pretending to be a doctor - from there he just goes South. <br /> <br /> In addition, the demon is the most stupid looking hellish creature since the days of the sight of Godzilla in the Curse of the Demon. There are also some strange devil worshipers who wear masks that look like exploding teenagers from the very beginning of the Logan Run. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cinema could not save this film. Despite the rather solid performances of the actors, the story is simply not going anywhere. I think “Hellbored” would be the best name for this.
