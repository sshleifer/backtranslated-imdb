What on earth has become with our dear Rama? Is this the same person who created Sarkar, Satia and Komapni? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was the most ambitious project of Rama, he clearly jumped off a high cliff, which he climbed, giving the industry some of the greatest works of all time. This film is made to fall like a brick. I tried to leave the theater, but I had to sit down, because I could not get my car out of the parking lot before the others left. Otherwise, nothing would make me sit outside the interval. <br /> <br /> This film is not at all close to Sholei. It doesn't even come close to him in the mile. I believe that Rama certainly loves the Godfather more than Sholai, since Sarkar was a classic. I read Rama's interview a couple of days ago, in which the interviewer said that Rama didn’t sleep more than 4 hours a day, which was also not without a break. Now I fully agree with this, since his lack of sleep probably affected the film. <br /> <br /> There is no power in the performance. Amitabh Bachchan doesn't even look scary. He looked more horrifying on those few posters and wallpapers that I saw earlier. Favorite Ramu Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job at Sarkar because she didn’t have many dialogues (in fact, not one, if I remember well). She opened her mouth in this film and found her place in history. It seems that the new guy playing the role of Jay, such a bold look, but he did not cope with the role of Jay. I can't continue ... Sorry ... my pain is too great for me to deal with right now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself throughout the film that I’ll look at the original Sholai once again to see that he is still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: a terrible movie. Media and critics are going to cook goose rama. And once again, to remind all readers, I am one of the greatest fans of Rama, and even I cannot spare him for this act.
