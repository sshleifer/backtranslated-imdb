It's been a long time since I last saw such a bad movie. Acting is very average, the story is terribly boring, and I do not know what to say about performance. It was completely unoriginal. Oh, and this is the same comedy as Clint Eastwood, pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (one of which from the TV show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80%, let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a renewed career, I think that this will never happen to this in their resume! The script had potential, but neither 80% of the actors, nor the director (who is an actor and obviously should stick to the role of an actor) did not realize it. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed the best. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you ever want to see this, I strongly recommend that you go to something less traumatic because not only is it a complete waste of time, but also a weak example of what it looks bad movie.
