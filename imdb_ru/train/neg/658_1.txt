I would like to give this film zero out of ten. Before moving to this movie the day after it was released, I went to IMDb to check out the comments. Commentary called the film predictable and gentle with terrible dialogue. I never hold other people's opinions, so I spent seven dollars on this crappy movie. It was supposed to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script must be dropped from the cliff. Since when do scary scenes appear in scary movies? I swear, I am amazed that there were no GROUP ADS ^ - ^ moments. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And this is because I have disconnected, thinking about my research work in English. Cliches, birds / cats appear from nowhere when you THOUGHT that something is about to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost died of laughter when the alarm went off, and the main character said: "I need to get my mom's shawl !!!" You. Moron. Screw the handkerchief! Security is only a few steps away, but NO, my mom's shawl (by the way, she didnâ€™t fit under the dress) is IMPORTANT, more important than my health and safety. And to top it all off, they took her back to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the WHOLE movie. And not only, I bet, he hides under the bed, moments. It was: "He stole the corridor clothes and got out of the hotel" and "This is a detective walking down the corridor, not a murderer!" Moments. Movies should never be so predictable. Disney movies aren't even as predictable. <br /> <br /> I'm going to end my rant now, saying that it was a terrible movie. I'm glad that I went to watch it in cinemas, so I would not buy it for $ 15, and then I hated it. It was just bad. It would be better if only one thing happened. If after the detective had been shot, the killer would have fallen in the same position that he was shot at. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on the way down. Oh, how nice it would be. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time and money. Go see a GOOD movie.
