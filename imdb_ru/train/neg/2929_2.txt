Not funny - how can anyone connect this to Monty Python? This is absolutely ridiculous - no laughter. It's not funny. Moreover, but ugly, strangely just for the sake of the strange, and it seems to me that these people were on something all the time. Unfortunately, something that did not make them ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Need to give a few points for the effort, etc. Actually, it seems, there is a track of laughter - or is it? Hmmm .... Since there is almost no laughter, this is a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> I may be doing this unfairly - maybe this is some kind of exercise. Some kind of art - in this case everything goes, never mind. <br /> <br /> But these guys play women with high voices, raised noses. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one heir to Monty Python's intellectual wit - this is Stephen Colbert and possibly John Stewart.
