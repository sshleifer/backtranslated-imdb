Someone had a great idea: let's ask Misty Mound to make his own version of Lara Croft with a rating of R - shoot two guns, not only in scant clothing, but also in topless. It was a really great idea. The problem is that the people who had it could not come up with any scenario or budget to support it. Thus, we get a "film" that barely reaches the average length, reproducing many of its parts (often in slow motion), and was obviously completely removed in the garage. Misty Munda’s appeal is still clear: she’s incredibly sweet and has a natural beauty next door. However, her two female colleagues here, with whom she shares a long lesbian scene, are far from her league. If “Mummy Raider” were presented as a video on Youtube, I would rate it higher, but as a “film” intended for DVD consumption, it cannot get more than 1/2 a * of 4.
