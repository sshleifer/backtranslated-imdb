This is one of the funniest bad movies I've ever had the honor to see. <br /> <br /> One Friday evening I watched this on a DVD with a group of friends, and we just could not stop laughing from beginning to end. end. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: the terrorists steal a convoy, which, in their opinion, carries weapons-grade uranium, but in fact it carries a bunch of cannibal dinosaurs. Easy mistake to make. Submit a strikingly incompetent team of army special forces to fight prehistoric animals. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; the man who seems to have perfected the actor's game, “The Scent of a Fart,” for which Joey appears in Friends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood and an awful lot of shooting here, but unfortunately, the Rance team seems to have trouble aiming. their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant, clumsy monsters. In addition, the light always seems to flicker and go out whenever Velociraptor attacks (presumably, therefore, we cannot see how bad the effects of the creature are). <br /> <br /> Having said all this, we all got a lot of funny bet about who will have to bite his head the next time. <br /> <br /> This film, similar to adventures in the style of “Husinsky Park” / “Aliens”, stinks worse than the crotch of a dinosaur, but funny, mocking entertainment is a great success.
