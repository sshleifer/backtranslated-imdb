There were some funny perfume films that come out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in The Bishop's Wife (1947). Of course, the best films were Topper in the late 30s - early 40s. And, most recently, Warren Beatty, "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), which was a 1941 remake of "And here's Mr. Jordan." These were well-written, funny, entertaining comedies, in the center of which were supernatural creatures such as ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now comes screenwriter / director Jeff Lowell, debuting in his feature film with a story about an unattractive story. An angry young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who is killed on her wedding day, and then returns to harass the young Spiritualist Ashley (Lake Bell), who falls in love with Kate's fiance, Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing is clear from the very beginning: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennet (Marion Kirby in the first two Topper films), which is the standard against which all female ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> the line at the very beginning, when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloan) says to Henry: “You are not smiling.” It accurately described my situation in this film. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that the script is not very funny. But this is exacerbated by the presence of Longoria Parker, who just lost me wrong every time she appeared on the screen. Just to begin with, exacerbating the lack of comedic talent, it is covered in so many pancakes, who knows what it really looks like? Kate dies when preparing for the wedding at the falling frozen statue. She is so reckless that the angel who teaches her about what her afterlife comes out of her (well, she actually just disappears), so Kate finds herself on earth a ghost, not knowing what her mission is. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry to come out of the funk, which he naturally went down to after Kate (from what I saw in Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief), so she introduces him to Ashley, who doesn't really know what she is doing as a spiritualist (she is also a kateritsa to make ends meet) to see if she can return Henry to contact with Kate. There are a lot of megugs that go on. <br /> <br /> Emptiness film embodied in the history of "B", revolving around the assistant Ashley, Dan (Jason Biggs). This is added near the end, but how Ashley copes with this indicates that she is the same tit as Kate. Since Dan is obviously attracted to both of these women with serious flaws, he deserves what he gets. <br /> <br /> In the end, Kate appears before Ashley, and the fun should begin. This is not so, and more a pity, because in other hands it could be quite funny. In fact, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. should roll over in their graves to see what their brilliance in the first two Topper films consist in.
