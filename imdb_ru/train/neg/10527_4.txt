I discovered this film from a vendor selling OOP. And this one is definitely the PLO. A year after Exorcist, she returned to the business with this film, but we all learned that Blair’s career never began, she never became a mega star. This is one of the reasons why many of her films are OOP. She gives a good presentation in this film. It is about a refusal, not recognized by her parents, and who has no friends. He played at the age of 15, played the girl 14, it is ridiculous. The film is also known for the scene of rape in the soul, where they stick a broom to her virginity. In most publications, it’s cut out, why I don’t know, there is no blood, okay, Blair is naked, but nothing is shown, there is no T & A, so there’s nothing to offend people. But the film is slow, very slow. Usually this does not please me, but I almost fell asleep. The point is that a 14-year-old teenager becomes a rebel against society, but there is no blood, no blood, nothing. Why it is classified as horror still amazes me. If you're a Blair fan, buy it if you can find it, otherwise leave it as it is.
