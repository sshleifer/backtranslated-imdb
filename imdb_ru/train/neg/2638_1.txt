There is a good. There is bad. And then their Sentinel, the political thriller at the bottom, which is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The plot about the mole in the secret service is good, but never before has a movie with such enormous potential been so chopped. Directed by Clark Johnson's arrogant "poignancy", every actor in this film seems to be working on an autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas looks boring here. I can honestly say that NEVER in my whole life I watched another movie with so many glaring holes in the plot. The turn is predictable from the very beginning, and the character's motives are so ridiculous that they made the audience laugh. Avoid this at all costs. This is a movie disaster without redemption value.
