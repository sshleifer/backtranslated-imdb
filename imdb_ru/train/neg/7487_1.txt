Unfortunately, this film is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course, they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simonsâ€™s script is not used in this film, so he falls again and again. Even the audience with whom I was, never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious, and when a joke appears, it is distributed, so the joke dies, i.e. couple having sex in the park. They announce that this is an ignition ceremony for New York, we all know that the lights will come on and we will be able to see how cute and robbing Goldie and Steve do the slap. The whole movie ends like this ... the joke is played out and distributed. Why Goldys hair is not at all messed up in the film. You will also notice every close-up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, so if you want to laugh.
