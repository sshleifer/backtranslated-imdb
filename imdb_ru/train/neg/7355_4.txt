Don't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series and movies, but enough is enough: Death On The Nile. Everyone did it! We know who is dying. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I already say enough! Mr. Suchet could use this amazing talent in another Agatha Christie novel. I will say that the acting of all the actors was great. The sets were awesome and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised at how “awful” he looked. I hope he does not look like this in "real" life! I honestly can not remember from other films whether the same end was. For some reason I do not think so. I thought it was a pretty brilliant touch, did Miss Christie write like that. I would prefer this end to end up in jail!
