This film seems completely pointless. There is no reason why everything that happens in this happens as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway and thought “how can I finish it?” Did they do it for betting? I could not tell you the plot, I'm not quite sure that there is someone to be completely frank, but if there is one, it is not recorded. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after it falls down the stairs, just like you. They go into the house with a very annoying little girl in it, they meet Christopher Walken, who dug up an ancient woman, preserved in peat. He brings her back to life for no other reason than she continues the story, and she shows her gratitude by immediately icing it up. Since then, things get a little silly. A couple of hours of my life that I would like to return!
