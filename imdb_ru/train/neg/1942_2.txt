If you do not mind your emotions playing toys, then you will not mind this film. On the other hand, if you like the riddles of British criminals, watch the clues and see how they all logically fall into place at the end, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to this frustration: <br /> <br /> * Although the police have long been using surveillance cameras to collect clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the sight of the children before her disappearance was not caught by the camera. This is a critical part of the mystery. It is incredible that the car in which the children were, was captured on camera, and not a large truck, which is so important to the puzzle. <br /> <br /> * The film tells how complex the tracking technique is. on the move of children, but misses the opportunity to use the same complex equipment, tracking vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible places near the crime scene, as part of developing clues. <br /> <br /> * In England, driving is on the left. The director tries his best to take the car to the park at the crime scene on the right, a few meters from the flower stand, when it could be easily parked right behind or even to the side; how did a huge truck. <br /> <br /> * A police forensic team is so meticulous that it finds an abandoned cell phone in a sewer pipe a few miles from the crime scene, but cannot find any evidence of a head injury right at the crime scene, even to the fact that they guarded the scene just a few hours after the disappearance and without intermediate rains. <br /> <br /> * Search dogs were not used at all to search for missing children; this is from a country that is well known for looking for a hunt dog for hunting and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that such widely publicized news would not have caused the allegedly innocent truck driver who stopped at the Flower Shop. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical for a mother to go to such extremes and make so much effort to leave traces of carpet fiber under her nails for her future murderous investigators, even persuading her daughter to do so. The same, although she simply could not crawl out of the unguarded motor home. If she had enough common sense to ask her daughter to put carpet fiber under her nails, she could just as easily ask her daughter to call for help or even leave the house on wheels, which was in a crowded residential park. <Br /> <br /> * The suspect who kidnapped the little girl was portrayed as mentally retarded / weak-minded - justifying his unconscious drowning of the mother ?? but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police, and also to fully exercise his rights, so as not to testify against himself. <br /> <br /> There are other inconsistencies that will lead to the disappointment of a true fan of humor. “Five Days” is a very weak British criminal history.
