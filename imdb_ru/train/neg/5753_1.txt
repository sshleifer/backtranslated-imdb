... although the film, which seems to be trying to present itself as horror, clearly lacked blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a clear lack of skilled directors, actors, editors and directors. script writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London put on one of the most horrific performances I have ever seen - his “diving into the maelstrom” of madness is painfully self-conscious and awkward. Oh, look at him twitch! Oh, look at him, drink strong perfume! Oh, look at him, raise your eyebrows and tilt your head at a sharp angle! Oh, look at his unwashed, greasy dark hair! Oh, listen to his excitedly hoarse voice! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, the poet T-shirt comes out - this is another boy who thinks he is Byron. (Or Po.) Oh, for the love ... someone gave this guy a manual “How to behave well,” or they just pulled him out of a cardboard box somewhere, a non-existent little plastic toy prize in stopping the Cereal Brand with discounts . Well, it was a stupid trait - but this is only because the performance of London melted my brain with its horror. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a pretty cutie and has grown, but has not yet grown up in her acting shoes. this film - she showed her lines as if she was detained, in fact, all her performance was very wooden, her poses were as hard as her lines - who knows, maybe she just reacted and tried to neutralize Jeremy London's hesitant excesses, but if so, she goes too far. <br /> <br /> Erie Vervin is known in the role of Poo - although his character’s role is confused, he demonstrates the best performance of the play. He looks pretty simple, but it's not just that - he has some kind of depth, I believed that he had a life beyond the gloomy two-dimensional quality of the other characters. Yes, maybe it's just because I like Po, and so he could just let his mind wander and invent while he was on the screen - whatever it was, he had a factor of interest, otherwise absent. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are a faceless stain — there are all the usual cartoons: a cheerful blond, a best friend who is a little crazy; smitten local policeman who is a bit of a jerk; a protective elderly man who may not be too fatherly interested in our heroine; insidious old witch, etc., etc., yawn, yawn. <br /> <br /> As in the case of the “apparent lack of blood for a horror film,” none of the topics they mention (and that the London character mentions - so fiercely - in his attack on Poe’s writing) do not runs through on. As another reviewer said, there was a potential here: murder, incest, are really shocking things, but instead they dodge problems and break away from violence (a candlestick raised in the air — approaching its victim — then black! This is normal in traditional Noir horror, indeed, it is expected, and it is accepted with love when it happens - it is an expensive convention, especially when it is accompanied by false lightning strikes and Sioux’s intense eye makeup - but in Descendant “it just looks like a clumsy, or as if The editor at the last moment became sick and turned it off.) It could be either a very tense psychological thriller - the horror of palingenesis / delusions / madness - or a simple (and fun) slasher movie: it tries to be both, and other (something new and exciting!), but in any case it fails. The only element of the horror of this film is the epic stupidity. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if he was at all) was drunk when he / she split this thing - there is an awkward angle of the scene; scenes that seemed out of order (but it could just be a bad script). Similarly, the director and cinematographer - there were some very strange shots and shots that I thought should have been a tribute to Hitchcock or Browning, but in the end looked silly (again, well in noir, but it was an attempt to be something something else.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps all of this would be funny (in the sense that previous reviewers mentioned: “O God, how did this happen?!?”) if I were in the mood for what something garbage ... unfortunately, I sat down on the sofa, a muffled light, with the clear intention of scaring myself - this is a very bad film, and I am afraid for I can not recommend it for people, not for laughter. <br /> <br /> Please don’t waste your time or money on it - either borrow a real horror movie / thriller, or find yourself fantastic stories. By all means, you’ll have a much more pleasant and frightening night. than you could hope to achieve with this rubbish.
