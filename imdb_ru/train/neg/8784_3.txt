The idea was awesome, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the script was bad and there was no depth. I could not get into this movie. I did not feel for the heroes, there were a lot of sensations, and the film just ends very strangely. Was it a happy ending? I dont know. Was it a sad end? Again I do not know. You leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. Cinema was so much, but could not. The fact that you can edit does not mean that you should, right? I don’t really recommend this film because you just can’t say that you’ve left the film, feeling that it’s finished. You will simply be confused. Believe me, you will probably thank me if you don’t watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
