I made this film about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my memory as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. This is worse than a home video shot by a high school student. I remember how they recalled the 1970s, and in the frame was a man with a polo shirt, oak sunglasses and a new SUV, like the Toyota Rav-4 or something else (I donâ€™t remember). I do not understand how they could have said it in the 70s. Perhaps he also had a cell phone, I do not remember, it was just awful. I returned it to the video store and asked why they even carry the film, and if I can return the hour of my life. To date, this is the worst film I've ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.
