Becky Harris plays a female shopper whose misfortune is to be in the store at the wrong time, and obviously the ONLY goal to be in this film is to provide a reason for wearing remote controls! I think Miss Harris was over fifty or more when she first appeared on the scene. As soon as the red-haired thug end his, it becomes obvious that this is not the queen of AARP. If this is not one of the best assets ever displayed on celluloid, I want someone to tell me. Absolutely breathtaking, in my opinion, and I literally raped my copy of VHS, capturing its charms. I would like to know if this movie is on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is really not worth mentioning. I was hoping to see something convincing and clever enough, but I was disappointed in both cases. God bless Becky Harris!
