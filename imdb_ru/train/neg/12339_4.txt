There are tolerably funny things in this comedy, surrounded by lots of unfunny things. Almost every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time. And the plot is so untidy that it makes you wonder whether they actually had a ready-made script before they started filming it, or they simply thought it all up and down. (* 1/2)
