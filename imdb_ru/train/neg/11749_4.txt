Phil Alien is one of those bizarre films where humor is based on the weirdness of everything, and not on real features. <br /> <br /> At first it was very strange and quite funny, but as the film developed I didn’t find a joke or weirdness anymore. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget film (this is not a problem in itself), there were quite interesting characters, but in the end I just lost interest. <br /> <br /> I suppose that this film may be liked by the stoner who is currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but better try “Brother from another planet”
