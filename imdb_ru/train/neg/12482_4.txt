The death hunter is directed by John Watson, and he plays the lead role of Rick Hill, who is something of a body builder and is known for this, if I understood correctly? The plot follows how Deathstalker (Hill) is trying to get something from the evil lord, and he must go to the cave of the lord. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien and, of course, Conan the barbarian. This is a breakdown of Conan’s tremendous success, and although it’s a very stupid film, it has a lot of good trash and is recommended for trash fans and patient addicts! <br /> <br /> Not so many cinematic films. Merit in this film. A couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and exciting, but what concentrates on the Deathstalker are these nude women and Hill's huge muscles. Women, as a rule, are helpless victims and are also very stupid, so this is a very manly film, and therefore many feminists might not like it! Scenes of the struggle are not something special and rather boring, and monsters are not something special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateur and poorly made, but what did you expect from such a budget effort? It tries to be as great as Conan, but fails rather badly. As I said, it might please fans of the turkey movie, but no one else. This is categorized, it's so bad, it's great! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as bad as it could be, and like a turkey movie, I appreciate it almost as much as other turkeys, nice ones of course! If bad movies are your cup of tea, try this and have fun, but if you don’t understand "nice bad movies," then stay away. And if someone can not stand a large number of nudity, then stay away. There is more nudity than violence, and thanks to these scenes the film received an “R” rating. Otherwise it might be some safe PG family movie! <br /> <br /> 4/10
