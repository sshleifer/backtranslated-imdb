This film had potential, but what makes it really bad is the role of Lindsay Crows. I have never seen her before in anything else, and maybe there are some Crouse fans who love her in something else, but her role in this film is bad. <br /> <br /> Her delivery is robotic. When she pronounced her lines, it turned out that she tried to make sure that she had the correct lines and just read the list in her head. Thus, her voice has very little inflection. I can’t believe that someone who plays an ill acting role was given a major role in the movie. She should know someone in the business. <br /> <br /> Now I hate to be so bad about her, but the comment must be “so” long, and her presentation is what stands out the most. <br /> However, I liked where the story is going, so I kept watching it. In the first part of the script there is a good movie. But the end also disappointed. Perhaps if her game was better, I would have liked it.
