No, it was not one of the ten worst films of the 1980s, but it definitely goes around the first 100 places somewhere. This film looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years, and then released in 1981. How else would you explain the special effects in front of the “American Werewolf in London”, the disco was still considered cool, and Ronald Reagan was not the 40th President of the United States? While we are at it, let's not lose sight of these 1970s hairstyles in the 1950s and 60s. I saw more of this here than in Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley combined. <br /> <br /> One woman who raised this film to the “so bad, it's good” category was a late Gorgeous Elizabeth Hartman, but barely. Biff plays for Miss Montgomery, a nauseous high school teacher who becomes sex-later, a stereotype that was made to death and is still used in Hollywood today, but even as a hot chick she retains her mouse qualities. Her call for help is proof of this. She also looks much better than Miss Wimp. "Seven bucks in a beauty salon, shot to hell." She was not joking. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that there are no good things elsewhere, there are just a few of them, and I don’t just say this because I like Hartman. By the way, “Teen Wolf” was better than this. Teen Wolf Too was better than this, and it was not so good. <br /> <br />
