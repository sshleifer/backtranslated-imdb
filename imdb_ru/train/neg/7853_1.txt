No conspiracy, crappy game and senseless blood .... <br /> <br /> It must be a horror movie? There is no fear or uncertainty, just a BOOM BANG GORE, then it's done. Some marines are in the desert for some strange, stupid reason, and they are pursued by these mutating beasts from the first film, which was good, and should be left on it. just another reason for money and the use of senseless violence, just like the continuation of "Saw." They know how meaningless the plot is, and the more blood they can add, people will see. I miss good, disturbing horror movies. Go to Hollywood, you can do much better.
