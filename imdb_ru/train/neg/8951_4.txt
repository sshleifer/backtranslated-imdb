I'm a big fan of this book, and Orwell is definitely my favorite writer since I studied Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought a DVD out of pure curiosity, Burton is an actor I highly appreciate, so when I heard him playing the role of O'Brien, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer on the DVD. The first and some fears began to arise, mainly with regard to the frankly awful Themed Song, when I heard eurythmics mechanically shouting “1984!”. Again and again, electronic shock is as bad as it sounds. <br /> <br /> In general, the game is good, Burton and Hurt play their part well, and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth, the end is felt, especially in the heart-rending scene of Room 101. However, this is also where the film is let down. The film spends too much time concentrating on the love between Winston and Julia, which, frankly, is not what Orwell wrote about. He wrote about the heartbreaking future, how Ingsock builds people's beliefs, and then destroys them all in the name of being forced to love Big Brother. The film misses the most important part of the book: Winston reconciles with his position in life and in the world, and also re-educates O'Brien. <br /> <br /> The commentary on IMDb at the moment says that the movie sticks to the book completely wrong. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit themselves to the Goldstein Brotherhood and do not confess to their crimes. There are no obvious references to the original cases where Winston finds an article with the Unpersons, but it is mentioned closer to the end, if you have not read the book, it is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A horrendous script that an excellent acting game cannot save. Michael Radford seems to have completely lost sight of what Orwell was trying to do, and the electronic soundtrack is frankly awful.
