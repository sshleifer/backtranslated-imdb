Honestly, I was disappointed in the “Expiration Date”. Super clever title and interesting premise, but I don't think it delivered. What was it about? The desire of the protagonist to reunite with their native roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome the fear of death. But he was not set up as a man who lived his life in fear - it seems that his life was going well, but with the approach of the end of the world he should start to worry. I have not bought it. Meanwhile, the minor characters in the film did not seem to need a common story. They all just did their job, working in parallel with the main character. In addition, what was considered a “curse” looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? What for? When? Finally, why didn't he just plan to stay in his apartment all day on his birthday? This is my criticism, but I really liked the shots from Seattle, the cinematography was excellent, the acting was good in the times when it was outstanding.
