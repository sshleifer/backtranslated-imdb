Perhaps not my genre, but the plot was terrible, as Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino played. K. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in the role of seduction here (while on marijuana? Why did it have to be turned on? This weakened conspiracy significantly). Also the character Farentino. it would be better if she had more respect for the relationship. Will the movie try to tell? Little.
