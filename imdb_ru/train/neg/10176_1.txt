BASIC LEAGUE: RETURN TO THE MINISTERS (1998) ½ * <br /> <br /> Starring: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Heisbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes PG Score 13 (for language and a bit of violence) <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, but in John Warren’s comedy “BASIC LEAGUE: BACK TO MINOR” there is one funny scene. It consists of a sequence in which an angry coach throws a baseball into the wall behind him only to hit the cement, jump back and hit him in the face. This is not so much, but, with the exception of a few one-liners, this is all that this film has to offer ... enough is said. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally damaged, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and poorly written, but simply bad. Even non-critical viewers will hate this film with all that they have. It's so familiar, just not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times do you need to shoot the same movie about sports? In recent years, we have seen the same material in Air Bud: Golden Receiver, and no matter how bad this film is, it's even worse. At least Air Bad was family oriented. The Major League Returning to Minors is too vulgar for a healthy family to watch together on Sunday afternoon. This is too childish for adults. So who is this movie for? Teenagers? Elderly people? People who are so desperate for entertainment can rent something like this? <br /> <br /> In the film, as in many other similar ones, there is one basic thought: teamwork beats everyone. Yes, it is, and what a great moral to try to prove. It is a pity that we have already seen and excluded him so many times that he has so little talent and intelligence that their fans are men in ballerina costumes. Where stupid broadcasters form their own “comedy buddy routine”, one liner mutters to itself, like “They suck”, “This quick ball for kids is designed with an hourglass”, “This guy dropped out of the ball for a while to find something that he was lost — perhaps it was his mind: ““ Someone needs a dream ”and“ someday see the sunset as beautiful as this game ”. Where the characters are so small for each other that we never know them by name. And where the only emotional scene of lectures on teamwork is so incomprehensible that it is almost funny. <br /> <br /> "Major League Returning to Minors" is so bad; this stops its banal ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence. A good baseball team is back, they are going to win and - the power is gone. I thought for a moment that this piece of garbage came to the conclusion, but in reality its false final scene only exists to add minutes to the duration. The film mainly consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw so many rotten jokes that it is not funny. There is another rather amusing line of dialogue in which the coach and the player talk to each other about why a long-time outfielder is no longer needed in this position. The trainer's answer: "You are too old, too slow and too fat." The player's reaction is to die for. But this scene certainly does not make this film worthy of your time and is definitely not worth a cent of your money. <br /> <br /> So, here’s another terrible entry into this genre of film, another one that is doomed to its own script that wasn’t seen before, and another one that is so familiar that it seems like deja vu. <br /> <br />
