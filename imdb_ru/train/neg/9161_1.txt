... well, put it in the DVD, spend an hour and a half of your life on something that you will never return and find out. <br /> <br /> Act? What is the action? <br /> <br /> Production values? ... production? ... meanings? <br /> <br /> History? Do not start. <br /> <br /> After many years of publishing on IMDb, I never thought that I would see such a bad film that I really wanted to get a lower rating than one. I always found at least one or two reasons to see the merit - if only in the intentions or efforts of the author, director, actors or producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, they are all the same guy (!) who really needs to understand the fact, at least, as demonstrated by this useless waste of videotape, that he does not have talent. I mean, it would be a reasonable excuse if it was a “staging” of some junior high school student for his first cinematic class, but the “artist” behind this game was twenty-six during this miscarriage. <br /> <br /> How did this happen? Who in their right mind wrote a check for this? Moreover, do not let the lid of the box deceive you: there is not even anything that would remotely resemble a good sex scene or any good “exposing” of the piece on this cover. <br /> <br /> Two last points: it was one second when this “film” had an expiatory value: the aforementioned “talent” was sharply knocked out by his beloved. I welcomed! And I learned one thing from this “movie.” There are times when something is so bad that it is really very funny. But not in a comic manner; it's just sad with humor. Very sad with humor.
