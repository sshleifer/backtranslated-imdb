If you have ever watched the dukes of danger, you know that you have never had to worry about drugs, curses, or rude behavior that small children notice. If you have seen the movie, you know that this is no longer the case! This movie was terrible! The main characters who use drugs and think that it is fun and cool, of course, is not what I call entertainment. They took a great show and just turned it into trash. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original show, now looks and behaves as if she was being paid for her services at the corner of the street. I was so excited to see this movie before it came out, 15 minutes after I left the movie, I was ready to leave. I kept thinking that it should get better, but instead it worsened by the minute. I wish I had never seen this movie. It spoiled a good show and left nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, look for something worth your money, because it is not only a waste of money, but also a waste of two hours of your life that you will never return!
