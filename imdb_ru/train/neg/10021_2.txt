The worst movie I have seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. No story, no humor, nothing! The sequence of actions is more like a series of random ads by Akshay Kumar, stitched together. I was strongly influenced by the "Matrix" and "Kung Fu Hustle", but very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I didn’t live up to many expectations, but watching this movie is an incredible experience that makes you wonder: “What did these guys think ?? !! ". <br /> <br /> The only thing you can remember after viewing is anorexia Karina in a bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason I didn’t give a“ 1 'rating because every time when i think i saw the worst, bollywood proves i'm wrong.
