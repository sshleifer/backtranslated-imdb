I did not expect much from this movie - funny little entertainment. Wuthering Heights can be turned into a believable modern story - sweet and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film decided to discard the talents of the people involved in the simplified version, so blurred from the original material, that it is surprising that they had the courage to call it Wuthering Heights. He ignores the fact that this is a story of people who are inherently incredible, mostly not sympathetic and often cruel to each other. This changes the very nature of some of the characters — in Isabel, for example, in the novel there was no insidious bone in her body — they deprived her of blind idealism and turned her into an intriguer. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychologically torments most people on his way, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving his daughter in his care. The dialogue is banal, and one wonders how the actors managed to do something with straight faces. Instead of depth or real emotions, we know that they mean something when they shout it to someone in the face. I read a critique of the early '90s version of “Wuthering Heights” by Emily Bronte, in which Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche participated, saying that she had turned an extremely dark gothic story into a handsome ripper. Slightly correct comments, but the MTV version takes another step, using the basic structure of the story, to bring the scourge of invigorating beaches into really bad music.
