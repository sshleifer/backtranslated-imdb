It was great to see some of my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra, and Audrey Hepburn. They looked pretty wonderful. But it was like that. They were not given any symbols or good lines for work. I did not understand and did not care about what the characters were doing. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were good, Patty Henson and Collin Camp were competent enough and confident in their little supporters. They showed some talent, and it's sad that they did not star in new and better films. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten has a chance to play her only important role in the film. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich, and I liked his latest film “Cat Meow” and all his early films from “Goal” to “Nikleodon”. Therefore, I was very surprised that I could hardly fall asleep while watching this. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this film is about a detective agency, where detectives and clients are romantically associated with each other. Five years later, the ex-girlfriend of Bogdanovich, Sybil Shepard, released a popular television series called Moonlight, stealing a storyline idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a big difference in the fact that the series relied on tons of witty dialogues, while it tries to do with farces and a few crazy lines. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: it's not like that. ”“ Paper moon ”and only a very pale version of“ What happened, Doc. ”
