I thought I saw this movie, actually twice. Then I read all the other reviews, and they do not quite match. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy go to this city to study the alleged snowman's observations. I still feel pretty confident that this is a film that I saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. Therefore, I return my review: if you like the random film “B”, like me, then “Return to Bogey Creek” is the film for you! Be it setting a sleep timer and pecking at your favorite movie bomb, or just chatting with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you have a fun night of improvisation. Be careful! Is the legend true? I think we could just figure it out with a not so stellar cast. Will there be any equipment malfunctions at especially the key moments of the film? Does our blonde, courageous, young hero have hair on his chest? Will the exclusively high-tech Technicolor last the entire film? You will need to look to figure it out for yourself.
