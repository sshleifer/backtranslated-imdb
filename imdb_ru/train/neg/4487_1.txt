A fan of science fiction films, I have known about The Matrix since its release in 1999. Since I let people tell me about it, I have suggested that it is very original and complex. I'm also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland. I could never understand how I missed the Matrix when it was released. With the release of The Matrix Reloaded, it's time to buy a DVD and watch it. <br /> <br /> Disappointment was too great. The premise of the matrix (control as opposed to the film) was smart. The philosophical premise of parallel worlds, alternate realities, is decent. Nevertheless, I could still take part in the film, as in science fiction, if he firmly remained in this genre. Unfortunately, this turned into a standard: “whether they will run away, break through or save those who need to be saved, etc.”. Worse yet, this turned out to be another exercise in the martial arts. The problem is that sci-fi and martial arts films are actually of two different types. For pure devotees of one or the other, mixing the two does not work. It’s like mixing science fiction with romance. You may have one or the other, but not both in the same film, or at least not both to the same extent in the same film. <br /> <br /> If there were such problems with The Matrix, the Matrix Reloaded would really aggravate the problems. At least thirty minutes of the film were either episodes of martial arts, or protracted car chase. (This observation ignores the question made in every professional, negative review of the film: if Neo could do a Superman thing, why fight at all? The answer, of course, is what attracts the young male demographic group to the theater.) Then there is the aspect of “redemption through love". This plot was developed by Richard Wagner more than a hundred years ago. In fact, he did better in Die Gotterdammerung. <br /> <br /> So what remains for those who have seen “The Matrix: Reboot”? Martial arts fans were probably moaning from trite, but mystical science fiction was philosophizing. Fans of science fiction were wondering why they sat at the Kung Fu Festival. Most men in the audience are probably bored with the silly romantic aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Just what should you get for your money when you watch the films The Matrix: science fiction, fighting art or a soap opera? A little of each one does not do for anyone of them, nor for a satisfactory film for everyone’s fans
