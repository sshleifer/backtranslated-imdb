What are people talking about here? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so bored that I left the theater. What happened to this stuff. I only laughed once and not even so much. Whoever is burning this film should be taken outside and beaten. I usually always find what I like in the movies, but this is crazy. “Slackers” makes “Not Another Teen Movie” look like a classic. He is considered one of the worst in all of history with such cracks as "Shots in the body", "Kon-air" and "Conspiracy Theory". AVOID ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would hand out money to people when they leave the theater as a sign of their apologies, but, to my horror, this did not happen. Looks like I'll never see this money again or two hours.
