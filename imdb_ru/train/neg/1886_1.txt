Once I promised never to leave any film (personal politics that made me suffer from various kinds of wood, such as Rambo 3, My Base, Deep blow), but Mr. Zaydl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a really awful experience. Anyone who sees this film will think that the Austrians are a miserable, miserable bunch of mentally retarded people. This shows a world where love and humanity do not exist, a world where people humiliate each other for one reason only â€” to distract from their own miserable existence. Choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (most of them look directly from the imagination of the Austrian shock-animator Dikes), director Zaydl wants to make us believe that this is real life in the Austrian (European? Western?) Suburbs, the Spectator faces the image of sexual orgies, violence against women and the handicapped, madness and humiliation. But this is not social criticism. It is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you get a bad game, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If someone needs such a film to understand that something is wrong in our society, then this person had to go through life with his eyes closed. This is a pseudo-social criticism with a sledgehammer. And people condescendingly look down on them condescendingly. It shows ugly people - this is not the reason why I hate it. But he portrays ordinary people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And that is why this film is really sneaky.
