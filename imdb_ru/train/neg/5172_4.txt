This is the second film I saw on “Horrors” over the past weekend. "Grave workers" - the first. Grave workers were better. Watching this, I can only guess that production should be rather limited. I admit that the story began to be interesting, but in the end it was all over for me. In fact, we were not given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters, which only made each of their erroneous characteristics even more annoying. I have to mention that there was also a bit of a wrong choice with a 12 year old boy acting as a sheriff. The only reason I watched the entire movie was to find out what was the big secret that was not so interesting. A little more history about the family would help, but from the very beginning they didn’t look like a family at all. <br /> <br /> For me, this film is so amateur that I could not even express it. on dvd. Four ratings are intended for the initial potential that history could have. It was one to skip the horror.
