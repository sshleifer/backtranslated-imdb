Ben Stiller does not act so much as reacts. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy that takes place around him. In “Something About Mary,” the hairstyle scene only works because Stiller tries to stay calm. When he runs into two other fiancés of Mary, he is the most awkward guy in the room, but the scene is funny. <br /> <br /> In the film “And here is Polly,” the formula breaks down for reasons that are hard to understand. Stiller is surrounded by many comic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, which are too few. Having said that, Hoffman relies too much on bodily humor - you know, we have problems when they go to fart jokes to laugh. The basketball scene where Hoffman hides this is completely exaggerated (although she throws one predicament in the form of an adversary without a shirt that causes a smile — noticeably due to Stiller's reaction). However, everything seems to act in a bubble, the reaction is very small. The characters Hoffman and Stiller could play along to each other much, much more. Aniston reiterates her role as Rachel, but Stiller is not Ross. This is rather the script "Joey is crazy about Rachel." <br /> <br /> Polly is the number of Roma, and this is his failure - he lacks a heart. You do not root for characters. If there was a little more work, we could have a deeper story, but in the end the failure of the film comes down to poor writing. It is worth seeing if it appears on TV on a slow night, but you will regret spending the money to see it.
