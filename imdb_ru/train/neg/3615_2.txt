Why have I never seen or even heard of this trash film before? It's right in my alley with a bloody teenager, ridiculous plots and the irresistible atmosphere of the 80s cheese hanging around him. For some reason, no one is interested in this, employees and students of an elite Catholic university were killed by an unknown psychopath. A newly recruited teacher, Julie Parker, becomes involved when all the people she communicates with are dead or behaving strangely. This movie is very bad! There is absolutely no logic or sequence, and each character is equally meaningless to others. For example, a girl is killed, and her body is thrown into a container. Then, for no reason, the story suddenly moves forward three weeks ahead, but the dead girl is never mentioned or even missed. Even her boyfriend! Acting is pathetic, and there is not even a nude. Killer disclosure is pretty funny, because the creators really seemed convinced that it was an original twist ... Not so guys! "University of Splashes" - one of the worst horror turkeys.
