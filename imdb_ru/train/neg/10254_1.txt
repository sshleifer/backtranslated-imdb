Spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, THE END OF THE WORLD is an extraordinarily overwhelming cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Here is the full story: the scientist receives messages from space (on Independence Day). The reports say that something like a huge catastrophe should happen, and then the scientist hears on the radio that there was a strong earthquake in China. He begins to think that the messages have something to do with natural disasters around the world, so he is trying to figure out who receives the messages (and who also sends messages to space). He and his wife eventually find out that messages come from the monastery. They attend it. Everything looks normal, including the priest played by the bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is adamant and truly believes that messages come and go to this monastery. Thus, he and his wife secretly return to the monastery, where they are being watched by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns. They are being held against their will, and the alien Lee plays forces the scientist to get what they need so they can return to their planet. As soon as aliens receive a special element, all aliens are sent one by one to their home planet on some kind of adhesive platform for transporters. Lee, the last alien, tells the couple that the land will be destroyed because of some ridiculous alien decision. Lee walks in the transporter and he is gone. The couple, looking at the monitors, which are visible videos of natural disasters occurring around the world, decides to follow the aliens. Since the earth is doomed, the couple sees no reason to stay behind, so they go into the conveyor belt and disappear. The last frame of the film - the explosion of the planet Earth papier-mâché. The end. <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a boring movie in my life. This is the most amazing movie I've ever seen. The scientist and his wife are the two worst heroes or heroes ever to appear on the screen. They don't care about anything. They see earthly cataclysms on monitors and decide "what the hell, who needs the earth anyway?" They do not even try to stop them or do something to improve the situation. Such a story could work if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything, but the actions and atmosphere do not exist. The actors and the people behind this boring film go through their own pace, so much so that you almost feel when they beat their fists on the cards, when they go out and return to work. I didn’t expect much with this film, because it’s the producer of Charles Band, but I didn’t expect it to be so bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was once asked about the worst film he had ever made and mentioned the invasion of stardom. Well, I'm sorry, Chris, but the invasions on STARSHIP were really stupid. Star invasion is terrible, but terribly interesting. THE END OF THE WORLD - VERY, VERY, VERY worst: it's beyond the dreary and inert, NO ANY entertainment value whatsoever.
