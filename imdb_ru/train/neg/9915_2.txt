I have just finished Dark Camera, also known as Under Observation, and I'm stunned. Stunned not by the film, but by some enthusiastic reviews I watched that influenced my viewing. The story was so destroyed by plot holes, and most of the characters were so flat that it seems appropriate to classify it as a comedy. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in disbelief when I experienced this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin leaves the limits of life at home with a pain-addicted mom to live with his father, a policeman, despite his mother's day. Warnings that dad is no good. When a young woman is found murdered, Justin is suspicious of tenants who live in neighboring apartments. With the help of a pair of buddies, he installs hidden cameras to monitor these people. When truth begins to unfold, Justin reveals an unexpected mystery. <br /> <br /> One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would have lavishly struck another one or two stars if she had moved away a little, but no luck. It would be the potential grace of the film's salvation. I thought that Eric Conley very skillfully played Justin, and I would not be surprised to see him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the film, although it suffers from clichés, would probably work if it were not for the ridiculously empty “speeches” of key actors, primarily Alexander Eitel (Kayla) and David H. Rigg (Justin’s father ). Horror! (sorry for the pun). <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low-budget films. In fact, I believe that an independent film is our only hope for a decent film making in the coming days. I will shoot low-budget films when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical scores and overall image quality. Nevertheless, I do not give discounts on the game in the form of figures and a script for lovers of Swiss cheese. There is a huge amount of well-made low-budget films. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can not help but suspect that at least some of the reviewers who praised The Dark Camera are somehow connected with its production.
