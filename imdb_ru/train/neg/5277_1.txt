I caught it tonight on Showtime and was amazed at how a movie with such an interesting premise can turn out to be so incredibly awful. WHO IS YOUR FOLDER? stars Brandon Davis, as adopted by high school student Chris Hughes, the geek who inherits the heir to the porn empire left him his biological parents. Although the premise sounds like the film can be very funny, it is ruined by the inept director of the new director Andy Fickman, a clich√©d and predictable script, and an acting game that is even bad by the standards of live video. Even the usually funny Charlie Talbert turns into an amazingly dark performance like a best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and unfriendly brat. 1/10
