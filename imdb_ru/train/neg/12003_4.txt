Six different pairs. Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Eighty spectators in the cinema. Looking at eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I sit somewhere in the middle between them and look in the center of the screen to find out what is happening in the film. All the stories have no connection with each other, but somewhere below Nikhil Advani is trying to show some connection between them. I tried to find a few lines that I could write as a review, but after 3 hours and 15 minutes did not write anything. The film is a bad copy of Hollywood blockbuster "LOVE". <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch a movie if you really want to watch a good movie.
