Susan Swift is an attractive young man, a child of flowers, transplanted in the 1980s (as young Susan Day), but she lacks vocal range for demanding dramatic leadership, and she tends to whine; nevertheless, she is pretty sweet, she has bright eyes and a beautiful smile. In Advent (as he was called when he was briefly released to the cinema), Swift may be a reincarnation of the Salem witch. The film is very low-budget and borrowed from so many other photos that I refused it 15 minutes before the end. It starts off strong and has some camp appeal. Obviously, there are more serious films that tell about the fate of the Salem witches who deserve to be seen; However, as trash movies go, it's not so scary. Boston locations - a definite plus, and the cast is funny funny. * 1/2 of ****
