This dirty little film, also known in another form as “The House of Exorcism”, takes itself so seriously that it kills any entertainment value <br /> <br />. <br /> European tourist Elke Sommer is taking part in the reserve story, who has a chance to meet Telly Savalas, who looks exactly like the devil she <br /> <br /> saw in a fresco in the square . Somer was taken to a mysterious house <br /> <br /> in a country where Savalas is the butler <br /> <br />. There, she is mistaken for a woman who has died long ago, and theatrical performances of the soap opera <br /> <br /> begin. <br /> <br /> The husband of the blind matriarch in the house had an affair with a dead woman who was the bride of the matriarch's son. The couple that let down the Sommer? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman gives the driver "driving lessons in the back seat <br /> <br />", and the husband knows and does not care, after all, <br /> <br /> is big some of the actors are killed, Sommer is drugged and raped, <br /> <br /> flees, and the viewer culminates on board the empty <br /> Aircraft ... which must have looked like empty theaters in which this the play <br /> <br /> played. <br /> <br /> In the alternative version of the “House of Exorcism” there are scenes <Added br / <br /> with the participation of a priest. <br /> <br /> The VHS copy of this edition from Elite Entertainment is crystal clear and has a <br /> <br /> mailbox. There are "additional" after the end of the loan; remote sex <br /> <br /> and bloody scenes. <br /> <br /> Mario Bava’s direction is quick and violent, but his script is <br /> <br /> terrible. There are half-entangled ideas, abandoned storylines and terrific amenities that no more than advance this thing in some direction. You have life, like dummies for the funeral practice <br /> <br />, a blind matriarch does not behave so blindly, <br /> <br /> and Savalas give the same lollipops as in Kodjak (who <br /> <br /> haunts you, baby?). <br /> <br /> It looks like the project had two named stars, and then quickly wrote the script <br /> <br /> what happens in Hollywood on a daily basis <br /> <br />. Sawalas looks completely bewildered, intermittently pronouncing his own <br /> <br /> lines and wishing his character not to die in the Dirty Dozen. Sommer runs, screams and gasps a lot, but her character is empty <br /> <br />, I freely use the term “character”. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really weird movie, and your reaction to it may depend on <br /> <br /> how strongly you are in Eurohorror and Kojak. For example, I cannot <br /> <br /> recommend "Lisa and the Devil." <br /> <br /> This is a no-stars, including all additions at the end of the VHS <br /> <br /> copy, contains strong physical abuse, sexual abuse, strong blood, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content and situations for adults <br /> <br />
