Slow, tedious and one-dimensional film! A good cast with a clichéd dialogue, a boring storyline and the heartless guidance of Mr. Marshal! The traditional and predictable history of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent lacks heart, new ideas and depth. The main character looks out of place because of her tiny physical form and sticky contact lenses. The vocabulary used by geishas sounds forced and too sophisticated for their limited disclosure in training methods. The story continues and continues for several hours, trying to convince you that this small, boring Asian with flat breasts is a real geisha, they actually speak in the film “She is destined to become a legend,” I say that this is a difficult thing! The film is just boring, it looks beautiful on it, there are very few interesting moments in it, as much as you can find when you go out on cigarettes. In fact, if you do not believe the messenger, you will not believe the message, and this girl did not fill the shoes! Borin, boring, miss it!
