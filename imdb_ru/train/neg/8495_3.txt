I am one of those people who went to the local library and read books on the Babbage differential machine, while my classmates played soccer, etc. So, if there is such a thing as a target audience for this film, then I think that I may I would get involved in this. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just need to watch it again. The previous reviewer mentioned that he was not watching this film, being tired. Perhaps it was my mistake. <br /> <br /> I tried my best to enjoy this film, and there are some aspects that I like, but overall I found it amateur and rather tedious. <br /> <br /> Being a kind of selfless computer nerd, I just can’t help but remember the exact timeframe when the film was actually shot and how the graphics used reflected that time (that is, 1997). Played in the games of the era s.f. "Mind Grind", to give one example, this film cannot avoid that low-resolution 16-bit color multimedia explosion of that time. Fortunately, in recent years this has diminished somewhat in the game world, at least in favor of real gameplay. <br /> <br /> I had to resort to watching this movie through the German satellite channel FTA (since I don’t I don’t think it was ever broadcast on the British FTA TV, well, just recently, I was slightly surprised to see the end credits, noting that Gottdog (God dog) had 4 people working on its design. Maybe it is mean to me that I am surprised by this, considering that ten years have passed since the film was created, however, the final result makes the graphics of the films of the eighties quite good for comparison. <br /> <br /> But as for the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada deserves a film without a science fiction approach, and perhaps a simpler biographical approach is better suited to cover the life story of this wonderful lady. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this film. First of all, the basic idea that somehow lost information from the past can be accurately recovered through some extrapolation using software intelligent agents seems a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In addition, the theme that runs through the film that a computing device can really predict the mechanics of all things over time (for example, the wind) is now, as we know, not true. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the Victorians may have taken this view. But the work of Gödel’s 20th century, proving that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's work on computation limits, not to mention chaos theory. and quantum mechanics, completely undermined these ideas, which seem central to how modern day researchers software should work. <br /> <br /> Finally, as mentioned earlier, a mouse click in the air, meaning “programming,” is also simply wrong. <br /> <br /> might be fine, but at least some technical advice would give the film much needed credibility in the credibility assessments. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the film, although, like Pi, it is clearly unique, but there are too many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy it, 3/10 from me.
