What a shame that Alan Clark is associated with this prank. This does not exclude, however; Gather a group of guys and a few Stell together and spend time running around it again and again and rolling on the floor in tears of laughter. Great nightly stuff. Al Hunter talks about the widely publicized topic of the late 80s - that hooligans were well organized and not really interested in football itself - often with a respectable job (real estate agent ???). But how can Clark convince us that any of the two-bit actors who deviate from other low-quality television productions (Grange Hill) or soon go to the poor quality drama (Eastenders) can make us believe in one nanosecond that they are strong football goons ridiculous. Do we really believe that the ICF (on which, of course, the drama is based) will ever go to another city to fight only six guys? <br /> <br /> ICF will oust metro stations and the like from HUNDREDS. Andy Nicoll's “scally” should be read before even thinking about a story of this kind. Acting is terrible and delivers the most laughter - Oldman is so campy that it’s unbelievable. Most of them look like they should be in Mr. Mate's bath. True inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can take a picture.
