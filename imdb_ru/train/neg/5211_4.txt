Ha. no doubt Tommy is angry here. I don't know why, but for some reason, small children in horror films tend to look like small butts. and since they are children, they will not die. because they annoy ... well ... except asylum from terror. but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the movies. Can't find this movie on DVD? what you can! All you need to do is buy a DVD package Chilling classics! You not only get the metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but also get 49 OTHER FILMS! what a deal! pff OK. I made an advertisement for these cheese films. let's say, this movie in itself is not worth 15 bucks. <br /> <br /> So, we have a chemist. Yeah. because all the chemical scientists look as beautiful as this guy who plays Peter. He is trying to come up with a serum to stop the destruction of the body. The college where he works wants to turn off his project, so he tries it himself. but since it is a horror film, he comes to terms with it and launches an incredibly long sequence of transformations, which takes almost 3/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> In order to sketch a film, he enters into a relationship with some woman who has a son and she has never been married! scandalous! But, of course, Tommy is one of the most annoying characters .... no. I take it back. HE IS the most annoying character. Much worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take on Peter's work and gloat over him while he is in the hospital. this is true, even being an old cripple, you can still be a villain. <br /> <br /> So, we see Peter start randomly killing some people in his visions, until he realizes that he does this, and simply decides to kill everyone in his path in order to return to normal life. However, in the end it turns into a lizard. Yes, I know, do not ask. The ending really doesn't make any sense. And if you are hoping for some really good returns, you will not get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a HORRIBLE movie ... it just upsets because of the lack of a good pay. If you already have a package of 50 films, and it is next on your list, you won’t expect a sleeping movie, but you also don’t want a good movie. Just sit, relax and eat lots of snacks. Because this film will not make you jump out of your skin anytime soon. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads out of 10.
