With this lineup and budget, you will expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack shot several films that border on the strange, but still work. Neither he, nor his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this parody of the banally poorly written garbage. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing but a series of jokes and the poor. The plot does not go away, the inscriptions are contrived, meaningless, and the characters are paper thin. If you think of the film as a three-dimensional film in which the story and the characters bring depth to the image, this bastard looks as flat as Mickey and the steamer. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Dan Aroyd in this memory of another truly awful 1991 film “Nothing but trouble.” Frankly, this film is a type of project that kills a career and dismisses agents.
