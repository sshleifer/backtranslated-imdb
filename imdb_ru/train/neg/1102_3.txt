First of all, I have to admit that I saw both films that I saw by this director without names, and therefore, I may have missed points. My Czech language is not bad, but seeing two of his films, I would not even try to learn. Samotari is too cool. Too cool. These are about ten different plot lines that are intertwined together. This is not so unusual in a city the size of Prague (albeit a tiny one). The main characters - from 20 to 30 years. They have a job and only one training. The best character is a young Balkan girl. Her feelings are repeated here by immigrants every damn day. That's all. The only great character. All the rest make their lives hell completely independently. How can I empathize with such obvious incompetence? Perhaps there are interesting moments with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype in the film? If you like normal music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at someone else's stupidity, watch this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, take a look at the original Jarmusch, not an imitation. And under no circumstances, do not watch Ondricek's “Septey” (in a whisper). Unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes.
