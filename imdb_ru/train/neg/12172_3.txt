After the defeat of the first Camp Sleepaway, who thought that a franchise could be born. SC II is superior in appearance. More inspired kills and just more fun. Although it may not say much (compared to the first film), Sleepaway Camp II is worth renting. <br /> <br /> Pros: Entertaining, do not take yourself too seriously, as SC I. Inspired Killings. Cons: cheesy behavior and a large number of mullets. <br /> <br /> Total: 5/10 <br /> <br />
