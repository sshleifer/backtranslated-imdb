Someone must have seriously joked when filming this movie. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it’s absolutely impossible that this film was shot in 1993. Fashion and music dictate that this is seriously the 80s. I guess he lay on the shelf for a long time before some crazy distributor picked him up and released him into an incredulous world. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. View. A strange loner meets a random man with a beard, who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favorite song, he will be able to turn into the one he chooses. At this moment I feel obliged to point out that the favorite song of a loner is “London Bridge is falling”. Why is this his favorite song? Because he is an idiot. We are only for a minute in the film, and the film has already reached a monumental level of stupidity. It gets even dumber. <br /> <br /> A singleton is a nostril. I can only assume this, because in the film there are two scenes where he notices picking his nose. This clarifies the name. He decides to turn into a girl so that he can get close to other girls. And kill them. It is more or less. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible. Every performance in this film sucks. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the play of actors is a standard of a pornographic film. It really is so terrible. The nostril collector appears to the audience as a nostril collector. The characters in the film see him as a girl, whom he became thanks to singing “The London Bridge Falls”. Dude, I feel like an idiot, even typing this. In any case, it is strange to see a middle-aged crank hanging out with schoolgirls. And not in a good way. There is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril at school goes with the girls and the song plays from above. This is probably the worst song ever recorded. I'm not even going to describe it. You will know it when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are scenes of violence. And there is the Benny Hill style harassment sequence involving the transsexual. There is even an immortal dialogue, which may have been taken or not taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, when the collector tells the nostril to the prostitute: "I have money if you have a wound." Fine, I'm sure you will agree. <br /> <br /> Perfect rubbish.
