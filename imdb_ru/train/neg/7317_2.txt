After reading the other comments on this film, I would like to share my own opinion that this is one complex film, unless you are a bruxophile. I am not. <br /> <br /> If you look at a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative, giving us more unclaimed neuroses than can be absorbed in one sitting. It is quite difficult to watch. The character Brooks (Robert Cole) is so unpleasant and unpleasant that it is difficult to communicate with him - not to mention rooting for him when he stumbles from one unfavorable, self-absorbed situation to another. And he should NEVER star in a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man can have such unprotected foliage and should have had a child like Catherine Harrold - unless, of course, he is not Albert Brooks in a play controlled by Albert Brooks. <br /> <br /> “Modern Romance” has its funny moments -----, but they are fragmentary and infrequent. More often than not, it seemed to me that I was on a limited journey with a completely hostile person, and I wish it was over. This confirms the problems that can arise when too much control over the film is imposed on only one person - a person who lacks self-discipline to be able to backtrack from him and see what is clearly happening. <br /> As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is actually what he portrayed. Six years later, he played Albert Brooks in the very successful News Broadcast. James showed us how Albert can form a credible and interesting comic play. Albert let us see how James (usually not the cast) makes a rare comic move in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will now move on to the next eulogistic comment about this. I tell you that there is enough pain in the world if it is not found in a film intended for entertainment.
