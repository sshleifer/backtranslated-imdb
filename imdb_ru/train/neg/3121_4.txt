This film is miserable. It has a terrible taste, it is pedestrian and inconclusive according to the scenario, although, presumably, it is based on real events - which adds nothing, but makes it rather a disappointment. The direction is not very well done, since the scenes and the dialogue are inappropriate. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. To begin with, Williams is not convincing in the breakup of relationships, and the relationships themselves are not interesting. Worse, his character is caused by an ugly story about pedophiles, which is basic and does not take place as a plot device. You have an older Rory Culkin, tastelessly belching "d_ck_smker" - in good fun - which is annoying enough, and then laughs at Williams' character. Finally, you have Sandra O as an adviser to guardian angel Williams and thrown into the explanation of the whole fiasco at the end. The character of Tony Collet is simply annoying and rethinking her performance in the 6th sense with the worst direction. Really miss you
