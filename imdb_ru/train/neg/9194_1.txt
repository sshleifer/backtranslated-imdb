Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I loved all the movies of Romero and completely enjoyed the reworking of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard every critic about this film, I was still an optimist. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and although this movie might not be very good, I liked it if it weren't for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shooter with a pretty decent plot. This, however, is pure nonsense. Horrible dialogue, unfinished plot and video game scenes inserted in the film. Who in their right mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing I liked about this film (I use the term “fluently”) is Jürgen Prochnov as Captain Kirk (fie). While his name throws originality out of the window, you can see in his performance that he knows that he is in a terrible film, and he might as well benefit from it. Everyone else behaves as if they were doing Shakespeare. And very bad, I might add. In fact, the only reason everyone should see this monster is if you are a.) A huge zombie lover and see every zombie click made or b.) Love playing MST3K, a home game. Watch this with friends and get ready for a lot of unintended laughter. <br /> <br />
