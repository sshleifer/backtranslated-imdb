Plain (and surprisingly tamed) Fulci giallo, which means that it is still pretty bad by ordinary standards, but bought out by its solid growth and some nice touches, such as a neat turn of time in matters of vision and clairvoyance. /> Known weaknesses of the genre are in full swing: a banal dialogue, a wooden game, illogical plot points. And the finale goes on too long, while the outcome is rather unconvincing, or, let's say, sluggish love. <br /> <br /> Fulci's ironic treatment of giallo norms, however, is amusing. Yellow hints wherever you look. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 lame assassins
