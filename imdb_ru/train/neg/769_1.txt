The main mistake in this film is that it is impossible to believe that any of these people will ever be played in the professional production of “Macbeth”. Hearing the quiet voice of David Lansbury, who painstakingly struggled with the famous speech “Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow,” it was impossible to believe that someone would ever consider him as a role. So I continued to believe that he did not get the role because he was a lousy actor; not because a larger name was available. When we see parts of the play in rehearsal, it’s hard to believe that the director doesn’t parody things with a hopelessly erroneous, wrongly directed parody of actors who cannot formulate or even understand the verse and the directors who see the play through their own interpretation interpretation. Sometimes directors are so eager to make their films (and the writers think that they have the opportunity to manage their work), that they agree to less. It looks like an example.
