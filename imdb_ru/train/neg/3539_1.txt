The first two films of Richie were bright, stylish entertainment. Here he raids the last two classics ?? "Ordinary suspects" and "Fight Club" ?? and still comes out empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he posed himself as a riddle (with a fake "Ordinary suspects", "the greatest fraudster whom he ever tried to convince that he was you" or whatever that may be. ..) and trying to portray "Fight Club" about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film fights for maintaining interest in the second half. By the last third you know that you are being led to a dead end, and this is tiresomely slow. <br /> <br /> Cons, chess and game theory are excellent subjects, but Richie understands them too superficially and too many times to use a lot of material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes the film (almost) watchable is Richie’s courageous act with a scene and a dynamic Maurice-Jones camera. If Richie stuck to a more satisfactory plot and succumbed to a tougher editing, then there is no reason why he couldn’t make another nice gang caper. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehensibility does not mean depth. If you want to see a great movie that doesn’t have a logical sense, but makes it worthy (and, by the way, which also includes an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement), see “Lost Highway”.
