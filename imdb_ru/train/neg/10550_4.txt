Being a big fan of the ten minute television episodes of Stella Street, I was waiting for this film with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately, I remained very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was alarmed by the fact that almost all the jokes and one liner were directly removed from the TV episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic time, as if the actors said them once, and could not bother to say them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt deceived because I broke up with my hard-earned money to watch the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The plot of the film begins on Stella Street (a typical English street in Surrey), gradually inhabited by "some of the most famous people from the stage and screen of the last forty years," including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the street were ultimately deceived by the local fraudsman from all his destiny and forced to live like tramps and ordinary people from the working class. There are a few pleasant moments, but on the whole, the screenwriters manage to take an interesting idea and make it rather boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In the T.V episodes, all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but in the movie Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. Her imitations were not funny, and it seemed that her characters were included in the story just to give her a lesson. <br /> <br /> If you havenâ€™t been a fan of Stella Street episodes, you can find this movie entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you can leave feeling a little deceived. 4/10
