Wow, I just saw it on TV as one of the “scary” movies that they show on Halloween. Was it a G rating? In fact, there was nothing that could make this movie scary or worthy of viewing. In addition, other people say it is a hoax, but I don’t think so. For a parody, you need something called "humor." This low-budget shitty holiday did not have the slightest humor, and this also did not make much sense. In fact, you have a stupid monster (a man in a rubber suit) coming out of the closets and killing people, I suppose, because you have never seen a monster use violence against anyone or any bloody consequences. The revolving newspaper informs you that the monster killed people, so I think this is good enough. <br /> <br /> The military are trying to weakly kill a monster that is not much more than a man. They have a very bad target. Then the military flys! Wow, because of this movie, the US military looks pathetic or what? The monster, which is difficult to kill, does little, except for fussing and roaring. Oh, and sometimes the second head jumps out of his mouth and squeals. It was a bit interesting, but at the same time a complete alien. <br /> <br /> What was the agreement with the xylophone scientist to attract the monster? It was difficult to understand much of the dialogue due to poor sound quality. Also, why did the monster wear the main weak guy for so long? Why didn't the monster go to the closet when he had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to figure out the meaningless?
