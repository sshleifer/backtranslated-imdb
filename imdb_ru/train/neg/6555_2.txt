So last night I decided to watch “Fairy Tales from the Hollywood Hills”: Natik Jackson. Or Strength, Passion, Murder, as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer starred in it, and I thought that this should say something about quality. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the film is really confusing. During the movie at the same time are two storylines. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the film, I waited for the moment when these two plot lines come together to make the plot clear to me. But this is still not the case. <br /> <br /> 2) The name of the film says that the film will be about Natik Jackson. Well, it is, sometimes. As said, the film covers two different stories, and the part about Natik Jackson is the shortest. Therefore, another title for this movie would not be the wrong choice. <br /> <br /> In conclusion of my story, I strongly recommend leaving this film where it is on a shelf in a store in a place that no one can see. By doing this, you will not spend 90 minutes of your life like me.
