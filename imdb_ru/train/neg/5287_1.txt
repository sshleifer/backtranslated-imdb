I have no idea why they made this version of Persuasion when they already had this wonderful mini-series with Amanda Ruth and Ciaran Hinds. I guess they wanted to make a fully functional version, but, of course, a lot had to be removed; Alas, what ended up on the floor of the cutting room was all the wonderful wit and humor, leaving the film, which was just a melodrama, and not a funny exposition of English country manners and morals. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were small and uninteresting. They had poor Ann chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth, like a stupid modern teenager (and if you were a stupid modern teenager reading this, let me tell you: running after a man like a woman in the heat is NOT cool) This is something that a educated woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this balanced heroine. <br /> <br /> Some have said that they find this laugh ridiculous; my reaction was not laughter, but outrage. The very idea of ​​such a corruption of Austin’s work is below contempt. <br /> <br /> It was awful.
