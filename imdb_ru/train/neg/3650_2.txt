Not laughing at all. Yes, I watched this whole train wreck, but only in order not to wonder if Cleese came to his senses in the last part. (No, he didn’t.) <br /> <br /> It may be historically interesting for you, the youth, to see that British “humor” included black “jokes” like these thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What surprises me even more is to read the comments of other reviewers who admit that this is not very good, and then turn around and give him high votes. If the overwhelming majority of the comedies that you saw are even much worse than this, then I certainly feel sorry for your tormenting existence. <br /> <br /> The level of humor in this show is aimed at young children, but the subject is not. So who is it for? People who like repeated and lengthy doubles, quests, jokes with drugs (only interesting as a short journey back to '77) and other "weak" feelings of humor. The Three Puppets are still funny, and for me they were still a child. THEY made some effort to make the jokes work. It is however suspended from Schlock. I am afraid that this is the end of civilization if this material is truly considered worthwhile. Then you will tell me that tabloid television is popular. :(
