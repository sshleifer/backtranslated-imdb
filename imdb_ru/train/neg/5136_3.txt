It falls into the category of films “It’s too ridiculous in the departments of dialogue and performance to be taken seriously”. Whereas Scream, if you know what I did last Friday, Thirteenth or the back of my boyfriend knows that they are bad, the Scarecrow does not. Evil Dead set such a high standard for comedy horror in the genre of the budget that the Scarecrow is simply inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Suspicions of inexperience are immediately apparent, since there are no hints of noise or vibration in the body and cabin of the aircraft. A repeated image of three men just screams about the storyline, but nothing happens. Although the men are clearly frightened, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this film is too serious for his sake, you could smile. I do not remember when Joe Bob Briggs had ever looked through Scarecrows, but I believe that he would not have gone down so low. However, with an IMDb rating of more than 6, there are many people who disagree.
