The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was his nomination for the original design of the song and costume for Oscar. I must admit that this film did not impress me. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (by the way, Glen Close is doing an excellent job with this role) leaves the hospital because of her good behavior. She likes all kinds of animals, and she locks all her fur. From this moment we are just waiting for her to start crises. Pretty soon she does and tries to make the best fur coat in the fashion world, of course, for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Besides Glenn Close, I found all the actors rather stupid, but from a child's point of view, funny. This is true because I assume that its target market is children under 12 years old. Pretty good fun for children and families, but did little for me. * outside *****
