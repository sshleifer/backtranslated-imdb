How can anyone say that this film is a comedy? If I had not gone with this, I would have fallen asleep and asked to return my money. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it looks like she was on the wrong set. I like most chicks, but I hated this one. This is the only time I have seen so much splitting and was not included. These outfits were too exaggerated. No one else says so, and I don't think they even said that. The dance part was terrible. My ex told me later ... "Did you not like this part? Didnâ€™t you think it was sensual?" I said yes only to spare her feelings. Now I know why we were never married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
