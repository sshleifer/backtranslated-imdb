BRIEF ENCOUNTER - a horrible and meaningless remake of the classic David Lin 1945, based on the Noel Kauard's still life. The doctor removes a piece of sand from the eyes of a woman at the train station, he has a terrible relationship, she is a happy married social worker of Italian descent. They meet by chance at another time, form an instant attraction and arrange meetings with each other every Wednesday. The couple falls in love, but after spending a few days together, they realize that they have no real chance of happiness, and agree to part. Trudy's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two superstars and veterans of the "Hollywood epics", do not imagine "ordinary people." Lauren, in particular, is mistaken - Sophia Loren is in full form, looking like a million dollars, working as a voluntary social worker who works part-time at the Citizens Advice Bureau, just does not sound believable. Burton, looking haggard, with dyed hair, too much makeup and platform shoes, doesn't look like an ordinary general practitioner. However, you cannot blame them for romance after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends the evening writing poisonous reviews, and treats her husband with complete contempt. Lauren's husband, Jack Hadley, hangs around the house all day and is incredibly boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is almost a novel 6 years ago. Their final scene together will cause nausea (“You were very, very far,” and so on.). This great British actor Jobe Lemezuerier acts in a three-minute cameo, like a friend of Burton, and looks slightly drunk, uttering his lines in a barely audible voice. This is a sad and memorable presentation in a gloomy, horrible paraphrasing of classic movies. Avoid at all costs.
