Ba Another tedious, disgusting rework of copyrighted work that was never intended for shooting. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Tony Collett, as always, is gorgeous (as you see, the actress), and there are some beautifully processed transitions between scenes. There are even some really funny lines, and working with movies, musical score and editing is literate, with the exception of the strange transition to voice acting and talking to the camera for a conclusion. <br /> <br /> But, oh, but. Most of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and almost all of them are very obviously too old (and in one case too young) for their stated ages. Worse, they all speak “Australian,” this kind of falsetto self-satisfied foamy song that cannot be different from what people actually said during Austin's time (think Sam Yosemite, I'm not joking). This is especially sad, considering that we, it seems, are finally witnessing the demise of an equally extraordinary "fake" that Olivier and his henchmen loved to howl at the top of their lungs. <br /> <br /> And the worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She only ever played one character in her films, and she stays true to her form, running her entire range (grinning to sulk) for the first ten minutes, and then just repeats herself for the rest of the long movie. There is absolutely no chemistry between her and one of her fans, and there is no obvious reason why they will be interested in her separately. <br /> <br /> In short, Emma has little reason to watch. This is a kind enough adaptation, but if you are going to pack a film full of anacronism (that is, terribly thin lead that cannot shoot from a bow or handle an accent), then you can do it correctly, as with a significantly superior "ignorant"
