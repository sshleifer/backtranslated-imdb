This film was promising, and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, the director, and the editors seriously disappointed this film. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the writers, it could be good. The game is wooden, very few characters are believable. <br /> <br /> Who ever edited it, he simply learned new editing methods and wanted to splash them out on the whole film. In almost all scenes there are a lot of quick “catchy” edits that should obviously be symbolic, but ultimately annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted this film to be liked, and I expected a worthy resolution. before the imbalance, but, alas, no, I had a feeling that I wasted my time, and the filmmakers were wasting their money.
