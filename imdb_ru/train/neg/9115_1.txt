If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G., she is a real, mean, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams, she is just a little fool hanging around. She is nothing! People don't adore her! Secondly, Sebastian was cute and hot in the first film, now he is a “baby face”. The story is not so good, and I do not understand. Why they did not do it first, this is the beginning. Free actors, nothing with a story. This is not cruel, this is a game. First, the best actors, the best story and its meaning. I think that music is better in cruel intentions 1, and music is better in cruel intentions 3. This is not the worst film I have seen, but compared to the first one it is one big, big, big nothing.
