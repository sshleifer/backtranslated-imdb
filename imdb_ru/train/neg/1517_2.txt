In the title, I write that the story is funny. Below I will clarify and explain why this, in my humble opinion, destroys this film. <br /> <br /> Gere and Danes are doing their job, and although it’s not the best job, everything is fine. The rest of the cast, however, does a really bad job. Keep in mind, this is not really the fault of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones who have characters who have even the smallest room in the film to really give any depth. All other characters have too little space in the film to create some kind of depth, or the character is so cliche that it doesn't matter how hard the actors try. <br /> <br /> The director has a bit of a complex set, but looking only at the direction, I think he does his job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is the scenario that is bad in two ways. First of all, this is a bad movie script. The characters are small (with the exception of the characters of Gear and Dane), the villains are clichés, and the actions of the characters are absolutely incredible. In addition, the authors should have an agenda in which they want to return our views and ethics for a hundred years. This is a film that says that some criminals are still criminals, despite the fact that they paid the price society gave them. It is also a film that states, though only between the lines, that any form of sexual deviation should be punished without trial, trial or jury. And, of course, according to the film, anything that is not sex in the missionary position of a married couple is a sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So, if you are going to film school and you need an example of a bad script, or if you are writing scripts yourself and want to increase your ego. See it. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
