Stanley Kramer directs the thriller and leaves two key things: action and thrill. IN DOMINO'S PRINCIPLE Jean Hackman is depicted as a prisoner who has been released from prison to perform some mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his operatives - they are supposedly working for the government, but this, like most of the film’s plot lines, was never clear. Hackman asks a lot of questions to which they NEVER get an answer, so the film does not go away. While he seeks to be like NIGHT MOVEMENTS and VIEW ON PARALLAX, DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is very well photographed, but even this does not help. Cramer's direction is devoid of any style. This is a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> With Hackman, everything is in order, proving that he is not capable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are respectively nasty, and Albert plays well the role of Widmark, the cruel footman. Even the usually disgusting Mickey Rooney is quite good as Hackman's assistant. One oddity, however, is the role of Candace Bergen in the role of Hackman's wife. We were told that she spent time in prison, and she seems to be trying to put on some kind of southern melody. Cramer’s idea to make her look like trash garbage is to make her wear an ugly brown wig. This role is better suited to people like Valerie Perrin or Susan Tyrell.
