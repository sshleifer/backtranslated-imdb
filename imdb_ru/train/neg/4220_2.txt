A brief overview, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, a thorough expenditure of 90 minutes. At the end of the film, I did not know what really happened. He is full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), girls from “Philadelphia”) and some vaguely recognizable people, but it simply does not make any sense. Is the story really lost in the editorial office, I don’t know, but, god ... <br /> <br /> Instead, put the DVD or go to bed and rest !!! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for cameos and chasing the car of Morris Small) <br /> <br />
