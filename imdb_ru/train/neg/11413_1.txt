Seriously - avoid this movie at all costs. I just saw it in my first “preview,” and although I paid money for it that was not refundable, I left the cinema after 15 minutes. Which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends, leave or not. For the first time ever I came out of the movie. And I survived some pretty bad ones. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that is dubbed (and very bad), even if it is shown in the original language. He relies on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. About the military (“What are we going to do when we get to the war zone?” - “You get out of the car and die”; in fact, it's much more fun to read here, as was shown in the film) about drugs (the guy eats what “cosmic cookies” behaves very stupidly and misses its wedding or is forced to survive it while at a high level - everything is poorly written and valid) about women in the army (“Why do we get only pipes? We were promised a weapon!” - "So it is, so it will remain") ... Ahhh. Well, you may actually find these really funny, but in this case you seriously scare me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have seen better, acting in the form of soft porn movies you get on European late night TV. So these were stupid jokes (delivered poorly), outside of the average level of the game, lacked pace, poorly duplicated and edited ?? It just did not work. At least not at any level used as a measure for films. <br /> <br /> I would even be so brave as to say that this click proves that there are people who can be much less funny Germans. And it says something, if you like stereotypes. (But I don’t play, but it’s nice to play with them. Just in case someone thinks I don’t have enough PCs.) <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, do something useful . Try to teach shrimp to crochet, paint your nails in the foot with really annoying color, disassemble a bicycle, change light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, switch to another religion and back - in fact, go and listen to "Last Christmas" Wham! on endless repetition. Anything but watch this horrible movie.
