Bad actors, poor filming, intermittent dialogue, small characters, but again, this was a bad premise. Basically, an 11-year-old criminal is being bullied because he has very little money. Of course, an 11-year-old boy has enough technology and intelligence to buy a house, cash a check for $ 1,000,000, and even prevent three clumsy idiots resembling three puppets. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an annoying, unpleasant boy who decides that when he writes a check from a stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best he can. In other words, he enters the bank, <br /> <br /> pulls the cashier the check he makes in his printer, and miraculously goes with a million dollars in cash. Preston, apparently, is also able to reach incredible speeds on his bike due to the fact that the man running the Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed, could not catch him, even when Preston jumped on a number of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, every hockey adventure film should have a hot heroine. In this case, our hot heroine is an FBI agent who sticks to a child who meets with eleven Preston and promises another date when he will be 17 years old. <br /> <br /> However, the worst aspect of this film was not his casting. Neither his casual dialogue, such as "The only other way I could think about skinning a cat was to put a hose in her ass and then take the fur." ​​Most likely, it was the fact that nobody in the whole movie did not seem to realize that the FBI does not care about random people. What I couldn’t explain was that Preston uses the “Macintosh” pseudonym to impersonate a kind of entrepreneur. Of course, the FBI finds it intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year-old wit to scream first when lobsters fall on his face, and then treats her with hamburgers, ending in a ridiculous noisy game in a cemented area where the jet water from the earth. Our heroine cannot understand during this whole adventure that the criminal being chased by the FBI slides and slides right behind them as they head for Preston’s limousine, complete with a one-dimensional driver who never stops giving cheap, the 3rd course laughs that the whole family can choke. <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this movie. I do not see how he has only 4.4 / 10.
