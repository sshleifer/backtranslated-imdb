Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me, why people like it. I think this is one of the worst sitcoms. <br /> <br /> Since it is so popular, I tried to watch it more than once and cannot complete the whole episode. <br /> <br /> First, the acting skills are terrible. All replay to such an extent that they are tired of looking. They speak in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones and have unnatural body language. I saw how best to play in a school play in kindergarten. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is NOT FUNNY. The plots are boring. They are not creative, clever or funny. Shouldn't comedy be funny ?? Why am I not laughing? <br /> <br /> Finally, what are these seventies? This is about as authentic for the seventies as “Happy Days” for the fifties. <br /> <br /> Oh, what happened to Ashton Kutcher? Who threw this inept dweb? And now he makes films ?? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think that this is high-quality television, it bothers me.
