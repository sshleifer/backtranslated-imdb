It was a stupid movie with a predictable storyline and terrible game !! Willy Nelson was as tough as his braids. The film seemed like a very long advertisement for the bright red lipstick worn by Jessica Simpson, especially since there were so many close-ups on her face. The package was not fun and, as I said, oooooooooo predictable. All the money spent on making this film was a shameful waste. Any hints of other old Marilyn Monroe films did not improve the viewing of the Blonde Ambition. It was so incredible - Jessica Simpson was able to assume the position of executive secretary without delay - it was funny !!!
