Decent enough with some stylish looks, however, a tiny budget gets in the way of things. <br /> <br /> I also get the impression that they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic perverted material on the website. <br /> <br /> If you like anime, in particular things like cyber-city and AD police, then this can lift your street. <br /> <br /> but basically this is a budgetary budget with a low budget, although not completely devoid of its own style. <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack from unheard of grunge / punk / post grunge bands. It is worth checking out if only for the soundtrack.
