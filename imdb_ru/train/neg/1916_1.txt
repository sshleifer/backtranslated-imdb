This movie is completely bullshit. Some stupid intellectual consoles himself, doing his best to claim the superiority of the aristocrat over the working class. Nothing but a piece of catharsis of complacency. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If such a film is installed in the United States, it will surely become a big joke. And just because it comes from the “other side”, it turns into a masterpiece, a wonderful entertainment for some westerns washed and / or brainwashed (some George V. may be :). Typical consequences of the Cold War, in any case, some kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I would say that if this - as expressed in this film - is what Soviet intellectuals have been thinking about all these years, then maybe they deserve all the suffering they claim to be survived. BUT NO! because, like many others, I read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding Soviet intellectuals. For example, something relevant with a dog, “White bim, black ear” - and the book of Gabriel Troepolsky, and the film by Stanislav Rostotsky - a real masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, real sadness, real pride and dignity, one of the best of the best Soviet times.
