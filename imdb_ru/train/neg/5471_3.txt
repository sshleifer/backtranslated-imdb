This typical movie “Troma-thrash”, this dirty 80s film, is considered one of the “highlights” of the infamous production studio Lloyd Kaufman, along with Toxic Avenger, released a year earlier. The “venomous avenger” is much better if you ask me, but this crazy splash flick, however, is also resilient; just make sure you leave your entire brain behind the door. Events take place in Tromavil, a small town that proudly claims to be the capital of toxic chemicals in the world, and they certainly don’t lie. The precautions at the local nuclear power plant do not meet the standards, to say the least (even Homer Simpson has never been so careless), and toxic waste leaks to the nearest high school. The first drunken victim is a stereotypical nerd who begins to throw out the greens from all the cavities of his body, but his death is considered an accident, because in his house there were at least TWO microwave ovens! Oh, humanity! Shortly thereafter, however, nuclear leaks also affect the weeding plantation at school, and everything becomes really messy. After smoking the joint at a party, the cutest couple at school produce a giant monster worm, which settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum. “Class of Nuke 'em High” is a horrible horror film, with such silly dialogues that damage your ears, and makeup effects give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless. If you like to watch faces melt, fall apart or split in half, this is definitely a must-see! Unlike the aforementioned Poisonous Avenger, this film suffers from a couple of really boring and lengthy moments when nothing really significant happens, for example, when Chrissy and Warren try to figure out what is wrong with their hormones. Crude humor is not as effective as in Toxic Avenger, and acting is inexcusably amateurish. Continue only if you are an avid Troma fan.
