I bet none of you knew that the famous conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary reconnaissance to Mexico before taking the Aztecs. It is good that he did this because he would never know about the Rex who inhabited one particular valley where the locals worshiped them as gods. <br /> <br /> This was understandable. What was missing was the casting of the blue-eyed Jan Ziring in the role of Cortes. Even with blond hair, known in the Beverly Hills 90210, painted black, Ian looked completely ridiculous. At least he did not try to emphasize Spanish. <br /> <br /> The real hero of Aztec's tyrannosaur is Marco Sanchez, who also missed the semi-repetitive television series in the Walker of the Texas Ranger as detective Sandoval from Dallas paid He finds true love for the Aztec princess and life would be just perfect if not for those annoying prehistoric beasts that the local people worship. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus Aztec looks like he used some passages from the famous series of Sid and Marty Krofft Land of the Lost. All that was needed was some sort of Slestak. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in learning about this reconnaissance expedition, which is not entirely included in the history books, look at the Aztec tyrannosaurus. Then try and sit through it with a straight face.
