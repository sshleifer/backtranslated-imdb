I noticed that “Fire” was on the channel last night, and I started watching it, because I could not remember anything specific, except that I was a terrible movie when I saw it back in 85 year. Twenty years later, the film is still terrible. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most common instrument in pop music in the 1980s, as can be seen from the title song. Hearing this song again, I wanted to poke a screwdriver in my ears to end the sound suffering caused by it. And in addition to this musical attack, Rob Lowe's character played the saxophone, and there was one scene in which he played a solo that went on like Charlie Parker, only his piercing tone and the game more resembled a monkey playing kazoo. All the characters were extremely unattractive, although I must say that they did a great job of selecting equally unattractive actors to portray them. In fact, I thought Mare Winningham was attractive, and at first I felt sorry for her character because she was wearing funny underwear, but then, near the end of the film, she decides to have sex with character Rob Lowe, for whom , most likely to vote for the transfer of various sexual diseases, if they voted for such a thing.
