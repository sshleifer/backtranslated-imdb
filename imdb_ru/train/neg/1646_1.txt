I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but that was too much. The game was not great, but it was not a real problem. The problem was that I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach about 20 minutes after the beginning of the movie. These characters were empty. They had almost no depth, and the fact that they had little was devoted to the cruelty that they demonstrated to each other under the guise of friendship. Studying the dark sides of a character set can be fun, but you have to give these characters real personalities, or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard, and the image they gave was just ugly.
