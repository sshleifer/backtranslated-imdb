Wait, don't tell me ... they threw away the film and saved their doubles. You know, this film could be shot in a back alley in New York. "Gangster bandster", probably. Gangster Rap, designer clothes from gangster rags, including a scarf, which somehow moved from the neck to protect against dust storms on the head. I guess it was supposed to protect the head from the heat penetrating the K-Mart hats. "Budget horse rental" seems to have been delivered to horses. A scene in one bedroom where the girl was talking, and the guy was saying her words ... I thought he was saying that. You know, watching this movie only confirms that this is no longer an acting game, but looks and money. There could not be too much about this movie. Well, in general, I think this movie will go down in history as the worst movie of all time. Just one more thing, where was Ice T? He finally got the opportunity to go to Oprah?
