Andy Lau is shot in another secret story of a policeman. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for the police and is also close to the drug gang (Lau). The film begins with what we see as police trying to bust drugs, only to see how it falls apart. Then we get acquainted with a young drug addict mother and her daughter, who lives next to Nick, with his friends and policemen, and after 45 minutes I turn off the film and publish the news. Well played and great to look at it as unattractive, as I have seen in a long time. It’s not bad as such, you really don’t care. I mean, I really didn’t care. In fact, I started doing something else, completely forgetting that I had a movie with subtitles, that’s how I didn’t care. I would like to hate the film, but the film is so worthless that it almost did not make any impression on me (it’s not even something that I could fall asleep, just ignore). Come on the box called "Chinese scar", that after he died? This is one to avoid.
