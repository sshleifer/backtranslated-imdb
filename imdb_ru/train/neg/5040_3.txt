I read comments that this is the best Chinese film ever. Perhaps, if in the only Chinese films that you saw, there was no dialogue, long-lingering distant views and silence and hacker editing, then you got the point. <br /> <br /> Difficult plot? Barely Try juvenile and amateurish. Fine moods and intrusive memories? Barely Try boring and trite. <br /> <br /> It was awful. I could not wait for it to end. Especially when the best lines in the film consist of “How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes". Blimey! What is the depth of character. I think that the continuous smoking of cigarettes should speak for them. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was completely disappointed with this. Even Zhang's sentimentally juicy “Way Home” was better than this.
