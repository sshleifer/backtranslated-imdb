Although I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its terrible production value), it looks like Shakespeare compared to this bunch of crap Hanna-Barbera brought us! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and terrible character created for children (including teletubbies, as well as Tommy Tapeworm). Whose bright idea was it - to create some kind of short mutant dog and let it speak, and then ride the characters of Scooby-Doo with it ?! Anyone who deserves death or watching this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is just unfunny, annoying and tormented by nerves - and this is only in the BEST episodes !! After many years, it would be better to just stop the franchise than to create this mess! I understand why in the live-action movie Scooby-Doo they made the villain Skrappi-Doo - after all, almost everyone hates him!
