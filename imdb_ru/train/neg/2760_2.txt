From the moment we met, I knew that there was no Gunn between me and the D-Wars. At first his name was lazy. I will be a war. As if writing the Dragon was too much for them. Besides ... you really can't be so blatant with your name, unless you are a Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever it wants. <br /> <br /> The second sign of a difficult relationship between us was the insane progression of history. Here's a film, a dreamy reporter tells of big snake tracks, recalls the time when he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins, and the dreamy little reporter finds a box that glows. The old store keeps a few terrible truths. This Bauraki, presumably evil snake, was deceived because of his chance to become a god. tells the child that he is a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in Los Angeles is his reincarnated lover, and gives him unnecessary decoration. The store also shows that, despite its apparent whiteness, he is a 500-year-old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, the dreamy reporter remembers this very well and starts to act like a half-mad, trying to find this random girl. Then jokes follow, and in the last ten minutes my brain will melt from my nose. What for? Go on, dear reader, if you have balls. <br /> <br /> Sarah, a reincarnated mistress, has her own memories. I have the advantage that I have the best girlfriend from Asia, and in the scene where she starts to get excited and do a bunch of posters with Asian characters on them, he tells me that the one who made this film has no idea that they make. This is a Korean legend, and she reincarnated from a Korean princess, but all in Chinese. Later that night, her dragon tat starts to hurt, she calls the police, because it looks like she has a heart attack. You see, in this mixed crazy world, they obviously cope with heart attacks in different ways, because the next time we see her, she is locked in her room with a security guard on the street, and the nurse claims she is crazy. I now have a new phobia, and this is what, if I ever have problems, the first respondents will simply accept that I am crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another argument with my harsh lover, the Gnome. There is a scene where Patrick Dempsey Jr. (Dreamy Reporter) is in a cafe with a cheeky black girlfriend. In the scenes that preceded the Divine Middle Deity, Bauraki killed an elephant, slipped through the suburbs and killed one of Sarah's friends. You see, people were afraid to go out after 9-11, but we must all be steeled after decisive coffee and baking, for which it was worth risking our lives. As usual, the giant snake will not prevent me from putting on caffeine. If I stay inside and fear for my life, terrorists and serpent deities will win. <br /> <br /> After being given a dragon sytnik in a battle with a helicopter, my cruel lover Dwarf treats me to a scene filled with pi $$ and vinegar to finish it off. I believe Bauraki has its own fortress and its rights near Los Angeles. They don't really say, but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah end up in a car crash that kills less significant people, and when they wake up, yes, the dragon palace. some backward dialogue later, a good god of dragon snakes jumps out of nowhere, and snakes fight / make love. And I'm not joking a good snake from nowhere. Maybe you think that I do it disproportionately, I do not mention this in the film, and then suddenly ... there! After a few seconds, the good dragon becomes the dragon god, sets fire to Baurki, Sara turns into a ghost and walks along with the dragon god, a dreamy reporter who has remained in the middle of nowhere captions ... thank God such difficult, were, and it was good times. There was a guy who looked like a turtle-shredder and spoke the same way as a Tuscan star wars raider. I will call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, he could never be useful. He could pass through the wall in a scene where it was useless. He could get into your dreams when it would not be beneficial, and he could ignite ten random soldiers, but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching these rubbish ornaments. I like him, because he was twice hit by a car in the same scene, and he made a fantastic noise of a raider dusk. <br /> <br /> Actors for the most part were great ... if they are great, then terrible. Jason Baer, ​​whom I thought was great at Roswell, I slowly find out that he can only act in one direction, and this is pretentious, spatially, and Patrick Dempsey is "ish." <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this dirty prostitute is his main actor, Bawraki, Dwars. This giant snake acted on his heart. I would dare to say that he played the serpent demigod evil cgi better than John Barrymore - Richard III or Hamlet. In each scene, there was some kind of emotion, stealing thunder from his younger mortal actor. When he ate an elephant, I felt that no one from the past, present or future would ever eat an elephant with the same feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature, and he put his heart and soul into every second of this damned project. Yes, gosh, my favorite actor in this film was the cgi snake. I have everything to admit it, right? <br /> <br /> I hope that Bauraki will get more work, not the cast, that Jason Behr finds a range of emotions different from the dreamy look, and this I will never again have to watch Blue Monkey. <br /> <br /> So, D-War is over. I want to get my CDs back and let's just be friends
