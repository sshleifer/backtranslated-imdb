The film includes former veterans of the series, who, for inexplicable reasons, play completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (speaking here as head of the UN Committee on Third World Countries!), Karin Schubert (as a feminist reporter-reporter) and Don Powell (as chauffeur Rassimov). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite being shown in deep night), it is heavily edited and especially the graphic scene (described in "Stracultr), in which the Asian slave trader gets You can't see your retribution when you were raped by a dog !! However, the torturous sequence at the end of the film, when a sloppy politician deceives a couple of girls (including, of course, Gemser and Schubert) on a midnight meeting under a New York bridge ( just so he gets his go wasp, get them!) - his high-society friends look with a frivolous look - it seems almost untouched. <br /> The funniest element of this record is - except Gems Her tendency to undress completely every time she enters the house (even before perfect strangers) - this is her trip to India to interview the charlatan / Guru (George Eastman looked much like Christ!), who found a way to prolong sexual intercourse indefinitely; of course, when Emanuel calls him to it, he ends with premature ejaculation ... !!
