Larry Buchanan. Yes, the same guy who starred in the Attack of the Eye Creations and in two (TWO abroad) films about the conspiracy about Marilyn Monroe. Here he is guilty. <br /> <br /> Adding to my ever-growing pile of folders left over from Oliver Stone’s conspiracy drawer, eh, I grew out of it, here’s “Down On Us” (that is, “Behind the Doors”), which is the working definition historical inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you THOUGHT you knew about Jimi Hendricks, Janice Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar, because this is the Real Deal! You see, three big names in rock music The 60s were killed by the government because they were disruptive or counterproductive to Truth, Justice, and the American Way, and they were the same, like them. I knew all this together. <br /> <br /> In any case, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) look eerily like their real shadows (that is, if you completely close your eyes, turn away and go five miles away from them)) show that instead of their recorded deaths they are attacked by the good old Americans from A! Yes, it's true! <br /> <br /> Dude, I can't believe that watched this movie. These are facts, when there is no street etched trust in the anchor point, funny; Acting makes television commercials look like a drama, and if you honestly watch it to the end, you deserve the end of the “turn”. You really, really do; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But, as the man said: "Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll." <br /> <br /> However, not this movie. <br /> <br /> No stars for "Down on us." And this film viewers describing the film, by the way ....
