This 30-minute documentary, shot by Bunuel in the early 1930s about one of the poorest regions of Spain, is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let's recognize that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully recognize that wealth can create its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although in general wealth is far condition is better than extreme poverty is depicted here). And if poverty in Spain diminished, it was not entirely due to socialism, which was preferred by Bunuel, but from capitalism in the Western European style. But one of the most shocking things in the film is this: in one of the scenes, the narrator says that children in school are taught the meaning of Pi. We teach mathematics to poor people, horror! Bunuelâ€™s short-sightedness is the brightest here, and she does not understand that it is the access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor overcome their situation. What does he offer? What do children learn exactly at school? Doesn't Bunuel understand that the lack of modern technology makes them poor compared to other people?
