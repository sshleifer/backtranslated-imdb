Five years after the original Creepshow, by George Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2 is another worst sequel to the horror film. This time, instead of five, only three. None of the three stories is either original or outstanding. The first story is the main plot of horror, a formal story about a wooden Indian statue, eager to revenge the killers of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but it is too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamur are played by older store owners. The second story, “Raft,” is the story of Stephen King. These are about four teenagers who unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon, the children scream about their life, like a watery drop makes each of them for no apparent reason. However, instead of being tense, children are burdened by poor dialogue and misbehavior, making it difficult for us to really care about what happens next. There is also unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is “The Hitchhiker”, which is in fact a retreat, re-adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story by Lucille Fletcher was filmed in 1953 as the film Noir Uncertainty. He was then adapted for the famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens. “Hitchhiker” works best of these three proposals, but not without problems. Lois Chiles plays a betraying spouse who eventually runs after hitchhiking, or so she thinks. However, we do not know whether she should sympathize with or condemn her. As in many ordinary stories of this type, characters exist simply to tell stories with their turns. Thinking stories with hooligans seems a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears in this issue as "creeping." It is good that there were no more sequels. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
