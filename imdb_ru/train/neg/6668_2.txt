The longer this film lasted - and it seemed that it tiresomely continues forever - the more frankly I became, frankly, a waste of time sitting through all this nonsense. Why on earth can people make such films or even get paid for such garbage? Do not be fooled by the relatively high IMDb ratings, as this simply proves that you can fool some people all the time. And in this picture, the main players are obsessed with weapons, so it is not difficult to understand how this film will eventually unfold. America will never be able to understand that the rest of the world considers it strange that society in the United States has such an obscene and fatal "weapon culture." <br /> <br /> In any case: <br /> <br /> The lead actor depicts a loser who escapes to the fantastic world of a cowboy in urban areas. He meets a family with two spoiled children, a teenage girl and a boy; takes care of a strict single father who barely manages. A cowboy seduces a teenage girl or vice versa, and the impressionable boy seems to be carried away by the insanity of a loser. <br /> <br /> Cowboy spends all the time in a state of unreality and depression. Absolutely a loser who prefers to go to the beach, and then makes a living, and then commits theft with his family, because he is too lazy to make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself a question: <br /> <br /> Who wants to see a sad unlucky loser in a fantasy world with a desire for death, or really look at a poor family that is actually not much better than white trash ?! <br /> <br /> This movie is meaningless Drivel. <br /> <br /> He saves himself from getting a minimum score with only half listened music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
