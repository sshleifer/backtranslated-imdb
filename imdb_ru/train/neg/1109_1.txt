This is almost certainly the worst West I have ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially characteristic of westerns and martial arts films: the hero finds out that his family / friends have been killed, so the hero intends to take revenge, disrupts an ineffective lawyer, saves a kidnapped loving girl and kills an expert sworn enemy in a cruel duel. This formula has often been successful - otherwise it would not have been a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophisticated performance you have ever seen. Scenarios are terribly simple and offensive; It sounds like a high school student wrote a dialogue because he lacks depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks duplicated. Cinematography is lame, and the scenery is sometimes just facades. The game is pathetic; Of course, some performers may blame the script, but others cannot use this excuse. I hope that I will never see Chris Liebert again as a speaker; every time he utters a phrase that must be evil or evil, he does nothing but lower the timbre of his voice, and he just sounds like a child trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Liebert, who plays Hopalong, look at his pranks (if you dare to watch this film): he wears this brand new outfit that makes him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, stubborn and dirty cowboy, If you like crazy cinematic fare, which simply serves to worship the imaginary greatness of Hopalong Cassidy, then get it, but if you have more than two neurons, look for something else.
