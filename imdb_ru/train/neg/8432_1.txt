Leave it to geniuses such as Ventura Pons, a Spanish director, to convince senior officials in their own country to subsidize this erroneous film attempt. The sad state of the film industry in this country is the result of attempts to make a film of such thin material. Most of the paintings made in Spain are divided into two categories: paintings about the Spanish Civil War, which like to present the past history at the discretion of the authors. Other types of films show the viewer a lot of useless sex, because the "creators" have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> When the film opens, we watch Per’s penis trying to cut it off and put it on one of the plates at the party. Later, Sandra will show all that she gave the audience to admire. The story of Pere's attraction to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happily married, is false from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the film is based on an earlier, better-made picture of Mr. Pons, “Amic / Amat,” but, alas, this has nothing to do with the mess we are punished for. the enterprise. As for the comments presented in IMDb, all negative voices come from Spanish viewers, which means a lot of them!
