It was supposed to be a film about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and the equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. It would be a movie worth seeing. Instead, this is Paul Reiser's car with a small amount of Falk. The beautiful Elizabeth Perkins is also present in this film, but you can hardly recognize it. I think Reiser had the impression that he is a giant movie star who needs a suitable car. He is not. Even more irritable is that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best actresses of the female characters on the screen today, and then pushed them all into the background. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when she does, the screen glows. In fact, the story is about Falk and Dukakis, but we end up on a meaningless, stupid, ridiculous trip, in which Reiser shows how he can be very sweet, precious and very deep with psychological insight (wrong!), For example, in a restaurant scene, which, it seems to me, Reiser hoped was “similar to Cassavetis,” there is a ridiculous false confrontation between Reiser and Falk, which is so obviously ridiculous that I was embarrassed because of Falk.
