Usually after the first minute of the movie, I know if I will hate or adore him ... but now I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The start was great; “It's based on a true story,” and blah blah bla, the thing was funny. After that, the cartoons and the description of the life of the guys with the photos made me think that I made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then seeing Toronto’s funny, fake look was cool. In addition, the decor and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> It was perhaps the first 10 minutes of the film ... which subsequently looked like an eternity. <br /> <br /> Maybe only I don’t understand Canadian English humor (maybe English Canadians also don’t always understand Quebec’s humor), but hey ... there was enough material for a short film, nothing more *. Maybe it can make a difference to the name? In any case, almost everything was filled, and, in my opinion, very few things were even funny. <br /> <br /> Actually, the “creation” was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation that made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; That's why I shot the film because I was interested in the “disappearance of annoying people.” But nevertheless, I did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and with it the point in the film. <br /> <br /> If you’re English and Canadian, you’ll probably appreciate the local humor, given the amazing number of people who gave this film 8. Otherwise, just think twice before losing your valuable time ...
