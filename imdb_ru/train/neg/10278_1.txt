the only worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this film at the Austin Film Festival in 2004, and I just thought that this film was accepted to the festival. it was an interesting premise, and it seemed that she could go somewhere, but just collapsed every time she tried to do something. First of all, if you are going to do a musical, find someone with a musical talent. the music consisted of a stupid piano that sounded as if they were playing the stereo in the room they were shooting. the lyrics were badly written, and when they were not obvious rhymes, they were groaning rhymes that showed how far they stretched, trying to make this film work. and you think that you will find people who could sing while doing a musical, right? not in this case. Fortunately, they almost half spoke / half sang in rhyme, but when they sang it made me cringe. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and that's just the address of the music. Some of the acting was pretty good, but many of the dialogues were terrible, like most scenes. they clearly did not have enough lighting on the scenes, or they simply had a bad editor, because they constantly crossed the line and used terrible decisions when cutting the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added a hook to make it musical. I hope that investors will make sure that someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
