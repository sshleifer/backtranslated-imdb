I knew that this film was supposed to be so bad that it was funny, so I went to that with this expectation. I just found it was so bad, that it was terribly boring. A song on a clueless topic is fun for 10 seconds, until you realize that there is nothing clever in it, except for its deliberately annoying quality. Watching things get splashed with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. The film is nothing clever or funny, except for the premise. It could withstand a 3-4-minute comedy sketch, maybe, but this is simply not a full-length film, any kind of fantasy.
