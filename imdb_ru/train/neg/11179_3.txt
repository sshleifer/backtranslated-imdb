No matter how we all loved Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this film. Advertising hack about the dirty ending of what once seemed an outstanding and idealistic career. Pacino plays his part by looking like an unmade bed and attacking everyone with a completely fake and inconsistent southern accent. <br /> <br /> The plot rolls so and so with so many loose ends and incredible possibilities that the mind coughs (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger does little there. Her scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. It's hard to believe that they mean a lot to each other. There is no energy. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, lit up the screen. She was electrified, and her scenes with Pacino were the most interesting in the film, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
