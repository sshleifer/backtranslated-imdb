Excellent work Alix Elias emphasizes otherwise misdirected and tangled pile of wood. I have seen this film, perhaps 12 times, and with each pass I find less and less pleasure. Why are manches so lustful? Has it ever been explained? Are they a reflection of our idiotic, boorish "I" animal? If they are, why not make it more obvious? Why not dismiss the subtleties of this film and not make this connection obvious? Another part of this movie that bothers me endlessly is motorcycles. The jacket that the little monster wears on the front side of the cover seems to suggest the “street” traveler. Sunglasses say "cool dude." With all this, I'm ready for the fact that Easy Rider meets dolls. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Stick to the Gremlins series, if you are a fan of miniature, wise, reptile puppet - this will provide you with a decent treatment
