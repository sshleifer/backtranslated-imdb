Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes to the storyline, too short, turned out to be low budget. There is hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes, it looks like Lorna has a cold on her upper lip. I am sure that makeup did everything possible to hide it. I think they did not want to stop shooting until she healed, sorry. Most likely, in this film there were no scenes with kisses. Only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end. Lorna Dawn - a great epic story, and it must be told the truth. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much nicer and more faithful to the book.
