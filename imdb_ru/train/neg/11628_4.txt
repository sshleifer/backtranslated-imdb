Wow, guys, you are too cute! Roots, Roots, Roots That's how I feel about this movie. It all started with a good idea: a guy (Edward Asner) escaped from prison, dressed like Santa, a lot of children he finds and believes that he is a real Santa, so Fake Santa recruited children to help him find a bag of stolen money. The film is similar to the Christmas version of "Whistling in the wind." The film begins well, but gradually it becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to such an extent that in the end it becomes ridiculous, and you just can not take this film seriously. For example, you get a Scrooge type character named Sumner (Rene Oberjonois), who is a complete soulmate who treats his young son like a pile of rubbish, he doesn’t treat his son so badly that he doesn't even buy him decent clothes, the poor child wears Jeans with holes in it! but the 45-second scene with Fake Santa is visiting Sumner, and by the end of the movie you get a guy completely happy, singing Christmas Carol and hugging her abandoned son ... yes, that's how it is Roots ... I'm all I feel good especially during Christmas, and I'm a big fan of seasonal television films, but this film is too big for me, it's a shame, because it all started well, but the second half of the film turns the supernatural element into a film that just doesn’t fit the rest. This is not really bad, there is a good game, especially from children, but there are a lot of the best Christmas movies.
