Was it one of the most boring films I've ever seen ?? I really do not know why ?? Only your ordinary stories about the guy who is going to marry and instead begins to imagine someone else. The story has been told a thousand times. There is nothing new or innovative in this. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to this movie. In most cases, when such actors / actresses get together to make a film that was shot a million times back, it's really interesting. They usually have a few clever things that are not found in any other. For some reason, this one just does not attract your attention. You can choose some funny parts or smart ideas, but for some reason they are just not funny or smart anyway ?? I wish I had a new way to explain this, but I do not understand it ?? Just do not waste your time on it ??
