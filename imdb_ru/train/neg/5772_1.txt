I just have to add, in case someone really reads this and has not fully understood the meaning yet. These other reviewers are not joking, this is really the worst color movie you have ever seen. When the film began, I could not believe that something like this really seemed to the world. <br /> <br /> They don't just say it when they say it looks like a home movie. It really is. Like the “director,” he took the hi8 family video camera (up to DV cameras and non-linear computer editing), no other equipment (lights, sound equipment, etc.), grabbed some decent-looking student actors and went to make a film. No script, just making it up as he walked. <br /> <br /> When I watched it, it was on my monaural TV, so I only have one channel of audio (to the left of the right speaker). At first I thought I plugged it in the wrong way. The film was quiet until someone spoke for a couple of minutes. I got up and switched to another channel, and suddenly I heard music and sound effects, but then I did not hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound on different blood channels! I mean, there are movies that can be fun to watch, so bad they are good, sort of. I'm not sure that this is one of those. I mean, I confess that I was a bit of a novice director. And watching bad movies just makes you want to go there and PROVE that you can do it better, you know. But from watching this movie, I felt sorry for those who did it. <br /> <br /> No matter how bad they are, the actors are the only good thing about this. I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed by the brevity of her bath scene. A bit of T and A would increase the score from zero to 3 or 4. But, alas, no. If you want to make a movie, but this is nonsense, add some unwarranted nudity. Worked for Roger Korman.
