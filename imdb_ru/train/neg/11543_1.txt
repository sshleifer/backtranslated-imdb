Although I use this site quite often to see how other people appreciate what I consider difficult or just nice movies, after watching this “movie” on the fourth movie last night, I had to write something down, even if it just helps. I need to clean again. <br /> <br /> The film was perhaps the most superficial experience I ever had - the main characters were played by Danny Dyer (23? Are you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully, like Leonard Nimoy) there will always be Spock) there was no real substance about them - I'm not sure that the first half hour of the film did not make the final version, but surely in the revenge movie you would like some sympathy for the victims ... here I don’t give a damn cared, was a dog, with a deer coming close. And both animals beat Deer (Sik) and Scully, who were frankly terrible. I think you are as good as the script you have been given, and I would like to heartily thank the writers, the producers, the director and all the actors for spending 90 minutes of my life and some good electricity.
