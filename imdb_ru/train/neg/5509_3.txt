When I was a kid in the 50s and 60s, everything related to Disney was, by definition, excellent. What happened? They are able to get any actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But somehow Disney manages to spoil everything, despite their abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, best producers and directors, but still ... they spoil everything! This movie is shit. The sad thing is that I suspect that Disney in their arrogance does not even know when the movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> Only thanks to the talent of the actors can I give him 3 10.
