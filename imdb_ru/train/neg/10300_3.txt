I am a fan of feature films, but unfortunately, I have to report this film to be pretentious bore. Painfully slow developing non-existent plot, based on a promising premise, the experience, let's say, is trying. Even after bad movies, I feel like I’m learning something or enjoying some aspect, but there’s nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the film begins and ends there. The game was fine, although the characters were very boring. For the main character to strive for such a daring goal, she is very empty. A pity. I usually like movies that have no formula, but the lack of a formula should not be confused with zero content.
