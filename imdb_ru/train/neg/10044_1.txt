This is the biggest failure of 2008. I do not know what the director intended to create such a big disaster. The songs were added without situations, the story was stretched to fill the gap at 3 o'clock, and the most disgusting are the tricks performed by the actors, as if everyone has superpowers that they can run between the bullets - fire, and nothing happens to them one person is fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was at Anil Kapoor, who all the time at his best was playing the role of a villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish ... Akka did a good job too ... But the moviegoer simply forgets about it.
