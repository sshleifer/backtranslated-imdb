What an absolute pile of pants. Having read Chris Brookmere’s books from a religious point of view since I stumbled upon “Pretty ugly ...”, I was glad to know that this drama was ordered. <br /> <br /> I obviously believed too much. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing on this show - and even he doesn't quite fit. The way someone can read a book and then adapt it to this piece of scale, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Whole characters change, situations are discarded, and Parlablan’s dramatic hack comes down to what Nesbitt does a quick chin and a slip in the bay window ... this caused tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> I’m scared to think what will happen to the "land of the blind" if this is the standard ... <br /> <br /> Please just avoid this ...
