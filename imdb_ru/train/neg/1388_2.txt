I went to see this movie, hoping to see some of the flashes of Jet Li, whom we were amazed at in Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of his combat stunts are so clearly fake that even this enjoyment has gone. Hitting the ball would have been much more impressive if you hadnâ€™t seen the wires holding it when it flew through the air for 4 seconds and 9 hits. <br /> <br /> Too cartoon and very disappointing.
