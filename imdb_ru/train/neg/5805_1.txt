Anyone who saw the original had to go out and destroy this horrible remake. Alex Baldwin, trying to imitate the late Steve McQueen in the literal translation of the word, just does not work. Although Baldwin did a wonderful job, itâ€™s a failure from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never tried to compete with the star. As for Kim, in the role of Ali McGraw is enough said. McQueen looked dangerous, menacing and believable, like Doc, the movie was excited and unknown, Baldwin and company turned it into a comedy, I laughed once when I saw this pathetic movie. And this terrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, who is one of the most exciting and believable actors today! Did it make-up artists for Michael, what they thought. If you want to watch a movie, as it was under the guidance of Sam Peckepe, get the original!
