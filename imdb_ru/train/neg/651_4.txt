I saw this film a few days ago and playfully jumped during scary roles. I have to admit, I found it pretty decent ... until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying. Logical problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a pretty healthy dude, makes no sound until he is killed. Don't you think he, at least, tried to kill the murderer? <br /> <br /> 2. When the comment was made that the gym teacher “SOOOOO is in love with Lisa”, I almost screamed on the screen. When your best friend's family was murdered by a teacher who loved her, you will not comment like that if you have half a heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks his uncle how many exits they have, and the uncle realizes that there may be danger ahead, wouldn't it have been wise to get in the car with Donna, the boyfriend, the aunt and the uncle and go far, far away, then lure the house with the help of HRT and the police, so that the killer would not be able to get out? <br /> <br /> I could go on. And further. And further. In fact, the plot was decent, the characters were not profiled enough for you to really feel any sympathy when they were slaughtered and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER. <br /> <br /> This film can be useful for teenagers or young couples who just want to spend a fun night. If you do not take into account all nonsense, this is a mediocre film.
