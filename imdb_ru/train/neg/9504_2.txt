The only reason I watched this film was that I recently read the not quite perfect, but interesting, made-up story by Robert Ho about the life of coach Big Kath Mabel Stark. Beti appears as a character in a book, in a less than flattering light. <br /> <br /> Until I watched the movie on IMDb, I did not understand that it was originally a show. Whoever edited the original 233 minute playing time to the 68-minute version available on DVD, he did a damn good job. The shortened version plays as well as any other movie “B” of that period, despite many “spirit-what?” Moments. For example, do we really have to believe that our hero dug that tiger trap twenty feet deep in the morning without even smearing his jodhpurs? Looking through the titles of the chapters, I see that number five is called “War of the Gorillas”, and number eleven is called “Gorilla”. There were no gorillas in the movie at all. I think it was here that some cuts were made. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
