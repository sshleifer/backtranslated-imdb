Even if someone does not realize that during the filming, Sellers was in poor health, and he died before the release of the film “THE FENDIAN LAND OF DR”. FU MANCHU would be painful to watch. This is supposedly a fountain of the famous oriental villain Sachs Rohmer, but he lacks attention. The potential for satirical comments about Roemer’s anti-Eastern overtones is ignored. Indeed, the film uses racist insults. It is unlikely that there are any jokes or jokes, only actors behaving stupidly and causing dull traits. It is especially sad to see that Syd Caesar is forced to spew curses and racial insults for trying to laugh. Most other actors also embarrass themselves. <br /> <br /> And Peter Sellers. He plays the double role of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to come up with a formula to regain his youth and his strongest British enemy Nayland Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; he conveys a kind of warmth, like Smith, when he discusses his fetishistic affection for the lawn mower, and he strangely moves like Manchu when he expresses his love of entertainment in the English music hall. But most of the time he plays both roles with tired gloom, thereby sabotaging any comic possibilities even more. The procedures of sellers, where he regains his power of extinction by electric current, are especially painful; he seems too convincingly painful to be funny. <br /> <br /> A few really witty lines, a sharp click of Burt Kwuk ("Cato in PINK PANTHER films") as one of the Manchu minions, and Helen Mirren's funny musical numbers can't save this mess. If someone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered to be a comic genius, he will not learn anything from the FENDIAN PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
