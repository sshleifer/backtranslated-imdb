Pretty boring nonsense that I've seen in a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance, and the game was the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Worse, camera angles were used, which made me feel bad, random music was awful, stifled the dialogue (maybe not so bad), and the footage from San Francisco looked like as if they were stolen straight from a city tourism council video ad. <br /> <br /> Yes, and mandatory sex. The scene was not even half well done. Better coverage next time, please.
