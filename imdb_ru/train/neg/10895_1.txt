I have seen a lot of bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a shitty horror movie. But this does lead to new extremes. <br /> <br /> This is a soft, plot of something that is never really needed anywhere, and takes time. No shocks, no horror, no waiting, just a bunch of guys rub themselves for an hour and a half, and then quickly finish. <br /> <br /> Bad horror horror genre, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
