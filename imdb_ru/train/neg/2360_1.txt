It will be the most useless comment I’ve ever recorded, but I still have to do it to warn you about the atrocity in the movie, what “Freddie is dead. This is not only the worst chapter in the Nightmare series, but also the worst continuation of all time! It was dull, meaningless and almost deathless. Terrible three-dimensional finale and incredible kills Roots enough to drive this "movie" into the ground. However, it doesn't stop there, just add a bad game, a terrible scenario and lots of wacky cameos, and you get this bunch of guano! No wonder why Freddie, as always played by Robert Englund, made two posthumous appearances. I would, too, if it came out like that. This film is exclusively for fans, do not look at us in disgrace.
