This is a good, deep cast, but for a thriller it’s better to play more than name the actors and talk. The first third of this film was nothing more than talk and talk. Much of this was a group of women quarreling about everything. <br /> <br /> The first five actors listed here are women, which confirms that this is really a “flick of a tiptoe” and some more. It probably plays on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a scene of a quick kill, and then another talk. Halfway through, they lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field looked here for about 15 years.
