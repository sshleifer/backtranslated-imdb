This is an anti-Serb propaganda film made for television. <br /> <br /> “Muslims are good; Orthodox Serbs are bad. ” <br /> <br /> This is a post. <br /> <br /> The use of “entertainment” for propaganda propaganda is not new. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the crowd. <br /> And apparently, many viewers and reviewers are talking about it. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> Serbs under the command of General Draza Milhalovich and his Chetniks saved 500 shot down American pilots from the Germans in World War II. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhalhovich and render British support to the Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed their example, and as a result, after the end of the war, Yugoslavia was transferred to the Communist Tito. <br /> <br /> And the US ally Milhalovic has since been smothered by the media. <br /> <br /> This film is part of an anti-Serb propaganda campaign designed by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG), culminating in the Kosovo “war”, in which NATO bombed Serbia because of completely false ICG claims mass graves in Kosovo were filled with the victims of nasty Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves, and the Albanians (Muslims) had no business in Serbia in Kosovo, are facts that most of the media will not print. <br /> <br /> I chose this film because the description of one sentence on the cover of the video looked interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine that I was disgusted when I found myself fooled when I rented another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia . <br /> <br /> Instead, from this propaganda, someone must make a film about the Clinton administration’s reluctance to deal with Congress and the American people about their involvement in delivering weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I will not hold my breath in anticipation of such a film.
