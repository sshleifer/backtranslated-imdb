Well, I saw a preview of this stupid movie. Firstly, the film is so staged and unreal that they all act. They can not sing. They are too full of themselves. It's horrible. Yes, children from 8 to 10 can enjoy, but this is really stupid. I mean, they say their manager is a kid. And there the record company is fake. This is stupid. I do not see. <br /> <br /> With regard to the setting and direction, not so bad. This is a cute documentary, but it documents stupidity. <br /> <br /> View this only if you donâ€™t like good music. In addition, it is very banal. It is not even tasteful. I hate to be so angry ... but this is really a piece of trash.
