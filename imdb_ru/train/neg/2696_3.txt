I know that John Singleton is a smart guy because he made Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and send it? This is similar to how the pilot of the bad "first time goes to college" teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some unreasonable violence to make it a commercial offer. Who would have thought that a rape victim would dump sausage with seafood? An evil loner will be hunted by a group of neo-Nazis (and embraced by a black man and a Jew - just for fun!), Just like everyone associated with this film, just lost the plot. Except for Basta Rifms, of course. Big ups.
