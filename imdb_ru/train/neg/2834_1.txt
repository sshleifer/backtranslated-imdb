Now I watched all four Bo Derek cars driven by her husband John; everything is pretty awful, of course, but these are definitely holes. Showing the usual fragile plot, bad scripts ?? from the director, of course ?? and acting, not to mention the free nudity of a star, she deals with her loss of a much older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts his gun suicide, saying that he always admired Hemingway !!), but who continues to appear and talk to her in fact, he wants to return to another, younger body, but in reality this only happens in the very last scene! Derek is beautiful as always, and still plays naively (!) ?? especially during the tangled middle section, where she is stalked by a bounty hunter in the spa. Quinn is usually bigger here than life (read: Hammy), but this easily makes him a nadir; in addition, for most of the time, it acts because of a piece of shiny plastic (probably assuming that it is in some kind of suspense)! Thus, his "replacement", obviously, is a cute dog, which has not a drop of talent or even individuality. Also filmed were Hollywood veterans Don Murray (Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife) ?? plus the amazing appearance of cameo billionaire Donald Trump (who apparently needs it in his resume)! It goes without saying that John Derek was his own filmmaker in the film, that the end credits are filled with useless (and banal) expressions of gratitude to many people who lent a helping hand and that ghosts cannot do this at the 1990 Razzie Awards ceremony!
