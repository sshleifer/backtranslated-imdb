The minute the striker began, I realized that we were in trouble! The premise is funny at best. The storyline was even worse if possible. <br /> <br /> The acting was tough and the actors gave off a feeling of inexperience. You expect more from Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered as if from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reed, but she was VERY incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a lousy movie to try and arrange for their return. <br /> <br /> Continuity was broken throughout the film. The creatures were not bad, but in fact they were not good either. <br /> <br /> As a result, I want to return these ninety minutes of my life. They can keep money, but give me time! What a waste.
