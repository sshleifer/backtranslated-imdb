Why do all the films on Lifetime have such anemic titles? "Unexpected love" - ​​oh, how provocative !! “I know that” would be better. The film is nothing special. Real people don't really speak like these characters, and situations are really beaten. Straight woman who “turns” into a lesbian, seemed rather nonsense than lesbian. If you want to watch two hot women kiss very carefully, you might like this. Although it seems that it was written by someone who really does not go out into the world to watch people. Why do I spend my time writing about it?
