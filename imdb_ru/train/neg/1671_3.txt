I saw it on the Cannes Film Festival market. <br /> <br /> This is really cheap production - thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that, but you have to catch up with a little sex, blood, or both. <br /> <br /> Think Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor. I think the producers really liked it. <br /> <br /> The opening scene on a spaceship that is going down is funny - you could imagine all the hands of the crew are shaking around! <br /> <br /> Haha - but I wish people who did it well - at least it is not pretentious.
