Do you want to know the secret of the film in the fitness center? Just lay out a movie with pretty ladies in super tight tracksuits, and let them stumble and rub the floor, like in a gentleman's club. This is what the creators of this terrible slasher film did, and this little trick made me look to the very end. This is the worst slasher film I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to change the channel, they added another scene with the girls involved in the workouts, and I stayed in place. Like a killer movie, Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase for the work of beautiful girls, this is a success. The urge to avoid is if you donâ€™t like the idea that half the film is a big T & A show.
