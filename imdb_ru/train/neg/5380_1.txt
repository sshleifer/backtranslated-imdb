At the time of this writing, it seemed that more than 50% of IMDb voters gave this film a rating of 10 or 1. I can only assume that those who gave it 10 were either actors or crew members. <br /> <br /> It is said that if there are enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters, these monkeys, simply using random keystrokes on the keyboard, will end up typing the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that, given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find one to give this movie a rating of 10. <br /> <br /> I patiently watched the first half, foolishly believing that the movie was on any This level would develop a plot or characters, or, perhaps, would make some kind of social commentary or cause only intellectual thoughts. Otherwise, I was quite ready to take action, indecision, comedy, horror, or even gratuitous sex as a way to keep my attention. Ultimately, I was disappointed, and therefore, most of the second half was scanned at double speed, as I searched in vain for a small piece of cinematic redemption. Unfortunately, they were not. <br /> <br /> If “Choker” were put up against the Scooby-Doo episode, then, I am afraid, the cartoon would have won the hands in terms of secrets, intrigues and unpredictability. And speaking of the cartoon characters, the acting abilities of various actors ranged from the acceptable (at best) to the embarrassing poor with the image of Brooke Bailey's strange pseudo-gothic obsessed with the death of London, so bad that I almost pitied her. br /> <br /> I would like to finish on a positive note, but even the soundtrack, a second-rate celebration of modern punk rock, could not entertain, let alone reinforce a very bad movie.
