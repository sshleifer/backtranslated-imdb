This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my whole life. I wish that I traveled in time and did the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the movie "War Games - Dead Code" was made. 2) Look at the original WAR GAMES with my current Computer Knowledge And eyes of a 1983 teenager. 3) Hack the Pentagon’s computer in the 1980s with knowledge and perspectives learned and remembered. 4) Reprogram WHOPPER to find out where THE DEAD CODE is located a few minutes before the first day of shooting. 5) Go back now, have a beer and ask Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to “flash” an empty whole in my memory. the event, especially my initial viewing of “Dead Code” 6) Have another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next bad remake of the film “Good 80s”. <br /> <br /> 8) I forgot killed Jar Jar. I'm not sure that I will have to go to the future for this. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
