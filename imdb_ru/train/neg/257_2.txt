I like Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> I like 99% of all the films that I see. <br /> <br /> And I came out of this. <br /> <br /> Now, I Admit, it could have been somehow connected with two white middle-aged women in the back of the theater who laughed at every little thing ("Oh no, Jamie knocks on the door! HI HI HI!" ) But .. It was so incredibly annoying. There can not be a continuous shot from the camera and without the camera from the usual angle ... everything should be on the face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad guy tried to be soft and Looks like Malkovich, but at the moment he is just old and tired. He did not bring anything new or interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines that you saw, too many that you heard before, and too many lines of a "tough guy" ... and I donâ€™t mind this kind of thing, though, as long as there is a bit of originality to it. In fact, almost the entire cast just sucks. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he's really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie ... but not so funny for me to put up with everything else. <br /> <br /> In this film, you had to shoot less, annoy less, shoot from the camera, more emotions, more feelings, and more Jamie Foxx. I gave him 2.
