I have heard about this film for many years and finally got a chance to see it. The massacre of the cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 ultimately led to the closure of the cheerleading camp. Fast forward to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, opens with new recruiters, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, they kill the killer until only one is left. That's when we find out who did it and why. <br /> <br /> In this film, Tom Smothers puts a terrible accent on the role of Canadian Mountain, and Paul Rubens performs his Pee Wee-Herman pictograph. In general, the plot is not very well developed and rather unconvincing, but some funny scenes do occur, namely House of Bad Pies and the strip poker scene. It seems that the final is combined together, and it's just a shame. <br /> <br /> In general, only about ten or fifteen minutes, the rest you can just move forward. It is possible to catch it on TV, but not worth buying.
