It was not a pleasure to watch. Frank puts all his dreams in the background and takes the usual (boring!) Job, just so that his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides to make a humiliating documentary about a person instead. A documentary filmmaker should point to the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with obscene headlines. The director's bitterness and indignation towards his stepfather are obvious. And sad. It seems that the goal is to make Frank seem stupid and pathetic, instead he looks like the most humane of the three people represented. <br /> <br /> In essence, a smear campaign, dressed up as something much smarter and sharper than it really is. It left me with a strong dislike for the director.
