We have reached the limit of implausibility with this film. In fact, dinosaurs arrive on this ship, driven by some strange old fart named Wuyi (which I needed after watching this movie). Obviously, Newy hears the desires of children everywhere and decides that he must fulfill the children’s desire for dinosaurs to be carried over into the modern age, so that everyone can see them for shameless exploitation. Dinosaurs eat it, which makes them smarter (It’s a pity that the writers didn’t have it). By the way, do you think it strange that of ALL the desires of children in the world, Newey fulfills the desire to bring dinosaurs into modern times? Why not satisfy the desire of children to stop hunger? Disease? War? I mean, come on! Doesn't Neweyes have anything to do with all the power he has ??? Finally, when Dinosaurs get into modern times, they start singing, dancing and destroying chaos (basically what you can see on a bad LSD journey, I mean, where else can you see T-Rex playing golf and jumping in a Spiderman balloon?). They get into the circus, and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) forces children who make friends with dinosaurs to sign an empty contract. What for? Why do children sign an empty contract ??? Screweyes says that if dinosaurs take a little ... Brain drain, he will let the children go. Dinosaurs instead of tearing off Scrabeis's evil limb from the limb, surrender and agree to his terms. What kind?! This is stupid! They could simply threaten him, make him give up the contract, eat him and go with the children. I think that the filmmakers tried to show that violence is bad, which is a controversial moment when, finally, dinosaurs run away, and a bunch of crows envelop Scriveys and, obviously, completely eat them up. Oh yes, this is not violence at all! We are back, no point, this is not fun, this is stupid, this is stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever made in a movie. Even for a children's film ... this is bad.
