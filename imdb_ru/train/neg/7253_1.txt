We rented a DVD in the hope of a good western. The film was good and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the film. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why did the bad guy kill the owner of the mine? In fact, he is not associated with the film, in addition, to find out how bad it is, and to hide. <br /> <br /> An insulted bank employee just behaves too badly to convincingly decide to hire killers to fire their employers. At least keep us guessing. No character has been designed for bank owners or bank employees. <br /> <br /> A very long delay in everything that happens. <br /> <br /> An absurd premise that Martin still had to meet with the judge after the gang admitted killing relatives. Even more absurdly, he admits that he will judge, and the judge will not listen to the sheriff's boyfriend. Even more ridiculous, Martin hung him up and broke the rope, and then the sheriff took him at gunpoint to finally return to his city and save his wife from a bad bank clerk. Will he not return after quickly sending a gang to save his wife and arrest a bad bank guy? Just send the judge a note that the gang confessed before being killed on the trail !!! In general, a very sad acting game and no point in the movie.
