This film was created for the Asian-Chinese market and is designed for fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest music stars in Asia. <br /> <br /> Jay Chou is a very talented songwriter. He is a mediocre actor, although he has appeared in several high-budget productions (“Initial D”, “The Curse of the Golden Flower”). Surprisingly, he won both the Golden Horse (Taiwan) and the Hong Kong film awards for the “initial D”. <br /> <br /> The cast is very well chosen, which mainly attracts everyone from China. It includes many famous film / television actors, singers and even a sports commentator (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was that Chu took the post of director and writer. He has a reputation for creating shallow and brainless films based on inconsistent scenarios. Because of his poor directorial and lamb history, the whole talented cast, the bizarre effects of vision and tons of production money were wasted. <br /> <br /> However, the terrible film successfully cashed out over $ 10 million, perhaps even more in Asia. This made it one of the biggest box office gains in Asia. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that you can watch this film only if you want to see how money and talent is being spent, or if you are just accompanying your children who are Jay Chow fans.
