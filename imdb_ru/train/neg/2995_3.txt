Only in the very rare case of the X-Files episode cannot cause any excitement, or there is something in the episode that is just boring to watch. The detective and his former partner die in unexplained circumstances. Death is related to the presence of a little girl who was there when death occurred. Mulder developed the theory that a policeman killed by his colleagues returned, reincarnated as a little girl, and was eager for revenge. Now for the weird bit. there is no connection whatsoever and seems to be just a random person chosen as reincarnation. I think it was a slightly lazy letter from the authors, and this episode is considered one of the worst classified material in history!
