This time we have a creator of psycho-toys called "Joe Petto" (See?), Who makes living, evil toys that kill people. He pursues a family that is not lucky just to live in the same house where he lived and his son-robot mutant “Pinot” (again, understand?)

It's kind of a cheap hybrid of Halloween III, Puppet Master, Dolls and bad home movies. Supposedly, in 2000, they began to make the sixth chapter in the series, but it was abandoned and not completed. We can only hope that this will remain ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 stars from **** <br /> <br />
