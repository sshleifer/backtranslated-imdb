I love a good juicy love story (and I'm a guy), but when I shot “Love Story”, I prayed that the end would come as quickly and painlessly as possible, and just the opposite for Ali McGraw's character. <br /> <Ali McGraw, when Jenny desperately annoyed me for the first 15 minutes. When we find out that she was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I could not help wondering if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor Oliver or someone would be interested. If she had not died, her annoying personality would probably have pushed Oliver to the edge and eventually led them to court in divorce cases. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 70s.
