I could not decide whether this film was so bad, good or if, according to Enid Koleslav, “it’s so bad that it went well and became bad again”. It doesn't matter, it made me look just like a bunch of weird color vomit, and offers many scenes that you won't forget, even if you want. There is a mocking young Ray Liotta, who tells Pia with pigtails that her creative writing trophy looks like a penis. A little later, Ray appears again, sticking on Pia not with a trophy of the appropriate shape, but with a garden hose. Pia with a firm chin tells her domineering mother that she wants to go to bed with Ray's eccentric father, Walter. There is an actress on the graveyard scene screaming the best line ever written by Pia or someone else: "WWWWHHHHYYYYYYY!" Again this garden hose, when Walter waves his face with Pia and roars, “Do you like it better?” There Pia and her date, so excited by close-ups of each other, that they begin to tear clothes from each other. There is a soul Pia, but she forgot to remove the dress. Perhaps the best thing is that there is a Pia typewriter, but instead of keys there are miniature talking heads of those who tormented her most (then I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally, Pia at the Awards, exhibiting Hollywood for his cesspool, spitting out the second best line in the entire history: “I think I'm not the only one who ever had to make his way upstairs. “I see that I’ve already spent more time commenting on the Lonely Lady than on the best photos, so I’ll leave. However, be warned that when you start watching, you probably won’t be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life will not disappear forever.
