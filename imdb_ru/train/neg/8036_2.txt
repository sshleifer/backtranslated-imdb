Do you guys want to know the secret? This movie sucks. Well, actually, I donâ€™t know, because if you allow yourself to indulge in plagiarism versions of the original films, then you may find this film striking (this film is plagiarized, and I know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the film are based on a typical plot; a group of so-called cool teens enjoying their vacation in Florida and themselves, who behave very much like minors. The only understanding we get at this moment is the extent to which the director has managed to illustrate the pretentious sense of teenage decline in the characters. The second half hour of the film is gaining momentum and begin to illustrate the beginning of unprecedented killings. The third half hour of the film will surely remain a mystery to me, because I turned it off before I could be mistaken, thinking that the film still has something interesting and original that can be shown. As for the story, it is easy to explain in several lines. A group of teens go to Florida for the holidays. While they are busy with parties, they are slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) start to kill, because they know some kind of silly secret. The only thread to the killings is that all the victims were enrolled in a regular high school. However, one thing that struck me in this film was how much Betty (I'm not sure about her name ... blonde) looks like Reese Witherspoon. Another thing that struck me in the film is that he made me jump out of his seat several times. Does this make it a work of art? absolutely not because my 12-year-old niece made me drink a glass of orange juice, because she "insulted" me when I was just about to go through the door of the guest room ... what is the difference between the director and my 12-year-old niece ?? ?? <br /> <br /> Want to know the secret ??? I'm not sure about you guys, but I'm not ..
