My interest in Dorothy Stratten made me buy this video. Although he had great actors / actresses, there were too many scenes to keep the interest. Plus it just wasn't so interesting. The dialogue was tough and confusing, and the story just turned upside down too much to be believable. I was very disappointed with what I considered one of the last Audrey Hepburn films. I will always love John Ritter best in farces. He was just too pathetic here.
