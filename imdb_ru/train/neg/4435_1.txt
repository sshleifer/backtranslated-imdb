Gods, I haven't watched such a horrible movie for a long time. Maybe not after the “New Guy” or various films about Freddie Prince Jr. Yes, it is amazingly terrible. The pure and wooden game of Mira Sorvino was undoubtedly inspired by Freddie. The production of the film was clumsy (rather, a play, and this feeling of isolation does NOT work well on the film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. She had a terrible accent, and her sex appeal was not here, so it was painful to see how she "seduces" other characters, and they "fall in love" with her. And what happened to the random shots of a live audience in the lounge chairs? Senseless! I had to turn off the DVD player to finish this movie, it would be excruciatingly painful.
