Quite possible. As Francis Weber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least when he stayed in his native France), he managed to play in a film that is so invisible that even a mere mortal man cannot understand. It's not just that the characters are so unbelievable or that the film is so deprived of even the lowest form of wit: it really hurts to look at it physically, such an endless parade of inept writing, acting and filmmaking that you can't believe it is a work of experienced and talented directors. This time the story of the whole story tells how almost an eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf in front of her theatrical release "Blink and miss". What were they thinking about?
