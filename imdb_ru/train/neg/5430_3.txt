Priyadarshan - whenever a person hears his name, his first thought will be "comedy." This is what this person is known for, or rather was known. After creating great comedy fighters such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slowly derailed with films such as Chupke Chupke and several others whose names I cannot recall at the moment. Now with such disgusting films like Dhol, the first word that would strike us if he heard his name would be “torture”. <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mixture of bad, unfriendly toilet jokes, partly dramatic, poor. tensions and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two scenes that were funny, though not witty, and secondly, with the exception of Kunal Hem and the hysterical grandmother, the game was decent. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were on top (if you compare them with the others in the film), then Tussar Kapoor came, then Tanushri and finally the two idiots . The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his game. Grandmother, at first resembling a ghost, besides, she was not at all funny, but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same as before. Four guys behind the girls and need money, but with a few turns. There is a “bad” person, ridiculously stupid and stupid. Finally, the good wins the bad and everything is all right. The idea of ​​having a dhol with a tone full of money is simply not witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing in the film is its length. After about an hour you get tired and want to leave the theater. But, being a critic, I have to endure for two and a half hours of the film. The film goes on and on, and the same jokes are repeated over and over, and the situations are eternal just in another place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law comes to your home and starts to mock everything, then send it for this film and have fun 3 of 10
