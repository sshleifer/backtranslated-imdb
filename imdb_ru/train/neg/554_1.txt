This movie is terrible. The script is bad, the script is mediocre, and even sex scenes are useless. Awe and intrigue of the original film are completely absent. This film was shot in a dark, gloomy and monophonic style (a la “War of the Worlds”), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. The pensive character of Greg Morrisey shows one facial expression throughout the film. Cool twists and turns of the original plot are sorely lacking here; the few that exist are simply anti-climatic. The only highlight is the performance of Sharon Stone in the role of Kathryn Tramell, which is rightly continued in this continuation, but this is not enough to fill other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which Basic Instinct 3 is to be created is if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.
