Imagine in a scat-film of crazy annoying kids ready from college, add a little history and a lot of horrible actions, and you still don’t even realize how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> Shot bad, bad effects, worse acting skills. Invented attempt to shocking horror. Everyone to whom I showed this is depressed. Sex scenes are worrying, not necessarily because of their content, but more so because you just want to finish them as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just disgusting, even before she got to the guy. <br /> <br /> I’m one of those people who love watching movies that people hate, so I made this one. But for your own sake, save time and avoid this disgust. This is so bad. I literally threw it in the trash.
