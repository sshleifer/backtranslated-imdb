This is the story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. Parents divorced, and mom stays at home in the east. His father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children to California and travels around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best possible education. <br /> <br /> Everything becomes really funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece, comes to live in a group. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the various adventures of a family complicated by drugs in a wealthy area. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter stands for a woman who wants Murray to move with her, as she wants a companion. <br /> <br /> Karl Reiner and Rita Moreno come to an end. They play brother and daughter-in-law Murray respectively; they are also Tomei's parents. Before the children, Rainer lets go of a reminder to Murray that he is paying for them all the time. <br /> <br /> The film ends on a sour note when an embarrassed family comes out of their bizarre excavations and takes a ride around Beverly Hills in his car. I guess the film promotes independence and some old self-esteem.
