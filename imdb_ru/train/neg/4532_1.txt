My husband and I bought the Old Sesame Street DVD for our daughter, and I must say that I do not allow her to watch new episodes on TV, because I find ALL the characters to be annoying. Teddy Bear And Telli? Oh God, how annoying and useless talker can think about their "parodies"? Elmo? Rest, not every child loves him, again, annoying and teaches nothing to my child. Mr. Noodles? what a failure. I think that once I turned on a “new” show for her, we were left dumber than before. The show definitely took a wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, the latest Kermit news, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, The Mumford Wizard, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the great educational parodies of the old school SS Sesame Street from the very beginning suffered from boredom and dumbness Jim Henson left in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, fun and interactive scenes to which it is used. I find the new versions just unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational chatter. Path to producers / writers S.S. You have another cartoon show for parents, where they sit in front of non-creative, not trained children, so that they do not have hair. According to producers / writers: I suggest you unscrew the old dolls and start taping content similar to the one that was on the first Sesame Street. The Lord knows that I do not want my child to speak like Teddy Bear or Elmo.
