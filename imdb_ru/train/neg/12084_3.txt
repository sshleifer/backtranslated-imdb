Take: <br /> <br /> 1. a famous piece <br /> <br /> 2. a director with his own ideas who uses <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the stage design of the popular theatrical production of the play mentioned in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. the main actor who does not feel the role he plays, and you will receive: “Hamlet, Prince von Danemark” <br /> <br /> I listened to the Hamlet radio show with Maximilian Schell in the role of Hamlet and I were so disappointed. I was hoping that the shot version would be better, that Shell would at least have body language to emphasize what he says - nothing. Then the scenery ... minimalistic design is not for everyone’s taste, but I usually like it when the stage is enough to understand what the setting is and nothing else. Alas, it's on stage, in the theater. This will not work in a movie based on a play that actually has plausible settings. That the idea for the set was copied from a theatrical production in which Shell already played Hamlet ... let's say if it was the only thing you could complain about ... I wondered how Shell could get the role of Hamlet somewhere in the first place and how can anyone let him play Hamlet a second time. If you have the choice to watch any of the approximately sixty Hamlet-based films, don’t watch this one if you’re not a masochist, or really hardcore, or like to make fun of untalented actors.
