This film is absolutely terrible, but, nevertheless, it can sometimes be hilarious, although this humor is completely unintended. <br /> <br /> The plot was incredible. I do not even think that the two-year-old child will be convinced of the ridiculous idiocy that the filmmakers tried to unite the story. However, on the positive side, some of the appallingly meaningless plot twists give a lot of humor. For example, “Wow, Lady Hogbottom hid a giant rocket in her backyard!” It gets worse (and even funnier), but I'll spare you. <br /> <br /> In general, the actors are funny. Most of the children's roles are pretty sweet, but not very believable. On the other hand, Annie is just awful. Adults generally do not take their roles seriously, but in general it is good. If they tried to be believable, the film would be even worse. What is difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> As soon as you get over the whole shitiness of the film, in fact you will see some outstanding moments when you hardly grumble. The scene where Lady Hogbottom’s son runs off with the maid is surprisingly funny, although it is annoying when the police catch them. The butler character, though very insignificant, is a ray of sunlight that almost, but never penetrates the darkness. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain. However, there were several redemptive parts that made him almost watchable without starting hemorrhages inside. Judging by its good sides, the film will be around 5; unfortunately, the rest of the film hardly deserves 1. So, I give it 3. It is quite generous, I would say.
