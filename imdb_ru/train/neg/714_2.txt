This is a movie of tired but strange children's cliches. Is there a Nazi master witch conducting experiments related to the Federation Council in the basement? Oh please! <br /> <br /> Striving for a creeping feeling of horror and fear, the overall impression of the film is a very immature concept of fear. Having no expectations in advance, they leave me: an elderly Xander from Buffy and a monkey-like heroine who seems to not know how to act. She said that I had met Adrienne Barbeau before only in the much more pleasant “Women-cannibals in the jungle of the death of avocado” <br /> <br /> Camera and editing create the overall impression of a slop.
