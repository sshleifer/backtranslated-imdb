Attempting to compare or present this “mine” as you like, Hitchcock is an attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to spend $ 7 on this film ... Weak acting game Weak history Weak script. <br /> <br /> No real expectation, no thrill. Through all the weakness of this film, you are waiting for a big return or even some kind of return ... You have to think what kind of crap it is. <br /> <br /> And please, enough movement to make the "alternative lifestyle" HIP and politically correct !! ... I can't recommend it to anyone ... Did I mention how weak the game is? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and Mork. But those were MUCH more innocent times ...........
