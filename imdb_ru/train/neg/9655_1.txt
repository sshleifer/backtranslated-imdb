I ended up watching this film before even watching any reviews, at the request of the woman. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. I am very shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that lead me to conclude that this is a fraud. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, I have to ask: “Are these directors behind or not? Do they assume that the audience is backward? "The film is terrible on many levels, and I don’t even talk about history or presentation. <br /> <br /> So these guys plus one girl (lead actress) form a musical group; guessing from the constant presence of guitars, it should be the ROCK band. Damn, when did the dancers start to be part of a rock band ??? In any case, let me take it as a "Bollywood version of a rock band", but it's funny enough that all the parts on which these two guitarists actually played cool "ROCK GESTURES" and I guess they played instruments, the sound of a guitar by I was completely absent !!! I just can’t understand the extent of the stupidity here ... <br /> <br /> I’m just going to conclude here because there’s absolutely no need to point out further flaws in the film. Bollywood directors don't seem ashamed !!!!!!!!
