Horrible movie! He must have been against some real stinkers to be nominated for a Golden Globe. They took the story of the first famous woman artist of the Renaissance and crippled her beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they have taken the liberty of the facts; if the story were good, it would be beautiful. But it's just weird - apparently, the true story of this artist would have been created for a much better film, so why did they come up with this boring script? I suppose that in the actual version there were not enough naked people. In the end, he hastily crowned the outcome of the artist's life - we could save a couple of hours if they had preferred the rest of the film with the same brevity.
