Another adventure in the field of youthful comedy, unfolded in the campus, where the cretin tends to cool, and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular athletes, forcing him to get the girl. All this has been done before, and all this has been done in a much more satisfactory manner. Mass humor that made teen films like American Pie and Dude! Where is my car, ‚Äùso popular, completely out of context in this issue, and it looks quite by accident that the viewer can only frown and not approve. The film is poorly written, and the actors did not manage to make it even a little tolerable. I will not even ennoble this terrible picture of disclosure, since it is a waste of my and your time. At best, Slackers never manage to entertain or cause laughter, and at worst this is painfully bad, and sometimes impossible to watch at all. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwartzman, impressed with his debut in Rushmore, humiliates himself with what appears in this picture, and the question arises how a career can end so quickly in the toilet. Please avoid, please avoid. Save your money.
