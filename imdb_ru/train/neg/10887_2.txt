...... this film is rather terrible, the only thing that prevented me from giving it a grade of 1 is that, unfortunately, I saw worse. <br /> <br /> The jungle music, shaking of demons and blood / teeth / eyes in the style of fluorescent ultraviolet radiation give this “terrible” look, and the script is terrible ... this film is more like a test to see how long you can hold out before you give it up. It is also predictable, but not in a good way. None of this film is in a good way. I watched it 10 minutes ago and thought that I would rant a little, so you're here. (Oh, and the action does not fail the film, it is also terrible)
