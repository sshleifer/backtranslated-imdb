This film is a great example of how a great book is destroyed by a film. “I Loved Jacob” is arguably the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no plot, the plots disappear, and editing is terrible. To top it off, the music is straight from the synthesizer and sounds incredibly awful. The acting of Bridget Fonda is decent, but everyone else plays absolutely amateur. I would offer this film to someone who is preparing to become a producer, to find out how not to make a film, as it is full of bad cut scenes, bad transitions and acting skills that should have been re-shot! Read the book and do not waste your time on this film.
