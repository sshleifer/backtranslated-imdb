There was no characterization in this film, and it does show how much this untalented hack, who led it, needs to learn its craft. All his characters in this film were so unattractive, and I didnâ€™t care. The best moment in this film was the end credits and the hour after that, because I felt so damn dirty that I wasted money on this smelly load. Hey, genius .... triads and yakuza from two different places will learn something about Asian culture. The canine scene in this sensation was so exhausted and useless. This DVD has proven to be useful. I really like my new cup holder. <br /> <br /> Therefore, children do not waste your money on this crap.
