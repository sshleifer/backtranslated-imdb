After the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003) and acting out the supposed success of the original Cube (1998), director Ernie Barbarash can allow us to present the third edition of the trilogy, the prequel of Cube Zero. <Br /> <br /> Deep in the depths of a gigantic and faceless institution, the time and place of the unknown, two low-rank operators Winn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and watch the behavior monitors of people who were placed in a giant network cubic chambers, some of which are equipped with deadly traps. Having said that the people they are observing are convicted criminals who have preferred this terrible and deadly test to a mortal prick, these observers have not had problems with their work until Winn, a mathematical genius, finds out that one of the prisoners named Kassandra (Stephanie Moore) never agreed to be placed in a Cube. It is suddenly realized that perhaps their “jobs” are not what they think, and that they can be part of something deeply sick and perverted ... <br /> <br /> For people who have seen and enjoyed the original Cube, this is probably not a prequel enjoy. The point is not that history has no potential; just the first Cube movie never needed to be expanded. Standing alone, this is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and confidence in his message. It was also well autonomous. The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystical features of the original, trying to answer questions with a lot of questions, but only in reality confusing something that never needed to be corrected. <br /> <br /> What this new film has to offer, which are questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, of course, these are good questions that should be raised, but probably should have been done essentially, and not as a continuation film that did not have such aspirations. <br /> <br /> Having said this, other features of the film, such as acting, directing and screenplay, are not terrible. The film has a dark, gloomy look, similar to such films of noir, like The Matrix and The Dark City, and they certainly managed to return the feeling of claustrophobia to the first Cuba. Unfortunately for Barbarash, these positive qualities are not enough to save him.
