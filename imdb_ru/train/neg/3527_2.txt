I had to see it, because it looked like a terrible premise - the prisoners found a magic book, oooh! Claustrophobic terror sets in, and so on. <br /> <br /> But there doesn’t seem to have been a story that fit the great idea. rather than frightening / physiological horror, he relied on the effects of the open fire and the horror of the OTT body, which didn’t scare at all if you were over 12. <br /> <br /> The logic at the end is ridiculous with dead characters for nothing but as in the number of people. a waste of good characters - who were the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> obviously, a budget that doesn’t spoil it, the film really isn’t going anywhere, and I believe that I’m going to say it - the Hollywood remake is needed. You just lose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other French films that have been released over the past few years, such as the Crimson Rivers, which were at least watchable / entertaining; I bet you can guess the end before you watched the movie. really very disappointing - impossible to recommend.
