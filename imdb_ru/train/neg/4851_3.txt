See how the Iraqi bomb disposal team counts down the time before they go home. <br /> <br /> In itself it is boring. Each time this small caption appeared, telling us how long they had gone, it simply caused this film to be dragged out without a plot. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I must have missed something. I am a big fan of war movies if they are made well. It was jarhead syndrome. The film, which from time to time was beautifully shot, but the cinema does not prevent it from being completely boring and meaningless. <br /> <br /> And stop shooting slow "pistol cartridges." they could save money and just get footage from any other movie with a gun in it. <br /> <br /> I had no sympathy for the main guy, I constantly hoped that his recklessness would make him die. In fact, the film would have worked much better if it had. <br /> <br /> I read several reviews, and it seemed to me that those who were in the armed forces did not like him, and everyone else loved him. I have never had the strength, and I am with them. This is pretentious chatter. 3 stars for cinematography.
