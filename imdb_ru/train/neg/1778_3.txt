I have nothing against a rapidly changing fear, but this Stephen King nonsense is too fresh, too bright and modern. The story of a new teenager in a small town that is “lunatic” - a kind of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and which feeds on the blood of virgins, asks for a more mysterious, ambiguous appeal. This thriller is given an unreasonably colorful look and feel, almost without atmosphere. Children are predictably beautiful and energetic, but a big plus is Alice Kridge, as the boy’s mother; The Krij from The Ghost Story never broke out of the filling and female mold, and this is a huge loss that it was no longer used. Her game is creepy and intense, and gives a hint that “Lunatics” could be a much better movie with a different focus and a tougher direction. It is too excessively and commercially controlled, with an unequal tone that ranges wildly from a thriller to a comedy and drama. Stephen King appears in a cameo, as do real film directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
