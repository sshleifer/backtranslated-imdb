Without a doubt, this is one of the worst films I've ever spent money on! The plot, sorry, did I say that there was a conspiracy? The worst moment was when ... No, I canâ€™t think of a single one! The best special effect that made me hide under the covers was ... no, I can't think of any for this. You knew who the killer was from the start. There was nothing wrong with the whole movie, in fact the only two vaguely interesting episodes were when you saw Misty's younger sister in the shower and when you saw Nurse Toppan taking off her top. This film should be watched only in order to understand how NOT to shoot a horror film !!!
