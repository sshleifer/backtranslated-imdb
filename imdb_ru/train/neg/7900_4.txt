Capital creatures wreak havoc in a peaceful little deserted town. This is basically the whole plot for this film, and although the scenes dedicated to the Munchies themselves are somewhat amusing (to a small extent), everything else is just a filler, and a bad filler. From the “hero”, who is Woody Allen’s painful imitator, to the ultra-stupid city policeman, it’s hard to choose the most annoying character in the film. There were cases when almost all of them were together on the screen, and I thought: “Well, at least, the friend is nice, but why should we put up with the rest of these jerks?”. The film is also filled with popular links (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably made it already in the early 90s. (* 1/2)
