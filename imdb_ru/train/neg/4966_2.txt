I understand that this film was shot with a very low budget, but this does not justify the monster Grendel. The death catcher, the Throne of Fire, the Queen of the Barbarians, the Conquest, the Invincible Barbarian - everything was done for meager budgets and bad special effects, but they still managed to create a cult classic, adding a few poorly dressed women warriors and a good sense of humor. Primitive costumes, dark castles and a beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the opportunity to become a very good low-budget film about swords and witchcraft, but the creators completely destroyed this possibility, using extremely bad effects of CGI and colorless characters. Compare this film with Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but itâ€™s a good example of how you can make an entertaining low-budget sci-fi / adventure film using credible special effects and attractive characters.
