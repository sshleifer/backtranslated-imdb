As the artificial Russian scientist says two-thirds of the way in the film: "I came for science." This largely sums up the reason why I watched this film - everything connected with a shark in half, with a hammer, certainly deserves serious empirical research from an impartial novice scientist. Or, as they say in business, my girlfriend’s brother had a remote control, and the rest is history. To say that the special effects were bad would be a bad service in the field of special effects. This is 2005, it’s not so difficult to shoot a car scene without a blue cheese background. Yes, it was charming and modern, when Hitchcock shot "Birds", but in 2005 it looks just low-budget. Deliver me from the cheap attempt at science fiction and do me a service to really try to voluntarily suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> However, seriously disproving the overall concept of this film, let me tell you again, sadly, it is probably worth your time. For that matter, this is the power of bad science fiction, which deserves education for a new movie lover and certainly deserves further education for those who have seen several films in their time. <br /> <br /> A crazy hunchbacked mad scientist with a hammer head transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to shed a lot of blood in nearby water makes me wonder not only about the intelligence of humanity, but also the ability of the film writers " B ”come up with a remotely believable plot lines. <br /> <br /> This film also largely corresponds to one of my long-standing bad statements about the movie - the bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If it were not 2005, I would be taken aback by the fact that this film was some kind of insanely poor Cold War metaphor. I mean that you could just as well have the Khan on the bridge of the Klingon bird of prey insert leaching into Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching lines of the film is when a chicken without a bra insists that Charlton Heston’s counterpart, “wait for Tom” when he tries to pick up a rescue helicopter from the ground. The fact is that Tom spends the bad guys in sunglasses with his endless banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov machine gun, or AK-47, from a layman's point of view. <br /> <br /> As the mad scientist at the end says The film “My goal is to develop the human race” is enough to say that this film contributed only to the evolution of humanity. The weak Freudian references uttered by a mad scientist when he prepared a female protagonist to mate with a hammerhead are just a reminder that even in the worst science fiction we can all find something to laugh about.
