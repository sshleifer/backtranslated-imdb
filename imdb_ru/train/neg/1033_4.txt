I grew up on Scooby Doo, where you are, and I still love it. This is one of my favorite cartoons along with Darkwing Ducks, Fairy Tale, Peter Pan and The Pirates, Tom and Jerry. Although this show is good for children, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the theme melody is tolerant and has a nice animation. However, it is quite disappointing. I usually don't mind Skrappi, but when he seems like the main character, it quickly annoys. Complete with a catchy phrase Puppy Power, Scrappy is somewhat annoying than usual. Also, half of the gang was gone after the first year, for some reason it does not look like Scooby-Doo. Both the jokes and the storylines were generally lame and unoriginal, very few chasing monsters or exposing villains. In general, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: get the key, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voice, melody and the fact that it is nice for children. Bethany Cox
