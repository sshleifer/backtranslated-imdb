This documentary at its best shows simply the offices of Ayurvedic healers and preparation for treatment. One cannot deny the terrible poverty in India and the despair of even their wealthier clients. However, as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails with a bang. Although Indian clients have noted that they have seen “aleopathic” doctors, these doctors are not interviewed, and we have to take vague statements from their patients at face value - “the doctor said there was no medicine,” “the doctor said it was cancer.” and so on. Well, “without cure” does not mean “without treatment”, and what kind of cancer does the patient have? The film is the weakest when it shows ayurvedic practice in America. There, it all comes down, apparently, to the overwhelming assumption that having strong work on Wall Street can lead to abdominal pain.
