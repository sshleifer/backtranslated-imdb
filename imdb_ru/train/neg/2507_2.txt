This is not a good movie. It's incoherent, all acting skills are bad, and you have a disgusting story that you have seen a thousand times, much better somewhere else. Not to mention the fact that you can see every point of the plot, which is a mile away. Worst of all, no one bothered to tell Lonette McKee that she could not sing. But who cares, she is sooooo good. But I digress, nothing new here. As a result, a group of hot girls get the benefits, someone hooked on drugs, someone hooked on a guy, someone hatched, and then something terrible happens. Surprise Surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can't believe that so many people think this is a good movie. It seems that many of you want to use a sliding scale when it comes to evaluating black films. I do not play it! If you want to support these films, watching them is excellent! If you like it - super! To each his own. But don't try to tell me that it was good. Pleeeease! I would like color people not to fight with such films just because black actors participate in them. Want to watch a good African American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or the color is purple. It would be great movies regardless of the skin color of the actors. What for? Because they told exciting stories with great acting that made you feel something else long after you left the theater. The fact that this is our experience does not mean that it will automatically become a good film. It is only good - when it is good. Period.
