As a child I really thought that the weapon that the killer had was cool, but I was a kid, and so I was a little dull. Even being a stupid kid, although the plot of the film was stupid and a bit boring when the killer did not use his light knife to kill people. What strikes me is the fact that the film is really a solid cast. What scenario they read when they agreed to act in this film, as it is probably boring and is only a means to demonstrate a light saber on a very small scale. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, and the end is completely chaotic. The whole film revolves around aliens and one weapon. In the story, two children and some dude face aliens, flare up years later, and it seems that the return was the same as in the mix. Dead animals and the like have to be investigated, and for some reason, one dude gets an alien weapon and continues to use it to make a very light killing blast. Seriously, you just need to wonder why this film was made, if you have a killer, there are good death scenes, if you have meetings with aliens showing something more than a strange light whirlwind, and if you are going to have light sabers, then call yourself star wars
