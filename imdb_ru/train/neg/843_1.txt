Los Angeles' BDSM “subculture” serves as the backdrop for this low-budget and shabby mess, a seemingly useless play for its high-ranking player, Celia Xavier, who also produces scripts, playing the twin role of twin sister Vanessa and Celia. Soon the question arises whether some rather unrestricted camera, lighting and editing pyrotechnics will ever reach the connection point with a weak and often incoherent plot that will not be taken seriously by the viewer. Celia works as a high-level probation officer in Los Angeles County, while her evil twin became a cult figure in her fetish world mainly because of erotic CD performances, but when the “Mrs. Vanessa” catastrophic virtuous Celia, who has decided to dig out the evil intruder of her sister, is starting a new job as a “sex slave” in a private castle club, where the specialty at home is the “prison party”. Two FBI field agents (whose deployment in the case of Vanessa is allegedly required due to her involvement in the BDSM Internet sites), in addition to the homicide detective at the Los Angeles police station, are assigned to investigate the crime, seeking to ensure the safety of Celia, whose enthusiastic the speeches in her new vocation are rather eagerly viewed by her clients as creating conditions of personal danger for her. Flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as the murder appointed by the Bureau of Operations in the south of L.AD., a metropolis area that is far from the setting of the film. The direction is not focused and is not supported by random post-production editing and sound reproduction. The above-mentioned photo-gymnastics ends with a powerful montage closer to the end of the previous film, which is only indirectly related to the script. In the midst of this slag, there is one active turn: Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent.
