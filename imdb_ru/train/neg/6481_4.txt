Since The Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney films, when I was little, I was curious about its sequel. <br /> <br /> “The Little Mermaid” (one) is a classic animation function with superb quality of everything, great music is appreciated and focused on the general audience. “Little Mermaid 2”, on the contrary, is focused primarily on small children, because it is spontaneous, reflects the child’s self-esteem, the music is more vigorous and less dramatic, and the final is felt as a break. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 begins when baby Melody presents Ariel in the family side. Suddenly, without any visual cues that contribute to the drama, the giant tentacle grabs the baby. I laughed, wait a minute, it's not funny, they attack the child! Well, I will stop laughing. Morgana’s crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity remove the potential drama because it happened so quickly. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Melody seems to be superhuman, which I defend as much as most children present themselves. This quality in the character of Melody is clearly manifested by the end, when she fights with Morgana without fear on her face. <br /> <br /> As in the first film, Melody has a lot of Ariel’s problems besides the reverse. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father, restricting her from the ocean, while King Triton limits Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody rebel against their parents. <br /> <br /> In the first place, music moves more emotionally. There are tons of songs in this sequel, but not so much orchestral work. It's great for the little ones, because they don't need an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first film was strong and inspiring. The sequel ends with a cheerful song, and everyone plays in the water. It is definitely more aimed at children, because instead of the final being solemn and leaving you tired, this final makes you think: “It’s time for a change!” After all, this film is interesting for children, so we should let them have fun.
