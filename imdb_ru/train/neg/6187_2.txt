In short, it was a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was terribly awkward; I did not feel any feelings behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too hastily and felt rather inappropriate. With the same success they could bring the statues. Chemistry between George Scott and Susanna York did not exist, and it was strange to watch American Rochester. He could at least try to make a British accent. I like George S. Scott as an actor, but it just didn't work. I felt that I was watching the bright moments from Jane Eyre, where the main fragments of the story were randomly connected without considering the flow of the story. The scenery and music were all very good, but I did not feel any passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester, and the film did not leave me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Good Version of Jane Eyre, I suggest you watch the BBC version of 1983 with Timothy Dalton and Zela Clark or the 1997 version with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two brilliant adaptations.
