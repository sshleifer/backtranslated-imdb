Absolute trash I got to 16 minutes / 27 seconds and gave up. I would give a negative review if it were possible (although “pissible” is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the hiss, which you could see and experience in practice between McMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between the dumb Dicky Krenna and the fact that there is here, simply does not exist. Anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet? There is no cigarette lighting with your fingertip? And I thought that I would be sick when they had a degraded appearance (and rightly so, believe me) Lee J. Cobb, while Case almost belches / throws his way through the explanation of his “Little Man” to Mr. Garlupis. No offense to seeing, but the detachment of blind people seems to have broken with the decorations of the houses of Dietrichson and Neff. The same goes for those terrible Scottish pants that Phyllis wears. And how the hell does $$ do Neff, that he lives overlooking the huge marina? That guys, again, it all happens in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can get through this more, you will have a much stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist. But please take some Alka-Seltzer first, or YOU WILL develop your “little man” who will never disappear. Act carefully, obviously.
