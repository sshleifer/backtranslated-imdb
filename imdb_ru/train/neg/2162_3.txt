I do not believe everyone praise for this film. The performance and the movie were a Sleuth robbery. Michael Caine wants him to be Olivier, and Reeves wants him to be Kane. Kane even had the courage to do a Sleuth remake with Jude Law playing his original role. Jude Law? Do you mean the one that made the Alfi remake? <br /> <br /> This film was shot during Kaneâ€™s career when it was obvious that he needed to pay off gambling debts. He will do everything for money. He will star in such award-winning films as this one, and "Outside of Poseidon." It seems that the praise for this film is Reeves' death. He deserves better than he was remembered for this lousy movie. And Kane too. This film can be found in the trash bin for $ 5.97 at Walmart. Along with precious stones, such as "The Island" and "Rio is to blame."
