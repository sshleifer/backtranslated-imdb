CAUTION, SPOILERS! ! ! Personally, I donâ€™t understand why Pete did not help save Williams life, I mean, it would be great to know why William was motivated or forced. I think that the members of the Secret Service are people every day, and there is a rumor that the writer was a member of the secret service, now his motives are clear, well known. But how to hire this film will not satisfy you, because the old, but used turns, the usual acting game - these are just the things in this film, just to keep you waiting for the end. Clark Johnson as director of special forces. I worked much better, like this time, and I still wonder how the producers (like Michael Douglas) left this movie in theaters.
