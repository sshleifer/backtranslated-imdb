Yes, this film attracts much attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. However, I did not like it at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more suited to a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to Earth for a short time in order to live a life of lust she never did in her worldly life. Trashy sex scenes to follow. Why are they shitty because they try so hard to be artistic that they take it away from real sexual intercourse. I mean, we are not watching porn for sex. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it’s still very erotic and pleasant to watch. Of course, the girls in this very cute. Here we have a rather unappealing lead actress, and this does not help. If you find the main role in your adult film unattractive, I will not have an artistic vision that could make me enjoy the film. Sex scenes range from disgusting to strangeness ... I mean, one of them has a snake. So for me this film just fails, because it doesn’t bother me at all, but, on the contrary, turns it off.
