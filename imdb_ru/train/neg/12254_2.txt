Some may scoff, but in fact there is real art to make especially bad films. It is missed in all directions. <br /> <br /> A group of young people - women with billowing breasts and constantly wet T-shirts, naturally - go to the movie "Surfing the Blood" and end up facing a crocodile. <br /> <br /> Not only was the crocodile clearly fake, some props [especially pay attention to the boat hitting the reef] look like they came out of thunderbirds! <br /> <br /> Nothing good, from beginning to end. I do not see it!
