Just another movie that uses unreasonable male nudity; terrible acting, plus, love sex scenes are the most nonsexual I've ever seen (and this is not because I don’t connect the idea of ​​two young people making love because I’m gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in Mil nubes de paz, Julian Hernandez made an incredibly pretentious film with a story in which there are enough arguments for a short film lasting about five minutes, but he manages to make a 2-hour film with him ... And this time, in the Mexican gay community, it’s not even worth talking about racism and commodification! God have mercy on us!
