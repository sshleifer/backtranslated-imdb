I recently watched this movie twice, and I can't understand why the producers made this bunch of crap. I mean, yes, it makes an excellent impression on Hitler's entourage, and I mean how they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, World War I, and in the interwar period. What I can’t understand is why they portrayed Hitler as a 100% pure evil, insane, unreliable, mentally unbalanced freak. In the end, he was a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who, of course, had his own dark side, no doubt about it. But why in the name of paradise portray him in this way? All of his positive aspects were cut from the script, leaving nothing but a propaganda portrait of the man who had the greatest influence on modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into a devastating 2nd World War. Yes, he was a racist, and yes, he was sometimes unstable, especially at the end of the war. That's right. But again; why the hell did they cheat the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not think this film was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was that they were able to come to power in moments of serious global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable, but so was perceived by almost every living German (not to mention the Austrians and many other people), makes it a warning to modern civilization, and NOT the fact that Hitler was such a “freak”. If the creators made us believe - I would be convinced that the German people are backward. Such a person, as in this film, would never have been close to the party leader, let alone Reichs Chancellor. <br /> <br /> 4/10
