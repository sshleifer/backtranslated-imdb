Let's see where to start ... bad game; I'm not sure if I would even call it that, because itâ€™s more like reading a script without effort. The actors did not even seem to be in love with their roles and seemed completely lifeless and lethargic. Of course, there was one or two nude scenes, but this could not save this film from its lifeless characters. <br /> <br /> Calling the main character a rapper is an insult to people who actually do it. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow, and it seemed more meaningless. <br /> <br /> Budget? Did this movie even have a budget? It seemed that they used less money than I saw in the YouTube home video. Poor lighting, props, bad post-production sound. Bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that. The story could be good if people really seemed interested in making it, but there was no life in this film; I don't care who took it off. <br /> <br /> Last year I saw some really bad films, and this one is definitely at the bottom. Do not waste your time, otherwise you want to listen to this objective review. Check the ratings, you will see that 1 is quickly ahead of the fur 10, and there is almost nothing between them. I wish I looked a little closer before wasting my time. What a crap!
