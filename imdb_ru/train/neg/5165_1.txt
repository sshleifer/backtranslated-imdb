I was looking forward to this trip and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And it is very easy to entertain me on a roller coaster and amusement park rides. <br /> <br /> Everything was fine with the roller coaster. - and it was only about 30 seconds of a 90 second trip. <br /> <br /> This was visually boring and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> He desperately tried to look like a mixture of far surpassing attractions of Indiana Jones and the Cosmic Mountains and Disneyland, and failed in all aspects. <br /> <br /> It was not exciting or exciting at the least.
