Please save me from these films that teach us that crime is fun and justified. Combine this with a meaningless scenario with a strong desire to become a brother Farrelli or Cohen, as well as with the lives of ANOTHER group of people of supposedly older school age, acting out their teenage fear of the Dawson Creek brand, complete with the soundtrack GenXYZ, which is terribly trying to make the movie "feel like" cool, and we will have an intense and painfully inept satyr. <br /> <br /> This is not even a blurred Ferris Bueller ... I would prefer to watch the traffic light change. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that only one scene costs almost as much as admission: when Betty girls in a mask meet Richard Nixonâ€™s girlfriend in a mask. This is a surreal moment. Even priceless. <br /> <br /> But otherwise I would prefer a toothache. At least I can use a little benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
