Well, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herrington-Tweed, B.B.E. (The backbone of England.) She is killed in the first scene - that's right, people; this show has no base! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole in the role of Ol Col. Cricket from the First War, and now the engaged Lord of the manor. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as a dedicated lady from the estate, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years older than her own heyday, but still glamorous (British spelling, not mine) is enough to have a toy on the side boy. It's all right, they have the full knowledge and agreement of Colonel Cricket (they even come for Christmas!). Nevertheless, she is attentive enough to the Colonel to say that a boy of her age (what a girl!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum, as the toy boy said, is just as senselessly glamorous as his compression. Pilcher was unable to come up with no cover for him in this story, so she gave him a secret job in the Circus. <br /> <br /> and, finally, <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire, Mrs. Polonia Chaups, the reverend director of the Rev. Girl boarding school, gives tea in her office with a mixture of deep, sharp advice about life in the outside world shortly before graduation. Her best advice: “I have only once been to Nancerou (the local royal house of England). I thought it was very beautiful, but for some reason it was not part of the real world. ” Well, we cannot say that they did not warn us. <br /> <br /> Oh, Susan - there was a time, your character would play the entire series. They don't write like that anymore. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So, with these actors and the setting, you have the “Return to Brideshead” rework, right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these one-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temporary tasks that you have (YOU call another!) <br /> <br /> The first warning sign: lots and lots of highlight. They walked around it, taking off on the street - "hey, it's just sunshine!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: the lead lady cries a lot. When she doesn't cry, her eyes are wet. This is the law of romance novels: "The leading lady is" tall eyes. " <br /> <br /> Henceforth, the “Leading Lady” will be called “LL” <br /> <br /> The third warning sign: in fact, “LL” has stars in her eyes when she is in love. However, I will give Emily Mortimer a reward just because she had to deal with this searchlight in her eyes (interesting. Did they use contacts?) <br /> <br /> And finally, the fourth warning sign: not on the screen female character "Mrs." She is either "Miss" or "Lady." <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, I still could not tell who was haunting whom and why. I can't even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> To summarize: they all survived World War II, and nothing happened to them. <br /> <br /> Good, after all, L.L. she finds that she lost her parents in the Japanese camps, and my sister comes home catatonic. In the meantime (there is always "in the meantime") some young guy, whom L.L. fuse (when I do not know), returns home from some difficult place of wartime and found living on Lady Manor Street (must be some outside if she finds it there.) Both victims of war will fly away to recover in Nancherrow (wherever you need to “drag off” somewhere in these romantic stories!) <br /> <br /> Great drama.
