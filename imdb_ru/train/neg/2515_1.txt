This film is an abomination, and its creation was to be considered a serious crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great mysteries of filmmaking is why no one has ever made a true film adaptation to this amazing mystery. This is a story about a really exciting puzzle, a cute old-fashioned novel and a dry English humor. Why did the creators have to change Richard Gordon from the Scotland Yard policeman to an amateur detective, present the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant, change part of the storyline about the charge of murder and the circumstances of the Gordon fight to save the accused, etc.? These producers and directors, who always think that they can make a better story than the one in the book, should write the original script themselves, and not force the product of another person.
