This film is about a male escort involved in a murder investigation that occurred in a circle of wives of strong men. <br /> <br /> I thought the “Walker” would be exciting and exciting, but I was wrong. The tempo was painfully and painfully slow, that even after 40 minutes of the film, nothing much happens. Seriously, the first hour can be compressed to ten minutes. That's how slow it is. <br /> <br /> The fact that he lacks thrills or scenes, only increases the boredom. It is almost shocking that even the scenes of the dispute are so simple and devoid of emotions. Could it be because of a stiff upper lip of a higher social class? <br /> <br /> Sadly, “Walker” turns into such a boring mess, despite the strong cast of actors. A bad plot and an even worse move are to blame for everything.
