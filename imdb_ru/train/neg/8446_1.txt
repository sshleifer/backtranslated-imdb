Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can someone tell me where I should have been laughing? There is not a hint or shadow of the idea. The three leading actors are pests, especially the one (I think it is Aldo) from Sicily, who cannot make a Sicilian accent !!! Not to mention the fabulous insertion of Dracula ... just another way, taken from the worst tradition of cabaret, to extend this “movie” a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto are doing everything possible, but this so-called film was really too complicated to save. I would give him a “0” / 10, but the lowest estimate was 1/10, and therefore I had to overestimate it by one rating.
