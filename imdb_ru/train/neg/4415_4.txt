I have always said that some plays, by their nature, simply cannot be transferred to the cinema, and this example is a prime example. <br /> <br /> As a play, this is a very funny farcical catholic satire of the church, with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unrealistic that we have to support it even when she starts to kill her worshipers mistake, admitting that he had not sinned since his last confession, so she feels she sends him straight to heaven). <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how far the reality of the play goes, and it works in the imaginary world of the theater. However, such a heightened reality rarely works in the cinema, and, of course, is not here. <br /> <br /> Directed by Marshall Brickman brought together an excellent team that works great, but presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion comedy becomes a tragedy, and you are left with an empty feeling in the depths of your stomach. <br /> <br /> Look for the production of the play instead; you will not be disappointed.
