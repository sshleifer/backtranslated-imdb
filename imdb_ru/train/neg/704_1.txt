The gentle romance of the sexual exploitation of black women by New Orleans by white men of power and privilege. Ooh. Does it whet your appetite? Well, then jump to VHS or DVD and use this useless trolling through the damn part of the story. For good measure, this is adapted from the book of the famous hacker Anna Rice. The direction is as tempting and melodramatic as the cheerful dialogue. Most of the acting is amateur. The only noteworthy mention is that it involves almost a dozen black actors who were barely involved in today's market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Verin, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some individuals who were barely noticed at all by Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell. This is also, in spite of itself, a sterling showcase for Nicole Ling. Pompous and ponderous James Earl Jones is also at the ready. So, the late Ossi Davis, a minimal talent, owes its success to being associated with the legendary Negro ensemble company. This film must be rated "T" for a scar.
