I was familiar with the fantastic book “Good night, Mr. Tom” for ages, and only recently I had the opportunity to see this adaptation. I heard a lot of positive comments about this, so I had high hopes. When the movie ended, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This film is not very good at all. “Good night, Mr. Tom” was an extremely poor adaptation, and almost 4.5 out of 10 books were missed. In particular, I found that many of the characters and some of the wonderful scenes in the book were not in that. There was not much dialogue there, it was hurried and too fast, but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never saw the connection and love between William Beech and Tom in this film, which was a real disappointment. Casting was not so good either. I thought it might be really good, but it was so different from the book! Extremely bad adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. It deserves a decent remake, which is 1000 times better than this pile of garbage.
