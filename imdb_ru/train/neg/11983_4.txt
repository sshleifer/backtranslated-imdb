Marie Dressler carries this depression-era drama about the benevolent bank owner, who recently aired on TCM during their April comedy fool. If you come with the expectation of a big laugh thanks to the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, as this is a really very depressing film. This is also very poorly done, which is surprising, given that it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's cinematography is from the school “tune the camera and don't move it,” often to the detriment of the film crew that goes off-screen (it’s like panning and a scanned print before it happened!) Or they cut off their heads. The film does not even have a distinguished director, which is based on the fleeting night nature of the production. Overall, this is an unsatisfactory mess, with a dressler often exaggerating and only this whimsical, the last throw of a throw to the bathroom to separate him.
