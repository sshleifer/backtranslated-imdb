This film is one of the most unintentionally bad action movies ever filmed. The Japanese-accented Dolph Friggin 'Lundren is funny enough, but it adds a really trite-friendly action, an eccentric and overly villainous one, a plot of clichéd love interest and one of the worst endings of all time, and you have a rather small suicidal drug for people who enjoy their lives and, until watching “Showdown”, they never intended to kill themselves with a blowtorch. <br /> <br /> I don’t know, it's just me, but all homosexual overtones are not too subtle. There are constant references to the male genitalia, not to the female. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other’s courageous parts, and in fact, before committing suicide, Brandon says to Dolphy: “If we don’t, I want to say that you have the biggest d - . "<br /> <br /> Now, is that what a normal person would say to another person? In the ACTION movie, not less? And do you want them to become your dying words? <br /> <br /> There are later this gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (regarding the villain): "I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy." Brandon: "Man, you have fixation." <br /> <br /> As the guy from RuthlessReviews.com noted: “Unfortunately, Dolph doesn't answer:“ I have a fix? I have a fixation ?! decided that his last words should be about my privates! I'm just going to cut his ears and his nose, dude ". <br /> <br /> This is mercilessly stupid and very fun if you like to receive root canals from unlicensed dentists, without Novocain. It's about the same level. Great fun for all family!
