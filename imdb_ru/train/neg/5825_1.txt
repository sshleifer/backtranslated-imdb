This is supposed to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people leaving the theater, others were falling asleep (well, it was a late night performance) ... This is a film without meaning, one of those that may make you never want to see an extraordinary picture again. I would really like to look at the creation of this film, because I am deeply interested in what the authors of such garbage think. Do they laugh when they create all these ridiculous things, or do they really think they are doing something interesting? Interesting ... The soundtrack is terrible, apart from some instrumental material that reminds you of the previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork music, stay home. This is the best thing to do. Small, tiny pieces of pleasant music - no reason to go out and undergo this torture. The God!...
