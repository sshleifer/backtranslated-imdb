I gave this movie a single star just because it was impossible to give it less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula for reproducing any organism. In their laboratory (an abandoned warehouse in Los Angeles) they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies breaks in to steal the formula, and the rest of the film is one endless pursuit of the legs. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (rubber puppet) is released and begins to destroy the throw. He has an amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without noticing him, and then quickly bites his head off. <br /> <br /> One cast escapes in a police car and spends the rest of the movie behind the wheel. aimlessly around the city. She has such excellent mental abilities that she cannot even control the radio. She never makes any attempt to drive up to a substation or to the donut shop and looks hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> T-Rex wreaks havoc throughout the city, fierce fighting with weapons occurs and buildings (cardboard dummies) explode, but not a single police car, or army, or anyone else appears. Such activities should be routine in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that no continuation is planned.
