The plot was quite interesting, against the background of the Russian revolution. I also liked to see Budapest, as the film was partially shot there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between the two main characters, so it was difficult to believe in the love story between them. Love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirkland was really tough, almost icy. Rob Stewart was rather charming and boyish, so she looked more like his older sister, and not like his girlfriend. The end, when we finally found out who was actually following them, was rather weak and had no meaning. I think I would have liked this movie much better if the relationship between the two actors were a little more reliable.
