I would rate this film as minus 10, but unfortunately it is not offered. <br /> <br /> Why I did not come out in the first five minutes of this film, I can not say. I had to go with my instinct and leave immediately !! Several people in our theater did this, and, unfortunately, I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The plot did not have all the criteria for the film. No plot. Awful game! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that maybe I would never see another film in which he is. I liked the taser scene. It is a pity that it did not shake a little meat in the senselessness of the plot. Someone needs to tease the writer and director of this film!
