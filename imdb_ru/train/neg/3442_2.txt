I shot this film solely on the fact that I liked the cover. However, as soon as the film began, I had regrets. It seems they used a home camcorder to make this film and allowed a small child to do it. They also used irrelevant ghostly faces and forms to try to scare people, but I found myself laughing, I could put it together and make it better. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I felt that these were some really good ideas, but because of the tricky lines and in some cases the actions were overshadowed. He had no direction. <br /> <br /> I did not want to sit through all this, because it caused me physical pain when I watched it, but I always finish what I start, so I take a deep breath and continue. Definitely, 98 minutes of my life is wasted. <br /> <br /> I would have saved myself from embarrassment if I heard that you were watching the Ghost Boat, and would have found something more interesting. I'm a fan of low-budget horror films, but it was a big disappointment, I thought nothing could get worse after Terror Toons, but it made me reconsider. And it goes down to its genre. <br /> <br /> * of ***** (Star - for the ideas that their worst fears will be behind them)
