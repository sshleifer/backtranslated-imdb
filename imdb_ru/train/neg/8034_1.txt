I know that slashers should always be bad, but come on, what the hell is that? This is similar to a group of 10-year-olds who saved their lunch money and started filming it by the end of their week. <br /> <Anyway, six young people all go to the same house to be killed off-screen. We have a clever whore, another whore, a black guy, a murderer, such stereotypes. After one is eaten by shaking the boat, everyone else is being chased by some guy who wears a mask that the people in the poor box have rejected. Somewhere in the middle there is one pretty decent murder, but then it returns to even more boredom and especially to false fears. we actually know that a killer cannot be a killer, because the guy surely loves to spend his sweet time on everything. <br /> <br /> After every character youâ€™ve been expecting dies, the standard ugly blonde and her boyfriend, who will soon become a boyfriend, end up being captured by the killer (they are pushed, pushed and fainted) and the killer reveals himself. I think that the authors of this film simply took a blindfold and a pen and placed it somewhere in the list of characters. The motive is just lame and does not even let me start a damn secret. The killer then, of course, takes the way too much time to explain everything (and then about ten more minutes, during which for some reason he breaks his arm), and in the end he is overpowered by a guy with a gun. Hey, unfair! <br /> <br /> Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could have more fun watching Lindsay Lohan's film, I swear. I mean, of course, most of the 80s slashers also sucked, but at least they added some T & A. film. Nothing happens for that.
