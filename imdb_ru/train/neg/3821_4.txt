What is the worst movie ever made? Gynecological nightmare "Screams and whispers"? Acid psychodrama Fassbinder? Black comedy "Last House" on the left? I’m sure that for that part of the film-loving public that links its masts with the good ship Buster Keaton, there is only one answer - any of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I don’t know that this film had a more piercing effect on my soul - the basis of Kiton’s complex and extensive physical work on an obscene farce; the agonizing wobble of this chief director with dialogue is not that he does not have a beautiful, comic voice, or that he cannot make the dialogue ridiculous; it’s just that the studio doesn’t seem to have given him enough duplicates, and therefore he seems to be trying to remember his lines before he delivers what he does - Keaton, and not his character, looks silly; or is it the humiliation of Keaton in a tasteless sexual farce when he gave us some of the richest stories of romantic frustration in the film? <br /> <br /> No, I know what was most disturbing is the need to watch Buster Keaton, the greatest comedian in the cinema, to sit on the sidelines to watch Jimmy Durante make his game. These are the horrors that make Dantes make up his Infernos. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have come up with a curious idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to sound is to turn him into Brother Marx, complete with verbal pedantry, complicated, tedious “clowning”, chambolic farce, theatrical production, triumph through the chaos and thelma todd. Keaton was simply not such a comedian, and where the evil language of Groucho and the joyful opportunism could just make this plot work, the socially inept professor Buster cannot, he is too studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was allowed for experiments, such as Lang in M ​​or Rene Claire; he would never try to hold the tide, like Chaplin. When a film like “The General” is hinted that he is busy with trains, the loss becomes even more obvious. <br /> <br /> And the fact is that the film is not so bad when it’s stained against the background of the flat direction - there is a great push when the camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at the train station; and the denouement, if the original is unlikely, at least more alive than before. In the way Keaton slows down the plot, he needs something very pleasant, and he needs all the possibilities that he can get. <br /> <br /> There is a film about loneliness, emotionally paralyzing order, stunning effects of education, etc., about how to deal with it. The best way to evaluate this film is to watch not the story of Professor T.Z. Fasting, and the exhausted genius of Buster Keaton, who was imprisoned by mediocrity, entangled by new technologies, mocking the evil fate (in this case, the studio), while maintaining the stoic grace. In this view, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
