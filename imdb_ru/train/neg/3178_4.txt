With these films, you know that you get the usual ghost jokes. Eve is pretty funny as a ghost. And other actors also do a good job. This direction and history, which is not enough. This could be missed if the jokes worked better. The only problem is that there are not so many jokes. Of course, I laughed a couple of times. In addition to the talking parrot in the film was not a drop of creativity. I blame the director for not taking full advantage of this premise. Eve, of course, has the comedic ability to show more, but she was not able to do it. In general, this film is perfect for Sunday. In addition, it can be skipped completely.
