I liked the movie a bit, despite the frantic pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as the North of Montana. This is definitely NOT Montana North and never will be. Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and this is one of the reasons why. Stop teaching the children of the United States to think that they own the planet. Such a centrist worldview does not become one of the great nations of the world. Even as a joke. I would never call the USA "Alberta South." Walt would never have humiliated us, so why start now? In addition, the film was pretty stupid, next time lucky.
