Worst movie since Open Water. Do not be surprised if you completely miss this movie after the release date, as I am sure that it will not bring much success at the box office. This film had a big potential, but it fell to a minimum. There is a lack of character development, clumsy actors and the reverse side of this film was nude. Buffer. Amazing. If I had to watch this movie again, I would go to the DELIVERY myself. <<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<$ <<<<<<< <<<<<<<
