I quote the film: “It's better not to know. Better to forget anyway. Best to give up. ” Oh, the irony. <br /> <br /> The ghost story with all the technical improvements of a Hollywood horror film, but a terribly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film, and you feel that you are preaching from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It is as if the dialogue of the writers were summed up by the bad cop and the Jerry Springer show. Maybe it is suitable for a movie like “Hitcher,” and not for a horror movie set in Russia. The result is that the potentially gorgeous setting and some potentially gorgeous scenes with blood are lost and just become stupid and not scary or meaningful.
