“House of the Dead” was the worst film I've ever seen, between the pitiful “matrix” attempts of a 360-degree camera review and a fun action that I fell asleep. I do not think that the director and director could decide whether it is raining or not, because it will rain on one side of the boat and not on the other. I would rate this movie as 1 out of 10 (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Jumping from a movie into a game was also annoying, and it makes you wonder whether they simply compensate for the loss of time. I ask anyone who reads this, DO NOT SEE IT. It is not worth the time.
