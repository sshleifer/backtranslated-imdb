With the unbridled success of the Army of God, every Mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a film now. In the case of the recent “Other Side of Paradise” this was not at all a bad thing. This film, though not great, was pretty good. “Solitude for singles,” however, is not. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of a young divorced Mormon guy who returned to solitary life, writing and shooting from Solitude for Singles, in many Paths, very similar to the 80s comedy Ferris Bueller's Weekend. However, this is where the similarities end. While Ferris Bueller was funny, original and well-played (how stupid such comedies are), “The Singles Ward” is the exact opposite. He tries hard to be funny. However, 90% of the gags are either falling, or are cliches and jokes that you have probably heard a million times before. The remaining 10% seems to be added to fill the time. And the action, although not terrible, is at best astonishing. <br /> <br /> Also, if you are not a Mormon, or are very, very well acquainted with the culture of Mormons, you are unlikely to get anything at all. Considering that the “Army of God” and “The Other Side of Heaven” were attractive to a wide range of viewers, both inside and outside the Mormon church, this film is certainly one big internal joke, and even if you get it, just not so funny
