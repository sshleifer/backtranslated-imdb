I saw this movie when it was first released. Memories of how everything was bad, stayed with me for almost forty years. I did not want to trust my own feelings for the film when I saw it, so I turned to a review of the film published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day - the mood was confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the film was inconsistent, illegible and boring that the producer was the husband of the star Leslie Caron, so the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning of this terrible film. The list of many capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grame and James Sikking - shows that there are promises in it. But the death of this film is due to its terrible scenario. The mysterious mystery is so unclear and so little revealed in the film that the viewer remains puzzled from scene to scene. It seems that the film is torn between a detective mystery and a spy thriller, but never stops at one or the other. The sense of expectation is completely absent. The main characters prefer to play dry, unfeeling characters who do not cause sympathy. Pedestrian cinematography. As a result, the unfortunate viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot, and, ultimately, the film itself. I'm a little surprised that there is no version of this pitiful film available for purchase. I hope that if TCM finds an imprint of this film and finds it necessary to show it on the air, it will be safely sent at 4:00 in the morning.
