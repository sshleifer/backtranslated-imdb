Well, it will be a short and pleasant review ... Something that the film should have put into practice, and made its life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie costs $ ^ @%. There is a compelling reason that there was a petition with over 40,000 signatures + ALL demanding that Uwe Boll stop making films from franchises that people liked. Bloody Rain was there a celebrity. <br /> <br /> Jokes are good ... if you have never heard them a thousand times. The game is acting, but in fact only the script can be blamed for this. I even wonder for a few minutes if they use the script. <br /> <br /> The film has nothing to do with the original games. Hi, if you played games, you know that the main character has no real motivation, except for such murderous motives as a massacre, because he kicked or faked. Too many stories for such a stupid movie. as i said. I haven't even stolen this movie. And for a person who says that this is “The Funniest Movie of 2007” .......... you need to look around, the news is better than this one.
