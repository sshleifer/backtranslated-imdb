Wow ... what would you do with 33 million dollars? Let me give you a choice; you can either: a) cut it and flush it down the toilet, or b) make a movie based on the premise of Whoopi Goldberg, like a futuristic policeman with a hard nut in partnership with a rubber dinosaur that uses terms like “I don’t invigorate the pipe” blowing raspberry on the grounds that it is ridiculous. That's right, you would choose an option that has more merit - flush to the toilet. <br /> <br /> You need to believe this. I can't even find the words to describe how bad this film is. It doesn't even fit into the “so bad - it's good” category. In fact, I am writing this on TV, and while watching it, I felt the need to go into IMDb and register my disgust. <br /> <br /> Given that the Jurassic Park was created a couple of years ago, how did this actually happen? Do they think that the audience will endure a man wearing a rubber suit? WG should have just walked and cursed the consequences. All interested parties will go to hell for this criminal waste of money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm going to explode.
