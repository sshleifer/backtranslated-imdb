Lorenzo Lamas acts in the role of Jack "The Soldier" Kelly, a former Vietnamese vet and renegade police officer who sets off to find and destroy the mission in order to save his sister from the bush of bushmen. The brutal film is made so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo is billed for the third time, but he has 3 minutes of screen time, and even that is not very good. In general, the film is terrible, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell, hanging from the tree in bags and gagged, are worth a few (unintentional) laughter. Following the improvement of the sequel.
