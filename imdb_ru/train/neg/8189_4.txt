It is always hard to have a brother in your life better than you, always struggling to get out of this shadow and not allow bitterness to keep you away from your family. So imagine that your older brother is Santa, and then imagine how difficult it should be. This is the premise. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays the titled Fred, an embittered loser who spends a lot of energy, making sure that people do not go around, expecting something to happen to him, or donating his brother. Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for being just a fussy, eager for fame, a bit creepy guy that Fred would like to portray him. Then, don't you know, Fred needs financial help, and therefore he has to fill it up by helping his brother on the eve of Christmas. It turns out fun and life lessons. <br /> <br /> Well, that is as it should be. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie that shows some good moments from Vaughn's patented quick talk, a ridiculous moment from a music video out of nowhere, Kevin Spacey plays an auditor to end Santa's operation (and he is one of the weakest villains time), not enough gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a luxurious Christmas attire, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elven attire (to be honest, although he is the highlight) and the movie, which is too floating in bitterness to feel ebya good seasonal fare, but at the same time too bold in the second half to feel funny to make fun of all the bad things about the commercialism of the time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weiss is also ready to go, just like Kathy Bates, but it's really nothing more than a film for Vaughn, and if you like his style, you will find something here that you enjoy. Unfortunately, there is very little to recommend this seasonal smelly. Outside of Won's rant, the script hardly throws up anything decent, with the exception of one particularly good scene, including a fun support group that tackles a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> David Dobkin’s referral is as mediocre and balanced as the 20p Christmas card you send to your aunt you haven’t seen for 10 years, and he seems to think that a simple combination of ingredients without a good combination or thorough care guarantees delicious Christmas pudding. No, we get a burnt, soft piece with too much sugar on top. Forget about it and put on a fun elf again if you want a great modern Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> Look if you want: Santa Claus 2, Santa Baby, Santa Claus 3: Article about salvation
