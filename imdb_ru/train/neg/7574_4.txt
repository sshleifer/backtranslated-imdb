But he has good actions and a plot that is somewhat interesting. Nevsky behaves like a bodybuilder, and he is not so attractive, in fact, IMO, he is Ugly. (his acting skills lack everything!) Joanna Pakula played Sasha very well, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character needed to be developed. There are too many men in this story, no romance, too many actions and too stupid an end. This is very cruel. However, I really liked the scenery, this film takes you around the world, and this is a bonus. I also liked that there was something about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough for it to get my attention. The actors were supposed to be more beautiful ... The biggest problem I encountered was that Nevsky was too normal, not sexy enough. I think that for most guys Sasha will be hot enough, but for us, the lady who are fans of action, Nevsky simply does not want to do that. In general, this film was good, I did not like it and did not hate it, I just found it to be another normal action movie.
