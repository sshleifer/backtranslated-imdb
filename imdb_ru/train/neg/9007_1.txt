This movie is one of the worst crap I've ever seen. I literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. CGI was terrible, and the story was just a waste. Dean Kane's character was Mr. Super-Intuitive, I can find out everything, except that he seems to be unable to work properly on his own helicopter. The biggest problem was the operation of a split-screen camera. I felt that I was watching “Brady Bunch” or something like that, only there were no different people in the boxes, just close ups and different views on the same thing. I can only assume that the actors really needed money, because this film was not worth the film on which it was shot.
