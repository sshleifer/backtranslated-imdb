Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. This is rare, but you should not hunt it. This robbery of the Italian jaw means almost nothing, and the rest does not make sense. The Alligator is not at all convincing, and many of the minor plots are not going anywhere. If it’s in a local video store, you can watch it if you’re a fan of monster movies, but it’s not worth looking for.
