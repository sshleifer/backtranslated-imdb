One of the worst romantic comedies (no, worst films) I've ever seen. The boy (who works as a psychic on the phone!) Must pretend to be gay in order to move to the apartment with the woman of his dreams. Fun does not follow. Boredom, easy beating of gays and terrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and love his crappy dialogue, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. if you see it, destroy the copy.
