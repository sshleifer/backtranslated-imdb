In the roles of the 1980s, guest stars of television films and serials (Misty Row, Pamela Hemsley, Klevon Little, Seymour Cassel and many others) in the history of a photographer who dreams of killing his models. Of course, models and other people begin to appear dead, causing all sorts of complications. <br /> <br /> For a not very good thriller, there is enough nudity and violence to get an R rating, but not enough good material to generate any real interest. This is best described as a movie that gave the Cinemax cable channel the alternative name Skinamax. I really see no point in watching this if you donâ€™t need to see every dirty thriller. (I also have to comment on the fact that this film is filled with smoking, to the extent that it becomes funny when someone lights up)
