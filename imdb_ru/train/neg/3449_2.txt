Fortunately, there is not a single video about this western imitator when he stayed afloat for the Big Frank while his career hesitated. The story of a weasel who lives by the reputation of his elder brother in arms and whom the bad guys rush out of the city only to return to rally their citizens with a new found courage must be written by the writer from the back room. In general, this show stinks. The story is mostly boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your mind. I have to completely move away from another reviewer who found this "... unappreciated ..." Critics clapped him at the time and deservedly so. You should catch this in the last show if you are late and have a fit of insomnia. But, if you can survive this, you have more stamina than most of my cinema friends.
