Bob Clampett's Porky's Poor Fish is a so-so cartoon, populated with terrible puns and one or two pleasant moments. Located in the Porky's Fish Shoppe, Porky's Poor Fish occupies an uncomfortable area between the standard black and white cartoon whipping and one of the Merrie melody books that came alive, which were popular at the time. Typical of many early Porky cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a rather unnatural opening musical number and the climax of the film. The rest of the time, the star is a hoarse cat who sees the fish store as an opportunity to eat for free, but receives more than he expected. Unfortunately, viewers get much less than expected. As sometimes happened in a series of books about life, the focus was on signs that could work just as well in a non-animated environment. There is not much laughter, and, despite the fact that the cartoon is almost saved by Clampettâ€™s energetic leadership, very little can be recommended in Porky Poor Fish compared to other early Porki cartoons.
