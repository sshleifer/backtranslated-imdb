Imagine a scene where several screenwriters sit at the table and say: "Let a black woman come up to an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) on the street and ask him if he is black and then leave." Other authors fall into hysterical laughter until one suggests repeating it in each episode. More laughter Now, if you think that the premise is funny, and the show contains many similar situations, you will love this show. Otherwise, use your zipper and find something more interesting, for example, how the paint will dry. Those who wrote glowing reports about this show should either go out more or be forced to watch really funny TV comedies. Another example of humor in the series - the girl is trying to pay at the supermarket checkout, trying to hypnotize the cashier. The first time is ridiculous, but why repeat it again and again at different shows with different tellers? I could give other examples, but they could be regarded as spoilers, telling why this comedy is not at all funny.
