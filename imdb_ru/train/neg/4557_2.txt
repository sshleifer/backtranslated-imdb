OK, very rarely do I complain that I got it for FREE. So I think this film pushed me to this limit. I saw this at the Hollywood cemetery for FREE and left very disappointed. The question of one of the spectators to the director about the use of references to the Indians simply as “bookends” instead of better squeezing into the film, basically says everything that this film failed. <br /> <br /> NATIONAL LINKS TO ITSELF --- Links to the Indians seemed really out of place and far-fetched. Obviously, this director and writer tried to tackle an arena in which they had never played before. They should stick to the old adage “write about what you know.” If they actually understand this, it was certainly not shown in the film, or the beauty of this unique culture did not receive due justice. <br /> <br /> Cliche and on the nose --- I agreed to watch this film on the grounds that it was an indie. So I held higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was indie and saw her before she became so popular. Even before it went on sale, I had already raved about how it would be a hit. Unfortunately, I could not say the same thing about the "shelf life." "Sunshine" led us to the cliché, but the filmmakers were so clever in their approach that the result would take us in another direction, avoiding the cliché trap. This film, on the other hand, could not help but fall into the trap, because it was already trapped from the very beginning. Pranks psychomams, a pair of Hendrix, etc. I don’t like to say this, but the best and worst movie I have seen this year was an indie film. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best, and this film is the worst. I would like to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the directors for meeting so well with their relatives at the cemetery.
