This film looked like it might be good in the beginning, but never justified its expectations. The director is talented and has good perspectives and artistic ideas (typical of Asian directors), but he doesnâ€™t know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it. The story was fragmented and seemed to go in different directions throughout the film, without finding a solid, understandable and interesting angle. In fact, the film never fit in the explanations of press releases. The game was very good, however. All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was outstanding, as he always is. It is a pity that he decided to make such a weak film.
