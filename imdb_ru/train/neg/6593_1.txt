Even if it were funny, this moldy wax film would still be soberingly disrespectful. Stop, unless you dig up the corpses of boys and do not reproduce "Weekend at Bernie" ?? but just what ?? producer Larry Harmon and director of cursed Ernest films hold copyright as a pretext to shame the whole story of Stan and Ollie Gaylard Sartain makes an honest imitation of Ollie, but Bronson Pinchot does not reach tenth place in the contest of Stan's doubles; even if they were both in the film, they would be no less disgusting. The less said about the surrounding disaster, the better. Makes "Utopia" look like a decent swan song.
