I just watched The Incredible Melting Man a second time, and it was even more boring than when I first watched it. I do not understand why he became such a "cult classic" when he was so boringly boring. The opening scene looks promising when a nurse throws a can of blood and runs after her life. After that, all that is actually happening is a melting man who wanders through forests and houses, remembering his life as an astronaut. The makeup is pretty good, and his melting sticky face looks pretty realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a manâ€™s head into a river, and it floats until it reaches a waterfall, where it falls on rocks and is torn. Although we have nothing to get wet, most of the scenes are shot in the dark, and you cannot see what is happening. There is not much blood, at least on the Vipco DVD, which I watched. <br /> <br /> No, The Incredible Melting Man is not so great. I will give him estimates for the cheese factor, but that's all. If you want a TRUE science fiction / horror classic, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
