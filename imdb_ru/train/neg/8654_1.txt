The film was completely misleading, and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was the “Heart of Darkness” plagiarism by Joseph Conrad, the river is being replaced by the road, and the boat is turned into a jeep, and Walter Kurz - into Osama. <br /> The statements made on the outside of the DVD box were a clear fraud to <br /> <br /> accept this fabricated death of a journalist and present it as an actual <br /> <br /> in while in some parts there are muslims supporting the 9/11 terrorist attacks to ensure that the usa treats muslims around the world. <br /> <br /> I warned the video store that the film should be removed from the Documentary section and placed in a war zone. for quasi-fictional reports of real events.
