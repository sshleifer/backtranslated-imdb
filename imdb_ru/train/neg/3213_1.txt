Well, I can honestly say that I first saw a film in which there was literally no meat or potatoes. The whole movie felt like it was just a salad without a main course. The storyline was prone to errors and laughter, the characters were one-dimensional, realism was outside the window, and the animation was done by four-year-old children. Does it cover it? I have never been more embarrassed by the concept in my whole life. I have never read comics or seen other programs with this character, but judging from other reviews, I do not shy away from my observations. <br /> <br /> For a start, the story was moving too fast. For someone who is new to this character and situations, I need to integrate more into the creation of causes, and not in finding a solution. I saw other Animes (if you could call it Animes) that do great things with their characters, because they spend time developing them. The Lady of Death was not allotted. In a few short scenes, we see her train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive little creature of Hell. It was hard for me to swallow, given the moments before she was presented as this weak and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly she sinks into hatred and can fight with existence that has existed for millions of years. It was absurd. Lady Death's view was poor, to say the least. It seemed to me that she was nothing more than a lively character, and not a desperate woman with revenge in her mind. It just didn't work for me. She was nothing more than a candy for boys in the pre-pubertal age, who wanted to pamper themselves with such huge amounts of skin that she suddenly built up on her chest during workouts with Cremator. Oh, I felt bad when I looked at her. The same goes for the character Cremator. Who was this random person? The explanations they gave were not enough, and instead I remained more incoherent than actual development. This is a very sad day in hell when we give up characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated film. <br /> <br /> Then Lucifer himself appeared. Let me just say that I think I can fight the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was ridiculous, and he simply did not represent the image that I had in my mind. As if Disney controlled the situation and wanted to make it a semi-PC. He lacked the darkness and wicked nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the ruler of Hell, but simply a lackey who had more room to live. Speaking of life or death, how can you die in hell again? It was a concept that definitely needed additional explanation. Most of the characters were worried about death when they did not even consider the option that they were already dead. That's how they got to hell. I think it was this level of thinking that destroyed the film for me. I did not quite understand that your soul is still in a solid body in hell, but can it be only me ?? or maybe it is because there was no development in this story. Nothing was built, only prepared. <br /> <br /> The battles were hysterically bad. The animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s. There was nothing impressive about how this film was drawn. Why are we, America, so behind animation? He is huge in Asia and he is creeping hardcore because we continue to make films such as "Lady Death" that do not challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap, and this film shows it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was bad. Animation combined with terrible voice acting was cheap. I had a thought somewhere that this film has been out of production for a long time, which is difficult to understand, because I think I could have shot this film on my credit card. The production was terrible, like the story. Nothing was worked out, leaving huge gaping holes in the plot, into which almost everyone fell. The strength of the characters was missing, and nothing was explained. I wasted my time with this and would like to warn others that when Death really did come, you would not be in my condition and would not regret spending 80 minutes on this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Rating: * of *****
