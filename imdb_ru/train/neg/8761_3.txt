My girlfriend has a habit of going to a blockbuster and choosing films that no one has ever heard of. True, sometimes it led to some funny discoveries. Often the best that can be said is that they definitely run an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> She brought home the “Tip from the Caterpillar”. She was excited because the box said it was funny. Fortunately for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This film was an exercise in patience. This is one of those films where, if you are not a fanciful and shallow person who likes to watch movies about yourself, you will hate every character in the film. Before the appearance of one nice character. In which the leading annoying pretentious character falls in love and will act in such a way that in the real world someone will drive away. <br /> <br /> FOLLOWING SPOILERS HERE <br /> <br /> Thus, a group of emotionally stupid, intoxicated, pretentious artists vow to love and find success in their careers. Then they meet a cute, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (almost perfect guy). Then we observe how a woman, annoyingly pretentious artist (she is 30 years old?), Loses consciousness, falling in love. Therefore, she tries to run away from a sweet, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with a married man with whom she had excellent, but empty sex. She is rude with a man and does her best to drive him away. In the real world, she would be pretty successful. Of course, I wanted to run away from her, and I didn’t even have any relationship with her! <br /> <br /> Although it's nice that this man “fought for his love,” I never wanted her to have it. (And my girlfriend) She did not deserve it. And why am I wondering if the director thought that the “almost perfect guy” should be punished by the need to win a relationship with her? When the artist asked the “almost perfect guy” to leave, we shouted for him too. There is a problem with the film when the heroine of the film is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want her to fail. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Andy Dick even laughed at me several times, although his character was also pretentious to annoyance. As for the other characters, they were well-acting, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy, and I can say that I laughed several times in the film. Unfortunately, not much laughter happened before the last 10 minutes or so. But by the time I laughed at it, I had prayed too long for the film to end. I needed to get rid of these meaningless characters from my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch people you hate fight with love for people they don’t deserve, then this film is for you.
