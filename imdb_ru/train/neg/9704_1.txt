Well, if you have a couple of hours to spend, or if you just hate your life, I would say, watch this movie. Anyway, it's good for a few laughs. You have not only obese, topless Aboriginal people, but special effects so bad that they are probably banned in most states. Seriously, the PG rating is also quite funny when you see Native Porn Extravaganza. I would not give this film to my backward nephew. You could not even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy, and clich√©, and stupid, and stupid. The game is terrible, and the ending is so painful to watch how I actually started pouring salt into my eyes, just to distract from the idiocy that fills the TV screen.
