I gave him 2 instead of 1 because I think Wongo Wild Women is worse. This exercise is patience. Itâ€™s like brushing your teeth bad hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic. There, of course, there is no acting skills (although the shark has a quality dialogue). We are not surprised at anything. We do not know how people got where they went. I always wonder how such things are released. I agree with the previous writer that this is not even funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes, and it takes so much space in the DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad picture you bought from starving artists. It covers a crack in the wall.
