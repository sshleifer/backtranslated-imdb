A dull house with a haunted thriller discovers that the American family is moving to a 200-year-old house in Japan, where a violent, murderous love triangle has occurred. <br /> <br /> The romance of the novel is the only element of interest in this very slow horror film directed by Motel Hell. The film creates zero ambiguity and consists of a few choppy scenes that rarely seem to lead anywhere else in general. <br /> <br /> One obvious example is a rather early scene, when a leading man visits a temple after realizing that his house is often frequented, as the monk had previously warned. The monk tells the story of the house (with which the viewer is already familiar with the order of discovery), and then the film simply breaks away from something else. Previously, the monk offered to help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house, as things get worse and worse, and nothing is said about the monk almost to the very end, when he reappears to do what he had to do an hour earlier - try to exhaust the spirit away from home , although by this time the audience will not care. <br /> <br /> There are some (probably) unintended funny laughs when American actors eventually become obsessed with Japanese spirits and suddenly start practicing bad martial arts, I say, probably because the scene is more than a bit like a duel with a chainsaw from the motel of the same director "Motel Ada", which more obviously should have been funny, but in general it is a forgetful deception.
