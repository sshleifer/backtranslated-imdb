This film is lame and not at all funny. The plot doesn't even make sense. Some scientist working on the outskirts of science opens the door to another dimension (maybe hell ???), and his daughter experiences it or something, then once, for no apparent reason, she comes back, and now she has big breasts and wears scanty attire (I suppose the demons in another dimension did it for her?) on this witch's book of spells (they want to be witches or something like that ???), and an evil spell ends up reading it again, that's how evil demon comes on earth, which obviously can be stopped only by the best girl in a bikini and a rejected lover boy. For no reason, there is a topless scene, and the guy in him who, according to my boyfriend, is a famous wrestler, but his role is completely unnecessary, itâ€™s obvious that they came up with something to just put him into it, because then, maybe , wrestling fans will really watch this meaningless movie, I'm sure that topless there doesn't hurt either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the film, I thought that it might help explain what was going on, but in fact it only confused things. Who are these people and what are they doing? In fact, this is a film about how to make a trip, and then fight with a monster, but there are a lot of things (for example, another dimension and bookseller) that don't confuse. I did not like the movie, but it was only five bucks. I do not recommend watching it, although it was too stupid, I cannot think of any part of the film that would be good.
