Alfred Hitchcock is by no means my favorite director, but imagine what he could do about it! The plot has a lot of potential for waiting. John Garfield is almost always great, and Raymond Massey is very pushy. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady, but the cast is big and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, it starts to sag quite early. Too many matches. And the important topic is trivialized in that in the end it turns into something more than just a love story. <br /> <br /> Garfield, Massey and the performers are fun to watch. But this is not very good.
