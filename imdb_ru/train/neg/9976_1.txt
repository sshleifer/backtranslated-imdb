In the first scene of “Problem Child”, the child urinates into the nun's face. For this movie it is witty. Ugly, mean "comedy", she is inept on so many levels that she does not believe. John Ritter is a kind father who adopts a child from hell and thanks him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one note, annoying performances and children's humor. And what the hell is Jack Warden doing in this mess? The film was shot by director Dennis Dugan and is disgusting in his attempts to include sentimentality, when it is done with rudeness, the film is made so bad that it is a rather strange experience. But do not pay attention to all this. The highlight of all this is Michael Oliver, the most disgusting and unlikely childish actor ever to come to the screen ?? Believe me, you want to hit him right in the mouth.
