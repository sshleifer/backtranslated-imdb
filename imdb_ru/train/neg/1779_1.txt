It could have been a wonderful story based on the ancient races of feline humans, but it’s not. <br /> <br /> This job could be just that; amazing and replete with mythological references that supported my admiration. The main characters (Charles Brady, played by Brian Krause; and his mother, Mary, played by Alice Krieg) were shallow, had no personality and were unlikely to be cute or painted. Even the character Mädchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson) does not fit this description. <br /> <br /> However, as I have said many times before, when you adapt Stephen King’s novel to television, you just have to take into account the fact that his books are not written for television, and his script to talent, Unfortunately, there is not enough fire and depth, which he shows as a writer. <br /> <br /> This is another unsuccessful attempt to write the magic of Stephen King, whether it be his novels or the original script. Just cut and paste your work on a small screen. His novels get completely killed in the process, and all you end up creating is a good movie; not less, but certainly not more. His scripts are amazing and missing. Sorry, this translation of the script has been missed. <br /> <br /> Sorry, sorry, sorry movie. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 1.0 / 10 from the ... <br /> <br /> monster :.
