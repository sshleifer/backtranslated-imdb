Words really can't describe how bad this film is. I thought Zandali was bad, but at least he had some good shots and a good moment of stroking his chin from time to time to keep you awake. This is ridiculous! Awful script, bad leadership, terrible game and you know what? I can't think of anything to recommend about it, except for the fact that it is not too long. If you want to have fun for 100 minutes, order from a dentist and work with the root canal - much nicer and much more profitable (if you need it!). By the way, I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. IT'S HORRIBLE!
