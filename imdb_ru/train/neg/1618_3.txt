I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I saw the previous film by Jacques (“The Penguin March”) and heard a very positive review of him on the radio. However, I was very disappointed. Most of all this movie is terribly boring. Literally NOTHING happens. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both laughed, because I could only stumble into things like “well, then winter, and then spring, and then an eagle, a river, and once”. dark, and the girl goes into the cave, and another time the fox gives birth to children, "and so on. After about half an hour, I began to sigh, yawn, roll my eyes, curse the reviewer at the radio station and hope that it would end soon. But the movie went on and on. When it finally ended, I plunged so deep into my chair that I looked like Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the film are (a) a girl who is clearly there to give the children someone who you can identify with. She wears one the same clothes for long and the entire film (one year) and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness. She is cute, there is no doubt about it. Nevertheless, a film about the beauty of nature, like this one, would be better without her being too human. I was constantly hoping that a bear can eat it, drown in a river or something just as terrible. (b) The comment of an adult girl’s voice that tells us only minor, obvious, boring, unnecessary things. (c) Music that desperately lacks subtlety. When a girl happily jumps, the music jumps too. When the eagle is threatened by a fox, the music also becomes threatening. It reminded me of the very first days of film making, and was too predictable to enjoy. Admittedly, many of the children who watched the movie with me clearly liked it, at least in some way they intervened. Thus, my warning applies only to adults: if you are over ten, avoid this film. You can get better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.
