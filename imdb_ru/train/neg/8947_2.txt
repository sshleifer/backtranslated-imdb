The book is fantastic, this film is not. There is no reason why this film could not cover the futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, the full review was released a few years later, and it worked well, even the groovy orange, released in the 70s, did a good job of creating a futuristic world. Dark German expressionist colors, black and white footage from vision screens - there is no reason for this approach when the film was shot in 1984. The main character - in the writing of white-collar, but dressed as if working with butter. and lubricate in the garage. In this film, he decides to use a communist-imitation approach to creating design, atmosphere, and theme, but the novel does not necessarily dictate the very theme of the communists who worship the humble worker. This book is in serious need of adaptation in the modern context, since this book is more relevant today than ever. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this shit. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, it seems that this film was created in order to deny a sense of realism or believability when this is exactly what is needed to convey the message of the novel to the viewer.
