When I saw the cover of this film, the first thing I thought was that it was made for video. The second thing that came to mind was how it looked in another horrible film, Falls of Darkness, a story about this stupid witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was quite a masterpiece compared to this bunch of rubbish, and this film should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a little story about a witch, or rather, as a meaningless acquaintance with two young children who are going to meet the tooth fairy in the hope that she will give them a new shiny bike for their teeth. The opening is filmed badly, and, like the entire film, it is certainly not scary. Currently a film about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter rents out his house, his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West) and her daughter Cole come there to stay. Cole meets a neighbor child, and they talk about the Tooth Fairy and how you shouldn’t lose your tooth, otherwise she will come for you. Unfortunately, after a few seconds, the Tooth Fairy seems to be stealing her bike and knocking out her tooth (Ironically). Will Cole be able to survive the anger of the Tooth Fairy, and whether her mother and Peter can save her and stir up their romance ... this is a bad movie, you can probably understand it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this idiotic film is how uncertain the Tooth Fairy is. They say she will kill you if you lose your tooth, but no. It looks more like a serial killer who kills at random, and if you lose your tooth, you will definitely leave. She steals a bike, so apparently she is also a thief. Earlier, I said that the idea of ​​this film is based on the “Waterfall of Darkness”, but where did they come from for the appearance of the “Tooth Fairy”? We'll see. She looks like a burn victim, and she used to go around the neighborhood, killing children. Hmmm ... it's almost as if she is Freddy Kruger's plagiarism from the movie "A Nightmare on Elm Street." And this is not the worst part of this terrible mess, the climax. This film may have the most ridiculous climax (not literally ridiculous, because I found it more disgusting than funny) that I have ever seen. I do not see it. <br /> <br /> Just little things. Lochlyn Munro was in “Dreadful Cinema”, and Gianna Ballard was in “Dreadful Movie 3”, and both of them were in it, so, obviously, the stars of “Dreadful Cinema” are forced to end their bad scary movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 80 minutes P for violence.
