I watched this movie on the Sneak Preview preview, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This film is just disgusting. He is full of wild and farting jokes and is not proud of the sequence of actions (such as a shootout in "Little Germany"). I made a small list of things that I liked about the film ... and with many of which I disagreed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. Fart jokes. 3. Poop joking. 4. The dude was pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. Taliban 7. Mocking Bush again. WE GET THAT HE IS IDIOT. 8. The guy has blond hair. 9. The plot. 10. Murder of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the actors were just insults, and there. <br /> <br /> Now (a few) good <br /> <br /> 1 The dude uses the cat as a silencer, like in a game. 2. A lot of action. 3. Crotchy made a refund (and the cameo creator of the Postal) 4. Hmm .. I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are a few “what is it” moments? <br /> <br /> Ball did it again. He turned another shitty game into an adaptation of the film. Glory to you, Mr. Ball. 2/10
