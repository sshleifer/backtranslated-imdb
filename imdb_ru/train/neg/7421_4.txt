Watching beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most amazing pleasures that an average movie gives me. Thus, “House on Carroll Street” was not a waste of time, although the story is made up, and the script is boring and somewhat annoying. <br /> <br /> There are many allusions to Hitchcock’s different paintings, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the lead role. She is dressed as Grace Kelly, and she is not far off. It's my pleasure. But her character is not convincing. The way she is presented to the public, she must be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined period of time, true events and a specific problem. But the story degenerates in the first minutes into the sad story of crime with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable since the actors play well, as do photography and set design. <br /> <br /> The finale at the Central Station in New York is breathtaking. It starts in the underground section and then rises to the roof. The film can be commended for the good use of architecture.
