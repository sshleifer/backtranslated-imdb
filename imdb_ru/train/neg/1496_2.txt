“Evil Breed” is a very strange slasher film, which, unfortunately, is useless. The beginning of the film seems promising, but overall it’s a disaster. The dialogue is pretty bad, but not as bad as acting. Acting is cruel and unbearable. characters deliver horrible lines, and even if it is on purpose, the method does not work, because characters become annoying. Some killings are innovative, but it took too long to get them. After about half an hour in the movie, we get the first death (except at the beginning), and then almost all the other characters smoke for the next five minutes. Then the film turned into a kind of parody with ridiculous looking characters, unrealistic karate-like fights and a scene in which a person pulls his intestines out of his * scrape. Nothing funny, it's just funny. The film then becomes terribly awful and meaningless. Most characters become clichéd even by slasher standards and as solid as Ter remains on the counter for 5 days. Evil breed is not even ridiculously bad, so it does not cope with its main task. Watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Before Dawn, or "See No Evil" for the real killer.
