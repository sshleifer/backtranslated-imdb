I wonder what the people who gave it 10 saw in it, which I did not do. This film is VERY difficult to follow the plot and / or stay on it. If someone tells you that this is a comedy, do not be fooled, this is about 98% of a strange drama and 2% of comedy. All the actors perform in a magnificent performance that cannot be denied, but it seems that he really lost something. I donâ€™t know if the original script was good and needed to be edited or how. It had potential, and instead it was really a failure. I would like very much an hour and a half ago I invested money in this film, but the video rental does not return on time. Save your money and see something else.
