I agree with most Colombo fans that this film was an unnecessary format change. Colombo is a unique policeman with unorthodox police methods. This film looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective drama from the past. And this is an alarming moment, because Colombo is no ordinary detective. <br /> <br /> In this film there are two parts that intrigued me. Firstly, I can not understand the name of this film. This is misleading. Perhaps the best name would be “The Vanishing Bride” or something like that. Secondly, Colombo hides evidence, without offering a reason (at least to the audience) why he does it. <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayed, just disappointed. I am glad that Peter Falk returned to the usual Colombo. <br /> <br />
