Although the fact that I am one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me a wise understanding, I know quite a lot about what was there for the first time ... and what happened on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of the incoming novice and was very pleased. it was funny, sexy, obscene, all the main requirements of the movie about entry. You have to remember that it was shot and released before everyone else: the house of animals, pork, etc., so in its own way this film really outpaced its time. for whatever reason, the film was handed over to the main distributors, who edited half of the original film, and then edited it in (should I say “mixed?”) the most random scenes in history. fat guy, people with goat heads .... what the hell is that all ?! I’m sure it was added for additional T & A, but it was so slow that it made everything happen before it turned into a harsh and painful stop. but overall this is a funny memory for me ... especially in that I can say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in a movie!
