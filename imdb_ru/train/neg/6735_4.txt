The best I can say about this film is that it develops well. It did not fall. The next best things are the support actions of the actor playing the fetish of the future groom Edward, the always amazing Holland Taylor, and the actor playing the husband of Taylor. The actor who helps criticize Messing's potential outfits on the early stage brings a deliciously absurd, but still winning, quality in the process. Well, there is a positive side to this. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, expresses much contempt for Messing much more likely than in any scene where he tries to be either business or supportive. As others have noted, he seems to have no emotional investment in this venture, except to complete it as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to tear down the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is adequate in this, but simply not strong enough for the actress to cope with all this without help. Give her "E" for the effort and "C +" for the achievement. Considering Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that could help Messing would have been the brilliantly cavalier game of Irons-Esquire from the actor playing her former fiance Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is rather weak, hoarse and helpless. <br /> <br /> If I tried to analyze this issue further, I would obviously pay more attention than most of the people involved. It's safe enough to pass the time if you have nothing else to do, and less unpleasant (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but it's much better for you to see “My best friend's wedding” again.
