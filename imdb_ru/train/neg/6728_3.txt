This film is hardly good, not at all good. Several memorable scenes and a bad choice of a pair of Norma Jean with a real actress. Jane Russell does all this work for her, the lesser woman Marilyn and / or actress. One can only wonder why this is considered one of the highlights of her unsuccessful career. 3/10
