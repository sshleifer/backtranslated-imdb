I watched the mask in the 80s, and now it shows up on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was pretty cool that day, and I also had a few toys, but now I looked at it to tears. I never realized how boring and boring this cartoon was. That's just terrible! This is not somewhere close to the same league as Transformers, He is a Human or Thundercats, and almost all were quickly forgotten as soon as they stopped being produced. I only look at Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 appears right after it (if the mask doesn't put me in the first place). One of the smallest cartoons of the 80s, which I hope to forget again, as soon as he will air on Fox Kids!
