This film was fantastic, wonderful, damn scary. and I mean it worried me just like pulse, IT, foreshadowing, and so on, but with a good movie comes shit that ends right? RIGHT! The end of this film was miserable. I mean, the ghost has turned the clock back in the chicken house, and now he thinks what I did, it means that I can call her and it will be the right time because she thinks so. right? wrong. my ass! I don't care if the ghost is Satan, it just doesn't happen. This is a film, yes, but most evil or praiseworthy films should make sense, but they are not. it just showed us what I just said, and people think nothing about it. Can someone please tell me why you all did not notice this pathetic part. the film ended for me in the hospital and that's it. check out number 3 its a lot more kick ass
