Although the cast of this film was wonderful, especially Diane Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the script was so bad that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the whole movie was that it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to turn away. Perhaps we “hoped” that the message would eventually become obvious, and that we could extract some meaning from these efforts. Unfortunately, it did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the audience might have been able to “sort out” this confusing story, which is a merit of the ingenuity of the human brain in order to understand the absurdity. The authors, however, have done nothing to alleviate this innate need, which we seem to have in the search for meaning. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that those who participated were simply passing through the movements of their respective crafts and that any inner passion for the characters, or the story was secondary or absent altogether. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, films made for television seemed to evolve over the years. Considering that the message of the message to the audience may have been the main interest of the authors in the past, modern authors and producers seem indulgent to their audience, concentrating primarily on manipulating us to "tune in" through continuous advertising, which seems to be the only reason which makes films like Surrender, Dorothy.
