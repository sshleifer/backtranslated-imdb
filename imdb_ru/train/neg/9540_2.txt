The only reason to see this film is the brilliant performance of Tom-Adkoks Hernandez, who is underused in the film as part of the film. As usual, Tom Villar is also good. Otherwise it is with ** p. The owner doesn't even exist, how does he magically change the letters on the theater tent to pronounce “The Possessor”? Lame.
