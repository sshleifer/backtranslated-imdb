Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally finished watching this horrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off within the first 10 minutes, but I decided that I would give him a chance, because he just needed to get better. Or, at least, to have some redemptive qualities, as I thought that, at least, it would be a “make you think” movie, or as really smart, or very well shot, or something like that ... Needless to say that it is not, and I wasted about one and a half hours of my life. I'm not even going to figure out why this is terrible, because it's a waste of my time to explain that this “may contain spoilers” ... IMDb, you should calm down about spoilers and pay more attention to people who Rate movies and comments do not pay to write good reviews or somehow participate in the film or something else like that. I thought that after this terrible movie it would be funny to see how bad the rating would be, and I was very shocked to see rather high marks ... all grades with 7-10 stars obviously should be about FULLY DIFFERENT film ... I still a big fan of IMDb, but seriously rethink this evaluation process, because this film should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee, like 3.
