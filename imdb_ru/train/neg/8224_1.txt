Watching this movie? I thought to myself that a lot of trash. These girls must have brains in order to even agree to be a part of it. A waste of time watching it, weak skies, I just hired it. The game was below standard, and the story was unbearable. Anyone viewing this movie, please save your money. The film has no credit at all. I am a real lover of cinema, and this is worse than the "Attack of green tomatoes." <br /> <br /> I only hope that this piece of garbage does not cost too much. Money would be better spent on homeless people in the world. I just hope that there will be no continuation.
