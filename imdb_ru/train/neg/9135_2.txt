Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so hard. This is your magnificent opus, a vivid example for all of us that you are certainly worthy of being promoted to the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences (as you stated on your website in 1998). Alas, it is better to be silent and consider yourself a fool than to speak and remove all doubts. With Ben and Arthur you do exactly that. <br /> <br /> Seemingly collected because of a lack of education or education, the script of the film leads us to a truly strange one with each new scene. This is a crazy excuse for the story, which may also be the best ally of the film. Starting cool, the homosexual title characters Ben and Arthur are trying to marry, to fly across the country to do this, in the shadow of Vermont's best palms. But all this posturing is just the beginning for BLOOD. Then there is more BLOOD, AND MORE AND MORE BLOOD. I mean that in the last third of this film there must be at least $ 20 in fake blood. <br /> <br /> Fully film - technical error. From sound to editing and music, which consists of one fuzzy bass note held on the keyboard, it's amazing that the movie even keeps together on any medium you are watching. So it is a pity that some decent amateur performances are in vain. <br /> <br /> Never mind, Sam. I'm sure you took five shots of this movie at the box office or something else that encourages poor souls (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we are not laughing with you.
