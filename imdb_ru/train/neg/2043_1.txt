Awful, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, a condescending remark and a few unpleasant autopsy photos do not give a good film. Once again, I am amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in creating film production, and yet they cannot be proud to realize that what they have done is a complete pile of crap. <br /> <br /> I sat and tried to come up with an atonement function so that I could at least balance my criticism, but the only thing I could think about was that the starting track Pink was pretty good .... I wonder did she see it <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk, boredom can kill you.
