This is a film that demonstrates that the mood, music and texture is not enough to create a good film. Of course, the spectators in the thirties show numerous beautiful scenes of Los Angeles - I especially liked the view of the trolleybus approaching the tunnel, and the tram going up the side of the hill - but in a sense this thin cinematography destroys itself because it creates a mood that “something will happen” - and nothing happens. The script also continues to depict some plot, action or injury - and from time to time it does not deliver. Even without offering (I guess) the theme of the film, a significant discrepancy between the characters. The main actors, too cute for their roles, did not transmit any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to any influence. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? This is another story. His character was so well thought out, so well played, that I wanted the camera to follow him.
