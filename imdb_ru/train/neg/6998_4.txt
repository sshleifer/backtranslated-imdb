Hollywood has always had problems reconciling with the "religious picture." Strange Cargo is no exception. Despite the fact that he uses the talents of an excellent composition and created with a maximum budget, with a suitable capricious photograph of Robert Planck, the film falls through the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden invasion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer's involvement in the action and the fate of the characters. It was difficult for me to sit still in all contrived metaphors, parallels, and biblical references, and it is impossible to accept the smug knowledge of Ian Hunter in the image of Christ. And the censors in Boston, Detroit, and Providence at least agreed with me. The film was banned. Few movie lovers in Boston / Detroit / Providence, if any, complained or traveled to other cities, because from the trailer it was obvious that Gable and Crawford were somehow involved in the “picture of the message.” It flopped everywhere. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the film received some animation on TV. The homely atmosphere makes the allegory of the film more receptive to viewers. Nevertheless, despite the growing reputation of a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Weird load runs along predictable, highly moralistic lines, and no one will guess how the main characters end up putting up with fate.
