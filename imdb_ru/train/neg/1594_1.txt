Wow. I got sick of this movie when I saw it. Soft, meaningless and motionless. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and co. can travel in time with the help of the "Spirit of the Forest" ("Princess Mononoke" very much?). There they meet a stupid child named Sam, and the "conspiracy" begins. <br /> <br /> Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) become richer in nature, become hippies and try to free Kelebi (“The Spirit”) from some stranger hunter. I don't even know what else happened. Everything went in the spot. Ash's friends were barely in him, and all the battle scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ash and his notorious friends should return in due time, watching Sam fly away from Chelebi (this scene was just creepy. OO;) learns that his new friend is actually his opponent's grandfather. And I think it is. Pretty backward, right? If you love your children, you do not subject them to it. (1 out of 10.)
