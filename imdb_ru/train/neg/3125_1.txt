Boris Karloff - Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in the Morhenge mansion with several servants and says to his doctor friend: “Don't try to treat me, doctor! I am disgustingly healthy! ”He invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes insanity by“ shrinking the brain ”(?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS * ** <br /> <br /> Morteval / Karloff eventually dies, and deadly "toys" (developed by his dead brother) begin to kill relatives. A mini gun shoots real bullets into the face of a guy, a life-size knight in armor attacks with an ax, and a dancing Sheikh wounds people with a knife. One guy gasps makes funny faces. At the end, Julissa and her boyfriend discover that Karloff is still alive and hiding in a dungeon where steel gates close the room. He plays constantly sounding organ music (something like a deadly rattle used for killing), his brother's spirit begins to speak (“The whole house goes with me!”), And the mansion is burning in flames. <br /> <br /> This meaningless mess is too dark, boring, and silly dialogue never comes to the lips.
