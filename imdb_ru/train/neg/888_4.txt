It was a film that I could not wait to see! So I finally got it, and I was very disappointed. For a start, the film says so little about New York, just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. In fact, he does not remain focused on New York magic. Another thing that changed my mind was a French film, staged inside this film. I know this is a remake, but this is not a French-style remake! In any case, here you will notice elements that remind you of French films, such as long and dirty scenes, no talk or talk, and, of course, everyone smokes in French! The story follows many lives (too much for my taste), and in the end they seem connected. I feel that there was no dedication to the heroes as it was in the stories. The film was too short to cover every fate of every happy ending. So, we can see about 30 people for 5 minutes each. And you have 120 minutes! if you like dialogs with active scenes and stuff, this is not a movie for you! I give it 4 only because I love New York, and I loved the cast!
