I liked the sensation of opening a few minutes, but after 20 minutes I generously pressed the fast forward button. Too many shots of Stuart (Michael Zelniker) going from room to room, through the corridors, through the doors and down the street, and the same number of shots looked thoughtful and confused. I got the impression that the story was originally conceived as short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched out in the form of love work between director Griv and star Zelniker (they co-wrote the script). <Br /> <br /> It would probably be more exciting if one of the characters could say something that I hadn’t heard in many other films before, or if the final was not - disappointingly - one that I predicted three minutes per film (atypical for an independent / smaller studio film). At least his heart was in the right place — it wasn't your standard Hollywood manipulative nonsense.
