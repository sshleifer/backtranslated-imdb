This early entry of B into the patriotic category struck the gorgeous young Gene Tierney at ads and posters, but you need to wait until you notice her when you are traveling in a Hollywood camel train. Earlier we created George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. I saw so many nice guys in Sanders that it was fun to watch the rare turn of a good guy. Nevertheless, Bruce Cabot's charm is largely a mystery to me - it is relatively low and clumsy, but I always felt that he had just left, smiling, from under the car, covered with grease and sixth grade. Some people love them in the same way as the character of the gypsy queen Jin. This is a thriller-adventure thriller, and just as we were warned about the invasion of local residents with weapons, ready to sabotage and attack the British on their land, there is a final battle with weapons in which we must lose the main character for good at all nothing but your closest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who did everything that was best with her, in a pair. It was almost more interesting to identify the great cast and the unexpected appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. Two or two and a half stars out of five.-MDM
