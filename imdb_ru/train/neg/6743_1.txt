How many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a scream-ripoff mask? The plot of Bleed is rather peculiar, but the film itself is a complete failure. On the one hand, the dialogue is poorly developed, boring and spending too much time on trivia, the game is bad and so on. I want to get my money back, this rent stinks worse than a skunk.
