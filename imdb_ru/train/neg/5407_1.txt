If you want to see a real “quality” movie, use the Eden formula. This wonderful film was supposed to cost only $ 50. It features a thin waffle script, pathetically poor sets, lighting and camera work, and a stop motion, a papier-mâché monster, which is completely ridiculous (it seems that they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and / or puppet gloves for a monster - but were equally terrible). <br /> <br /> All the actors say their words as if they had never seen them before, and read the telepromter. The special effects go beyond the lousy. And the only thing that is sad is that they abandoned the really elegant original name “Sunken Tyrannazurs”, which sums up exactly what you get in the full 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you clean the bottom of the barrel so hard that you break through to the pile that lies beneath it. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
