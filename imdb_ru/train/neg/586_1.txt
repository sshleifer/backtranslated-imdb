After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in the film “The Man from the Snowy River”, WHY Kirk Douglas was replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? Without controversy and Harrison, everything was different from what Douglas portrayed. Perhaps he realized how bad the conspiracy was - Jim returns after a long absence to find Jessica, who is being chased by another man. He could not expect that any girl would wait so long without having contact with him, and would not find an opponent. For the Disney movie, it contains obscene language, as well as an extremely unnecessary part, when Jim and Jessica chipped in without being married - very GOOD. According to my family members, this is an insult to the viewer. I will stop at the first and try to forget that I have ever seen a sequel!
