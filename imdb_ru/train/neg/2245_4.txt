This film is NOT similar to the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that is a shame, because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I do not at all deny the talent of Barbra Streisand. She is a good actress and a brilliant singer. I am not familiar with the other works of Chris Christopherson and therefore I cannot judge them. However, this film leaves much to be desired. He is slow, has unreasonable nudity and obscene language, and it can be very difficult to put up with him. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it’s quite natural that I would like Judy Garland’s version better. Watch the 1976 film with Barbro and Chris, and judge for yourself.
