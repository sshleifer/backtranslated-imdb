It has to be one of the worst, if not the worst movie Iâ€™ve almost seen. (I could not watch this until the end). Pure and simple, this gratuitous violence is only for its sake, and the ridiculous storyline only adds to the dull and incompetent filming. Sick. And is only suitable for those who love injury. After killing several hundred men, women and children, Seed was finally caught after he easily killed several more police officers, who finally received information about his whereabouts. He is sentenced to death by an electric chair and survives by a miracle! Buried alive, he digs up the exit and plotting revenge on those who put him away and flicked a switch. Needless to say, more horrific murders are happening ...
