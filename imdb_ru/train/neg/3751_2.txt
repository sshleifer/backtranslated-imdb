I'm a big fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a rather disappointing experience. Besides ambient background music ?? which really sets the mood of the movie ?? He lacks almost all the qualities that I come to associate with the work of Lynch. The visual effects are at least boring, and the dialogue must be vague and monotonous in order to be of any interest. <br /> <br /> It’s more like the film’s students awkwardly trying to make a dogma feature film than work. an experienced director. I have seen a lot of amateur films with excellent camera work, scenery, sound and scripts. In this film, almost all artistic qualities are missing. It seems to me that I am watching one of Davids' home videos shot during a weekend trip with friends.
