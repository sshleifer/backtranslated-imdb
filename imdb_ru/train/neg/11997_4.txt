this film has a lot of flaws, and that's all I could see. it is painfully long and terribly directed. I could see the whole audience become impatient and wait for it to end. The execution time is more than 3 hours, which could be edited in less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The transition between stories is medium. most people admitted that they were sitting, waiting for something better. <br /> <br /> This is only ridiculous in the pockets. ambitious project and performance below par. Govinda does an honest job, Anil Kapoor disappointed me, the rest of us, as expected. if you expect something close to babelle or love in fact, then it is not where close.
