The problem with this film is that it was shot on the worst camera, and the film is blurred and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that the one who held the camera could not stand still because he had an attack or something like that. In this film, too much shit and vomiting. Every twenty minutes, someone vomits, and it makes me think that it was done by some kind of bulimia or something else. It was disgusting. Then there is an annoying piercing cry that goes on and on and does not stop until the credits begin. I also did not like it when all of her friends were shot (or not, I do not know), and she goes to the van and puts on patches. It was really very stupid to even have it in a movie. How much gas can a man deflate to start a van? It should be a lot, because they will not run out of gas until the end of the film. It was a terrible film, and I highly recommend never watching it all my life.
