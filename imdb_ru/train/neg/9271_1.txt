For the small minority seen here praising this film, GET SERIOUS. I know that everything depends on the personal opinions of people at the end of the day, but anyone who has more than a couple of brain cells can certainly understand that this is complete nonsense. So bad that it does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that those who say how great it is are friends with someone who participates in the film and try to give an impetus to their career. Bad in all respects, do not deceive people, to say otherwise. The storyline is a weak rephrasing of previous entries, the script also. Attempts to hide the lack of originality, using the girl (WOW!) Instead, Do not hide the lack of ideas from the directors, and, unfortunately, there is absolutely no panic. Absolutely no expiatory qualities, full poop. I awarded this couple of chancellors one rating simply because I had a chance to find someone who would finance this piece of shit. They must have put more effort into this than making the film. A shame.
