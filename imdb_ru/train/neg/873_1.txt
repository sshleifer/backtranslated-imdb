A leader who is very successful in his professional life, but very incapable in his familiar life, meets a boy with Down syndrome who has run away from home. Both characters feel very lonely, and, apparently, the less intelligent will show the leader the beauty of the little things in life ... With this argument, something like Amelie’s atmosphere and sentimental music, I didn’t expect, but a moralistic disgusting film. Anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes a rather cruel guy), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Otail and Pascal Duquin, was very good, I decided to continue watching the movie. French cinema, in general, has the ability to show something that seems quite lively, unlike the more stereotypical American cinema. But because of this, it is much more disappointing to see after an absurd end, with the impossible death of a boy, a charming tone, the happiness of a family leader, a cheap temper, an intolerable laughter of daughters, a guy waves from heaven like Michael Landon ... Really nasty, in my humble opinion .
