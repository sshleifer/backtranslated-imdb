The meaning of the extremely extended preparatory phase of this Star - the story of the birth, apparently, is to achieve the ultimate success of even more sublime. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective, like a slurred young woman, enclosed in herself, but never convincing as an actress of growing fame, who wins and profits from this squad. Even in lengthy scenes of acting classes, Esther will never see her follow the instructions of a teacher. After suffering from the painful pain of Esther (mostly self-inflicted) in painful details, we are not given a convincing feeling of her triumph. <br /> <br /> The obsessive presence of the pain of the heroine seems to be a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. And yet the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-oathism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) are never united in a single whole. A 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to tie its loose ends. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go in front of an audience.
