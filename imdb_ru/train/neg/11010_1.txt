This film does not even deserve one. It was a waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not insulting, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is one that I think everyone should read. There is complete frontal nudity and disgusting language. But not only that, there is NO storyline, the actors are terrible, the accents are terrible, the actors have little time, and I was even excited to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was for Brian Van Holt (by the way, he only has fifteen seconds). I think this could be a mistake for directors and editors, but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only a new sentence. <br /> <br /> A film similar to this one, Eraser, is arguably the most disturbing film in the world. There is no storyline here, and this is not funny. Although it is not trying to be funny. DO NOT SEE OR FILM.
