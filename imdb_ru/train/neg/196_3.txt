This film is imperfect in many ways. Like many before, he portrays more Alamo mythology than history. The production is bad, in general, the impression is a charity project for many actors who would otherwise have to work on Hollywood squares. For me it was the greatest drawback - I know the age and common features of the real heroes of the Alamo and the geriatric ensemble of television actors chosen for their portrayal, never letting hint at plausibility. <br /> <br /> As a native Texan, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about the story. I can take a decent production from any point of view (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but it never gave me the opportunity to enjoy it. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life than this messy mess, but were a little less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid it.
