This should be the stupidest movie I've ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. A small child is strange, and they move to a hotel because his caretaker is his father. We find the child has a gift, "Shining." This gift never has anything to do with anything other than making the child seem cool. Then the film becomes duller and duller until the person finally goes crazy. He rages to kill the child and his wife, because ... well, he feels so. Why else did he do it? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the bath. A man kisses her and realizes that he is kissing a dead corpse, which is absolutely disgusting. Somehow, a black man enters the hotel and is beaten with an ax. Then the child and the woman get into the car of a black man and leave the father, who dies within a few minutes of hypothermia. Most films are not a waste of time, but this is precisely in this category. The music is trashy, the characters are commonplace (except Jack Nicholson, a good actor), the plot is distorted and corresponds to the description of vomiting, the ending is very predictable, the plot is slow, tedious and boring. This film is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS. I am surprised that he got such a high rating on IMDb.
