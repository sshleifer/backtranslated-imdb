Well, let me start by saying that none of this will come as a surprise to anyone who has read other comments. That being said, MY Gd, this film smelled! I mean, WOW, I didn’t know that you could throw as much money as they obviously made for something, and it’s still worse than ANY Roger Korman’s movie! Korman was probably transferred to this film at some point, but he refused because of the poor quality of the script! The only reason this film was made in the first place was because someone said, “Hey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we get zombies? Resident Evil? No, someone else came first. Silent Hill? No, too quiet. People will never sit in a dark room, just to get scared. Hey, didn't Sega have a game in which people were running, shooting zombies? They went beyond the platform, we could get it for a penny! "<br /> <br /> Basically, they tried their best to make a movie like a video game, even up to the shooting of the battle, as if the characters were actually playing a game. <br /> <br /> The first and main problem is that the original game was terrible. I mean, <br /> <br /> a bad merchandising film made for the worst game-in-two weeks-and-after-delivered-and-bought by morons-and their parents for Christmas are terrible. The graphics were boring. Monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The thing was boring. In other words, it was a boring game. And it was a version of ARCADE. The home version was even worse! In the home version, you did not even hold a gun in your hand while you were bored with this senseless game! But I digress. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they went so far that they actually crossed scenes from real gameplay during battle scenes. Huh ??? Didn't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that a battle was really taking place there? Not to mention that EVERY battle was filmed from a video game point of view, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first-person shooter (player comes from a character's POV). Maybe that's why they added game graphics so that you know that they hint at the game ... Well, whatever ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the only thing that made this ALL experience remotely enjoyable It was the fact that everyone in the theater made fun of this film out loud, so my sudden bouts of hysterical laughter and general distrust were taken for a common thing and did not drive me out. <br /> <br /> To sum up, DON'T GO VIDEO! Do not even accept to rent it when it comes to video in a couple of weeks. Run. Just run.
