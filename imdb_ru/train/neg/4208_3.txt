There is a really good film hiding right below the surface of the layers on the layers of cheese, which is the “Page Master”. <br /> <br /> I found out about it when I looked at it again this morning, neglecting it for years and years. I remember how I hated him with passion when he first appeared, but this time I found out that the special effects are pretty good. The plot is just “An Endless Story” with creative entectomy, but it's a nice little click for anyone who just wants a really cool eye candy. The animation is awesome, and I especially liked the way animators allow their characters to look and behave more surreal than usual. I give him a rating of three, as I would * give her two (just for parody value), if I ever decided to watch this film, expecting it to amaze me to the depths of my soul.
