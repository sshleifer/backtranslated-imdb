I know absolutely nothing about the author Philip Pierce or about any of her novels, and if Tom's Midnight Garden is typical of her works, I probably wouldn't be interested in her books as a child. When I was a child, I was really not interested in liturgy if there were no soldiers fighting monsters with a large number of bodies in it. <br /> <br /> Judging from this version of the movie “Tom's Midnight Garden”, I think Pierce is writing for a lower level. children of the middle class, since most of the story revolves around the protagonist Tom Long, moving into a house without a garden, and then suddenly finding the metaphysical. Having our own garden was, without a doubt, something that the working class did not have in the 1950s, so I think there was some kind of political class somewhere. There is also a romance with a young girl named Hattie, but again, cynical children love love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that there is very little excitement or adventure in the story. <br /> <br /> This is a children's film that seems to be dated from its source. It is harmless, but I am surprised at his high IMDB rating. I wonder how many of them would have received so many high marks if they were 10 years old who just saw the Lord of the Rings trilogy?
