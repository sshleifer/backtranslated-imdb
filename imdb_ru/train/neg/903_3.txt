The 1937 Stella Dallas with Barbara Stanwick didn’t get very old — as someone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now — a real mystery. Perhaps they thought that the cheerful and cheerful Bette Midler could do something out of it, but this gray-haired script defeats her. The plot that the bartender gave birth to a child out of wedlock, and over the years she gave the young girl to the rich father of the child so that she could make a better lifestyle, could not escape the nondescript, old-fashioned attributes and attitudes. Midler works best with a director who can control her excesses, but this does not happen here; Stephen Collins is fearless as a man who changes her life, but Trini Alvarado is well played as Midler's daughter. This is what used to be called the "female picture", the web, but it does not pass the test because it remains too true to its origin of the 1930s. * 1/2 of ****
