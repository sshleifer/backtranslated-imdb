There are many crazy people working for him in Mad Magazine ... but obviously someone had some common sense when the powers that be renounced celluloid waste ... editing is el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid ... and the only reason he gets two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off her clothes and we get a good shot in the chest ... I never thought that I would be sorry Ralph Macchio, who made the decision to be in it, but I do ... and I REALLY feel bad for Ro on Leybman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never have appeared in this fragment ... of the film ... at least Mr. Leybman had cajons. Refuse to have his name indicated anywhere in the film .. and he comes forward ... actually there are copies of this thing with Mad's initial sequence still on it ... if you can find it, take it, because it is probably worth something ... it's the only a thing in this movie that costs something ... and a note for people on IMDb.com ... there is no way to spoil To have this movie for somebody ... the creators spoiled it themselves ...
