Up until the last few minutes of the movie, I would give the movie 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is so terrible and “Hollywood” that it completely undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the submarine and the possibility that they received orders to fire their nuclear missiles. The captain, Gene Hackman, is all set to launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming launch orders first. The problem is that to launch an OBA, the captain and the 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch, and Washington is firmly on his own, until eventually this leads to an armed uprising aboard a submarine. In the end, an error was detected, and the missiles were not launched. Great. However, here comes the part that simply does not sound believable. After they returned to dry land and approached the review board, Washington and Hackman (who had just spent half of the movie trying to kill each other) shook hands and became pals! Yes ?! Too banal end to make the film worthwhile for me.
