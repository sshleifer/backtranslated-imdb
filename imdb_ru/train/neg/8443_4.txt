Anna lives with her family in a new residential complex near the city. She was with her husband Sebastian for many years, and they no longer speak. While on a working visit abroad, a female colleague commits suicide. Anna was deeply impressed by her death, although she hardly knew her. No one seems to know why she killed herself. Anna for the first time understands that you can be unknown among the most expensive. Anna does not mention this incident at home and begins to observe her husband and child. Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly begins to look at her life. And she wonders why sheâ€™s so moved away from the people who are closest to her. <br /> <br /> (This is my translation of the short text on the cover of the DVD. I hope you find it useful, because this film does not have the IMDb Story for this date.)
