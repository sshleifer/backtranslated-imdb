I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes several times. It's true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conavey, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - they all have some talent, but here they were all about what basically happens in a Cinemax movie. set aboard a spaceship! <br /> <br /> Sadly, Alien Intruder tries to be unique, using a computer virus / alien demon / harpy / whatever you want, as you would like to call it named Ariel (Skoggins) to penetrate this high-tech station Virtual reality aboard a spacecraft where four men are allowed to realize their fantasies when their captain (Williams) watches over the system. <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but it all just sounds like a well-supplemented episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams surpasses all classes right and left, and it seems he would prefer to do something else, somewhere else. Ah, what people do for money ... <br /> <br /> Forex is pretty static, maybe even less than you expect from a cheap video like this. Unfortunately, even female nudity is less than you expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is a real star here, and, of course, she gets ALL the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a movie in which everyone is teased and without brains, see “Alien Offender”. Of course, you probably have to look no further than Cinemax, at 2 or 3 am. <br /> <br /> There are no stars, even for the kind of star power this film can collect. <br /> <br /> Leave this lost in space.
