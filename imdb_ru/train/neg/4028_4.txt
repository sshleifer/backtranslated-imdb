It had all the creations of a very good movie - good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (a mysterious rocket from space threatens to burn the planet) and a lot of footage (if the Air Force had a movie about jet planes fired rockets, it was used) . Unfortunately, it is destroyed by too much melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The film is about a rocket from space, which is attacked by the Soviets and is randomly selected in a low atmospheric orbit. At speeds of less than five miles and speeds of over 4,000 miles, it emits a million degrees of exhaust, burning everything on the ground, including glaciers, early warning base (DEW) bases and Eskimos. <br /> <br /> Any attempt to destroy the missile fails. <br /> <br /> The first flaws in this film appear early. Although we do not expect much from low-budget films, some things cannot be forgotten - for example, a little research. For example, both the Soviets and the US are launching anti-missile missiles that deploy a missile with unmistakable accuracy. However, the first successful missile defense tests were not conducted by the Russians until March 1961. <br /> <br /> Too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romance with the same amount of wood as the log cabin. The character Parker is crying and screaming at the victim of Loggia, as if she were on the screen. The loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman. The scientist (Phillip Pine) is so much rude that makes William Shatner look like a fan. The bus driver is constantly spitting out the doomsday shit in the scene behind the scenes. The only good actor is the film narrator, played by veteran actor Lawrence Dobkins (The Naked City). <br /> <br /> All this could be overlooked, if not for the time frame. After the rocket information is sent to DC, the Pentagon enters a group of scientists. General (Larry Kerr) announces that the rocket will hit New York in 63 minutes. After this, there are discussions among scientists, and a deadly lull is required from ambassadors to find out if the missile is a Russian attack and whether an answer is needed. <br /> <br /> The film shows the military were in full combat. Civil defense people leave work and go to their posts. Eight million people try to hide from radioactive fallout, while school buses take millions of children (and we see the whitest New York I've ever seen, although when watching science fiction films from the 50s, it seems like standard). The press is stored in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, the man at the Pentagon announces that the rocket will hit Ottawa, Canada, in 51 minutes! All of the above action happened in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien rocket. He slowly produces a container of plutonium, loads it in a jeep and delivers it from DC to a distant rocket base to put it on a rocket. On the way, a wild driver knocked him out of the way, he broke down, and then was hijacked. Finally, he returns the plutonium and travels to the base to arm the rocket. Again, all this in the same 63-minute period. <br /> <br /> The movie also annoys the viewer, giving the impression that Ottawa can be saved, only to show how men, women and children become fried. They say that the rocket has five minutes to get to New York. The loggia is still going to the base (4 more miles ahead). He gets to the base and arms the rocket, then a two-minute countdown is announced. All for five minutes. Areas of New York should have been, at least, burned. <br /> <br /> By the way, the rocket was destroyed, if you did not guess. The ABM warhead destroys it with a powerful plutonium-based nuclear explosion. Five seconds later, the explosion dissipates and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear explosion equivalent to 100 Hiroshima on the outskirts of New York, and nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The movie had all the elements necessary to be a good movie B, but they were wasted. Loggia played her character so stupid that you didn’t care that he eventually sacrificed himself. You were not bothered by other characters, even the clever scientist played by Pine. The tension that was supposed to promote the film was simply not physically possible within the time limit (it would not have been anyway, even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This film is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it was not republished in any medium and for good reason. I do not know whether the film should be or it was a standard practice, but there is a scene where the government sends all the best scientists, military and businessmen to deep shelters, saying that they are too valuable to lose them. There is not a single woman or minority in the group. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film, and he plays the piano a little. It was worse than the "27 days" when an alien gives five earthlings a chance to save or destroy the planet, and it does not include either blacks or Latin Americans. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a special Tonight on Turner Classic Movies, and I don’t expect it to appear again. If you find this copy anywhere, you can post it on Amazon.com.
