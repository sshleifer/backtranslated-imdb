My twenty-fifth film, Sidney Lumet, Garbo Talk, painfully protracted, scary and predictable, was dramatically shot in the low quality of my quest. <br /> <br /> The film is about an agitated young worker named Gilbert. (Ron Silver), son of Estelle Roll (Ann Bancroft), eccentric, furious and, above all, an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle became ill with a brain tumor, her son decided to go on his own obsessive task: track down Greta Garbo and bring her to his mother. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft in full, “Auntie-mom”, chewing the scenery, this evil oligar, whom this film loves, where she tells people, defends her ideals and always ends up in prison. She stands outside the film as an obvious artificial construct, and every scene with her is uk-yk lame; every note seems false. The remaining characters are the same as one-dimensional, but incredibly less interesting. Ron Silver is as flat as he can be, and his attempted love triangle is as wired as everything else in the film: he meets rich Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but becomes astonished by a strange employee Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), and I called each scene in three before they happen. <br /> <br /> This is another problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are placed in an intriguing and fascinating story, but there is simply nothing here. The pace of the film is glacial, brilliant with extraneous material, which absolutely nothing strengthens, and when the film begins to follow a linear plot, it is both wrong and uninteresting. There are, so to speak, many guest stars, including Harvey Firstein as gay from New York (imagine) in another extremely unimportant scene. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, he tries to make half- A worthy statement about the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but by that time none of the characters existed as real people, and the film exhausted me with submission, therefore functions as a case is too small, far too late. This film is my twenty-fifth film about Lumet, thanks to which he easily becomes my most watched director, but with the exception of a couple of blatant blunders (“Stranger among us”, anyone?), He did not get distracted by the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo’s conversations. . <br /> <br /> {Rating: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (out of 24) of 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumet films}
