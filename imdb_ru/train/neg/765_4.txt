Seriously, what do they think? For many years, the Columbo series tried some new things and deviated from the usual successful formula, but this film really overdid it. This film is basically very different from any other Colombo film, but the differences are not in favor of the film. <br /> <br /> The main thing that distinguishes this film from any other Colombo film is the fact that there is no murder. The whole premise of this film is completely different, and it puts the character Colombo in a completely different environment and situation. In addition, in general, everything is different and more "modernized". <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levy has shot several other Colombo films in the past, all of which very much followed the usual formula. It also makes a strange choice, which he chose to guide this film. <br /> <br /> The character of Colombo himself also feels completely different, perhaps because of the reason he ended up in a completely different environment and situation where he helps his nephew after his fianc√©e bride disappeared after wedding. The absence of some good relief and the trademark of humor Colombo also does not make this watch good or pleasant. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the film does not start too badly, but the film begins to become more and more ridiculed with its history as it develops. This is such a stupid written thriller with kidnapping, whose story is becoming more and more unlikely. It also makes the film more and more unsightly. This is a very interesting Columbo recording, which also does not know how to entertain its viewers. <br /> <br /> The fact that the actors acting as assistants are not the most talented in the world also helps. Despite the fact that his character was in a completely different situation, and the film was shot in a completely different style, Peter Falk still feels well, and his presence still saves this film somewhat. Can you just imagine how this movie would have been without it? It would be a very bad and funny cheap movie that I can tell you. <br /> <br /> A strange Colombo record, which can be described as a failed experiment on deviation from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
