... and lovers of Ethel Merman will also love her loud, domineering vocals, like the evil witch Mombi, but the continuation of this cartoon "The Wizard of Oz" is devoid of real imagination, replacing fantasy and excitement with noisy action (and cheaply repeating its frames as a bad music video) . Little Dorothy returned to Oz, who went broke and meets old and new friends. The inept animation stuck somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and the less inspired shows from Hanna-Barber, but many of the songs are good, especially Dorothy’s “This is a distant land”, beautifully performed by Liza Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, so the movie is animated whenever Dorothy is near. Much of this is not remembered, and I'm not even sure that baby boomers will get a charge from him, since he has been in circulation for so long. As a matter of curiosity, just fair. ** from ****
