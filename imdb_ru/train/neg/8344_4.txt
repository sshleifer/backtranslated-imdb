After reading all the rave reviews about this film and several that give him so-so. I finally decided to drop a single cent in my values. I agree with the majority that if it were not for Loren Lewis and Chris Ferri, it would be a disaster. Picture taken in Marietta, Ohio. north of Dogpatch, where all the real talents fled south 77 years ago, at least as much as the fuel tank would allow. I actually heard a chuckle from reviewers who subtly argue that they can work a little better than most, arguing that they followed the plot without the slightest confusion. This tiny little story of Brothers Crook is like an old record with a pass. As an American, I understand the difficulties that Indian filmmakers face. A trip to Romania would probably destroy the budget. Let's face it, this whole movie was looped by Claire’s loops at the gas station, Claire on the side of the road, Claire under the stands, Claire in the house, Claire in the cornfield, Claire in the school. Claire here and Claire there. It almost became monotonous, and it would be if she were not the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff should make a living, but do not write a two-page script and turn it in an hour, twenty clicks. Before you write another script about dreams with ghosts, watch one or two episodes of "Ghost whisper" or something like that and get a little background. All the actors, except for the ones listed above, and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film. In addition, there is the appearance of co-director Jeff, as he is in all his films. Like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? The one thing the film was going to do for this is that the cameraman seemed to be focused on the derrière Lauren Lewis. Well, for all the sarcasm I am experiencing, I still recommend the movie for horror lovers, just to see this young actress in the making of her career (I hope), and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain worthy of attention.
