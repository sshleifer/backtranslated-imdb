The plot of this film is based on one important point: this killer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. Not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man is shown killing a teenage girl without provocation and reason, without emotion. This girl was someone's daughter. I do not think that a father who cared so much for his daughter could have been so cold-blooded in relation to another's daughter. Or, alternatively, could be so cool and still worry about your daughter and take care of her. And the idea that the convicted murderer would actually ask the parents of his victim to take care of his daughter is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> However, the actors acted with conviction. I thought that the change in color of Scott Bakulaâ€™s eyes really made him seem colder and more menacing than he usually is. You could not see his eyes at all.
