Encouraged by the positive reviews of this film, I was looking forward to this film. Bad mistake I have seen more than 950 films, and this is truly one of the worst of them - it is terrible in almost all respects: montage, tempo, plot, "acting", soundtrack (the only song of the film - the melody of country-country - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and disgusting, and extremely boring. Rarely was I so happy to see the end credits of the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps me from giving 1 point is Harvey Keitel - although this is not his best performance, he, at least, seems to be making a little effort. One for Keitel only.
