As a cast member, I was a band member at all basketball games, I would like to inform the world after I starred in the film that we were not allowed to watch it, since it was banned in Oregon.

While we were shooting, we were allowed to eat several times with the actors and production personnel. Mr. Nicholson is remembered for being one of the most ill-mannered people I have ever met. Enough time for a young 20 year old. But, of course, itâ€™s not at all what actually happened on campus in the late 60s and early 70s, despite what Hollywood might think. Oregon trombone player
