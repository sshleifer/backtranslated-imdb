A Vietnamese vet decides to seize a provincial city, and anyone who stands in his way will be eliminated (including women). Released in cinemas shortly before “The Stars Are Born,” which turned his career upside down, this drama from the movie with Chris Christofferson is insanely reckless, frivolous and evil. Filmed in Simi Valley, California, the results are really obscene, cattle cliches and senseless violence make up most of the script of director George Armitage. Armitage gathered the most curious actors of the 70s for his film, including Ian-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters and, in a sense, Loni Anderson; however, the center of it all is Christopherson, coarse and coarse throughout. This deserves a score, I suppose, for the fact that this is a completely non-sympathetic thriller, but the bad vibrations (and the ridiculous climax) cover the whole project like an ugly spot. * 1/2 of ****
