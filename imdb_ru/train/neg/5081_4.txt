Was there at least one positive to this film? Critics who knew nothing about video games might have noticed game errors. No damage was taken, and in the beginning it was clearly visible damage. <br /> <br /> And I may have missed something, but maybe Super Mario Bros. 3 did not imagine that this is a game that has never been played before? Well, if that's the case, and I didn't miss anything ... like Fred Savage’s character, and even the girl, already knew so much about the game? We are talking about things that some people do not know about their second or third viewing. <br /> <br /> In addition to the factual and gaming mistakes, the overall quality of the film itself is generally low. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The child was not even good at video games on the frames they showed. Many of the children I knew in those days were much more experienced. Besides all this, acting and plotline are simply mediocre in their strengths. The characters are soft and completely uninteresting, “The Wizard” (the youngest child) is a very quiet, completely dry childish cliche of a small child who almost never speaks due to injury. The point is not that it is unrealistic, but that it had to be thrown into the film in order to actually even begin to form a plot that will exceed even 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the only value that can be found here is nostalgic. If you grew up with this movie, you will like whether it was good or not. It was about children playing video games, and while you saw it, you were probably also obsessed with NES. But if you didn’t like it in your childhood, there’s simply nothing that could interest you and very little that would prevent you from turning it off. <br /> <br /> No, sir, I didn't like it,
