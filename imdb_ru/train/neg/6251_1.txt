I was able to hold out only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget film. The most blatant absurdity was that while the American prisoners in the North Korean prisoner of war camp were allegedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine, go without bathing, tremble in fragile and dirty parks and sleep on bare floors, and let's not forget Torturers - they always manage to strip their perfectly combed hair. Except for the rather strict look of Harry Morgan as an army major, the actors and actors are terrible. Ronald Regan does not seem to be able to portray one character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. Basically, the Caucasian cast, depicting officers of the North Korean camp, could be excusable, but when allegedly Russian officers acting as Korean advisers walk around in a Nazi uniform with emblems in a new form, complete with jodhpurs and jack boots (obvious revisions of the costume department from WWII movies) to speak with accents like General Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes, well, that's just six nonsense. Do not waste your time on this.
