Anyone who saw the original 1970 film knows how a great cast, script and director can create a comedy masterpiece. Besides, it's easy to see how the opposite of this can create another tasteless Hollywood bore! This film was pathetic! If it were not for John Cleese (comic genius), I would have gone 15 minutes later on this terrible waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon would not have written another scenario for this version (he said that he couldn’t improve the first time), and I’m surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he won’t plead for defamation of humor ! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a great job on the original, what did the producers think about when they shot this one? How could the director and editor look at these scenes and think that one of them was funny? I do not know, but I know one thing - it is not surprising that foreign and independent films are becoming increasingly popular .......
