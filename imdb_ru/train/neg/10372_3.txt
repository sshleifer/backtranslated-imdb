I liked the commentary of the first reviewer much more than the film, when I saw it in the second cycle cinema in the early 80s. Then I was impressed by the meticulousness of creating costumes, modeled on the pattern of tenniel. But for me, the actors were mostly squandered, their personalities were muffled by masks, while the direction, which I consider to be unusually static, and the photo - dull. The rating noted at that time was insignificant, which means "you should not look even once." <br /> <br /> However, I would also take the chance to look again.
