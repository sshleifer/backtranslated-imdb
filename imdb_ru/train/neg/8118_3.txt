Well, EYEboy, I have to say that I am infinitely pleased when someone highlights me and tries to make fun of me, especially when he is someone who seems as smart as you. My favorite part of your post was: “But there is no good good guy, good guy, bad guy, kimosabe. I suggest you stick to the movie with a lot of bang. ” <br /> <br /> Well said! I really like action movies, especially if they are well-made, but I also love films that do not have much action, as long as THEY are well-made. Sorry, but Secret's and Lies do not fall into this category and this is just a very bad movie. I really do not see a lot of non-American films, so maybe I was spoiled and did not realize how bad foreign films were when I watched “Secrets and Lies”. Perhaps if I judged foreign films on a different standard, I could someday see how “Secrets and Lies” could be one of the top rated films on IMDB. Hmm ... If this is true, it is very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email address)
