By 1941, Colombia was a full-fledged large studio and could produce a film with the same technical polishing as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best that can be said about Adam of Four Sons, the lead soap opera with the almost ruthless performances of Ingrid Bergman (first presented in the top of an American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a French girl (it was an era in which Hollywood believed that one foreign accent was as good as another), hired as a governess for Baxter’s four sons and left (with one break caused by the crash of the 1907 stock market) until boys are adult men who served in the First World War. Almost everyone in the film is so good, well, that it is a relief when Susan Hayward, as a villainous person, enters halfway through ?? she is about the only person observed in the film, although she clearly channels Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; is it also the first in its long line of alcoholic roles ?? but the script remains saccharin, and the ending is completely ridiculous. It is not surprising that four years later, Bergman abandoned the similar plot of the “Valley of Solutions”.
