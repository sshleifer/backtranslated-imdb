The woman (Sylvia Christelle) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but all this is connected with some stupid plot or something like that. <br /> <br /> Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Does anyone understand that this film covers child abuse? I believe that everything is in order, because this is a teenager - if we had a man with a man seducing a girl, that would be (rightly) an insult. Sorry, but doing this with a boy doesn’t justify it. It is still sick. I understand that Brown was an adult (he was actually 18 years old when he was made), but he LOOKS 15. I just hate that some people think that this is normal. <br /> <br /> The plot towards acting sucks (Christel is beautiful — but she can't act; Brown is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen), and constant nudity becomes boring and not even erotic. <br /> <br /> I saw this crap theater in 1981. I was 19 years old, and I was with my 14-year-old cousin (who could easily pass for 18). He wanted to see it - I didn't, but I decided, what the hell? We entered, and I actually bought tickets for three teenagers who were clearly underage. My cousin thought it was boring, and three other children left halfway through! Let me clarify this - three teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity! This should give you an idea of ​​how bad it is. I am surprised that it was ever released. And 1 completely.
