I didn't even bother to finish the film, because I was so bored, I thought I was going to faint, I watched it in cinemas, and I and my friends were just tired, so we got up and went to another film if I something you need to sit in 2 minutes again from this movie, I think I'm going to shoot myself ... and I know the whole movie, because my friend told me what happened at the end, and I was not surprised at all, I mean, who didn't know it was going to do the right thing and let him be happy, I mean, you really should be an idiot to not know it. I know that I did not miss anything, and if someone asked me to watch this film, I would say “above my dead body”.
