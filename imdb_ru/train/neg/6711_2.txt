1993 was a year. That was long before Philip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. Who knew that I would be extra in the film with him? In fact, I was additionally paid in the film “The Back of My Boyfriend”, which was shot dead in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, Texas. The original name was “Johnny Zombie” (thank God that the producers changed their mind!) I was on the theater stage. I rushed to watch a movie that day when he went out in theaters. This is more a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a laugh, you can check it out. Nothing that is even close to the quality of "The Dawn of the Dead" or even "Sean of the Dead", but the cheese factor is good enough. Chao
