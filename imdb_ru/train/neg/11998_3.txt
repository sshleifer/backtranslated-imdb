this is a terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> first of all TOOO long. the longest film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Too many stories, damn it !!!! <br /> <br /> In fact, there are too many stories that the story line is ruined. <br /> <br /> comedy was not a comedy !!!!! it was not funny at all .... <br /> <br /> The story is so disgusting and poorly written that it doesnâ€™t matter whether the characters are alive or not ....... <br /> <br /> I have there were some expectations from this film ......... but my expectations completely collapsed in the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> the only thing that is good in this film is MUSIC .... .. and obviously Vidya Balan. she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors ...... she's just a novice, and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and Blonde, who are playing his love interest, also help save this film. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of a taxi driver. and Blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent presentation .... <br /> <br /> another talented actress Ayesha Takia is completely wasted in this film !!!! such is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay copes well with his role, but it seems to be too much! Anil and Juhi are also completely wasted ...... <br /> <br /> The only one who is not wasted is Salman, because he does not have the talent to ever be wasted !!!!!!!! ! <br /> <br /> In general, this is a very impossible movie with the script of Mishmashed and TOOO Masladar, the storyline of which is formed in accordance with the silly comedy scenes. Imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 is four hours !!!! Think and rethink before you go to the cinema !!!!! Better avoid it !!!!!
