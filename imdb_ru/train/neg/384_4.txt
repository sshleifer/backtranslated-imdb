I do not really trust the conspiracy theories about AIDS, but it is sociologically interesting to observe this phenomenon. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of the frightened and dying often gave rise to such grim fantasies. This was especially true of the politically radical and sexually extreme demimonde of San Francisco. The city, famous for its beauty, rarely looked uglier than in this film. A sense of darkness and decomposition permeates every scene. <br /> <br /> Although it’s impossible to say that the acting and plot is well-made, the film’s unique cultural context and depressingly dark mood at least partially save the film from total loss. In fact, I discovered that the most interesting performance is Irit Levy as a fragile and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police detective. It is interesting, though not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Highlights: The use of the darkly tragic film “Turandot” in the film is an effective motive, and it has a sublime silent cameo created by cult performer Ron Eti.
