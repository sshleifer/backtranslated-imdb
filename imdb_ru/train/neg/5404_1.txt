Have you ever had a desire to just kill an hour or two, doing housework and watching a movie so bad that it defies reason? Well, while renting movies on one of the weekends, I will look at their cover and see T-Rex. Knowing perfectly well that the dinosaur on the package was T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I KNEW that I had to rent it just because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed at least. <br /> <br /> Mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned with their condition and shareholders than life, and, of course, a big, poorly brisk, sock-puppet T-Rex. It was our film, were there scenes obviously related to other films? Not to mention that the hungry Rexs are never satisfied ... never. The way he is hungry is outside of me, because he really doesn’t have a throat (indeed, if you look into his mouth, when he roars, he is hard ... like a toy or something like that). Now I love to watch incredibly bad B-Movies from time to time, because it reminds me how much better the blockbuster movie is. This one was fun. I'm not even sure if it should be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, without mistaking, you will laugh. <br /> <br /> Am I to blame for the film’s budget ... yes, but the acting did not help either. Well, Tony Todd was pretty good, as with some of the female roles ... when you cry, shouldn't "tears" appear? Fur, I'm not going to be angry with this movie, I knew what I was on, and if you are looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: watch this movie, then immediately see Jurassic Park and then the lost world back to back. You will write letters of thanks to Mr. Spielberg the next day.
