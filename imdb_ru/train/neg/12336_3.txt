I give it five out of 10. All five points are for Hendrix, which provides a very decent set of his latest materials. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera and its editing is on the verge of horror! We have countless pictures of Hendrix with a full face, where he could almost do anything, perhaps pee? We do not see his hands on the guitar, that's what's the matter! Also we got a lot of pictures of Hendrix from behind? It looks like Hendrix has three cameras, but they all work with amateur fools. The guy in front of Hendrix seems eager to focus on the stage, as if Hendrix on the guitar is just a distraction. While the guy behind is trying to focus on a few tiptoes at the kiosks, than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that bleeds from the amplifiers (sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) tracks such as a machine gun, a complete waste of film! If Hendrix had lived for another two years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light, if we talk about the full official release. The only gem it contains is the incredible Johnny B. Goode, but this is all in a rather poor visual document of a great man, inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight.
