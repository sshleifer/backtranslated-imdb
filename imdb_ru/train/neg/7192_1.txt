After 5 minutes of this film, I suffered from hyperventilation, shaking and writhing from pain. And not in a good way. The story of a troupe of idiotic children making phone calls to a psycho, which is always a good idea. It turns out that psychos do not like playing phone calls, because after 2 minutes he kills poor mum and dad Williams at their door. Well, skip 15 years ahead and guess what? Still playing phone calls to people. Yes, you might think that a terrible murder would prevent them from doing it again, but no. So after about two hours and too many screams, I realized that this film gave me only a terrible taste in my mouth and a strong desire to commit suicide. This piece of shit doesn't even have to laugh at the stupid staging, “acting,” or shrinking Rutger's career. I love horrible horror movies, but this is the most unsatisfactory part I've ever seen. Just do not.
