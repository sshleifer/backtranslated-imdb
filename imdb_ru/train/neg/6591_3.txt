This is the sound of Stan and Ollie spinning in their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not enumerate the main shortcomings of this film, since they are so obvious that, of course, they don’t speak. Small things like the New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy, despite the fact that the stars were dead for more than thirty years when it was done. Little things like that. <br /> <br /> It would be a bad idea to have actors playing jesters, simply called Laurel and Hardy. No matter how bad it is, it might work. For a really bad idea, try playing two actors to emulate a duet. Well, they can claim to be nephews, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Well, forget his idiotic "cousin Larry" in "Perfect Strangers" and look at him in "The Real Romance." Here, however, it stinks. It’s probably not all his fault, and, as a director and cast, everyone who is better than the material — he probably just desperately needed money. There are those who argue that it is difficult for Americans to master an effective English accent. This case did not help Pinchot here. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in Stan's trademark screech does he come close, though, since the screech overdidded the fatigue point, which had nothing to write about home. Gailard Sartaine looks a little better than Ollie, although it's like saying that it is worse to step on dog dirt or hit the ball? <br /> <br /> Remember the originals with their fractions of a second, intuitive teamwork and innate appeal? Well, it is completely absent, replaced by two stupid old men and jokes, so unfortunate that it was possible to park the bus through the spaces. Whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up on several panels, this one has several drawn-out mummies of hokum (and what a lousy name!) That are mixed with the boys fraternity script. I cannot say that I have seen each of the 108 films of Laurel and Hardy, but I am sure that it is safe to say that even their nadir was ahead of that level. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main problem is that the originals played on their own, or at least used their own accents. This, at least, seemed natural and unbridled, unlike the contrived caricatures that give Pinchot and Sartain. And since when did Stan make Malapropism, and so much at the same time? “I was going to give you a cremation while standing”; "I would marinate my friend." Stop this! <br /> <br /> The only noticeable point is the mention of the clown Bozo, the cartoon character who shared with the comic Larry Harmon L & H. Harmon, of course, acquired the copyright name (as unpleasant to see ® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this parody. <br /> <br /> Questions abound. Will Stan and Ollie become an asshole if they were alive today? Will they be glass mummies with broken bottles? Was the wall hit on the genitals with a spear and ended with a big CGI finale? Let's hope not. <br /> <br /> I once laughed, but I think it was just a disbelief at how awful it all was. Why was this film made first? Who do the manufacturers think will like it? Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, an absolute disgust that I was tired of watching in just five minutes. Approximately as fun as catching a head in a vice, while hot poker and stinging nettle are forcibly inserted into the anus.
