As a fan of books about Sookie Stackhouse, I believe that this series is their completely rough presentation. Vampire Bill does not look good and looks much older than described in the book. I found that they made the already amazingly colorful characters seem very stupid and vulgar. One of the things that I liked about the books is that, despite all the crap she’s going through, Suki is always a lady, and yet in the series she’s not at all like that. Not only that, but the prejudices shown in the series are not so widespread in the books. I did not expect an exact copy of the books, but at least I expected them to be used in the series.
