An interesting story about a soldier in the war who misses saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is being pursued by this event, although he did save many other children in captivity. In the film, the head flashes, and this soldier is now a teacher in high school, mostly run by police officers patrolling corridors, bathrooms, and even classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison, and most children pay very little attention to their teachers or principals. Dolph Lundgren, (Sam Decker) plays a soldier / schoolteacher and decides that he is going to quit teaching and move to another area. However, the director asks him to have a detention class as his last teacher duty. It is at this point that the whole hell breaks out in the film, and the story becomes a complete bomb. Try it if you decide to view it!
