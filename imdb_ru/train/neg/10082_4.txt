I laughed at this whole rotten movie. This is so incredible. A woman after many years of marriage leaves her husband, she has a breakdown in front of the real estate office. What goes? The office manager goes out and offers her a job !!! Fun! The next thing you know, two women go for it. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing believable in this film “Lifetime for Women without anything better” Awkward dialogue like “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life feeling that I had a chance to be happy and didn’t use it” doesn’t help. There is a rich, distant mother that doesn’t approve of her daughter’s new relationship. The cheeky black maid is incredible that a movie with a cheeky black maid was made in 2003. Hattie McDaniel must be turning into a grave. The woman has a husband who is worried and wants to care for snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No cliché did not go unnoticed.
