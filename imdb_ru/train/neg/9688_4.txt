Greenway films seem smart, erudite and innovative. And yet his style and grammar produce and remind viewers films made in the cinema era of the First World War: personnel composition, use of the middle frame, static camera. It may be good to rub against major films with this style, but this is not new. Perhaps, like that other "innovator", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than he looks to the future as a genuine innovator. <br /> <br /> But Greenwayâ€™s biggest drawback is that he cannot write. His dialogue and even the structure of the plot are mechanical and logical, but without the vital force of another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this weakness is most obvious is in his humor, which is balanced and logical, so the joke is dead before it is delivered. The result is boredom: if it is not funny, it did not help: ask the comedian to justify his actions if the public does not respond. Perhaps a well-read director could learn something from Freud about humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenway over the years has manipulated his actors to work like clones. They speak along lines with bored, self-satisfied air, like self-conceited adolescents. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its design and lighting, is terrible.
