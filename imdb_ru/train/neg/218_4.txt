*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds good, and if you read the novel, then you probably expect a deep and intense film that can give some insight into some interesting and insufficiently studied human relationships. <Br /> <br /> True, the script tries to do this, the director tries to do it, but the main cast fails. Maria's acting is so dry that she lacks any feelings, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems nervous because of the camera. Her only scene that truly feels is nearing its end when a friend leaves her. <br /> <br /> John seems even more tense than Mary, and even worse, she doesn’t look natural at all. Maria had an attitude, even if it was artificially pushed to the evidence, but she had it, and her character gained some confidence. And even worse, we have no understanding about her: where did she come from, how did she become involved in lesbian relationships, how did these relationships develop? We only get a little bit from her parents, and their relationship seems to be “here”: they have content and an end, but no beginning. Like her partner Maria, she has only one scene that is really touching, the scene in which she shoots the character Maria Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this film (except for the owner of the house, it plays beautifully there)) who can prove some kind of acting talent. He has a relationship with his character, and it suits him. Only once or twice he seems to hesitate (the scene at his parents' dinner, he tries to be obvious when it is not needed at all). <br /> <br /> I like this story, everything is all right with Tudor Kirila. The owner of the house actually acts, and Puya sets out a few lines with style, but this does not save the film. It is unfortunate that the whole campaign had a huge potential, and Romanian cinema could use a film on this subject. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to be more credible than indecent. a secondary lack of feeling (well, Mary’s conversational interludes are a good attempt in this direction) the lesbian relationship of Mary and John. I am very sorry that I spent the money on the ticket, I would prefer to see it without leaving my room.
