I hear rumors of an upcoming "Leonard Nimy showing a Blu-ray disc." Taking into account the achievements over the past 25 years, starting with Steady-cam and CGI, it will be interesting to see whether it is possible to revive the franchise. I just hope that this will help eliminate the unpleasant taste that I have left during this whole Magnavision demonstration fiasco. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates Betamax VCR" was a brilliant milestone in the history of entertainment. After the preliminary "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates a compact cassette" and the completely tasteless "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates 8-track tape", who would have expected such a nice piece of cinema? I'm crying now, just thinking about it.
