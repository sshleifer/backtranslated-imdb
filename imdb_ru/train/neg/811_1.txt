The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and watched it several times. And although I know that sequels are usually not as good as the original, I certainly did not expect such a bomb. Romance was flat, the sight was old, there was simply no conversational humor. It may not have been the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's close.
