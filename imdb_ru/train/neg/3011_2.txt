I was very excited to see this film, anticipating a visual excursion on the balance of artistic beauty and nature, in which there are wisdom such as “Rivers and tides”. However, this is not what I received. Instead, I get a rather boring film about how the human industry is harmful to nature. This is certainly a rather unorthodox statement. <br /> <br /> The photographer does not seem to agree with the aesthetic qualities of his images and the alleged “ethical” responsibility that he has for workers who occasionally inhabit images along the periphery. And, frankly, the images were not so impressive. And, according to this “artist”, the scale is the basis of what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In every way a silly movie. For people who would like to feel better about their environmental awareness ... but not for those who would like to think about the complexities of the problems associated with it.
