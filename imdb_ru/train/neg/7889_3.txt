I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I am really disappointed by this. I'm not quite sure why anyone made such a film. It was a bit interesting, but I feel that the people doing it had a lot of disagreement about what they were doing. Monday the writer was in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the guy who gets the coffee; and so on. It seems that they really wanted to make a couple of different films, but they only had the time and money to make them. <br /> <br /> Someone else said that acting was really good, but I would like to disagree. On the other hand, if the actors were able to remain calm during filming, they may be better actors than I trust them. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the film will be a mystery ... something like historical law and order or national wealth. It starts that way, but then, from nowhere, it turns to a bad episode of the Twilight Zone, or ... what was this other show that wasnâ€™t so good ... Bad episode of External Limits. <br /> <br /> My main claim to the film is that it is played like that. There is an evil guy with pointy white hair. There is a love interest that, when she first appears, the wind really blows through her hair. Seriously. As soon as you realize that this is a Christian film, the end is also quite easy to see. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was unsuccessful, especially in the first scenes - a way to make your best foot forward. It was not atrocious for most of the film, but there was an occasional ridiculously poor shot of an old lady praying, hands in a dark room, while lightning strikes - a thing that just makes you a little embarrassed to watch a movie
