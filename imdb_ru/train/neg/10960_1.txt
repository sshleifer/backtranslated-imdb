Oh! They are not much worse than this terrible adaptation of the favorite novel by S. S. Lewis. While the adaptation is very true for the novel, the game is simply terrible, and the scenery and special effects on the scale are equivalent to a school play. I read that the budget for this mini-series was the greatest that BBC ever gave at the time, but surely they could collect a little more than $ 2, for which, it seems, the film was shot. The worst of all the consequences is Mr. Beaver. I know that computer effects were not at the required level or even cost effective at the time, but the man from the costume shop in the costume was terrible. Itâ€™s better to just cut a character from a movie than to do it for a role! Avoid this at all costs.
