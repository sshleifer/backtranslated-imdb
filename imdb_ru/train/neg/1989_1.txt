I would like to give this movie zero, but it was not a choice !! This movie sucks !!! Women cannot act. I should have known that it would be bad when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could believe that I had not changed the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black women as shooters in Western times is ridiculous. it's not just a race, it's also a floor. The combination of these two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some people in the film are not bad actors / actresses, but the film itself was terrible. it was not believable like a movie. It may be “interesting” for a certain group of people, but I am not in this group. lol and using a great line from a great, great movie ... "That's all I have to say about it."
