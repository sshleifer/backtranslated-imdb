Not being familiar with American TV channels, when I clicked on it with my relative's cable, at first I thought it was just a low-cost sci-fi film, then after a couple of minutes I began to think that it could be smart Satire about the worst excesses of Christian fundamentalism and then it dawned on me - my God, these people are serious! It's been a long time since I saw something so unintentionally funny. I did not dare to write a review about this, fearing to offend the believers, but then I saw other reviews and thought: hey, they can accept it. A challenging philosophical puzzle: how do you make a film that criticizes films without actually showing what you are criticizing? The answer is: make it so that the only people who appreciate it are people who hate films that you criticize. I suppose that some liberals (pah! Spit when you say that!) May be offended by directors' contempt for viewers who are not obsessed with the J **** C ***** myth, but I donâ€™t mind - it was so damn funny!
