Contains spoilers The plot of the film can be summarized in several sentences: Three guys go hunting in the woods. Two of them, along with other people, get a head shot without giving a reason. The last guy can stand free, scream and do anything without being shot. He passes through the old factory, and evil people easily go straight into his sight. Villains are comfortably dressed in black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> That's the whole story, not summarized, but in detail. Everything is stretched out with the guy standing, ringing the doorbell. We are waiting with him. A long shot of guys bored in the woods and sleeping. We can take a nap with them. One long shot of following a female runner might be redeemed if we could see her ass or tits bouncing around. <br /> <br /> There is less dialogue there than at the Terminator, and this is not because there are so many actions. Characters just don't talk. And then they do not even have something banal to say: "I will come back." If my friend was shooting this at the weekend, I would be hurting for him, because it would have been a feat to sort out the camera control. Paying rent for this DVD is completely inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is a little funny is that the director tells how the local police did not understand that they shot and treated them like a random guy who walked with a gun. If they were shooting this, I would be sure that it would be more fun to watch a movie than a movie.
