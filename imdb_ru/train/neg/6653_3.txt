I just watched this movie, and I must say that it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eve (Ellen Phiaestad) cannot play at all. She read her lines very unnaturally, and she had a very unnatural facial expression throughout the entire film. Rosanna Munter, who played Peter on the other hand, is natural. She played her part with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we have seen it many, many times before. She breaks up, he finds another, she is jealous, he breaks up with another girl, and as a result they end up together again. There were no surprises, everyone knew that Eve would be parted, and that Adam would "connect" with Petra. The only thing that nobody saw was that Petra told Adam to go to Eve for a party. She became very serious, which is the side of Petra, which the audience had not previously seen in the film, and told him to return the heart of Eve, which was very nice. <br /> <br /> Apart from Rosanna Munter, there is not one actor who gives an unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend it!
