I caught Lost Afflictions at the New York Film Festival and video, and I think I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, this is just another Visual FX business card. The story sucks pretty. Due to poor lighting and camera work, as well as poor editing and music, the film seems to be of poor quality. <br /> <br /> Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have the best plots, and the rest of the technical products will be on par with FX! You can no longer just enjoy the fun of FX in shorts, it's been 5 years since the "405" made a big splash. At least this short, fast, cool and even a bit funny! None of this can be said about Lost Afflictions.
