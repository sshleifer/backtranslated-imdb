I bought this movie in a trash can at Rogers Video for $ 2. I enjoy a good B-movie from time to time and thought it looked like a good one. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty cliche "1970s" and pretty good for that. Unfortunately, the storyline is difficult to follow, and little is happening in the film. In fact, I turned it off after viewing for 45 minutes and a week later I realized that I had to watch it all, no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> There are good moments in the movie, but you have to wait, wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you like movies B, this can only be for you, just warn you that the movie is slow and doesnâ€™t really happen, and I also did not mention the storyline ... <br /> < br />
