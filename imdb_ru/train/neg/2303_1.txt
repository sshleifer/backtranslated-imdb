In addition to people, apparently buying in this trash! As such shows have shown, like “Moral Eagle”, even if you tried to make the most outrageous, unbelievable parody of evangelism that you could think of, it will not come close to the fun of this show. It's hard to say what happens when you watch it. Is this a news show? Talk show? Who knows!? They start with a report on various international news articles, but in seemingly random moments, the news is interrupted by this strange, troll-like, little man with a forehead, which is most of his face, muttering, laughing and generally creepy. <Br /> <br /> At first glance, Pat Robertson doesn't even look like such a bad guy. He just seems to be senile, but harmless, old cub, stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who called for murder, who supported and offered assistance not to one, but to TWO suicidal dictators who illegally used donations to launch diamond mines who SUPPORT forced abortions in China, and who regularly mean that Caucasians male Caucasians are superior to all other races. <br /> <br /> However, all of this would be amusing, except that he seems to have a large enough fan base to hold his little show on the air 40 years later (either this or enough money to bribe some television executives who don't care what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes anxious when you realize that some people have to watch it somewhere and cling to every word. Even when Robertson repeatedly showed how corrupt he is, people still listen to him. I do not know whether this is funny or scary. I think a healthy mix of both.
