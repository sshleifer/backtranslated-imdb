I'm scared to think about what people think about environmentalists after seeing this powerful, preaching cinematic trash. Starlight, endowed with a sufficient number of Indian imitators and jesters with space brothers to supply the store with a new era, makes anyone who does not care about the planet look like an idiot with a crunch. ? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to lead a flute-playing underwear model in a mystical search to prevent the impending ecological collapse of the Earth. But first, they must defeat the evil alien, who is not at all like a refugee from a bar on Castro Street. Fortunately, they have a mystical grandfather, Willy Nelson, who helps (which looks a bit embarrassed by the process, and should also be) along with buckets of cheap F / X and a lot of senselessly swelling music. <br /> <br /> Of course, the clumsy script helps to hide the banal plot of the film and the staggering pace, but this is only the top of this melting iceberg of the film. Anyone who is involved in this film should withdraw their trade union cards until they complete a real environmental science course.
