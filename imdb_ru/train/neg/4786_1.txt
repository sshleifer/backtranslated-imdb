I despise horror movies, it's not a secret. No conspiracy, bad behavior and gallons of blood are the main components of these movie mistakes, and this “film” is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually run this garbage. (This particular trash was released right on the video, as I recall.) Since mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to this other movie, I say this: all Phantasm films, all Jason films, Freddie films, Chucky films and most Myers can be summed up in one word: HORRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
