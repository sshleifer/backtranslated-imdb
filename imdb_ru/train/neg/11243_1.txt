In short, this film is completely useless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a film in terms of what someone in the early 1900s could have thought about the future. An interesting idea, but the absence of a convincing story or characters does not allow us to ever suspend our disbelief, so the idea just falls through. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the whole movie was made with the actors in front of the green screens, and we should be impressed. But as a graphics specialist, excessive mitigation has become an obvious obstacle to hiding the difficult problem of sharp edges with green screening. The color is mostly washed out without any significant effect, except for a reduction in visual quality. And I do not understand why someone would consider something rendered in this film as innovative. In any case, the ridiculous retrograde graphics lowered the bar for really bad graphics - they do not even correspond to the ancient graphics of the Jurassic Park. Models for robots were so simple, simple and unforgiving. There were a lot of strange prehistoric animals on this island, but they are not explained in any way. <br /> <br /> History is terrible to the limit. In fact, I can not believe that I did not just come out of this film. The relationship between Polly and Joe is not motivated, and throughout the film is based on distrust and deception. Why is the Morris Paley character even there? We are by no means convinced that Joe is heroic - I mean that he flies on an airplane and saved one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little time on the screen, so why should we make sure that Joe wants to save him? Who were the Nepalese who locked Joe and Polly in the mine and why did they do it (remembering that the entire operation at Totenkopf was robotic)? <br /> <br /> Holes in the plot: (1) Why did the character Bai Ling (the serious fall of her great character in Crow) stop the robots that captured Joe? They searched for bottles and did not find them. (2) Why the hell would Dex be captured but not killed (he doesn't know or doesn't know about the bottles, and the bad guys didn't know that Polly had the bottles, and she was associated with Joe and, therefore, with Dex) ? (3) Polly points out that “they” know nothing about Totenkopf, but she has some secret source about him that contains what seems to him to be a rather complete FBI-style file. (4) Empty space on the map, as described by the Nepalese - if they know everything about this mysterious area, then why the hell is their map empty at this place? (5) At some point, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) - Joe is given new clothes that are identical to his old clothes, but Polly is forced to wear some kind of strange looking bulky dress, then in the same sequence continuously Polly returns his original clothes. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far should I switch my brain to watch this shit? <br /> <br /> We must be delighted with overproduced music, even when nothing interesting or distantly exciting is happening on the screen. <Br /> <br /> And the current one? Should we be impressed with a bunch of bad British accents? Which character is not annoying? I think that Lin Bai's dialogue was probably the best in the entire film (it does not have a single line). The dialogue was not camped and did not even rise to the level of cheese. This is just bad and annoying. These people are not heroes or irresistible; these are the people whom you would try to ignore or dissociate if you ever had the misfortune to meet them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film gets a rating above average here IMDb. IMHO, he must compete with “Batman forever” in the bottom hundred of all time.
