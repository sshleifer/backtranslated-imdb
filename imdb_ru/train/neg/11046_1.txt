This is probably one of the worst films in history. Bad game, bad special effects, bad story, everything is bad. In the last 15 minutes, a cyborg cat appears that confuses everything. Malcom MacDowell must have had to make a home payment, because otherwise he would have to sell himself on Hollywood Boulevard to pay the bill. I just do not know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this shit and be able to look yourself in the mirror every morning. I could make the best special effects in my bath. No continuity. The editor must have been sleeping or on drugs - this is so bad. Act. Do I need to smoke to be bad? The gun either shoots a blue flame or bullets, decide. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it confuses Whay it's called Seadly Wake 2013. It has nothing to do with the movie.
