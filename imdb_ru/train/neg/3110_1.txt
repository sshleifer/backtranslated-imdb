I usually go to this site before going to the movies, since I like to see what other people think about the film. I read a lot of reviews that said: “Thriller, not a horror movie.” This prompted me to try this movie. I really have to disagree with these “thriller / horror” statements, as this was not one of them! I almost went and asked for my money back, and if you have a lot of reviewers liked this stuff ... well, you must be easily satisfied! At the end of the film, the people behind me said loudly: "What a waste of time," and I turned to them and replied: "I could not sum up better." I kept waiting for something to happen ... but it did not. There was the potential for many good scares (or thrills, if you will), but nothing happened. Williams did an excellent job with this role, but I felt that he was replaced by a bad script, which was idle and did not lead to anything. Save your money, this is turkey, which will be sold in the near future in the DVD store, where you can buy!
