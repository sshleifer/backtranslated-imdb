it's just ordinary Indian trash that turns into a movie, since we, the Hindus, can proudly boast that we have the biggest film industry, but it is also the worst. <br /> <br /> As in other poor countries, there may be films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies, and we just keep pumping out trash. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, look at the brilliant films that they have, and we get shit like Kissna! <br /> <br /> To find real people, itâ€™s not surprising that the international community as a whole is laughing at the Indian cinema.
