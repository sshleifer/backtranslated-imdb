It is assumed that this film will be a “frivolous” story about Santa Claus and his “magic and mystical” miracles. But instead, it seems absolutely creepy. In this film, two things that seem terrifying to me are: 1) what Santa looks like. “Have you ever seen a more awful looking Santa Claus?” and 2) the weird dances of Pich's “evil reputation of Satan” are simply disgusting to watch. Watch this movie only if it is the MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh. I can't believe this is a kids movie.
