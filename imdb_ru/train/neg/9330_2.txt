Saw this movie recently and had high hopes. Not so much on the basis of a director who has never made a cinematic release before, but more on the basis of his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (starring in The Double Body, Brian De Palma's masterpiece) were featured in great films. But not together, and this fact has not changed because of this. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that can make him a little attractive is the choice of the places where he was shot. In my humble opinion: do not waste your time on this.
