This was allocated to fans, since the match “winner gets everything” occurred between two separate “companies” (World Wrestling Federation and Alliance): the union of former WCW and ECW superstars. Because the final match will lead the superior company. It was a team match, the fighters were limited to throwing opponents from each side of the ring to the other, each wrestler comes to the conclusion that in order to weaken his opponents and strengthen the fight, intervention is necessary. Each wrestler simply beats the opponent with punches, special movement and marks in the partner. The storyline was previously stained by Vince's ploy that a member of the Alliance would be deceptive and join WWF. With this statement, it was obvious that WWF would be Overall: a very innovative storyline, but poor performance, which is not a disadvantage of the fighters, because the match format is a tag team. The remaining matches are just disgusting: <br /> <br /> Edge vs. T est: Test's powerful “big boot”, but it didn’t show the true talents of both stars. <br /> <br /> Al Snow vs Christian: a good match, but unnecessary for pay-per-view <br /> <br >> Taji v William Regal: the worst match of the night <br /> <br /> Immunity Battle Royal : watching this match was extremely interesting, but since the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event, only the wrestler, who characteristically appears on the "Heat" and is probably a WCW light heavyweight diverter (i.e., a hurricane that is simply hired as an artist) <br /> <br /> Hardy Boys vs. Dudley Boys: Best match of the night: Jeff Hardy performed “Svantonskaya b ombu "from the top of the cell and through the wooden table and Matt wedged into the cell, which seemed extremely painful. <br /> <br /> Since Stone Cold was the WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was the Hardcore champion, and Kurt Angle was the mole in the alliance. All the main stars in the main event in the Alliance faction got a job after the outcome of the match, with the exception of Booker T., who recently attacked the fighter at Raw and will inevitably get a job. Shane McMahon would somehow return to television, and everyone wanted to witness the fall and death of the Alliance to see how Stone Cold remained without work. WWF did much better. A match in which all the tilts were brought into one faction would be better, but what happened to the matches in Lara and Iron Man?
