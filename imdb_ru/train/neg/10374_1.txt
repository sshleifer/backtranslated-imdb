The family moves to an old house in Japan. But there is a snag that is being pursued (BOO !!!). Oh, did not want to jump you. This is just a review. Take it easy. Um, now the old samurai is stalking him anyway, who killed his wife and her lover in slow motion. This naturally makes the 3-minute scene stretch to 7 or 8. Horrible play. Terrible story. But how bad can it be, you ask? Well, it was VERY bad that my brain began to melt and seep through my nose in thoughtful drops. It was VERY bad when Doug McClure appeared on the screen, and I prayed that I would have memories of the Little Wonder almost the same damn show & I can better hum the theme of "little miracle") There are films that are so bad that they are good. this is not one of those <br /> <br /> where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My rating: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori becomes topless Susan George gets two love scenes (one naked, one just topless) <br /> <br />
