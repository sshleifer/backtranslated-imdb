This film was awarded the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the past few weeks, I have seen dozens of nominees and recipients of this award in the past 30 years, and I really think that this film may be just the worst of them - but it was not just a candidate, but won !! I guess 1989 must have been a terrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The film shows a group of characters that are a bit like the lean Uncle of Fester. It seems that these are simple hinge shapes that move with the help of stop motion animation. All are identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each one has a different number on his back. They all stand on a large platform that is suspended in space as if by magic. Each has a pole, and they are also a box on the platform. The platform begins to bend slightly, and in response, the men move, trying to balance the platform. It goes on and on and on and on. The only relief from this boredom is when one of them behaves rather disgusting towards the end, but this is not enough to even laugh at it funny. In addition to the motion-stopping animation, this short film is nothing interesting for me .... NOTHING. <br /> <br /> By the way, the excellent shorty KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989, and I have no idea why I wasn't among the nominees. It was a BIG short and was much better than any of the candidates this year or a year earlier. Perhaps the success of Pixar in previous years led to a biased attitude towards them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny that it seems almost criminal to ignore it. Can Pixar not enter it? This seems unlikely.
