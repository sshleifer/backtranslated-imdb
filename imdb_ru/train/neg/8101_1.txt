It is often said that films never compare with the original book. Well, in this case, not only the film is not as good as the book, but it is an insult to the book. I would prefer Milan Kundera’s novel to catch fire than into this “something” that the director probably calls “adaptation.” <br /> <br /> The whole beautiful philosophy that asks: “Is it better to carry a heavy burden on your shoulders or cope with an unbearable lightness of being? put off to the side, and instead, all that is involved in the film is the sexual adventures of Daniel Day Lewis (I can't say, Thomas) with his dumb wife, mistress and other mistresses. Francois Truffaut has already said: bad directors make bad films. Do not waste your time and money. Instead, read the book, it's really worth it.
