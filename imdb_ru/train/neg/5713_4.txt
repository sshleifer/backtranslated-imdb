There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on creating pleasant, intelligent characters. As for attractiveness, the main characters in “Say Yes” are a strange married couple. Beautifully made. Unfortunately, they are stupid to the limit. Let's calculate how badly they cope with the pursuit of the pursuer. <br /> <br /> 1. After the hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him which hotel you stayed in when you drop him off. <br /> <br /> 2. Kill the pursuer in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, allowing him to press charges of assault. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not worry, telling the police about the persecutor, and simply assume (for no apparent reason) that he was bribed by the police. <br /> <br /> 4. Trying to escape, try to hide your lady as much as possible so that the pursuer can kidnap her. <br /> <br /> 5. After receiving help from someone to find the pursuer after your wife’s abduction, be sure to send them as soon as possible so that you can meet him one-on-one. It makes no sense to be unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I would never have expected that any person would be protected from several mistakes in these stressful conditions, but the characters in “Say Yes” are so sleepy and make so many incredible mistakes that it is virtually impossible for the viewer take care of their safety, as they are victims of their own affairs. It kills the enjoyment of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> If you're curious, the writers didn’t stop at stupid characters. Since they themselves are undoubtedly crazy for writing this crappy holiday, they decided to make the situation so absurdly unreal that the whole sense of reality would disappear. <br /> <br /> 1. Stalker kills a policeman at a police station ?? while the main character sleeps at a distance of no more than ten feet. <br /> <br /> 2. Stalker is involved in all sorts of dubious actions in broad daylight and around many people, but no one except the married couple notices his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. Stalker is experiencing an absurd amount of violence that would kill any person. <br /> <br /> 4. The scenes of "suspense" had no imagination. In fact, some scenes were direct looting from American films. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing was the decapitation at the end, which was rather cruel because it was inflicted on the wife. It’s too bad that the filmmakers followed this up with an incredibly stupid ending that comes out of left field. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the Koreans behind the creation of “Say Yes” should be ashamed of themselves. Even better, they should just move to California and get a job with people who make films with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
