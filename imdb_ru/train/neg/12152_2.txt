Some reporters and their attendants are trying to tell the truth about the zombie epidemic, despite the "government controlling the media." The filmmakers do not understand that George Romero’s zombie films worked only because he subtly kept his policy against most of his films (“Land of the Dead”). This satire is almost as thin as a brick in the face or a bullet in the head, more suitable for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction? Is there something nuanced in various commercials that are related to the film? Nope In addition, the acting is equally terrible, the characters are completely unattractive, and the plot is meaningless. Put it all together and you’ll get the worst, most incompetent zombie movie ever since C.H.U.D. 2 raised his hideous head. <br /> <br /> My rating: D
