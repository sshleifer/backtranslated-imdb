Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name in the legendary entertainment program Full Moon. Unfortunately, his arrival at this independent studio occurred at a time when the budget and production figures were the lowest in recent years. However, in his short career, Hamilton has established himself as a creative director who manages to create ingenious and original stories. Now this does not mean that his films are good, but at least they differ from the usual horror genres. <br /> <br /> In his debut of “Bleed,” Hamilton presents us with a creative twist on the slasher subgenre. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) - a young woman who finally got the job of her dreams. Not only that, but it seems that she also found a boyfriend in Shona (Danny Volsk), it seems that life is finally smiling at Maddy after many sad events. While they were not at a party with Sean's friends, they told her that they had created a “club” in which members must kill someone in order to enter. <br /> <br /> Obviously, they are joking, but Maddy is desperate to fit in that she is actually killing someone. After this event, someone starts killing the rest of the "club" one by one. Maddie has to figure out what's going on, because anyone can be a murderer, including herself. <br /> <br /> Maddie is a very interesting character who is beautifully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. This is a very interesting twist in the genre, when the lead actress is part of the suspects. The concept is so original, and Rochon's game is so good that it is a real shame that Hamilton did not develop the whole story any better. From time to time the film seems rather slow, and in general it is a sensation that can be found in a bad movie. This is a good idea wasted. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors are strange in the sense that all female actors are very good. while the male cast is terribly bad. Danny Volske is awfully wooden, and his game as yuppie is pretty stereotypical. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. In addition, there are a lot of nudity (both men and women), and the cast is very good, so this is really a plus. <br /> <br /> Low-budget hurts the movie in the effects section, since there are very few bloody scenes and not very graphic scenes (probably because they will look bad); however, given the budget, the film at least looks good. <br /> <br /> Hamilton’s recent effort, the sexual exploitation company Delta Die!, is the best film ever created better and more generally ridiculous. Although this film is not as bad as other well-known films, it still has many flaws and may be of interest only to Debbie Rochon fans or fans of independent off-budget films. 4/10
