The deadly beauty and death blows of Charlotte make the film cooler than it would otherwise have been. The story is so poor, and Charlotte's character dies so stupidly that you wonder if they thought about this ending for this film. I wish someone could say that an alternative ending exists, but I'm afraid not. As for the rest of the cst, well, I would say that they simply did not act very well; although the blame must be placed on a bad script. This film reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies absurdly, as she was the only one who stole the show during the entire movie. I could give this movie 2/5
