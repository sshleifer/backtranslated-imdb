Here is an indie film that I really would love to love, but ultimately I couldnâ€™t. The absence of the script (boldly proclaimed in the main headlines) really reveals and kills the picture. This story is a meaningless mess that you should not try to figure out. I quickly got bored for 10 minutes, then I survived the remaining 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before hitting the head, stopped to (fortunately) get to the end ... even that was not worth the extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE is clearly trying to be smart, picking up his best episodes from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, OZARK SAVAGE has very little that has not been done before and is better. This film would be much more fun if it was short for 10-20 minutes, but as a feature, it just feels soft and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I fully understand the financial reasons, which, I believe, were motivated by their stretching to more than 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinauer makes a big promise, and I wish him good luck.
