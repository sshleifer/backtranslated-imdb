This film is a 90-minute Ramones concert with short periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What is this school? <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of the Ramones, and neither do I repeat, DO NOT waste your time like me. It is completely impossible from beginning to end. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to love them in this movie. There is no plot in this movie. As for the young comedies, with this you clean the bottom of the barrel.
