This film should not be classified as a movie. Although he is more than 10 years old, he never needed to receive funding, and this has a detrimental effect on the Australian film industry, which now produces such brilliant films as Dish. music cannot act, stupid, not music, the storyline is completely absent and this is a struggle to sit down. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. This is a waste of your time.
