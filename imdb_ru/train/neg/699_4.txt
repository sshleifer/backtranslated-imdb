This is probably one of the harshest fraudulent films ever, badly played and poorly written. <br /> <br /> SUBJECT Five students who stayed on vacation during the holidays close the hostel, but someone has a design and he starts killing one of them, the main suspect is the creepy land keeper John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or it could be one of five characters. <br /> <br /> WORKS Not so bad, not so great, except for Daphne Zungia, who is dying. too quickly and should have become the main character, and the rest are quite boring, although the main character Laura Lapinsky sometimes has her charm, and in the end she is sorry. <br /> <br /> The killings can't really understand why they banned it, the killings look mostly fake, one guy had his arm cut in half at first, which looks very fake, but others are pretty nasty, like one girl pushes a car with heads, one girl gets boiled alive, and the other burned alive. <br /> <br /> OVERALL Not a very good slasher I would be much better
