This film was a complete disappointment for me in Cai Ming-liang. It oozes laziness from every frame. So I'm not going to analyze it either. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If there is a drought in the room, why do we see cityscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if this should mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirst reports a thirst for intimacy, and watermelon is a trivial substitute for sex). Or it’s just a matter of making lousy films, let alone being consistent. <br /> <br /> 2. We don’t get to know what happened to pornographic actresses, why she is unconscious or, apparently, dead. It seems that the question does not matter as long as the message about the highest alienation is successfully (= bombed) delivered, but in retrospect its inert body turns out to be a cheap dramaturgical trick, a pretext ?? as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity in which he is engaged. <br /> <br /> 3. Nothing is expressed in this film that Antonioni did not express better 40 years ago ?? and without unnecessary humiliation of their actors. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical numbers (reworked from “Holes”) resembled the idea of ​​the pupil’s artistic counterpoint, performed at the same high school level. If it was a point, then the point sucked.
