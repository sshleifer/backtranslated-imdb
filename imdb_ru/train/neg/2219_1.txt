Perhaps one of the most overvalued so-called classic horrors ever created, “Halloween” includes the unforgettable Michael Myers and the excellent play of Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, the repeatability factor is very close to zero, since unpardonable time is spent on dullness / culmination of real events. <br /> <br /> This is a movie from which you can get into microwave popcorn and not miss anything. <br /> <br /> As it gave rise to so many sequels, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank God Rob Zombie does this. And in general, I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> Of course, he more than compensates for all random spaces that fill the time, with some fancy points of interest that the original is badly missing. <br /> <br /> This is a film that we think we like, very much like the way we are taught that we MUST enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Don't think this is a classic.
