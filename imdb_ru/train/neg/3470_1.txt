As with most of Ben Affleck’s films, comedy is dry and the story is predictable. This is if you want to call it a story. Many questions remained without thoughts at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining better. I say this because it would mean that the torture would go on longer. As for any of Ben Affleck's failures, this is no exception and can only be experienced by other actors. Even then, acting was mostly far-fetched and implausible. A trip down memory lane with actors that I had not seen for years was not worth the price of admission. Everyone thought that this needed to be said; they, too, quickly joined the ranks of the “former”. My choice was to wait for the repair of my car or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. In general, I would have laughed ... mostly because this is all I got from it.
