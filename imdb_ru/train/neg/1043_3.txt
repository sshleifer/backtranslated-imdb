What a bad, bad movie !!! I can not believe all the hype that was put forward because of this pretentious, amateur justification of this film !! I left the theater to the end, stunned by how bad the direction and cinematography work of this film was !! And read adoring paeny, who argue that in this film there is truth and reality, when all that is in reality is a bold attempt to pull the wool out of the eyes of reviewers and festivals, being cheap and unattractive. <br /> <br /> At least this film showed me once and for all that the Sundance Festival was a complete joke, and that the film shown here is more a label of bad filmmaking than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You want your time back! I know what I did.
