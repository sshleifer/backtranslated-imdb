LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is a really disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI, and it was really good, but this one really makes you disappoint ........................... ..... ....... <br /> <br /> This film really spends your time and money. I went with my friend to this film on the first day of its release, and both missed the cinema .......................... ..... .......................... <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT was very small and useless in this film. I think that SANJI-DUTT reduced the role of HARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The character of the film is also not so good as previous ............. <br /> <br /> VERY VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
