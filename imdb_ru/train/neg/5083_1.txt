I find it rather useless to comment on this “film” for the simplest reason, for which he has nothing to comment. It looks like a rotten egg, which has nothing to show the world, except for the fact that it is rotten, like other endless numbers of eggs were before. But as the commentary is obligatory for such a grand insignificance ... <br /> <br /> “Dirt” is definitely the right word to describe this film, created just like any other Romanian “film”, shot by Lucian Pintile, who insists on portraying the so-called “Romanian reality” after the communist era (from 1990 to the present). <br /> <br /> It is not recommended for anyone outside of Romania, as for others (who have recently found an amateur camera, the lack of a plot). lack of directorial / acting quality, etc., noise, etc. as fashionable and even artistic): watch and enjoy this “movie” (as I know you will do), but do a favor to other well-meaning members of IMDb, do not write an online review, because it will be misleading, annoying and ultimately waste your time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film (among other things) has some kind of value, educational for it serves as an example for: “How NOT to make a film”
