Raymond Burr plays the role of a lawyer, who was involved in the murder of his best friend (Dick Vorand) due to his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). It was a whole year before he began acting in the Perry Mason film, so the film could be of particular interest to his fans if he inspired him to be casting. <br /> <br /> There are not so many things here that, although interesting. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one-dimensional, and the motives behind her crime are completely obvious. There is an interesting presentation of Lamont Johnson as an artist who is also in love with the “femme fatale”, but the character Burr is quite simple. Frankly, it’s strange to see an actor like Barr, who shoots these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his frozen role doesn’t fit his character here as well as in most films in which I saw him. In fact, there is no mystery, and it is assumed that all the uncertainty is associated with the title of the film and the way the character Berra sets up the character Lansbury to attract attention (double danger does not allow her to be judged again for the initial murder, presumably). I believe he does this with a very large tape recorder, which she does not notice when she enters the room. <br /> <br /> A few, perhaps unintentionally funny moments, and basically everything else could be done on TV.
