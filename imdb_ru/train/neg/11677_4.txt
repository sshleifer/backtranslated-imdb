Critics have talked about this to death, to be honest, this is not so great. Of course, “CHAOS” and “INSIDE MAN” are literally the same movie, only with variations in obscurity. But I found Chaos more enjoyable, because it was a fast paced, sort of stupid Swordfish movie. The reason why this film is more popular is that it was released in the States, and Chaos was shown worldwide at film festivals and in foreign theaters, but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and the USA. <br /> <br /> It’s true that this film has a lot of homage to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that doesn’t mean that it’s nice to watch this film. <br /> <br /> See if there is nothing else on the TV, but you may get bored after a while.
