How could 4 out of 16 previous voters give this film 10? How can more than half of previous voters give him 7 or higher? Who is voting here? I can only assume that it is primarily children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad film in all respects. The story is stupid; acting is even difficult to imagine as acting; faceless characters; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this rainy day on a science fiction channel. In the sad case when it is ever relayed, I suggest you read the book instead.
