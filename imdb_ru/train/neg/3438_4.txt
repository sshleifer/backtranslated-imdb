The haunted boat is sold as "Fog" and "Open Water". In many ways, that's for sure. There are scary and weird looking people to interest you. <br /> <br /> However, at best, acting skills are bad. Showing clear signs that this is just a group of friends who make a horror movie. Which in all credit they do to the best of their ability. When you agree on a low budget, it makes it very difficult for special effects, when ghosts look almost like people in rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the movie are creepy and weird. But he suffers from using too many turns in a short amount of time, which just leaves you bored and confused. In terms of being awake, the film does it very well. Ignoring the unnecessary twisting every 5 seconds near the end, you really want to know what's going on. And ready to wait for the climax 1 hour 35 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is not a ghost ship, but it is definitely suitable for the evening before T.V.
