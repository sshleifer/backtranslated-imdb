Another variation and improvisation in the well-known and beloved children's fairy tale, La Bete (1975), also known as "The Beast", tries to present (very clearly and what may seem offensive and disturbing, but in fact quite stupid and comical way) What really happened between beauty and the beast? I am surprised by the many reviews and comments that seem to look too deep into this film. I would not say that this is a serious and dismal study of such topics as sexual dysfunction, craving, satisfaction, or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I would not even call it a horrible erotic film. Rather, it is a parody of all the genres that it touches or mentions, even though all departments have some shocking moments that will surely remain in your memory. <br /> <br /> A long (too long) scene between an aristocratic young woman and a supposedly terrifying, but the funniest person I've ever seen in films, with truly impressive ... good anatomy tuned to clavichord music Scarlatti and hysterical. My husband and I laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the meeting. The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will win the monster. The question is who is the target audience of the film. For erotic pictures, she is too verbose; for a feature film - it has too many amazing scenes of sheer insanity, and I would say a sudden ending. IMO, the filmmaker did not want this to be a serious drama. Like the art house / horror / erotic parody, itâ€™s fun and definitely original. Laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. This story of curious beauties and lustful animals, of course, is not recommended for sharing with children. The opening scene, which can shake the unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality, can be successfully used on the Discovery Channel for a program such as "In the animal world, mating habits and horse rituals."
