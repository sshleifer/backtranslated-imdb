Wow, that sucks. I am going to summarize as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> Earl invites 4 naive whores back to his castle. A bunch of nothing happens for a long time. Some non-erotic and non-erotic sex scenes occur. Some girls are chopped off (off-screen) - The End. <br /> <br /> The only thing needed for this is decent looking scenery and costumes, poor dubbing that leads to an unintentionally funny dialogue, and a few short Nudi shots. And believe me - these things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of fatigue that this film has. In fact, the best part is that it starts with a distributor who shows some slutty gothic chicks covered in blood and showing their boobs - and again - this is definitely not worth the price of admission to this garbage. As everyone else noticed, the name of the film is completely meaningless, since there are absolutely no bloodsuckers or any dances in the film. With the same success it could be called "Goat Reaper leads a circular jerk" - and, at least, then he would have the best title, which also has no relation to the film. The exact title would be “90 minutes of torture” - another tempting title that at least would be true ... to the viewer. To be honest, the trailer on the disc shows all the best parts (and I use the term “best” very loosely ...), so I highly recommend watching this instead, if you're still interested. I can not imagine that someone would like this film - please take my advice and leave this on the shelf. 2/10
