My first attempt to watch it ended after 8 minutes, approximately after a television report, which I could not cope with. Like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there is a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think they are aliens. * awkward silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later I watched it to the end, and it was not as bad as I imagined, but there are serious problems with this. About half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the second half needs to be expanded to explain the story or something like that. <br /> <br /> What is the use of detective, eugenics and monsters that Horus throws out for a moment? More funny was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" Gods "who have lived forever, and of all the games in the multiverse, we are in a monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly ?! Even Erich von Dieniken looks cohesive compared to this. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly short. What did our main character do to freeze himself? Why was there no big event when it was released at the end? He had these nasty followers, remember? What happened to normal people? What's up with the guy in the mask? How did a blue-haired girl appear? What does she have with eyesight? Etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> Visually this is normal, more or less, if you do not pay attention to the Egyptian gods, similar to walking tures with rottweiler heads.
