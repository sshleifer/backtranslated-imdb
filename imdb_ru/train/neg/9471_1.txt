Don't get me wrong, I assumed that this film would be stupid, to be honest, I gave it an incredibly low standard to match. The only reason I saw this was because a lot of girls were going to (another story for another time). When I started watching, I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now there are two types of horror, this is Freddie vs. Jason the Terrible, where you and your friends are sitting, laughing and joking at how awful, and then there is such a film. The Cat in the Hat could not even interest me for a moment. When I watched the first film, I was not only bored, but I felt as though I had been offended by the horror of the film. Mike Myers is usually great, I love most of his work, but something in this film did not work. One of the things that the director / producers / writers / amateurs changed was that they refused to use any color of the original book (red, black, white) for any character except Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any original (and I hate to use this word, but it fits), rudeness of the original. The book was like Sunday Ice, colorful and tasty, and the film was as soft and hard to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a leper prostitute.
