An expedition led by the awkward captain Storm (Mark Dana) goes to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to the previous expedition. They meet the beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann), who joins them. Soon they are confronted with a drunken mother’s blood ... and it seems that only Simira knows what is happening. <br /> <br /> This snooker. I caught it late on TV on the night when I was about 10. It put me to sleep! Seeing this again all these years later, I understand why. This is a slow movement, the mummy does not even appear until 40 minutes (and it is only 66 minutes!), The acting game varies from bad (Dan) to REAL bad (George N. Neise), and there is no violence or blood to find. This film focuses more on secondary playwrights (including the silly love triangle) than on horrors. <br /> <br /> These are three stars, because in fact it looks good, everyone plays straight, there is a good game from Diane Brewster that is short, and the scenes of the mummy’s attack (all three of them) are not bad. They are not scary, just slightly creepy. However, this film is pretty bad. Confident fire from insomnia.
