Pros: nothing <br /> <br /> Cons: all <br /> <br /> Short description of the plot: a female reporter faces hitchhiking telling her stories about the deaths of people killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: Never in my life have I seen such a bad film as The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed with a budget of 20 bucks, TZC is a terrible horror film, featuring unconvincing, forgetful actors who cannot act to save their lives and get baked, which is more gross than frightening. How does this movie work? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> My last 2 cents: funny enough, this film was made by the film company Brain Damage Films. Their brain must have really been damaged to make such a stupid movie. <br /> <br /> My rating is: 1 out of 10 (If it were to me, this film would get a negative bajillion rating)
