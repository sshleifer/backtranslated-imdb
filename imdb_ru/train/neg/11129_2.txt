See the 1936 version. How personally I am annoyed by the voice of Charles Boyer, he is more suited to paying the cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf - I mean Omar Sharifâ€™s attempts, but no, they are too sweet and bright. Catherine Deneve (sp) except that she is too old, does not look like Marie - nothing! She looks too sophisticated to even think about dying for the love of this person in this way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the entire film that conveys the role they play is Ava Gardner, whose appearance as Empress Elizabeth is rather brief on the screen (and look at the images of the Empress, is more than a passing similarity ), because historically Empress Elizabeth was not so involved in the life of Rudolph.
