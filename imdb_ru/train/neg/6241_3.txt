What is really not consistent with the theory of Al Gore (and his supporters) is all about “consensus”. <br /> <br /> If there was such a consensus, why “believers” “in omnipotent global warming there is an overwhelming need to try to intimidate anyone who questions them. <br /> <br /> Why does anyone who doesn’t hold to global warming meet smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of oil companies (obviously, a professional global warming researcher doesn’t mean that you are someone's wages in this wonderful world ...) Why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is being solved, when is the natural nature of science honestly questioned assumptions? For some ideas on how to answer these questions, read Prey from Michael Crichton's famous oil puppet ... oh wait, he is rich, not in the payroll of oil companies. He simply risked his career, disobeying the line of green and other Kyoto fans, and spoke the truth by exploring it. By the way, did you know that, according to his supporters, adherence to the Kyoto Protocol will hardly lead to lower temperatures? Just a few questions from which Al Gore did not get involved in order not to receive a single penny of the ecological lobby in case he decides to run again. <br /> <br /> So who is the puppet?
