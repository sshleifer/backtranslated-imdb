In addition to all technical mistakes .... <br /> <br /> How about a flight attendant who can kill 4 of the 7 terrorists (including former marines), 2 of whom even without using a pistol. Then she gets on the plane perfectly. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we are talking about a regular, scared, but very well assembled flight attendant. : D How about the leader in charge of the assault / rescue team, who has a full plan (according to the logic of the script) of everyoneâ€™s sleep plan, and someone from his team is flying in an airplane. Only he decides, under the influence of the moment, to change his plans and instead lead the attack on the terrorists, flashing his weapon, not knowing where the terrorists are or how many, and not taking a favorable position, so that his entire team gets easily destroyed. Yes, it uses the old Noggin. Only later decide to use sleep gas anyway. And it turns out to be useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film was bad, I could not refrain from watching and wondering what next? : D I can not help but imagine that all the beautiful, unemployed screenwriters think to themselves, this is not fair. lol : D
