I just gave it the ridiculously named horror comedy film a 2 because a few famous porn stars past appear in it. A group of tourists, presumably on holiday in Ireland, but in fact in Canada, faced one or another inbred cannibal mutant, and the plot was more or less directly from MOUNTAIN EYES AND GLAV. The only problem is that if I'm not mistaken, there is only one mutant in the window, and it is not that impressive. It seems like a pot-bellied mummy in this home movie about five years ago. Some bloody but stupid deaths help, but the film is purely amateur and boring to the limit. The ending is predictable and was made to death. No pun intended.
