*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From the very beginning of its work, this fantastic film sets a record: it is an instant classic. It does not take long to realize that this film is big, more than "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy 7". His very greatness deprived me of speech when I left the cinema and returned to the box office to buy myself a dozen more tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that simply requires multiple viewing. The first observation will surely leave you with this strange "Ha?" I feel, but do not be embarrassed - it happens to the best of us. The story is so devilishly clever that you need to think about the mortality of its authors. What appears to be a simple story about an idiot who has penetrated the FBI turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all the really important things in life. The complexity of the structure of the plot will confuse you when you first view, but do not give up! Only after my sixth or seventh viewing did I just start to solve some of the secrets of Corky Romano. And watch for the unexpected turn at the end, otherwise you might be taken by surprise when it turns out that the FBI agent Brik Davis is the most wanted criminal of the FBI, Corky is not a real FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits that he is illiterate, and Poly Romano is from the toilet like a homosexual. Surprised, damn it, from me, I can tell you so much. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattanâ€™s comedic talents are second to none as he leads his hero Corky Romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. Recalling the performance of John Reynolds in "Manos, Hands of Destiny", Kattan shoots countless personalities and shoots all the scenes with perfect comedy time. However, Kattan is not just a comedy. He is also a master of drama, as he controls the feelings of the viewer with the slightest movements of his face. His facial expressions reflect life itself, in some ways. For example, in a scene in which he farted in the face of his brothers, you can see an expression of social injustice and alienation, clearly reflected on his painful face. At such a moment it is difficult to find a dry eye in the house. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters David Garrett and Jason Ward are the real heroes of Corky Romano. With a history of such proportions, it is easy to understand why it took two experienced writers to complete this ambitious project. Their skillful narrative and unorthodox structuring make Pulp Fiction a mediocre parody of Saturday Night Live. The story of Garrett and Ward is so convincing and tempting that it captures you by the hair, completely absorbs, shakes and spits out. At the end of this unusual experience, known as Corky Romano, you find yourself to be a different person with different views of the world and different ideas, and you have only one question: <br /> <br /> Why, God? What for?!?
