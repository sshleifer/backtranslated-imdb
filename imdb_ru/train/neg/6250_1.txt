I really liked this show, once. That is, until I realized all the flaws in it. This is so unreal. I know that this is fiction, but it is not even unlikely. That's why ** Spoilers ahead, guys ... ** Do we really have to believe that a child like Yugi will be descended from the pharaoh of ancient Egypt? C'mon! He is the biggest nerd on earth. What happened to the hair of Pharaoh (aka Atema and / or Yami)? The last time I checked that the pharaohs were shaved (except for a small amount of hair on his head) and wore fancy hats. <br /> <br /> And whether we should be convinced that the evil rich genius of a boy named Seto Kaiba ? Puh-leeze! First, he had to be an adult by law to run a company. And that would make him not a very brilliant boy, since he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why should he attend such a school as Domino High when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend an unusual snobbish academy? Plus, the side sections with his younger brother are so juicy and lame. Every time you turn around, this child has been abducted by crooks for a villain. * yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is a poor kid who lives with a worthless father. It says that Joe earns all the money to attend his school because his father is an alcoholic, but you will never see Joey doing something like a job. He doesn't even mention work. And his sister Serenity is a complete idiot. Why did she choose a snob, such as the Duke (who dressed his brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television), and not a good guy like Tristan? Is she really so ignorant? Various characters throughout the show are obsessed with demonic forces, stole their souls with demonic forces and became victims of mental illness. (Oh, it's safe for children, NOT.) Tea is a typical type of neighbor girl, whose only purpose is to be Yugi / Yami's girlfriend. And although she has some interesting points, she simply does not have enough time to become the main character. <br /> <br /> Animation is just awful. All characters look painful and irregular. The prospects are terrible (especially when they are close-ups of someone's hands), and the colors look good, but not stellar. <br /> <br /> But the worst hole in the plot of the series was that Yami said that his Millennial Puzzle could send souls back to their bodies. If so, then why didn’t he save Grandpa Yugi when Pegasus stole his soul and saved himself from having to bring her back? <br /> <br /> All that really is, is commercial for yourself. The only plus to this is “Yu-Gi-Oh: Abridged Series” from LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Do something more worthwhile. For example, see the abbreviated version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
