You're kidding that was awful !!! <br /> <br /> But despite this, they gave me this film and 3 more, and they were all on DVD. The film begins with the movie "OK", but starts from the middle and below. <br /> <br /> Well, the ending, let's say, was one of the most anti-climatic endings in the history of recent films. In the last episode a lot of blood, and if you like the dose of horror of Schlok, then this film is for you ... 3/3
