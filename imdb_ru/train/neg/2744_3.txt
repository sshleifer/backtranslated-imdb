I was bored, around 10 pm, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so funny. The way children behaved as if they were over 11 years old just infuriated me. One of the children had a ring that supposedly killed people after 3 years or so. I got the impression that he wants to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is rather difficult to take young children seriously, especially when it is connected with the use of worms. They behave as if everything is so important, for example, if Billy (the main character) does not eat worms, then the world will end. <br /> <br /> This is a good film for small children (except for the fact that the 5-year-old says “penis”), but not for teenagers or adults who don’t want to waste their time.
