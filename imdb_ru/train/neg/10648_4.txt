The Weissmüller Tarzan film finals are pretty weak. There are several things that destroy this film. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan spends most of the film in floppy sandals. In my opinion, any shoes on Tarzana, whether sandals or shoes, as is sometimes portrayed, take away from the character, which must be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the character Benji, as mentioned in the previous post, completely tears off the film as a comic foil. For me, his character is not needed for the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, although Weissmüller still plays a major role as Tarzan, it is clear that he was not in the best shape. Although in his later films "Jungle Jim" his physique improved somewhat compared to this film. <br /> <br /> The battle with the octopus is a terrific idea, but I think it should have been done in Weissmuller’s earlier film when he was at his physical peak. Similarly, a battle that takes only 30 seconds will be much more exciting if it drags on for 90 seconds for 2 minutes, like the classic battle of giant crocodiles in Tarzan and His helper. <br /> <br /> And even though Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mary is completely pleasing to the eye, she is unable to save this last Weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to the character’s great run.
