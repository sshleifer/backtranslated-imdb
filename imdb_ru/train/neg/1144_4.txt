Summary: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory of how to produce energy, knowledge that can unbalance the world. He keeps his knowledge secret and desperately wants to leave the Soviet Union. The KGB, on the other hand, desperately wants new technologies. So, they set the scheme in motion. During a rescue attempt to release Markov, the KGB enters, takes Markov to a secret place and lures him to reveal his secret, saying that they are in Sweden and work for the UN. As a reinforcement, the KGB kidnaps the alienated daughter of Markov. Now the CIA is sending its best agents, a team of (Swedish?) Ninjas, to prevent the KGB and to save Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: a cult film, which, despite the fact that it is not very good, you need to watch. The film is quite ambitious, but it is lacking in many areas. Firstly, it is very dark, probably to hide the locations and bad effects, that some scenes are difficult to understand. You cannot see what is happening. The second thing he lacks is martial arts, despite the fact that this is a film about a ninja. Of course, there are some, rather low quality, but mostly ninja shoots from automatic weapons or explosions. Automatic pistols are also a problem, as they seem to have an endless supply of ammunition. And ninjas seem almost immune to bullets, while Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> What then says about this? The idea and ambition first. Some actually, and especially for the Swedish film, are worthy action films, although not from the martial arts. Several good scenes in slow motion and pretty much blood and gore. And some very interesting new weapons technologies that cause the victim to blow up the heart or brain. Mostly all the parts you are looking for in a B-film. <br /> <br /> Since this is definitely a B-film, you can't be mistaken here. But if you expect it and see it as a B-film, thatâ€™s interesting. But do not forget that this is not only a B-film, it is set in the eighties. For example, some girls, in addition to wearing ... say, "interesting" clothes, receive lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> In general, look at cult status and ambition. Enjoy it, and then forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
