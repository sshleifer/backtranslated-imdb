***** WARNING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS WHO WILL REALIZE MORE THAN THIS TRAVEL. **** <br /> <br /> Here is good advice to everyone who lives in the UK when there is an old 80s comedy on Channel 5. late at night, read a book instead. Currently, I am in the process of recovering from a seizure, due to reading some of the comments on this film here. I’m actually shocked by the fact that someone actually said that this film was realistic! All I can say is thank God that the cold war never escalated, otherwise we could just as well give Commi our boundaries ... I found this film terrible under the pretext, perhaps this is just my British perception of what makes a movie funny, who knows? But in all aspects this film is not just awful, its teeth are terribly awful. <br /> <br /> I have never been a fan of Bill Murray, and such garbage as this one justifies my feelings for him. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster's, which was made just three years after this film. But that just sums it up to Bill Murray. I can say with confidence that I have not wasted my time so roughly since I saw the first launch of Operation Delta here, although these two films have more in common than you think. Firstly, they both have horrible sequences of actions from beginning to end, and secondly. They both abound in cheese cliches, everywhere. <br /> <br /> One thing is, these guys must be in the "US Army." However, they are allowed to lie around their camp, Willie Nilly, seducing female officers of the military police, and then foolishly fucking them in the quarters of the generals. Let's talk about Random! I'm afraid this movie is just awful. Do not misunderstand me, I do not sympathize with the feminists, but the fact that these two women actually fall in love with two heroes soon after their arrest, their release ... Twice, just an insulting female race. The fact that one ugly, fat-assed ass (Winger) and his unfortunate assistant Ramis can simply have a sweet chat in a member of parliament’s underwear, to which they are madly in love with two of them, is nothing ridiculous. <Br /> <br /> Then there are training scenes where you can meet the Psycho squad, which unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his things, followed by an overweight guy (played by the deceased and great John Candy) who claims to have joined the army in order to “not pay $ 400 for anger management classes.” The presenter with a loud mouth, Murray, paying tribute to “Giant Toe” (WTF?), “Drill Seargent,” who, frankly, could not organize to $$$ in the brewery, not to mention his group of recruits. All that this scene needs to do is to prevent a lot of battle scenes when people say: “go to hell!” All the time, and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Then the scenes continue A course showing how a bunch of rag tags make tits on the stage, leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air, birds with a machine gun go by, fill the watch tower with bullets. (Likewise. Yes, I told you that this film was accidental ... It also miraculously escaped indiscipline ...) In the end, leading to the passing parade, where the unfortunate detachment makes a magic turn in two hours, (Hit me , Miracle!) Thanks to some of the wise words of Murray, to which they then direct a massively non-military dance in front of the geriatric "General" in front of the other troops. All this is to the great pleasure of their two girlfriends on the stand, who really should have arrested them ... Although everyone laughs at this. This is a bit surprising. He then selects them to guard a new prototype armored vehicle worth several million dollars in Italy (which, as it turned out, is just a mobile home painted in green with lots of gadgets inside), saying: “This is exactly what this Army! ”Right ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the terrible finale, where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this top-secret military machine prototype to pick up their recently acquired and several hyperactive deputies friends in Germany. To which the "Unhappy Captain" (John Larroquette) learns and leads a squad of recruits on the search mission for this machine. They then make a “wrong turn” along the way and end up in Soviet Czechoslovakia, where they were captured. (As if we didn’t see it happen ...) So begins the attempt to rescue Ramis and Murray + Birds in their hands, where a big fight takes place, a lot of shots from the hip and tank explosions. When they return as national heroes, humiliating the Russians, calling them "pussies", and so on. D. And so on. End. Like this. No military ships, nothing. They had just stolen a prototype of a military vehicle, brought it to the country of the Warsaw Pact and almost caused an international incident that could provoke a 3rd World War! <br /> <br /> This film is, frankly, more fun than diagnosing a deadly disease, I know this is a comedy, it has all the right actors, but where the hell is it? Does channel 5 cut these bits? The only redemptive feature of this film is the repeated use of naked women who take a shower and female mud wrestling. (as I said, Random) Not that it helps to distract from the fact that this is, of course, a crappy movie. This film really should be aimed at immature 9-year-olds, unfortunately we should watch it instead. 1 star out of 10 is a common scar. My advice, do something more useful with your time. How to castrate yourself ...
