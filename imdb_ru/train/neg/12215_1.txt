What I can say was the theft of my time, I was taken to watch this film, and I must say what a terrible experience. Fei Ann Lee is a terrible actress and inconclusive in this film. Larryjoe76 is clearly a reviewer. The plot is subtle, to say the least, Cantonese dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie at your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tan from Shanghai should be behind the film, because this film will bring little profit or not. The banal plot is trying to compete with other rum-comas, and simply merges with the landscape. It was like drying paint. <br /> <br /> In short, this film was a waste of time and space. I have seen the best movies on YouTube.
