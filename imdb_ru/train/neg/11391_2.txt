When I first started watching this film, I was looking for some subtle metaphors, but it soon dawned on me that this film was really about people on the train. Interactions between people are similar to those that you can see on any day on the street, and when a slightly more interesting situation arises, the dialogue becomes unnatural and boring. It’s not that I don’t understand how this film tries to portray the way people interact, they are just very boring in this film. If you want to see and analyze such relationships, the best thing is for you to go and buy a train ticket and look at the people who are close to you. This is realistic, but you would not go to the cinema to watch a movie about how you sit and watch a movie.
