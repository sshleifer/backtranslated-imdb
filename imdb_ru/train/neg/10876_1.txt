What the hell was D-Movie? Bad game, bad special effects and the worst dialogs / storyline I've ever encountered. The only cool thing here was Culio, who had a great cameo as a furious cop.

And the one who compares this with the series “Evil Dead” can compare “Tomb Raider” with Indiana Jones (well, at least, in “Tomb Raider” was Angelina Jolie)! 1 out of 10
