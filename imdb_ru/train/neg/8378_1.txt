This film is probably the worst film I've ever seen in my whole life! The plot is ridiculous, but all the nonsense of "Little Man" is so stupid. The whole movie is unreal and stupid. Let's face it, it's just "Black Comedy." This is just a meaningless, horrible play that should never have gone to theaters. The jokes are not funny, but the game is terrible. Please, I ask you to save money, than to see this useless piece of shit. I had to endure sitting in the Little Man for an hour and a half, wanting my eyes to bleed. I hate that something like this can even be thought of! Who writes this shit? The actors have no talent, what is it, how do these people get to Hollywood? They make money out of this junk!
