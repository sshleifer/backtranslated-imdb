The ruin will be the scriptwriter, and his agent (Tom Voodoo and Arieh Gross) will have to live in a self-service vault, run by an eccentric and frightening manager (Ron Perlman), who they believe is a serial killer terrorizing the city, "Costume Killer" so because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). They convince him that his life story will make an excellent film, and they will assemble a group of inappropriate directors (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Christy Swanson) and find that the art of making a film can be murder. <br /> <br /> There is something else in this film, but, unfortunately, it remained on the floor of the editing room, and it shows (according to rumors, the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our loss (and actors who all do an excellent job and deserve the best), because it has the features of an exceptional black comedy, but it rises to mediocre grace. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Ron Perlman, itâ€™s absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comedy time is excellent, and he has a chance to make really impressive impressions (he did not joke when he said in the commentary on the film Hellboy that he needed intervention when he enters Jerry Lewis's regime). It is just fun to watch. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also plays a two-role (but key) role.
