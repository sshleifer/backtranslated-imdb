With the exception of the FAMILY, this new season is worse than the first season. I can not imagine what they think. As a horror fan, I can tolerate a lot of bloody and senseless turmoil, but with each release this series gets worse. I can't imagine how terrible it must be that the actors and the film crew go to work every day, working to produce such crap. STORY! Is it too much to ask? CHARACTER! How can we spit on the fate of ANYONE in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares if they are cut or something else? Almost every episode ends in meaningless bloodshed, complete shock, without any sense of revelation or conclusion or CAUSES why we were subjected to bloodshed for an hour. Even Dante's effort this season has caused exciting sexist violence and led to a meaningless conclusion. Ironically, production values ​​and productivity are usually up to the mark, and the content is complete nonsense. I have high hopes for Harris VALARIE executive producer under the stairs, but we'll see.
