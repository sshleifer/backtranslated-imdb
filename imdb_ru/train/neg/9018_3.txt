This is a science fiction movie of Formula B, and the director didn’t hide it. It's about the dragon, which the scientific team has revived to life. All you have done is what you have seen many times before. This is a weak script, without real characters. In fact, he is full of stereotypical characters and situations. The director attacks it, just turning it into a film by the formula, not trying to fool us, and this gives the film an easy appeal, but you hardly remember for a while. This is best seen when you cook, clean, work. Like senseless fun. It has its place in the entertainment, but it’s certainly not something you sit with friends to see if you’re all drunk and you don’t care. A massive rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I don’t think it’s as stupid as most people, but I’m surprised that some people in the publications think it was impressive. It really eludes me, because I do not see any attempt to even make this memorable film.
