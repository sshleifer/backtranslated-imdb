... except for John Heder. This guy made the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was entertaining. The 29-year-old son is a slacker (Heder) still lives with a widowed mother (Keaton), who meets a new love (Daniels). The son of a slacker is jealous and seeks to lose a comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but whoever gives up Hadera would be better off selling hot dogs on the beach. Heathers' performance is annoying, which would be nice, as he plays an annoying guy, the problem is that he is a bad actor to play this act, making this guy enjoyable in the final. In the end, you still want you to personally hit the guy in the face, and you're upset about the end. In the future, every movie with this guy will be useless to me!
