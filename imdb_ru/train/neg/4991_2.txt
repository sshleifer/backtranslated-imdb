One of the worst films I've seen is poor camera performance, crappy filter, the film was grainy, the script was terrible, I mean, come on, how predictable was the big battle at the end ..... <br /> <br / > some fight scenes were fine, I think .... <br /> <br /> some scenes were so bad that it was funny ... how Sorbo got on a horse and rode at the end ... LOL, I mean really .. horse? Oh, I can not forget how bad assassins were riding in the same vehicle throughout the entire film ... Some might think that after killing key witnesses and federal agents they would be found ...,
