Fragmented, obscure, bad script, bad photography and directing ... well, itâ€™s very obvious that the first commercial filmmaking attempt by good people from TBN is not well thought out. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has had great success in the past, helping to bring China Cry, the story of Norah Lamb, to the big screen. But Omega Code is an annoying mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and many of his programs, and who loves China Cry, I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone. They do a very good job with their ministry, but this is not an example. Don't waste your money ... rent a China Cry instead.
