Well, like most fans of Steven Seagal, I know that I’m not going to expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film, but I expect the film to have at least some more budget. The main copy problem I watched was terrible due to duplication. I know that in some films it needs to be done, and I accept it, but when they rework with a completely different voice of the actors and continue to do it through the film, this is really the overlaying magic away. Besides, the sets seem to be built without care, because one scene at a sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack passing through it. I was really disappointed with this film and I only hope that the next Stevens project will be more finished before the film is sent to buy / rent. The story of this film made me think about whether I was watching a science fiction film or not, but some parts of it seem alien, but they didn’t explain what was going on, and I find it very confusing.
