I saw this film once a long time ago, and I have no desire to ever see it again. <br /> <br /> This film is about Preston Waters, a harsh childhood, which the family always seems to ignore, and who always seems to be short of money. This all changes when a bank robber moves Preston's bike and passes him a check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Then Preston buys the mansion and says that he works as an assistant to a mysterious and wealthy patron named Mr. McIntosh (named after his computer). After that, he just goes crazy about money. <br /> <br /> On paper this sounds like a great idea. However, the screen is one of the most empty films that I have ever seen. On the one hand, it is too unbelievable. I know that some parts of the film were supposed to be incredible, but I draw a line on how a twelve-year-old boy comes out with a thirty-year-old woman and is responsible for the small state of an imaginary person. In addition, it was a shallow film with a weak acting game, predictable storyline and little-known characters. The characters were either stupid, overly annoying, or underdeveloped. But “Juice” was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip it.
