Worse than the rating he gave. This is currently a typical SciFi film: a bad or terrible acting game, a poorly written script and a crappy guide. From the opening scene where DeMille buries his set to the end, this film is terrible. In the opening scenes of this film, Moses (who was Charlton Heston in the DeMille film), Faroah (Yul Brynner) and Nefritiri (Ann Bakstor) look at a boy who hid a box in the sand. The characters who were supposed to represent the three above-mentioned icons were terrible and should have reminded the people they were supposed to be. The fact that it is in the desert far from civilization is ridiculous when someone is injured, and they all scream about the ambulance. The writer obviously does not notice the fact that there are no ambulances in the center of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such poor quality.
