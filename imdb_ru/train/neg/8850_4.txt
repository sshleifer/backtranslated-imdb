Now this movie will not frighten anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big and smaller - well, these are three reasons, aren't they. <br /> <br /> The first reason for this is interesting, these are special effects. I found them quite interesting and somewhat impressive. Seeing how hair grows on March A. Hunt and Sybil Dunning is terrible, especially when they participated in ménage à trois. <br /> <br /> An interesting fact is that this Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown". "Sugar" song "Rolling Stones" and the fact that she starred in the notorious naked scene in the London film about the rock musical "Hair". <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, there were two more features in this film, and they were produced repeatedly during the closing credits. I lost count, but I swear that Sybil Denning has exposed these glasses for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and possibly even more. They were the most outstanding feature of the film.
