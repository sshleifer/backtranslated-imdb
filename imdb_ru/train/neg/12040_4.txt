I do not know anything about the Iliad, so I can not comment on its accuracy in this story. However, as a standalone film, I found it very boring. The battle scenes tried to be big and spectacular, but they were just obvious CGI. <br /> <br /> The game was bad, and, no doubt, Brad Pitt was thrown only to attract the ladies. But he is not a very good warrior, I fear, too cute. <br /> <br /> Good points are design. This film looks good with an impressive landscape and castle buildings / walls. I really like the film, which, at least, tries to make heroes' accents believable, but this film seems to completely ignore it. we hear American, Scottish English anything, except what you can expect from a movie about an ancient eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend this movie for a family holiday. It is too long, and the young will be bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, everything is fine, if you do not care about the lack of realism.
