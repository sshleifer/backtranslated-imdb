I found this film a boring, monotonous and rather uninteresting one with a hasty, shallow “optimistic” ending that did not sound true to the whole story. Watching these characters on weekends of horrific events, unfriendly relationships and bad news is not my idea of ​​a watchable, interesting film, and I was very tired of his “one note” theme and could not wait for it to end. In fact, I almost stopped at halfway through. The whole film seemed just meaningless and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressing and unpleasant, although the game was good. A small film with small ambitions and a little attraction - sorry, but he just didn't do it to me, and I love good, small films! This one simply does not feel jealous, although I continued to watch him, hoping and believing that it would be so. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers included him on their “Top 10 Years” list. I would strongly recommend watching Sand House instead - now there's a nice little movie!
