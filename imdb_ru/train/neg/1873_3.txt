You must be joking!!!! Let's look at the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, and not just some kind of entry in the cast of the month club, of actors. Indeed, unless it is intended for David Mamet's mocking satire — a brief, confusing dialogue, alternately represented in machine-gun speed or monotonous (I think, Ben Stein) lethargy — or in a flat dry comedy; This film should be ready to receive the Rotten Tomato Award - or worse. <br /> <br /> As though the tough and uncomfortable Posy is not enough, we have a tougher and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. This film has more wood than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> In addition to this already strange casting, there are a few more roles, all of which are filled with unforgettable actors who look or sound like runaways from the American “New Model” Pardo, or even a child who pronounces the word "was" as "bob", which simply draws our attention to the fact that there is so little of everything in this film that we analyze its accent in order to guess if it is Canadian or not. !! I think I laughed heartily in places that should be serious, and I was serious about sections that were supposed to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alaric Yans' music for Mamet's House of Games. If taken as a parody, the film is almost funny; if taken seriously, just a shy piece of wood.
