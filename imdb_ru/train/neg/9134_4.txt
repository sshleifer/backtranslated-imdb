I tried to like this program; I really did. I even bought a pilot film, first on VHS and then on DVD. However, I could not enter into this story, because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddy" (Sibill Shepard), seemed to just fall in love with themselves, on the one hand. I recognize that there was some clever dialogue in the show, which was a key part of the success of the television program, and I really appreciated this dialogue. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was almost like the old comedy films of the 30s and 40s with the participation of men and women. You get a lot of controversy, accusations, screams and shouts. Many people seem to like such disagreements, but I hate them, so I never got into the Moonlighting bandwagon. <br /> <br /> Only Ellis Beasley in the role of the unfortunate assistant “Agnes” was entertaining. It is a pity that she had so little air time. Shepard was good on the eyes, and I suppose women will say the same thing for Willis, but too much controversy between them, finally, pushed me away.
