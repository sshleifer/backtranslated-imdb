I saw this film at the Edmonton International Film Festival, where the great Dr. Uwe Boll attended. <br /> <br /> Simply put, very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll "so bad, it's really interesting," but just bad. The plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life (obviously, because of previous convictions), can not get a job, and with a terrible betrayal of his wife for 900 pounds. This man turns to his cult leader's uncle in order to steal a truck with toys that contain bird flu virus. Al-Qaida also has plans to steal toys, and this is followed by almost two hours of totally incomprehensible sex and violence. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible (with the exception of Dave Fowley, who really tries, despite all this), the jokes never rise above children who are shot at the chest in slow motion, and people who poop. This is supposed to be a satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think "Airplane!", But made by the creators of South Park and without any jokes.
