I bought it in the records on the tower, seeing a commercial about a hundred and fifty times on a comedy. I really really wanted to see this. My God, where was I wrong? Now, before giving your review, let me say that I am a person who can find good in all films, damn it, I have over 1500 DVDs! In view of the above, the underground comedy film is the worst among the films I have ever seen. I tried to give him a chance, but not only it was not funny. It made no sense, did not offend anything and was stupid around. God, who in his right mind thought these bits of shit are funny? it goes straight to the bottom of the bunker ...
