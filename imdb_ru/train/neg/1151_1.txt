This film was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is his main character, is everything except the "mother". Well, she was unhappy in marriage and always put her husband and children first. Her husband is dying. Then she goes to visit her son and meets this handsome man, who sleeps with his daughter and eventually sleeps with him. This part of the film is all right. Not great, but this can be observed. The guy is charming, and who can blame her? Well, not very motherly to sleep with your daughter's lover, but let's blame the shock of losing your husband. <br /> <br /> She becomes a completely obsessed guy. I think this is the part where I didn’t like the movie. She always wants to please him in the “old-fashioned way” with snacks while he works at her son's house (I think this is the only thing she learned), as if this was the only way she could get it. Attention. The guy is obviously not very interesting (in fact, he seems to think that it is a charity to sleep with her), and instead of being offended by this, she continues to beg him to go to sleep with her and be kind to her. when he becomes very offensive. “I want to please you,” she tells him desperately, while he insults her very much. <br /> <br /> What angered me in this film is total disrespect for the mother. She says something to Craig like “I'm just a shapeless lump” when they first sleep together. <br /> <br /> This film insults women. If it was me, I would buy myself a small item that would bring me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain ... :)
