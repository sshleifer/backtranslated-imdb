When to start? This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. The editing was the worst, the sound effects were terrible, and the editing of the sound was corrupted. Most of the film that you can see here is shoddy kicks, with confusing conversations in the background. I had to completely turn on the sound to find out what was going on ... and what should I have heard for sure? Probably one of the worst scenarios ever made. I can't believe that people actually put a little bit of green into this movie. It makes me think that I could take the shit in the box, send it to the producers, and then ask them to finance the film for me. Nothing more to say. The villains were bad, the main characters were bad, and the film was ugly. If you really want to know what NOT to do when writing, directing or editing a movie, watch it!
