Scary film. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just filled. The film was bad. Why should I stop at this, I do not know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The game sucks, and the letter is just a retard. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the film is Denise Akkaya's chest. Even this was destroyed by a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. The film is badly thought out and absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> OK, now I'm going to shock IMDb for this stupid rule of at least 10 lines of text. First, I spend my time watching this byproduct. Then I feel obligated to warn others that I am creating an account in IMDb only to discover that I need to write a damn movie essay just to express how bad I am in my opinion. Totally unnecessary.
