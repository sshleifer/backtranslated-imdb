First of all, sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this film (no less than is available). The film fails in every department, whether script, direction, characterization or acting. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin with, the title of the film is really class C (although the film itself corresponds to the title). 2) Amitabh Bachchan struggles to match the character, but a weak script combined with pathetic leadership makes him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay, Gabbar Singh has a reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). Here, in Aage, this figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor fellow was beaten by our so-called hero, and he had only a few male bicycles that went to work (with all the automatic guns). Making a movie like “Sholai "In the Mumbai staging in our time does not look convincing. 4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone must tell her that she does not know acting skills. Why is Ram Gopal Verma playing her over and over again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but he had almost nothing to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, are lost in the film. 7) The legendary role played by Lila Misra (Mousy from Basanti) in the film “Sholai” is cheaply replaced by a certain Ganga Mumiyia in this film. Rama, please grow up and understand that there should be intelligence in your movie. Stupid enough characters in your movie, such as Shiva and Aag. 8) It is not worth talking about modern Jaya and Veeru ... very touchingly. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I was shocked to see this film, because it looks like a cheap and comical translation of the original classics. Please do not waste money and time on this film. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst possible movie) would be a better idea than to see this horrible pack of stupid characters, bad songs and an unhappy director. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Saurabh
