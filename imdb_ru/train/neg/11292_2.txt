Corneille Wilde and three dumbbells are looking for a sunken treasure in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> Treasure hunters led by Wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little taunts on hungry faces. Wilde and his funny people need to find a way to get themselves out of the menu so that they can start the excavation of an old Spanish galleon filled with gold bars. <br /> <br /> After the crew plunged into a small eternity of pushing, pushing, arguing and listening to Wilde's annoying health tips, 5 crazy convicts sit in a boat and complicate the situation. Now it's a battle of wits regarding who gets the treasure and who sees what the inside of the shark's belly looks like. <br /> <br /> At least, Wilde is in uniform, wearing the same clothes. "Naked booty" 10 years ago, and he remained in excellent condition. <br /> <br /> Made from a budget of 75 cents.
