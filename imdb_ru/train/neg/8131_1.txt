Unless the name should be some kind of spoiler for the transformation of the wife (the villains! Destroy it for us). In any case, if this film were not “Made-For-TV”, it should have been, it is so surprisingly low-budget, undisciplined, not distracted, and falls into a cliché every 70s, except for the disco. No one can be pleasant, and you could take care of what happens to anyone in this. Extremely forgetful, with the exception of bad, bad performances.
