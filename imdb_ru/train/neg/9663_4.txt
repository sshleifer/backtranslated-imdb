How cynical are writers to indulge so. I can be an American citizen, but I don't need to see how other Americans pat each other on the back for an hour and a half to watch a movie. I am surprised that so few people have commented on how clever, really sentimental and banal the dialogue in this film is. The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as rude and offensive as in U-571 (which changes British submariners for American ones), but you still leave, feeling a bit slimy. Indeed, the Germans in this film do nothing but the admiration of Americans between the battle scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I just wanted to say to the writers: for many of us, it’s obvious that you can’t capture real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and that you have taken some very well proven labels. Fortunately for you, there will always be nationalist crazy people who appreciate your sugar-covered stuff.
