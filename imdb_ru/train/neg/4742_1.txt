Wow. It was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, a popular girl with a hot boyfriend and a girlfriend who intends to become the Queen of homecoming. She must save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts. Sheen teaches her the skills of the snake, tiger, etc., and she must learn certain methods to save the world. <br /> <br /> This film is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture. but acting and casting were terrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedian and I donâ€™t see her playing a serious role. It was loud to watch her cry over Sheen. Sheen could not act at all, and everything was completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to come up with something similar, and I came up with Power Rangers. This film is so fake, and the stunts were as strong as the Ranger, that it was just banal and stupid. The characters were not cute, and I just could not look at it. Disney really needs time to make decent films. High School Musical is the only film that deserves to be on the Disney Channel, along with other films such as Jumping from the Ship, Color of Friendship, Go and Understand, Read it and Cry, and got stuck in the suburbs. you like action movies and banal jokes, you will like this movie.
