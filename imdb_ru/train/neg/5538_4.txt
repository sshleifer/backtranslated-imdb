This is not really a film about zombies, if we define zombies as dead walking around. Here, the main character, Armand Luka (played by the incredibly young Dean Jagger), gains control over the zombie creation method, although in reality his “method” is to mentally project his thoughts and control the thoughts of other living people, turning them into hypnotized slaves, This is an interesting concept for the film, and Fritz Lang made it much more effective in his series Doctor Films Mabuse, including Doctor Mabuz Player (1922) and Doctor Mabuse's Testament (1933). Here, unfortunately, he is subject to his desire to regain the love of his former bride, Claire Duval (played by Anna Heche, who looks like a bad haircut, Dorothy Stone), which is indeed the main theme. <br /> <br /> The film has an intriguing beginning, as Luke is sent to a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to put an end to the cult of zombies who came from there. In some type of connection (where we get great sets and clothes from the 30s), he announces his engagement with Claire, and after just five minutes she returns the ring to him, declaring her love for her friend, Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland ). It is unintentionally funny when they talk to each other without looking into their eyes. It would have been a great movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000, if they hadn’t yet roasted it. <br /> <br /> It never showed how Luka actually revealed the secret of “zombies”, but then he uses it. To kill his enemies, create a giant army of rifles with soldiers and bodyguards. We will not see such pure will power until John Agar is in The Brain from the Planet Arous (1957). <br /> <br /> Finally, Claire agrees to marry him if he leaves Grayson alive and returns to America. Luka agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves. On their wedding night, he realizes that Claire will love him only if he gives up his "abilities." To get her love, he does this by causing a “riot” of the title, in which all his slaves wake up and attack his composition and kill him. Grayson embraces Claire, and we seem to be at the end of the parable: "Whom the gods will destroy, they will go crazy first." <br /> <br /> So actually, the film is not so bad, despite the low IMDb rating that it currently has. On repeated views (?) You can see artistry in a well-formed script! Dean Jagger has not turned into a good actor yet, and he is almost unrecognizable in his youth - is this really his own hair? We remember him more for his bald roles of the old man in “White Christmas” (1954), “X The Unknown” (1956) and “King Creole” (1958). The story borrows many of its core themes from the Halperin brothers better, the earlier film White Zombie (1932), in which the unfortunate Robert Fraser (like Charles Beaumont) uses zombification to win the love of Madge Bellamy (like Madeline Parker). <br /> <br /> If you want real movies about zombies (there are hundreds of them!), I would start with “White Zombie” (1932), “Zombie King” (1941), “I went with Zombies” (1943 ), “The Night of the Living Dead” (1968), “The Last Man on Earth” (1964) and his two remakes. In the modern era of great films, there is “The Terrible Express” (1972), “The Serpent and the Rainbow” (1988), “28 days later” (2002) and its continuation, as well as many, many others. Numerous references. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not a film about zombies. Judging by this film, he is more likely a semi-exotic novel. Thus, it stands slightly lower than some of the most popular horror films B in the late 30s and early 40s. So I will give 5.
