Really, really, terrible, catchy, terrible. But the actor Clayton Moore (the film "The Lone Ranger") competently manifests itself as an actor. He is the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare treat for five minutes, if you want to dive into the depths of grotesque-transparent special effects, southern California is the “moon” (again, again and again), and acting so stupid that it can be a hoax . .. except that it is clear that this is not so - no humor here, except unintentional. <br /> <br /> Dialogue can be worse than any of these other aspects and costumes. Enough said. Plot? What is the plot? The bad guy (well, the bad guy) and his minions, including his earthly agent named Krogh (listen carefully, or you suspect that this is deception on behalf of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc) and his incredibly inept shooters (who, however, pistols that never need reloading, like Commando Cody, so there are a lot of skirmishes in battle). <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
