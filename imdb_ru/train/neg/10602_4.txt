This movie is mostly shitty, and the only reason this movie is worth seeing is the fact that Jean-Claude Damme was filmed in this movie. There are a few good action movies in this movie, and the best ones are at the end of the movie. > <br /> The acting in this film is so bad, and this is the worst acting game I've ever seen, and 2 actors Bill Goldberg and Michael JJ White can't be filmed in ALL. Claud Vam Dammes are the worst films he made, and if you want to watch him in one of his great films, you should watch Blood sport, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> For this whole movie shit / ok rating 4 out of 10.
