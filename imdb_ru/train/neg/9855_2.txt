Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of fantasy. However, this film is not for me. Many contrived arguments are trying to support the assertion of this film that dragons ever existed. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but it is not possible to investigate them more thoroughly, which could give the film a certain authority. The film uses (nicely!) CGI to tell us a fabulous story about the life of a young dragon. This, combined with the popular TV-show-CSI flash forwards, makes it look like something scientific, which in reality is not. In many cases, the arguments / hints are flimsy. In some cases, the clues used to show that dragons may have existed, or flew, or spat fire are simply invalid. Seeing it just makes me sore on my toes. Even a fantastic film needs some degree of reality, but there is simply no such thing in it. Bottom line: this is a pretentious documentary about fiction and CSI, you should not look.
