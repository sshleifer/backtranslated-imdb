GERNSI (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands, 2005). <br /> <br /> Mouse Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a thirty-year-old woman who finds out that her husband (Fedya van Hyut) is cheating on her, but she does not dare to resist him. She painfully avoids any encounters with people, her parents and sister, so we have the main character in a feature film that does little. We know almost nothing about its origin or its motivation. Just a woman who seems stuck in a dead end, not only during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why should we, the viewers, also suffer? <br /> <br /> I almost became disillusioned with the movie after seeing this messy mess. It was a very boring and painful 90 minutes. Usually I try not to waste energy on making bad films. I will take the beating and move on with the punches, but in this case, a fair warning is in place. How the hell did Nanook Leopold receive funding (largely from state-funded funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to talk. This can be compensated by a brilliant cinematographer with cinematic ideas or actors with a little more attractiveness. Nothing of the kind, just a vaguely defined concept: “I want to do something from a woman’s point of view.” The result is an insult, not a tribute to the female view of life. <br /> <br /> Worse, there is no interesting frame in the whole film. I can't remember the cast that could spice it up, but Joanna ter Stig is a (small) light in the dark if possible with this terrible lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold tried to send Maria Kraakman: “Maria, look at the horizon, we shoot you three minutes, just express sadness”. The perfect cure for insomnia. Get a copy and watch it late at night, guaranteed to put down too much. <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 1/10
