So my wife and I just finished, despite several threats from both of us to turn it off. For the most part boredom was the worst part of this film, there was very little excitement. The game was terrible, to the extent that we did laugh several times during some of the worst scenes (for example, the church lady). The dead sister used paranormal means to contact her living twin, although instead of sending useful information, she focused on scaring her instead, which was very similar to the Ring. Instead of engaging the police — I'm sure those earplugs she found will have all the DNA — instead, she develops a terrible plan to “get” a man who hid the accidental death of her sister. I call this a terrible plan, because in the end, she lets him kill her, and the film then disappears. Bad dialogue, bad game, bad ending.
