An obvious attempt to make money at a hostel / saw hostel, my expectations for this film were low (really low!), And yet he managed to be disappointed at all levels. The acting is so bad that it is not even funny, the storyline does not exist, and the only fear was the understanding that I wasted 1 hour and 21 minutes watching it! I am surprised to note that 34 people gave him a 10-star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of them are Caste and Crew. The 34th, perhaps the mother of directors? - although I am sure that even it will be difficult for her to rise above 2! Additional DVD features include an hourly “create” feature. What raises the question "why?" (although perhaps this serves to demonstrate what should not be done!). Avoid at all costs.
