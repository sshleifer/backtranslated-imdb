“Criminally Insane 2” is included in Satan’s “Black Wedding / Insanely Madness” DVD, which is also good, because when I watch a movie and I know there is a sequel (especially something as obscure as this), I always curious. Now I have satisfied my curiosity and will never watch it again. Most of CI2 is nothing more than “memories” of CI, and shots from Ethel asleep, recalling pleasant memories, I suppose. Thanks to sentence 13, she was released from Napa State (interestingly, she managed to watch Crams playing while she was there?) And was sent to a halfway house, run by a cute elderly woman, whom Ethel quickly called "grandmother." All this is filmed on a video camera, so the picture and sound are quite pathetic, and even in a pair of “rolls”. Of course, Ethel is engaged in his own business, which is to send someone between her and the food, especially the guy who is witnessing one of her rifts and extorting her dessert. In addition, you should consider that any killer halfway would have a large drawer with sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the sink. Guess what the whole thing is in false "trust". If you liked or didn’t like Criminal Frenzy, in any case, there is no good reason to watch it, except out of curiosity. It's amazing why the creators of this even worried. 2 out of 10.
