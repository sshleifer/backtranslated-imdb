In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in his position receive movie roles that exist solely to benefit from it. I have no idea how much Thomas paid for making this film, but I would have to pay a lot of money to agree to make myself a national fool in the cinema. The film obviously comes from Enter the Dragon, like most martial arts paintings. Only instead of real martial arts, they create a new absurd martial art, which one critic called “a hybrid of kung fu and break dance”. The gymnast (of course, Thomas) is hired to save some lady from an impassable fortress, but in each room there is a support that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the assistant of the villains. Of course, he makes his way to the main villain, and, of course, they arrange a bizarre battle with the final, which will surprise only those who have never watched a film about the art of the marshal. There are nuances that nostalgic types like, especially the cut of Thomas mullets and many male colleagues. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wants him to never step on the set.
