In the original film there was nothing of value, this one was even a lamer. The fact that I even found it for rent was simply amazing. Anyone associated with this film should be high in something! So what was the storyline? What happened to the girl? Was the viewer supposed to get the storyline in the first four minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, I tried to look at it several times. I even borrowed a child from someone to get feedback. The kid said it was stupid, and he was four years old. I think that maybe some merit could have been given to the director of the filming, since perhaps some of the shots made the film more than the film B. It can push it. I really liked the theme of the song. Good thing it was just a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you might like the film if you are taller than the cast and crew. Is the pot lawful in France?
