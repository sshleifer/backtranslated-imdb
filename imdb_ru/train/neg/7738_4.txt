The film was "OK." Not bad, not good, just good. If there was something else in the theater, it would have been far missed. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 are also smelly, but I would prefer to see it than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Harrison Ford or another young punk, this will be a “cute” movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or blockbuster.
