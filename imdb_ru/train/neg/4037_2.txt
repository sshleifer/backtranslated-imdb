I have no idea what the producers of The Shield tried to do, but the result speaks for itself: Shield is practically unobservable. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the performances on The Shield are great ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show is so poorly composed that you cannot even see the performances. For example, editing cuts off reaction frames before they have their full impact. <br /> <br /> I do not know that there is an intellectual rationale for this, but it deprives the demonstration of all emotional influences. <br /> <br /> I will give Shield one point for ambition in his subject, but this is almost all I can give him. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a number of talented performers spending their gift on something so strangely poorly filmed.
