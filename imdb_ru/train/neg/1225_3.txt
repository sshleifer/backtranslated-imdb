Well, let me start by saying that I'm just amazing with this movie, I just could not stop laughing at his stupidity. Don't get me wrong, it works well, in particular, Bassinger, but the script is just, well, of course, incomprehensible to the mind. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite is good, and until Della witnesses the murder she is committing, but after that she just goes downhill. In the middle of the film, the main character pulls out her tool box and, of course, instead of lobbying him in the guy's head, she decides to pull out a screwdriver, car jack and finally a flash (for example, for a sinking ship) to kill her victims br /> <br /> Then I promise the final line: if you do not have stitches, I will eat my left leg. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie. to those who simply want to laugh at some kindly old-fashioned, terrible movie. May I also suggest that you beware of the scene at the junkyard, where the guy falling from a wooden board one foot high takes me every time.
