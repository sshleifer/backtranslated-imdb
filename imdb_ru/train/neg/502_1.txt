This film is not only a very bad movie with horrible actors - or supposed actors - a boring director and an unattractive story, it also accurately copies the scene from the excellent giallio Torso, directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years ago), one of the most the famous psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and cult cinema all over the world. In "La Sanguinusa Explorer La Danza" the director reproduces the scene in bed between black and white girls with a peeping look from the bedroom window. Naturally, the scene in the film Rizzo is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charm in the film Martino. Putting another black girl, another white girl, and another spygirl playing a scene is just the most suitable way to prove that the Rizzo film has no ideas, originality, taste, and nothing at all. I think that such things offend the viewer.
