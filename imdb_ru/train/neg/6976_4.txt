Robert Altman’s dreary, new-minded western from Edmund Noton’s McCabe was overlooked at the time of its release, but in recent years he has gathered many critics. In addition to the completely convincing scenario "Boom-city", the characters here do not deserve special interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) salty and unattractive. The bearded Warren Beatty plays an entrepreneur at the turn of the century who settles in a fighting community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; As soon as profits begin to flow, Beatty naturally threatens the urban struggle, which wants to participate in the action. Altman creates a solemn winter atmosphere for the film, which gives viewers a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this pitiful little town is limited - most of the story is made up of vignettes - and Altman’s move is intentionally slow. Hardly a statement is made (just the opposite), and languid actors look at each other without thinking. This is a self-destructive picture, and yet, in the Altman way, it proudly bears defeat. ** from ****
