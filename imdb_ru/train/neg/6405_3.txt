There is no real story, just a series of short scenes playing VERY old jokes. I chuckled once or twice at the beginning, unfortunately. But even after just 73 minutes, this film wears out quickly, it is welcome, and it becomes outdated and tedious (with some nudity sprinkled here and there, so that you don't sleep). Despite the fact that this film is bad (and rather rotten), it is a comedic decoration compared to almost ANAROOM Aaron Zeltser and Jason Friedberg (the film "Date", "Epic film", "Meeting with Spartans"). Sad way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 pairs of boobs, 3 bushes, 3 assholes <br /> <br /> My rating: D <br /> <br /> Red DVD code Additionally: Original trailer for this film ; and trailers for the films "Behind the Door", "Dead Pit", "Farmer", "Obsessed", "Power Game", "The Only Survivor" and "Foolish Taxi"
