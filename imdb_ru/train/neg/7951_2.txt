I gave Koi Joko a low rating, not because it was a bad film, but because it was not commendable. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any of Xiao-hsien Hou's works before, but for the uninitiated (including me), Koi Joko is advertised as a tribute to Yasujiro Odzu. (Japanese director, the last film of which was back in 1962). The film is very rare, there are very few dialogues, stories, music or emotions. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays Yoko, an unemployed, wandering character who spends his time in her local cafe or freely explores the Taiwanese composer she loves. Tadanobu Asano plays his friend, who works in a CD shop and sometimes indulges his otaku interest in trains. And it's all. <br /> <br /> We watch Yoko drinking coffee alone ... walking around ... waiting for the train ... getting on the train ... falling asleep on the train. The kind of worldly reality that everyone in Japan can see daily. You capture these ordinary moments of the life of these characters, but without any meaning for these vignettes, this is a completely meaningless movie or watch it.
