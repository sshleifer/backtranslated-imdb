Although the 1967 version of Hazard of Polina is not entirely offensive, it is, of course, idiotic. The name may lead to the fact that you expect tribute to Pearl White (the original Polina in 1914 silent series of 20 episodes), but for this you better fit the version of 1947 with Betty Hatton in the lead role. This 1967 version resembles a mixture of Casino Royale and the weakest of Elvis films. Worst of all, it's not a mixture of these things, but more like someone skipping segments from one another, so the thing is skipped back and forth between the two styles. <br /> <br /> Unity, which exists in the production, comes from the combination of Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Stedman), a successful combination, because both do not even have the most basic acting skills (imagine Mandy Moore playing against Dana Quayle). <br /> <br /> Austin will later play with John Aston in the movie Angry Roy Slade, and the difference between talents is actually painful to watch. In the mid-60s, she was a Dodge Rebellion girl, so she appeared in a similar series of dangerous situations — imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue jumpsuit. When the automaker's advertising agency replaced her with a girlfriend, Dodge Fever, someone had a bright idea to show her in a feature film. <br /> <br /> This story begins with the fact that Pauline grew up in the Basqueville house under the care of an actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. in Dobi Gillis. George falls in love with her (Pauline, not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotages several possibilities that she must take. George goes in search of his fortune, and Pauline, 19, gets a job teaching a young, oil-rich Middle Eastern prince. When he tries to add an attractive blonde to his harem, she runs off and goes from danger to danger. These include the African Pygmies, a 99½-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one-year-old grandson is old enough for marriage, the film industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All of this is meant to be stupid and charming, but it controls only the stupid part. Some efforts are being made to incorporate the noiseless view of the film into a sequence of actions, imitating the twisting of the camera (which speeds up the action). Unfortunately, everything else (film distribution, production design, installation) is depressing in the 1960s. Nothing here even comes close to a picture of a Pearl White tied to a log, moving in the direction of a buzzing saw or tied to a railway line, waiting for an approaching train. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
