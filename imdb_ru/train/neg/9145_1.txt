Let me first state that I like to watch "bad" movies. It's funny that some of these films make a more indelible impression than the really excellent ones. This movie is terribly evil. This conductor of the crazy ego of Sam Mraovich is not only bordering on mediocre mediocrity, but also redefines the very meaning of words. This should always be a barometer for bad movies. Sort the Mendoza lines for a movie. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs and plays the role of a blunt subject. Arthur Sayles fights with despicable wives and the Christian forces of evil, when he and his partner, Ben, "dead by their eyes," fight for equality in marriage. As a libertarian, I believe that gays should have the right to marry. Ben and Arthur do more harm to this cause than an army of homophobes. The image of the whole Christian is so ugly and mutilated, the trademark Mraovich that you can not take any of them seriously. Brother Arthur Victor, the Bible who is addicted to Jesus, is so terribly obsessed with evil / effeminate gay that you have to wonder how he ended up in this role. This is because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also the director. The worst is Sam Mraovich himself. When do you think a leading person remembers the words “pie, balding and plump”? Sam also supplies strings such as domino pizza, cold and usually wrong. Final score: you suck on the composition, directing, acting and casting This is Ed Wood's quadruple crown. Congratulations, terrible little man.
