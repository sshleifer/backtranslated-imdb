Razon is a terrible movie! It is so simple. It seems they were trying to make a film to show the life of the reel. Just as Zappa did many years ago. But, unfortunately, in Denmark there are no good young actors. Many are still Leon as a little girl in Krummernes Jule, and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. Several times in the film she plays without a soul, and this destroys the film! <br /> <br /> Even if I consider it a movie that is worth watching. I do not agree with the fact that young people behave this way, but I think that this can show how this can end if you let down your child. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies such as Kinofolk! <br /> <br /> In general, I think that people should see RÃ¥zone. Not because this is a great movie, but because these are films that touch on important topics. I also think that it is important to note that there are some scenes of violence in this, and in fact it is in these scenes that Laura acts best. - as the end, where she holds a gun!
