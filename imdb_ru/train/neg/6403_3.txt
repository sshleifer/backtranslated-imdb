.... as for the level of wit at which this comedy operates. Having almost reached the length of the function, “Can I do it ...” “While I don’t need glasses,” this is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that this should have been a highlight (example: Santa's gag); others are so long that you will not be able to believe in this when you realize that they need so much time to establish an “highlight” (example: funny students). And almost all are directed without any artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 time in 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (iron / phone, probably, my favorite). There is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity, which once again proves that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is also some comedic male nudity). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is really damn memorable! But none of these reasons is enough to give this film something more than * of 4.
