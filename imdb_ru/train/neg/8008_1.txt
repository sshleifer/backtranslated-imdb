For Daniel Otto, `Queen Margot 'was much better. For Nastasya Kinski, "Paris, Texas" was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges (“CrissCross” and “A World Apart” cannot even be compared with this) and from Goran Bregovic for using the version of the same musical theme from “Queen Margot” for this film (Focus on the end of the film). If it was an American pop film, I would not be surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and a director, a similar general approach to child abuse without an original understanding is very simple and frustrating. There are bad guys who kidnap and sell minors. There are those poor children who hate the people selling them and are waiting for someone to save them. And finally, there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from the bad guys. Each character is shown in simple black and white terms: good versus evil. In addition, from the very beginning I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the story of child abuse? I believe that the difficult problem of child abuse and pedophilia is much more complicated than how it is depicted in this not very original film. I think this film was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
