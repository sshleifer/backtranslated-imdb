What a bad image of professional policemen displayed on television while watching this alleged reality show. One can only hope that real reasonable suspicion, which leads to a probable cause, which leads to a set of circumstances that make a “stop”, then a “pat” outside his clothes, in order to be able to explain why the officer went into someone's pocket and took out the contraband, was cut from the scene, because if this does not happen, the arrest will be rejected in most places, even if it is handed over to the warden. The announcement of a warrant by radio does not mean the actual existence of the warrant, unless the sending person has an original warrant on hand. If the dispatcher reads from a printout on a computer, it is enough to arrest, but this does not necessarily mean that the order is still valid. Since I did not see the Dis-Claimer from CBS (perhaps I missed it), CBS may be in trouble.
