The five or so really good Westerns that Mann created are unmatched as a Hollywood ensemble. Even John Ford has never done so much with this quality. It is curious that they are all unequal. My dear Clementine Ford is worth about two and a half of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> Their true hero, besides Mann and Stewart, is Chase. Chase is responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote a faraway country, a bend in the river, and perhaps some others. But none of them are finished the same way as “My dear Clementine”, but then there are very few films, both Western and others. <br /> <br /> Each of the five Mann films has huge gaps, or six, let's see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and yes, six, Naked Spur. Everyone has a great scene after a great scene, with fairly obvious omissions. However, just like the Red River, which is still the greatest West ever created. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But the Far Country has huge, huge holes. It's disgusting, and really comes alive only when Stewart and McFull lock their horns. The rest is pretty pedestrian, with the usual exception of the Mann Camera. The Mann Camera is a cinematography course for one person. This is about the same good eye as anyone who has ever fallen behind a moving film strip. It is almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> Far Country has one amazing moment. And as usual it comes from Stuart. No one in the history of cinema has ever received physical punishment with the authority of this person. He is absolutely amazing: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester and the Man of Laramie: in Bend he was beaten and hangs on a string so believably, and with such boiling hatred, he looks like someone moved from Dachau to Far with such violence he is beaten down with a raft, it looks so convincing that you shudder, and, of course, when it is pulled through a fire in Man, you find yourself looking for burn marks. What an actor. Not to mention the moment when he was beaten up early in Winchester in a hotel room, as he had ever been. <br /> <br /> But this was Mann territory: take a look at Gary Cooper, who fights Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any battle scene. Cooper, although not as convincing as Stewart, is nevertheless somehow equal to him in looking exhausted at the end of the battle. In short, no one but someone, but no one has ever shown a person in extremism as much as Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great director. <br /> <br /> See every western he has ever done. They are his real monuments, even if they are all fragmentary. So what. When he roars with his magnificent scenes, they are as good as everyone, including Ford. And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever made by anyone, period. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Anthony.
