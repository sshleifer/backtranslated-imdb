I rented this DVD when I saw it when I was looking for something else. When I saw the name on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read the book of Yalom about a year ago, and I really liked it; I really admire the work of Yalom as a whole. (I am a clinical psychologist.) I looked, maybe 30 minutes of this film, and I had to turn it off. I'm not sure if I can take much more. At the surface level, artificial accents, as others have noted, are simply distracting at best, and annoying at worst. A game is boring when it should be passionate and comical, when it should be serious. The image of Lou Salome is frivolous, and the brilliant Freud looks like a schoolboy. I see very little spirit of the book, transmitted so far. I hoped I could recommend this film to my students. Instead, I will refer them to the book. Submit it.
