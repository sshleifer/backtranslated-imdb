At first this film was a bit confusing. I usually like Gina Phillips, but this one, I have to say, was a bad choice, just as she was in the movie “The Ring Around Rosie,” and this movie is also not her good movie. Jeepers Creepers was much better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. She scared me, and in the end it was insane. It was about Jennifer Cassie (Phillips), who comes to the funeral of their twin sisters. She lives in a house her sister owns, and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) sacrifices her relationship to stay alive, and while she wants to live, she cannot die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, she tries. Crows have a strange role in this. When relationships go to bed, the crows feed on organs there so that they cannot fall asleep. But they do. Basically, all this is crazy, and Mary Ellen will never die, and her relationship will be buried, but not dead, because they must suffer forever so that Mary Ellen can survive. Yes, I hope this helps. If not, sorry. I love you
