Is this movie a joke? This is a comedy? Of course, this is not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor, but in many cases a bad acting game, bad direction, and a horrible script made the audience laugh out loud at the movies. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist who has just peaked, shot by a murderer, into which he enters by mistake. The killer sees the portfolio of works by young artists, which he carries, and decides to visit the exhibition of his works. At the exhibition, the assassin meets the dead sister of artists, and they fall in love. These are all very predictable things, and no one realizes the end, since it is so poorly written. The action of the film takes place mainly in Vienna and its surroundings, and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this film, unless you are learning how to NOT act, direct or write a movie script!
