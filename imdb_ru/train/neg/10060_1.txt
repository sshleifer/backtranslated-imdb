The author embarks on a “journey of discovery” of his “roots” in the southern tobacco industry, since he believes that the (Brightly and Deservedly Forgotten) film Bright Leaf tells about his ancestor. This is not the case, and he doesn’t really find anything of even insignificant interest in this absolutely stupid and indulgent glorified home movie suitable for showing at drunken family meetings (director), but certainly not for commercial or even non-commercial release. A good reminder of why most independent films are not shot by large film studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and uninteresting for anyone except the director and his immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
