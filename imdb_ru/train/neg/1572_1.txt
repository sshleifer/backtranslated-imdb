Pretty one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A terrible game, a ridiculous "action" (it is clear that the cars are moving slowly), a cruel script, a terribly unsatisfied ending and an incompetent guide make the movie hash. We know that Judge Reinhold is an excellent actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no strong tension in the car, and when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, for some reason they laugh like crazy banshees, even “five times” when they see that the bridge has been lowered! In addition, the chain of events that lead to the fact that these people share the same car trust, causes trust. Apparently based on real events? If so, the truth is obviously stranger than fiction! Unfortunately, the fact that it was depicted in such an incompetent way.
