Although I can not deny that his films are often interesting, I always personally felt that Martin Scorsese was just a little overrated in his abilities. His use of bright styling in a large number of his films seems to scream: “Look at me, am I not a creative director?”. His best film I’ve seen is the one with the fewest colors added, the superb Raging Bull. <br /> <br /> Although for this remake, it seems, everything was as usual. The boring film to convey the atmosphere of the 1950s was so bland that it was distracting in itself. Melodramatic close-ups in conjunction with the chosen imitation of the classical score “Psycho” are more likely to cause smirks of ridicule than the feeling of atmospheric terror. The score "Psycho" was incredibly nervous, this "tribute" sounds just piercing and annoying. Even actors, who sometimes can be decent, perform historical performances that just scream “caricature”; A notable exception is Lewis’s smart turn as an impressionable teenage daughter from the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> De Niro is surprisingly the worst offender here. Of course, he looks quite threatening, but as soon as he opens his mouth, the aura simply disappears. Now I'm not an American accents expert, I originally came from England, not far from Manchester, but surely he could come up with a more convincing southern tint than this? Being a gifted physical actor, he almost overcame this fatal flaw, but not quite. I, as a fan of De Niro, was embarrassed by the desire that he was behind the scenes, and not delighted with his performance. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.) <br /> <br /> - the best style of the entire film extends to the ridiculously bloated finale. When will Scorsese find out that underestimating a situation can sometimes create tension as effectively as give the viewer a visual and sound bombardment? I also thought that he was too respectful of his reputation to resort to a cheap “killer is not dead” trick that less talented people can use. <br /> <br /> In general, a completely ridiculous “thriller”, Scorsese and De Niro did MUCH better work together.
