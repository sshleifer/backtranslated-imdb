Would anyone really see this rubbish if there were no small children running around naked in it? From a cinematic point of view, this is probably one of the worst films I've encountered, absolutely terrible. Some perverts once woke up and thought that I would make a film with little girls and call it art, put them in the countryside, and there is no need for telling or explaining how they got there or why they don't appear to live anywhere or have parents because movies don't need anything like that. I would comment on the rest of the movie, but I didn’t mention spoilers, so I’ll just say avoid, avoid and find a suitable movie to watch.
