This film deserves another bad review. Consider a reviewer praising the merits of a film in which "there is no sex, violence and bloodshed." Excuse me. The very production of the film makes us watch as a young comrade Cody, with a love of life and who has everything worth living for, scatters into pieces, leaving Cody in his lifeless, bloody body. And, given the nature of war, we know that Cody saw horror almost daily. So much for those who watch this movie with such pink glasses, that the violence that determines Cody’s personality is erased from the viewer's memory. <br /> <br /> Without any family of his own Cody, like John Rambo, wanders around the country on his bicycle to make a long hike to his hometown of the United States under the guise of a certain city of Nevada. No mention, no understanding of the obvious fact that Cody is a damaged product. We know this because his commander actually announces him so that he orders Cody to "take some rest" from the death and destruction of the war. This explains how no one seems to notice or care, the obvious "flat" effect of Cody. This is a good game. This is the flat effect of post-traumatic stress disorder. Not knowing here, remember that his commander ordered him to leave the battlefield. <br /> <br /> How about this “random” kiss, as noted in another review. The fall was an accident, there was no kiss. How exactly did Cody "respect" Faith, hitting her, knowing perfectly well what she was told about? Now it was not a family value moment. The moment, which is then announced to the nearest universe, as if posted on YouTube. Of course, the faithfulness of faith, as well as Cody's “coming in” to a woman who plans to marry another, are perceived in the spirit of the Christmas season, and they all welcome their deceived hearts and lips. <br /> <br /> We know little about the bridegroom of the Faith, except that she professes her love for him, she needs no more than a nanosecond to accept his offer (perhaps he will wait if some thoughts appear ), he is generous, he loves her to death, there is nothing really against him in the family, he believes that marriage is based on compromises, and they never discussed plans after marriage. There are no villains here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a wonderful actor who is told on a hill: “We love you, son ...”. “You are part of our family” literally a few days after they met a stranger. by the name of Cody. And the speech of the “group of brothers”, where this phrase, first of all, was never intended for virtual strangers outside the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this film is a sweet Christmas fluff that betrays itself mainly, especially rudely, when it welcomes Cody’s disrespect for Vera, physically hitting her, knowing perfectly well what is being said for her. Redefining the family as we know it is accepting a virtual stranger as a full-fledged loving family member, because we all "love you." Who of you did it or who knows someone who did it? NOT.
