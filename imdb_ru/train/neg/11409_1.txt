The trend of the disgusting violence of the 80s, disguised as a “horror film”, really began. I was the target audience for this repulsive piece of garbage, and then I was disgusted, as now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where we start. Let's see the settings: you can bring people back to life if they died a violent death. So this ridiculously weak premise is a reason for killing people in horrible ways, because, well, it is necessary to bring them back to life! It could work if playing for black, laughing at Re-Animator or something like that. But no, it is played straight. In the wagon, a whole frightened family hunts, at least one of the few scenes where their death is behind the scenes. However, almost everything else is on the screen. In fact, there is a scene where a strolling and murdered young girl is beaten up by zombie citizens who all take pictures of her and smirk with several cameras. Then her close-up face, and the filmmakers with love — and take a lot of time — in a time-lapse photo, her battered face is carved on the skull and rearranged to look like “normal” again. This, of course, made the dormant Jack Albertson in the role of a suicide bomber for all this. He likes to drive an ambulance / hearse playing old tunes by Tommy Dorsey, I think it must be nice. <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, even the Sheriff is undead, and the doctor kindly offers to fix his rotting hands. It is not clear why the sheriff does not meet with other citizens, who gladly kill children, cut off their faces, put needles in the eyes of victims of burns, etc. <br /> <br /> Interesting, really interesting, what people see in a geek, similar to this, to give it any rating at all. It's not scary, the turns are ridiculous, and on the whole it's kind of sick. It’s not even well done to “see it to the challenge” or enjoy it at a level you could watch a bad film by H. G. Lewis. This is just a terrible garbage created for people who are confused by this kind of meaningless blood, and created by people reeling for a salary. <br /> <br /> Sad that Albertson was even involved.
