It seems that the main point of these comments is that the film has amazing animation (I watched it on Blu-Ray), but it really doesn’t correspond to any real depth. <br /> <br /> First, all the characters are pretty cute stupid. I understood the hint of the situation with Laputa between Agito, Tola and the main antagonist Shunak. However, perhaps my mind wandered, and it was wishful thinking (Laputa is my favorite anime, the original Engilsh dub). The characters are also not very attractive, and, as mentioned in another post, they fall in love very quickly, leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who doesn't seem to notice this). However, she quickly seems to forgive Toola at the end without explaining the change of heart, except that it makes the ending a bit more “happy.” <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanation. For example, who are the druids? Are they human? and who are strange women / girls who seem to hang out with them and rule the forest? Nothing explains why they are there and how they can give ordinary people superpowers. Plants arriving from the moon, still do not fill the gaps on this matter. It's almost like a weird version of Triffid Day. <br /> <br /> Whose name is Toola? Why bother about it if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted this film to be liked, but I didn’t find a plot as deep as the film “Ghost in Armor”, or a real character like this. Miyazaki. I do not resent watching this, but I really wish that I did not buy it. My advice? Try it if you have a couple of free hours, but lend it or buy it cheap! Perhaps if you are new to anime movies and you have nothing to go for, you will like it. It is of course nice visually.
