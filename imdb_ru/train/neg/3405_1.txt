I can't believe how uneducated this film is. This is like watching a police academy, except that with people who have no idea what they are talking about, and ... Wait, there is a stupid robot that should be a supporter. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but it's just nonsense. Not only is there no plot for this film. It is like watching someone pretending to be a doctor throwing non-medical words, as if they were the chief of staff at the main medical facility. Plus, people wear clothes that are not suitable for the space program. I feel that I am watching a movie "b" for girls from a valley in space.
