Kids love dinosaurs. This is to some extent part of their culture. But they have the Earth ahead of time. Original. At least this film had a heart. It. This film is just pathetic. The fact that children love dinosaurs does not mean that you can simply put together any old story and show it to children. This movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and thatâ€™s more in terms of things. Not like a soul sucks, like Theodore Rex, but these are bright years from being the Earth ahead of time.
