The only possible way to enjoy this movie is to hit your head against a wall, allow internal brain hemorrhage, allow multiple cells in your brain to die, and as soon as you are mentally retarded, you may * CAN * enjoy this movie. . <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was superb in the role of a taxi driver, just like a British girl. Perhaps if they had made the whole movie in their antics in India, and how they ended up falling in love would make it a much more pleasant movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him 3 marks is that Gowida and his actor abilities when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted in vain. In addition, the Heathrow reunion scene was too complex for perception. As an international traveler in the world after 9/11, Anil Kapoor could have shot himself before he reached the heavenly bridge to confess his true love :) But on the other hand, the filmâ€™s goal was to defy logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg into face of * OVERALL * audience. <br /> <br /> See this at your own risk. At least I know that I have had scars for life :(
