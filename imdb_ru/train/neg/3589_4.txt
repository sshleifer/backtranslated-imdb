I was attracted to this film when I watched the cast, but after I watched it, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. The main problem of this film is that the actors are not able to hold this film behind their backs. What for? Because of a bad script. Although Dillon, Lane, and Jones are struggling to take this film to another level, there is no innovative narrative, and the direction is too ordinary. So for fans of Matt Dillon, this is a watchable movie, as well as for fans of the beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but this is not a film for him; far below his level. So, if you get hooked on this great cast, watch it, but don't expect anything big or unusual. The only thing you remember about this movie is the scenes of Diane Lane; Otherwise it is very easy to forget.
