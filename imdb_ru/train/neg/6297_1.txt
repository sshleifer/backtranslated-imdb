I am a big fan of Martin Amis, on whose book this film is based. Unfortunately, the director could not translate the book on the screen. The novel is completely post-modern and extremely artificial in its wildly bloated characters and the disintegration of the traditional storyline and character development. This is a fun study of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moral contemporary British writers. The film director completely missed the point of the novel. In his hands, the film screams with breakneck speed, pandering to every known stunt and possible “strange” camera angle. It's like Ken Russell on acid, and suffers from indulging the most senior director up to a hundred. Even a short glance at the penis of the magnificent actor Christian Solimeno was not enough to save this pathetic film for me. Fierce!
