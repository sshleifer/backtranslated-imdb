I saw this movie by chance yesterday at the cinema. I had some hopes for the film, because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book on which it is based. The film starts well, because at first glance it seems like a good thriller. Quickly, although the film becomes a mess with uninteresting storylines, characters that never loom, and no one in the audience cared for (like Marjoke) and terrible editing. and many scenes that simply add nothing to the story and can be easily discarded. After going through this story, you will encounter one of the worst endings that I have seen in a very long time. It should also be mentioned that there are many sexually explicit scenes in the film that you are probably used to if you watch a lot of Dutch films. It's hard to mention anything good about this movie. About a third of the spectators had already left the theater halfway through the film, and I did not hear a single kind word after the film ended. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed any faith I left in the Dutch film industry.
