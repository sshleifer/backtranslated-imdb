This film is a great illustration of how NOT to make a science fiction movie. The worst trend in science fiction is to make of your theme a terrible, sofomorian, pseudo-orwellian / juxlanian / whateverian “vision” of the “human future”. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers (and authors), like geeks, take yourself very seriously, given the high ratio of crap to good in their genre. I think that other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just came up with, relaxing), such as horror or an action movie or even a romantic comedy, seem to understand a little better the fact that they do not change the world with some depth "message." <br /> <br /> Science fiction can certainly be successful at a serious level, as many great directors have proven. But there is a huge flip side to the whole concept, which is represented by “Robot Jocks” with its cheap “future” design (a lonely good design element: fancy, brilliant billboards everywhere, which encourage women to have more children) and their painfully heavy parallels with “ Iliad "(" He is named Achilles for God's sake! ". I really did not understand this until I watched the movie for about the tenth time, but I went to the public to school, so the directors are not rehabilitated.) <br /> <br /> Of course, if you're a crazy fan of movies like me, y This disadvantage is a big plus. I really like these movies, because bad movies are often more fun, and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. I think this is a kind of Lester Bans approach to watching movies. <br /> <br /> Note: the main role in this film (Gary Graham? Is that his name? I refuse to go checking) is really not that bad. He does it. He is cool, especially when he is drunk / hung.
