I just finished watching the Going Overboard. I have to say that we have to send every copy of this film to Iraq and get them to watch. I even tried to get blind women to watch this, and she turned them off after about 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for writing, if this is what you want to call, those in charge should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was 10,000 dollars, and they were much lower. Wallmart got a good deal about this? Every store has a big, huge basket of this shit sitting on the marketplace. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a stand or exchange it for a friend, but then they can no longer be your friends !!
