It was a watchable movie, but the plot was a bit weak, and most of the jokes were from some of Rodney's early films. With that said, it was worth the time to look. I gave it 5 out of 10. So, in fact, this is one of those films that you do not go out of your way to see, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
