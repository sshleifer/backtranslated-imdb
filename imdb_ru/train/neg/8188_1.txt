The funniest thing in this ridiculous film is his vanity, that if a person becomes holy, he or she, his family or his significant friend, live forever. Let's forget that in order to become a saint, a saint must be dead, and the saints do not have significant others. For thousands of years, Nick was a Jolly Elf for Skredzha Fred, which is not even hinted! Open on Nick, learning how to make toys, then on Fred, learning how to run numbers; Nick gives the sick child a cart, Fred takes the cart along with the family farm! After a few more such episodes, Fred turns into today's Frend, who releases his spleen from anonymous brothers and sisters, and his losers nod in sympathy. There, I just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy! <br /> <br /> This Santa, which is one ho-ho-ho-ho-ho from the massive coronary artery, is a neurotic, burdened with a queen of harpies, an operation right from the hell of Megamall, and the answers on the board ( Yes?), which just gave the Easter bunny his pink egg. Oh, and his right hand is a frivolous blonde in a tight mini dress and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really annoyed me was that the Helmet was named number 1 on the naughty list. Shouldn't a naughty list be reserved for future Hitlers and Stalin? Children who are true incarnations of evil? No, for Old Sausage Fingers, a good boy who pounces because he is undesirable and unloving, this is Demon Seed! <br /> <br /> Nimrods behind Fred Klaus should be boiled in their own pudding! Bah!
