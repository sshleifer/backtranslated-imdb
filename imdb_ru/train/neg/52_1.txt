I was excited to watch a film about Catalonia at the Berlin competition. But after the presentation I was completely disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like any war, was terrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, not at all likeable, is shown in countless films and plays, as well as in the relations of homosexuals and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr. Villronga is trying to do is a pseudo-tragedy that belongs to the worst of the filmâ€™s history. It is a pity to see Angela Molina in this film. I do not advise anyone under any circumstances to go watch this movie.
