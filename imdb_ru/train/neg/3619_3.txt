In fact, there is a family in which a little boy (Jake) thinks that there are zombies in his closet, and his parents always curse. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... decides to become Rambo and kill zombies. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, when you are going to make a film, you have to decide whether it will be a thriller or a drama! How a drama film can be watched. Parents divorce and argue, as in real life. And then we have Jake with his wardrobe, which completely destroys the whole movie! I expected to see a similar movie BOOGEYMAN, and instead I watched a drama with a few meaningless thrillers. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 only for good playing parents and the triggering dialogs. As for the pictures with Jake: just ignore them.
