Have you ever heard of a Taiwan horror movie? Or some Taiwanese movie? Probably for a reason. This one was really boring, even though it contains black magic, including withered children's bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> After reading the thoughts of other people, I was looking forward to some violence and blood, but there is not much there. A bit of gagging and other unpleasant things, if you are waiting for graphic blood or some horrible effects, you will be disappointed. They clearly did not use eel blast and other things to the maximum extent. <br /> <br /> Nothing good about this movie; a single character who was not completely soft and some good black magic spells like eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect did not work at all, the most terrible was an albino girl (though not so terrible). This is the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
