Ugh. It seemed strange to me that their ancient book on curses was written in plain text instead of handwritten. At times, acting is so apathetic, while at others it's too dramatic. Why did the "demon" kill two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for this? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle when she is somewhere there? We get it! You spent some money to rent the third step. This does not mean that you have to show it all the time! The Faith Lair looks like the old school Battlestar Galactica with some last minute changes. There is a scene where we present several people in a talk show for 30 seconds before they are killed for no apparent reason and without meaning. Each person is a unique character. Unforgettable characters and even more memorable plot make this film the most ill-conceived of all that I saw on SciFi. Stay away if you are not in bad movies.
