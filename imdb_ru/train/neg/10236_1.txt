Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before the legion of filmmakers chokes on their lattes, let me dwell in more detail. As much as I like it, it's just one of the worst films I've ever seen, and definitely the worst film I've ever seen in a movie (an impressive statement, as I recall, when I saw Daredevil on the big screen). The two leaders (Daniel Gillis and Elisha Cuthbert) were inconclusive at best and absolutely terrible at worst. Of course, they were not helped by the script, which had the same emotional depth as the single Daphne and Celeste, and the characteristics that were about as convincing as the defense of OJ. The plot (to stretch the term a bit) was thin to nonexistent, and the scenes of “bloody”, although they were undoubtedly cruel, were irrelevant and ridiculously formal. At the heart of the plot is a model of the twenty with something (Cuthbert), which is kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various internal tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes are reminiscent of incoherent scenery, and the focus was on the shock rather than on scaring the public. Although there are actually very few positive points that can be learned from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a terrible film. I have never heard a more vocal movie audience. For twenty minutes the whole cinema was in stitches and remained the same in everything. For my part, I broke out laughing, supported by a film that rose to the top of horrible filmmaking. No matter how you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a plan for future directors, describing in detail how not to make a film. <br /> <br /> PS I did not mention that I managed to get into the movie for free ... so I can afford to laugh at it. I still felt like asking for my money back ... it really was THAT bad.
