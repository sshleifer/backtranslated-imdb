Although this is usually a funny movie about adventures in the jungle, it has some distinctive features - the settings are pretty beautiful, and the pace of the adventure is good. You will not be bored watching it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as light as possible, playing the eponymous hero, shamelessly drunk jungle guide, accompanied by rich boy Van Hoffman and his gorgeous wife, under a shower hunting expedition to the land of cannibals. He never takes things seriously. The shower is there as an ornament, and Keith makes extensive use of it - she really doesnâ€™t need to act much. She is not the only woman who shows off her body, and the prudent aspects of the film make it about halfway to T / A. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that could attract particular attention to it or away from this. Produced to be shlock, it does well without too much fuss. Good 2 AM cable programmer.
