As a big fan of the Cracker series, I have been waiting for the next addition of 7 years. I'm afraid that this episode just does not match the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years at his daughter's wedding and is participating in the investigation into the killing of a soldier, tormented by flashes in response to his duty in northern Ireland going to slaughter. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like about this episode is that it’s very convenient and how Fitz leads the killer. This is all fat for contrived. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in memories from Northern Ireland that were great shot.
