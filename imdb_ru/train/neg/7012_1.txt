My girlfriend and I went to watch this film as “The Surprise Premiere”, which we bought on a preview ticket of the film before it was opened here in Denmark. We sat after 1 hour or so, and then we left! The purpose of the film, it seemed, was simply to portray the era (and club 54), but this was done through the development of a character that was not there, and the plot of which was not enough. <br /> <br /> Rarely was I so indifferent to the characters in the film! <br /> <br /> Although the music was good. So, if you like to listen to good music and correct the mood of the 70s, I think this is normal. But do not wait for the plot of believable characters. <br /> <br />
