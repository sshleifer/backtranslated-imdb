"Beautiful guys with bad hairstyles !!" "Beautiful girls with no clues !!" "Stupid gangsters who can't shoot straight !!" From the Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama "Dragon Heat". For reasons that are likely to be completely hidden forever, in the movie "Outlaws on Steroids" and the cast, for some reason, they made both Maggie Q and Michael Bean sign as villains. But they don’t have much to do in this terrible festival. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors, each with their own resume and list of achievements, and Bean in particular, I had the courage to take on some rather complex and not heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was a super-bad “Mai” in “Live Free Or Die Hard,” Nuff said so. /> <br /> Bean, of course, is known for being a soldier from the future who made the Terminator of 1984 such a plausible fantasy / fantasy game, breaking up on Big Arnold, who is now the governor of California !! <br /> <br /> Michael Bean is almost completely lost in this terrible train crash of police drama. There is absolutely no reason for this, as the incredibly confusing storyline, presented mainly in Chinese, since this is a Hong Kong story, could have been better worked out for a non-Chinese audience with a foreign narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Bean were used as something like an observer or coordinator of Interpol or an agent under deep cover who would have to be given him “splines” every five or ten minutes, that would be great. But no, he was brought in as a part of a strange group of bad guys, such as spetsnaz, who seem to be engaged in the independent sale of their own corrupt deals, in the center of someone's absolutely corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals. <br /> <br /> Yes, there I said all this. Embarrassed? So do I. "Welcome to the party, buddy." <br /> <br /> In a truly excellent Hong Kong crime drama, known under the English title "Latest News", there are a number of interesting characters at work, but there is only one storyline in the plot. <br /> <br /> Bad guys against good cops. In this terrible and overly violent raid on the world of the Hong Kong triad or gang, it seems that hot police forces are nothing but a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery, as criminals mow them down. <br /> So it comes as no surprise that there is an almost incomprehensible scene (several scenes, in fact) where children try to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game to win prizes with stuffed animals. And so the good guys from the police of the good guys quite naturally intervene on their behalf, so the owner of the arcade must abandon the Kyupi dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also an indecisive attempt to create "love." interest "between one of the" visiting policemen "and the only female" visiting policemen. "<br /> <br /> Visiting policemen are supposed to be real witnesses to the leader of the gangster Triad, who is hijacked on the way to his appearance in court, not by his own team, but by mercenaries (Bean, Maggie Q and some others.) All these killers want something, but we don’t know what it is until the very end of the film !! <br /> <br /> It is impossible to create uncertainty in a criminal drama f without getting something, or getting, or leaving, being entered very early in the story. Add to this a few “cut scenes” made for purely ornate effects, all of which show the recent past. bad guys and ordinary bad guys, and any movie lover can easily understand why this barking dog gets 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
