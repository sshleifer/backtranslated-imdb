After a series of blackouts in a remote island zoo, saber-toothed tigers with genetic engineering were released and pricked the inhabitants of the island. Man, the sci-fi channel made some bad original films, but I think it could be their worst! This poorly written and directed plagiarism of the “Jurassic Park” offers all the usual clichés (insane scientists who think that people killed by monsters are “unjustified losses”), characters walking alone along long, dark corridors are brain-dying teenage characters who only act film must die a horrible death, etc.), and, not surprisingly, there is no expectation. The special effects are brutal - puppet heads in close-ups of title animals are bad enough, they look like hard plush dolls, but CGI makes computer dinosaurs in Life Walking with Dinosaurs look like comparisons - just terrible. There is some blood, but most of them look rather unconvincing. Oh, and the death scene of a scientist at the end is really one of the worst things I've seen in recent years. I could not even laugh, it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste time, this one is just awful. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting little things - this film borrowed musical remarks from the 2003 sci-fi movie Alien Hunter, which was far superior to this piece of shit.
