I come to the cinema every week or so, and check this site regularly, but never before have I felt obliged to comment on the film. <br /> <br /> In my list of horribly bad films of all time - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - now I can add nonsense, which was “Empty Man”. <br /> <br /> Of the terrible introductory titles - the ridiculously too long run-up of the cast and crew composed of the Spaghetti alphabet - right up to the offensive finale - a record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogues and acting skills that have ever been in the cinema - this movie is gloomy, and only impressive computer graphics will not let you go long before the end. <br /> <br /> This is not only my opinion, but also the opinion of my friends and all those around us. When a large part of the audience laughs and groans during and after a serious thriller, it becomes clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Moreover, he was also sick. The director took action beyond realistic fare for the violent film, and into the realm of the blood-stained B-film. It is hard not to imagine the director as some kind of dirty old man, because the number of attacks by an invisible person from the laboratory and into the outside world extended only to two attempts to feel some sort of breast. Perhaps sex could have been the first thing in the boy’s head if he had been made invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of the girls involved in him, he is unlikely to make an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> [Spoilers follow] <br /> <We drove the films of the patient exterior, but still worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job, acting more and more perversely as a “hollow man,” the rest — perhaps with disabilities due to a terrible scenario — are doing an even better job — being empty. One long-time team member found an invisible person strangled in a locker: “He finally broke down” shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is normal, and the lab team hesitates between horror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting. In horror, they make their way through the laboratory corridors, balancing their weapons, but after a few seconds one of the crew members happily jumps back down the corridor to get blood for the injured colleague. The leading woman treats the invisible man with politeness and good humor even after he has insulted and insulted her, and the reaction to his shoots seems to be low, even after he drowned the head of the Pentagon: “He drowned in his pool last night , ”Said the same woman, amazingly unable to put two and two together. <br /> <br /> The script is overwhelmed with this poorly acting dialogue with the pedestrian, and the rest is just AZ of stencils of film that are thicker and faster than the film unfolds to complete distrust and fun at the end. <br /> <br /> The Eureka moment at the computer, a woman undresses by the window, a looped video with protection - the list is really endless - a predictable disregard of numbers, the decision not to kill two main stars, but simply to place them in the place of probable impending death and leave them alone, almost dead good guy, appearing out of thin air to save a woman, a bomb and an omnipresent earl count tdown, a fireball explosion that just burns before you get to the heroes, a fall that stops before you hit on And more than anything else immortality bad guy. <br /> <br /> The Invisible Man burnt to shreds with a home-made flamethrower, struck by an electric current, hit the head with a rod that had just pierced one of the smaller actors, and then, obviously, surviving an explosion, a fireball and the complete destruction of laboratories has more than enough life to rise through a fireball, to see the characters of the films for the last time - at what stage the incredulous public shrinks and looks at their watches. <br /> <br /> That this exceptionally bad film really made his movie amazing. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the film itself, and even impressive special effects will not even save him, which should be avoided at all costs.
