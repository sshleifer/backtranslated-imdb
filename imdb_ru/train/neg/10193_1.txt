In this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all his might, while at the same time clearly stating in the film that his work is one of “objectivity”. Obviously, this is not the case. For one reason, many scenes “taken by pure chance” are obvious settings (when this poor goat “accidentally” falls off a cliff, you can really see the smoke of a gun on the right side of the screen!). On the other hand, he concealed one important information: the Hurdes people were as they were for a certain reason, which they just hinted at in the film. That is, goiter, a disease caused by iodine (salt) deficiency. This goiter is the cause of their cretinism, and if Buñuel had found the time to do his research (damn, if he checked “cretinism” in the medical dictionary, he would have found the “goiter”), he CAN finish by telling the truth about these people ( so far, with doubt). Instead, in his film, he constantly judges them, speaking of them as “cretins”, again and again, dramatizing the action, creating scenes for creating a performance, and all this is very unacceptable for a documentary who claims to work for all-powerful objectivity. Bunuel speaks all the time in this film without giving a single word to the people he is shooting. He speaks for them and even then judges them. This play is imperfect in its roots, in its ideology, and this is a real shame, it is considered an excellent film.
