City girl Meg Tilly receives a terrible phone call from her mother and, for obvious reasons shocked, returns home to her family’s rural excavations, only to face a mystery: why do all homespun residents act out strange and disturbing ways? The radiation thriller, which hardly paid tribute to ecology, makes the residents of a small town go crazy, which (ridiculously) includes two women who look at each other with a desire in a public place, and Tim Matheson, who receives oral attention from a girl on bench in the office. The picture is too stupid for words, wasting the thoughtfulness and quiet intensity of Tilly on the garbage, at the same time driving himself into a corner from which it is impossible to hope to get out. Some of Thomas Del Ruta’s cinematography is good (especially the fire sequence set in the garage), although it’s disappointed in inaccurate editing — and a rather depressing finale. The simplified scenario has neither surprise, nor a piece of originality in the sleeve. * 1/2 of ****
