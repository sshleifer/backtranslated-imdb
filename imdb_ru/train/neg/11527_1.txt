<br /> <br /> The film begins with the usual comic film-hero. This is about a boy who is loved, who has no parents, and he is madly in love with a girl from school No. 1. Nothing surprises in the film, there is nothing you could not guess when you come to the movies. Toby McGuire shows us that either he is not a good actor, or no other actor in the world can save a script like this. Perhaps children around the age of ten will enjoy the movie, but it is a bit cruel for the little ones. You can not help thinking about films such as "X-Men", "Batman" and "Spawn". All these names are better. I almost went out the last 20 minutes! One thing that could be good was computer animation, BUT even this is not something that can be put into the Christmas tree! So my advice: don't watch this movie, even if you get paid for it!
