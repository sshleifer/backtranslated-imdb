This movie is AMAZING. I watched it the other day with my cousin J.J. He said that everything is in order, but I think it is RULEZZZ! I mean, this is so cool. Ted V. Michels is so brave and intelligent. He made a film that was completely different from those terrible Hollywood films, like The Matrix and Stop or My Mother Will Make. Although it could be better. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like that big claw that a funny person wears. I think he's the coolest guy from that Domino Pizza guy. Not only does this movie look really cool, like the out-of-focus movies that my dad made from my birthday when I turned 6. But he tells a complex story with dozens of characters who seem completely unrelated, but they all meet at the end. It's brilliant how this network is woven so that everything comes together. I would like Ted V. Mickels to continue. But for this you need more aliens. And a pirate.
