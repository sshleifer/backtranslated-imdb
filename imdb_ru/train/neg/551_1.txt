I was looking through the list of the top 100 AFI comedies, and I must say that this is truly one of the worst. Not only from the 90 films in the list that I saw, but also from any movie that I have ever seen. Drunk sometimes funny, but Dudley not. Lisa almost paid off, but, alas ... just go and look at the "Arrested Development" if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley to laugh and drink should be funny? I would highly recommend ANY other film from the AFI's 100 best comedies for more laughter than this one. If you want to see a funny drunk, try The Thin Man. In general, a funnier movie, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if you are as drunk as Arthur).
