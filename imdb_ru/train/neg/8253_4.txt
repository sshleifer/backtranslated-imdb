The film had a pleasant beginning, I really believed that I got into one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen ... there was something special “foreign” about how the film was created, realistic, but somewhat abstract and mystical. But then the storyline began to become more and more unreal. To say that the finale was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost an understatement ... The most typical romantic finale, where everything is suitable for every “cute” character. The scene where the main character realizes that he made a mistake and pursues the “woman of his dreams” only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of spectators. Come on. In the end, the “good guys” win, the “bad guys” lose ... You understand. WASTE of a potentially interesting movie.
