Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there were more. There were unexpected turns, funny situations and, of course, a simple absurdity that would remind you a little of Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now in this sequel the same characters, the same actors to a large extent and the same time travel The plot changes a bit, since the characters now have to be experienced time travelers. Thus, they jump up and down in the story, not paying any attention to the fact that it becomes more absurd as it moves through the film. The Duke, Jean Reno, is trying to keep it all together with his game, but his character is devastated, so he cannot do much to save the film. <br /> <br /> Now the servant of the duke / assistant, he really has all the attention. The film is just about him and that he is clumsy / annoying / stupid or whoever he is. The fact is; this character tries to make the public laugh, but he fails. As if someone told you a really very, very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling the joke to the end, adding details to alleviate your suffering. <br /> <br /> If you like Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with a sequel. If you don't like Les Visiteurs, you never want to see the sequel. If you liked this sequel ... well, I guess you still need to watch a lot of movies.
