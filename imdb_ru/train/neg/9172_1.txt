When I go to watch a film about zombies, I donâ€™t expect Oscar Caliber to be presented or compositions at the Godfather level, but I expect the actors to at least not look tense while reading their hints and dialogs. it does not seem to have been scored 10 minutes before the actor reads him into the camera. This film was just awful, I actually got up and left for about 25 minutes and went next door and watched Cold Creek, which was also not very good, but it seemed like Citizen Kane compared to this bunch of crap. On the other hand, the girls were very nice, and this is probably the only thing that kept me in place longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left after the hottest was killed, there was nothing that could interest me after that.
