The below-average video game turns into a kind of conspiracy to find the next terrorist in the US backyard. Welcome to the madness of cheap, made directly to video movies. It is full of nameless actors and actresses with a small valuable plot. <br /> <br /> In any case, this strange game continues, and our “hero” bets on real money and does it well. It's a bit of a gamble, except that the game part has disappeared and it sucks. Instead, it's an online game with little real value, and you gain credibility if you do good. <br /> <br /> What is even stranger is that the two strange computer programs are somehow fighting, and everything is finished. I will leave the viewer to see how all this will be implemented. <br /> <br /> In general, it’s not even worth renting for $ 1. Borrow it, please. "D-"
