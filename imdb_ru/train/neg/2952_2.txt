Watching only the trailer for Theodore Rex, you might think that this is a bad comedy with a cop friend of Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume. This is true, but it is mostly a futuristic story, which is in many ways similar to Batman Forever with its own style of direction and strange character design. It was sold incorrectly and should have been sold as a futuristic story, and not just a lame cop comedy. Regardless of whether this film is moving to market or not, it is still a terrible film. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs come to life thanks to amazing technologies, and they talk and walk like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after the dinosaur is killed, he is given a case on which he must work, but he must be a partner of the toughest cop of all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). This is an inappropriate duet to uncover the murder, and the audience must stay awake long enough to cope with this piece. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character, but towards the end it's unbearable to listen. For some reason, being a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad imitator. He imitates famous people and accents, and he has really terrible features. Whoopi blames him for farting, and he says, "This is not my pipe!" That's Yes! What a childish, immature line, even for children's films of this level. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping that Teddy would bite off her head for the entire length of the film. <br /> <br /> This film never knew what it wanted to be. When futuristic scenes and actions occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any scenes without action, the characters try to be as funny as possible, which leads to nonstop boredom with a straight face. Action scenes do not work, because they are too strange and not violent enough, and, as mentioned earlier, comedy is just a bunch of dead jokes. Nothing works here. <br /> <br /> The presence of a detective duo of dinosaurs and people seems like quite an original film, if not more. Nope This film is a huge plagiarism of the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Simply replace the dinosaurs with cartoons and set them in the future, and this is exactly the same story. Man killed, dinosaur killed. The dinosaur and the detective reveal the murder, and the cartoon and the detective reveal the murder. The bad guys at Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and affection. The bad guys here are the guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd, and the guys who act like caresses. The club scene in the Roger Rabbit, where Jessica Rabbit descends from the stage, is simulated by dinosaurs. This is a huge plagiarism of a much better movie! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a bad film, not even deserving to watch it directly on VHS. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 90 pg minutes for mild violence, language and rough humor.
