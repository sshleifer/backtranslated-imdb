Strange, but almost all reviewers appreciate this film. Is it because it was in 1975 that Chamberlain and Curtis are in it, and, therefore, to forgive sometimes a very bad acting and childish way of storytelling? <br /> <br /> Maybe this is because some people are sentimental to this film because they have read the book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think this is a problem, the filmmakers never assume that the audience has read the book). <br /> <br /> Or because I am subconsciously annoyed by the fact that English-speaking actors try to behave like their French colleagues?
