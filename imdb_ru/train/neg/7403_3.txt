It was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but this is about as much as can be said about it. It starts with a good atmosphere; the hospital is respectively sterile and alienated, the mood is set to "creepy". And then ... nothing. Well, something. Only that which clearly does not fit ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and at the same time not particularly frightening creatures and the hospital that they have captured. I mean, come on, biker dads? Some group watched too much Gvar. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was the main demon, who looked like a middle-aged truck who was desperate to threaten, and at the same time looked like he really wanted to sit on an Afghan-covered couch, unfasten his belt, Get a can of cheap beer (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I have seen far more terrible truckers. On trucks. To drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Fearfully! <br /> <br /> Other monsters are even more caricature and even less scary. At least on the DVD video gives some explanation of their presence in the hospital ... they apparently just happen to appear in some places, play some kind of bippy metal, and make people die a little. With the exception of a few good special effects and not quite terrible acting because of the lack of a decent letter, there is simply nothing. This is just a background noise movie.
