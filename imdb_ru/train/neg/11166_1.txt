I’m sure that deep in the depths of Jack Black’s mind, Nacho Libre’s character is absolutely cheerful, but no, it’s not. You can say that Ol Jacks, having a whale of time, plays in a cunning, slimy Mexican monk with dreams of becoming a fighter, but this film is just a flash in almost every part. <br /> <br /> I just sat there for most of the movie, thinking "It must be funny" and "This is a guy from Tenacious D, right?". The truth is that this film can offer NOTHING. EVERYTHING! This is a lousy script with shitty characters and really vague actions and directing. You will see endless moments when you think something funny will happen, but it just isn't. I was bored for about 10 minutes, but it will surely catch. This is not true. After 90 minutes, I barely managed to prevent the aneurysm, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> It’s like, as you remember, many years ago when you saw something with your favorite actor, even some of them are really an early pap from before they became famous and you were would really be embarrassed that he said that the actor really was in such a load. Yes it is. <br /> <br /> I liked some of Jack Black’s early films, such as The Petty Hall, and I’m really looking forward to seeing Peak of Fate, but come on, man. If you do this with us again, Jack, I will have to go there and score your kneecaps or something like that. At least give you a serious talk. <br /> <br /> I know this is a cliche, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and for many reasons ....
