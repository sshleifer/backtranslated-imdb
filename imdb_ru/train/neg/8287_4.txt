This is largely a television version of the story, the film begins as an episode of "Xena ...", with a little meaningful dialogue or character description. After a while, it becomes a little more meaningful, but all the characters are still cartoony. <br /> <br /> Salma is an exotic beauty. Richard Harris is an evil and sexually repressed Frollo, struggling to break a nut in Salme. Other characters, including Quasimodo, are pretty easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> This is also a kind of a liberal version of the story, Frollo is the suppressor of the ideals of the Enlightenment, as the abbot in The Name of the Rose, and Quasimodo is the defender of freedom. The dark side of Quas is ignored, although he pours liquid on people. In fact, he is just an outsider, he looks different and likes to play with the bells more than an ordinary person. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film is intended for children, but I doubt it, given that Frollo smacks himself bloody to correct his desire to spank his monkey. For the most part, uninteresting and forgettable, but not terrible, and sometimes interesting execution of the story.
