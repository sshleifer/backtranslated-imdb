Well, I rented this movie and found that it really sucks. This is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family, then the cool son comes with his stupid camera, and he likes to photograph the damaged building, strange things and strange films, and then he asks his father to take him on a trip and just agree, and so on and so forth ..... They go to that city that no one knows that it exists (blah blah blah) And the most unpleasant thing is that the film ends and you donâ€™t Understand WHAT IS A FILM !!!! I saw a lot of mysterious films, but it was the worst, Honestly, he has no description at all, and I wish I had seen him.
