Scenes of fights are played as in Jackie Chan's slow motion, and the attempts of wit are pitiful (the worst pun: “Guess what? This time I heard that you were going”). The stars are an inappropriate pair: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of screen charisma and charms - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free from (at least in this film). Note to the director: in the future, please stay away from any love scenes, especially when your main actress will not do nudity, and you have to rely on a double body. (* 1/2)
