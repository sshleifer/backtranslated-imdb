You cannot go far when the initial story is not so great. The assumption that a cyborg needs blood is crazy. <br /> <br /> The script is just awful. With the actors there is nothing to work on. The kits were organized in the desert to cut costs. It is a trademark that if the background is a desert, then the film has no budget. <br /> <br /> A budget deficit is good if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work from scratch. but this film looks as if they had to reconsider their changes in order to buy an operator a sandwich. Again, forgivable, if only the story does not just suck. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film commits the biggest crime of all: it does not end! It simply ends as if it were a commercial from the rest of the film. But the rest will never come. Just weird. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
