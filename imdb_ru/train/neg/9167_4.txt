Leap Years is a film adapted from an e-novel by a Singaporean writer Catherine Lim, which was the first Singaporean novel / novel that was sold over the Internet. The film had a complicated post-production schedule: filmed in early 2005, it is scheduled to be released in late 2005, but eventually it will appear only after 3 years, February 29, 2008, a leap year. <br /> <Before I say anything, I must first admit that I am not a fan of the romantic genre, so I can be a bit biased against this film - I watched it simply because it was a Singapore production, and that available for borrowing at my local library. Here are my two cents in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the fact that, apart from KS Yu-Wu and Wong Li-Lin, all that has been noticed here seems to be Eurasians. The love interest is Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and the trio of Wong's buddies are, well, hey, Eurasians. This film perpetuates the stereotype that falling in love and communicating with Eurasians is more “c” than that of an ordinary Chinese (or whatever Asian race you are?). I don't know, it seems so. In addition, everyone in the film speaks with a kind of mystical "angular" accent, which is not found anywhere else, of course, not in Singapore. This is the type of "semi-perfect English" in which the authorities would like us to speak, but which is not found anywhere, say, on the MTV channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film sounds forced and unjustified, and not due to the absence of true-blue Singaporeans in the cast. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to be struggling to get stuck after some lines. single-stranded. Twenty minutes later, the film’s wit begins to turn pale, and the film begins to serve its usual plate of cliches. <br /> <br /> I guess I didn’t like the movie, because the whole premise of maintaining love for 16 long years seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other incredulities in the film. I can't believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-woo) fell in love with one of Wong's girlfriends. And the scene in which the groom says: “Go before I change my mind,” was used in one hundred East Asian TV shows (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, etc.) ... <br /> <br /> So 4 stars for this movie. The production value is fair, and Wong Li-Ling tries her best, but the script does not help her. Joan Chen has a 15-minute role in the film as the eldest Wong, and she may be the best actress in this film, but, hey, her role is just a cameo. <br /> <br /> If you come across “Leap Years” at the box office or library, you may want to insert it into a DVD player for curiosity, but otherwise, for people who do not quite like the genre of romance, you can decide whether to skip or not
