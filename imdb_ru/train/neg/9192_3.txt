I found this movie in the horror section of my video store. This seems to make sense, since most zombie films have their place there. From Romero's "Dead" trilogy to "28 days later." However, after seeing it, you can quickly see what kind of film it really is. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a music video that goes faster and gets more and more blood. There are no horror guys. Just a few decently placed militants who soon become tiresome because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you get the feeling that you accidentally missed a DVD player 3 minutes ago, but no, here how they actually made the movie. What a pity. I think that anyone could find a better use for $ 7 million in the film industry than to make this bundle. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, again, they were over-used and tedious, because every time it was the same trick, just with a different character. <br /> <br /> And what else ROYALLY annoying pasting shots from an arcade game. I played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it here? Oh, that's right, this is not a movie, but a music video, and at the same time it is bad. 3/10 <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence / bloodshed and profanity
