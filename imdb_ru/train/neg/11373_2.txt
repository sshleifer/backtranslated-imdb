This is not obvious from watching this film (therefore, I recommend viewers to explore people who represent their work in it), but this presentation about the realities of Islam and its promotion of violence and intolerance towards all non-Muslims lacks objectivity, as well as unable to take into account the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Quran says a lot about how a devout Muslim should interact with non-Muslims, but any realist can understand that not everyone who considers himself a follower of Islam will agree with and comply with all the principles of this faith and system. There is reason to question the speakers, so viewers need to watch the presentation with healthy skepticism; do not swallow it all, hook, line and sinker, without thinking about your own. <br /> <br /> For example, investigate the identity of Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who committed a terrorist act in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe in any of these statements. I am not and have never been a Muslim. I never read the Quran. I am not a Christian and am not a member of the _any_ faith. But I am a smart and insightful person. While the film is quite disturbing, in his view of how SOME Muslims see their commitments to Islam; I remind you that in Islam there is something more than the views of fundamentalists. Just as they are fundamentalist and evangelical Christians, there are also differences in the intensity of beliefs and obligations among Jews and Muslims. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you need the salt shaker turned on. arm. One grain will not be enough, you need more. Please use your own mind and think for yourself, study what is presented and appreciate the state of the world and how Islam fits into it, based on what is said in the 98 minutes video. Among those who collect this film, there is a common thread of political affiliation, which indicates a certain bias. Be your own brain.
