Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so I am happy to see any of their films. In fact, the man at the horns factory is the fourth who can break open, and rather soon Ollie split with all the sounds from the horn. He is resting at home with Stan next to him, needing silence, and the doctors (James Finlayson) call to say that he is coming to check on Ollie. After realizing that the plumber is entangled in electricity and electricity, the Doctor comes for a check-up and, after some tests, he recommends drinking goat's milk and getting some sea air in the ocean. After Stan finishes playing the trumpet by hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car accident, he and Ollie go to the dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat in the dock, trying to milk the goat, and Stan brought his pipe! Meanwhile, on the front page of the newspaper it is written that Killer Nick Granger - Escapeed Convict (Richard Kramer) ran away, and he sneaks into the boys' boat while they are sleeping and the goat is chewing the rope of the boat, leaving for the sea. In the morning they see their whereabouts, and Killer comes out, demanding something to eat, and notices how Stan and Ollie make fake foods, for example. Spaghetti string, cheese soap, bacon belt, meatball sponge, and he makes them eat. When Ollie begins to choke, Stan hits a pipe to help, and Ollie’s anger makes him kill the Killer, and he continues until the police arrive, so that Ollie’s anger will make them go to jail. There were the tiniest moments of comedy, but this is not a great black and white film. "Well, here's another pleasant mess that you got me into!" was number 60 for 100 years, 100 quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 for comedians comedians. Good!
