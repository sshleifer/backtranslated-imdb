I love Seth Green. His performances on the 70s show are always worth seeing, but last night I felt that the show needed to be reconsidered. Four lonely young guys inherited an apartment in New York, for which most of us would die. Grandma must have been the heiress to have such a place. Therefore, I felt that the need for realism should have been revealed. In any case, the story of how the four best friends got this apartment was implausible. I would be delighted if they had to move in with one of their parents, who would provide great humor and dysfunction about the organization of the show. This was not much humor. I just watch it, because it falls out before My name is Earl on Thursdayâ€™s victory evening. I think they should come back, abandon this series and start over. We need more family shows. How about Seth and his friends cross over with his stupid parents in the suburbs after the fire burned their place. They could have Dabney Coleman play the father, and Christine Estenruk the mother and the incapacitated brothers and sisters. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless, and the network blows it.
