Elizabeth Rum was the weakest actress of all ADA Law and Order, and her play here is even worse. Her attempts to focus on Texas amateur and unreal. She also cannot adequately evoke the strong emotions necessary to play with the mother of the kidnapped child; from time to time, when her daughter disappears, she manages to sound only vaguely irritated, as if she cannot remember where she left her keys. <br /> <br /> This is an important true story, so, unfortunately, the terrible actions of the main actress distract so much from the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they simply cannot overcome the tendency of Roma to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of the southern stretch when actual action is required.
