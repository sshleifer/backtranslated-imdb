Blimey! I remember so many horrible films that have been spinning around high school since the early 1980s. They usually had some kind of incredibly intense plot and a lot of 27-year-old actors pretending to be students. When I watched this movie, I felt a little nostalgic about growing up in the 1980s. However, then I find out that this film was shot in 1989? What! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, it's just bad. On the plot there is a city that is preparing to close high school and threatening to take all students to the city’s secondary schools. What is strange, the students of this school are rich and rich. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they can’t find money to support this school; they’ve never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here's a kicker. The school board says they will save school life if students can raise $ 200,000. So the elderly are doing this. Hmmm, you get 200,000 dollars, but instead of saving them for college, do you invest them in keeping high school where you are a senior? And why precisely they close overpopulated school until the end of the year? And ... oh, forget this film was stupid and made in 1989 !?
