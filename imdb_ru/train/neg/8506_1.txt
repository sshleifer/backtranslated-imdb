It may be the worst movie I've ever had. Incoherent will be a compliment. Even the end did not make sense, but it was a huge relief when it finally ended. I watched this with a kind of fatalistic fascination, to see if it could continue to deteriorate, and it happened. By the end of this mess, I wished that all the characters had survived, and I didnâ€™t feel too responsive to the actors. If you want to see a train wreck, I recommend hanging up at the train station. Even waiting on an abandoned railway platform beats this mess. Apparently, I did not ventilate enough to fill my prescribed ten lines, so at the risk of redundancy, I will say it again. This film is zero, and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. What about minus zero?
