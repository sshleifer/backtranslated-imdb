Now, it would be a bit of a clich√© if I started with the title part, so I'll wait with that. Firstly, this film made me wonder why children do stupid things, for example, wander around the laboratories and break bottles. Then I realized that this is a movie with a message, this message is for children, and there will be no such things. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insect monster, growing and causing chaos before dying in the typical "kill monster indirectly" manner. Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... there is neither Blue nor any Simian in it. Now it is a nozzle, as if I was deceived or something like that. The cover showed a giant bug / crab / idiot / thing in front, chasing a few screaming nurses. It happened, but I wanted monkeys! I had just enjoyed the MOST EXTREME PRIMATE a few nights before (half drunk from Cask and Creame cognac!), I was in the mood for more 80s style. Not so much. If you like snow monkeys or snowboarders, this film is not for you. If you like mistakes and good reasons to beat children, rent it.
