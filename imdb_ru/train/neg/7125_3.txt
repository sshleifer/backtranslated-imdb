VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a big disappointment! And although Sam Pekingpah had a hand in the script with Robert Town, he still leaves the role of the lead film, dryly filmed by the unknown Buzz Kulik. First, Yul Brynner with a top score, as Pancho Villa is not suitable for this part! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one note performance lacks the fire and pleasure that Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland may have led to the role. Brynner just looks like a Russian aristocrat, dressed like a Mexican gangster who is in the center of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. In addition, the second invoice Robert Mitchum is completely lost in the picture! His role as a biplane flying an ace, which bombed improvised bombs because of a revolution, is a poorly written meager role that any minor star could play. Mitch has no decent line in the entire film, and he recalls his picture of another Mexican revolution, which demonstrates the excellent “Bandido” (1956), which, unfortunately, no one seems to be interested in releasing on DVD. In addition to the lack of any style, "Villa Rides" also suffers without the presence of a female star! There is a young senior Mexican Grazia Buccella, who happily looks at Mitchum, but her casting is just careless. Someone like the Claudia Cardinal or Gene Peters could possibly add a couple of badly needed chipping to the intermittent storyline. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good action films in the film, but there are a couple of good action movies. not the film, not the most perfect image quality Panavision, and the overly repetitive theme of Maurice Jarre does not help. <br /> <br /> Like Paramount, there are no extras — not even a trailer! Yes, a disappointing presentation of movies and DVDs that could and should have been much better.
