VERY BAD FILM ........ and I mean VERY BAD ... The plot is predictable, and it is SO crappy, the creativity of the battle and the dance scenes of that time are the only reasons I did not give the film alone, except for this ... this is a film that you can not afford to watch ..... I feel that while watching a movie the idea of ​​the film was interesting, although a kind of cliché ... ... To bring the village bumps to the city, blah blah -bla, but I feel that maybe it would be at least a little better if it were not so stupid, very poorly portrayed so the idea to the screen, I think. The plot is somewhat predictable at times, although the dance that I can say to TIME is pretty good, the turn of the break dance battle was good ..... IF you just watch a movie, look at the dance scenes and create your own dialogue, maybe it can be 5 ... lol
