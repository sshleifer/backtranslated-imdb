As the director of the Altman experience, we could expect us to want to spend time or take care of what happens to the lead character, neurotic, whiner, idiot without redeeming qualities - this is the main mystery of this deeply tangled piece of work. A monstrous piece of garbage. In addition to this serious flaw, the storyline requires serious concentration to follow. The scenario, which includes the character Bran, is so obvious from the very beginning that we tend to wonder whether the author and the director completely lost respect for their audience. This last question lies at the heart of the film: it presents directorial pampering with deep contempt for the taste, values ​​and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
