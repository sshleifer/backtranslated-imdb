This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad that it seemed ridiculous. First, there is no plot. Actors seem to read cue cards and do the most stupid things. For example, pursued by dead people, but still wishing to go out and look for their friends. In addition, the zombies were terrible, far from as fun as any of Romero's work, which receives support in the film. And the stupidest part was that they kept showing video game flashes in action sequences. It’s as if we don’t understand what a zombie shooting video game is. Also, all 20 are able to use automatic weapons and hit a target, even without aiming the weapon. And the way people die is so stupid. As if they ran out of ammunition, so stand waiting for them to jump. And when they are cornered in front of the house, they run out of ammunition instead of firing at the door, so stupid. <br /> <br /> CONCLUDING TESTIMONY: If one of these actors appears in another film, he was blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen in recent years. Bee-film on cinemax is better.
