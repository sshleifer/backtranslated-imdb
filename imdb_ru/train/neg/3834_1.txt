I watched this movie, really liked the girl Gregory many years ago. It was nonsense. The plot was vaguely unpleasant when the teacher and his friend killed more than 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. Previous commentators seem to think that it doesn't matter, but I found it pretty nasty. If you have children at school, the last thing you want is to think that every junior teacher is hungry for his students. We were surprised that the censor missed it. In addition, the film was just a waste of time. The script was bad, and John Gordon Sinclair tried his best to recreate his schoolboy image, slightly stupid and off the wall. Why someone would like to crave it in this performance is incredible. This film has failed in all respects for me. Nightmarish. Please do not waste your time browsing. Life is too short
