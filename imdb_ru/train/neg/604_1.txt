I was so disgusted by this film that I felt obligated to warn others. This movie has no story, plot, or hint of a target. The film begins after the standard introduction to the film “Let's be scary”, to which every viewer has become accustomed to now. Thus, we can completely ignore the beginning. Soon we get to know the main actress, and from that moment it becomes clear to everyone that you just wasted your hard-earned money and you had better look static. (If you have not seen white noise - EEK) Acting is a shame, and they all must return to the pantomime of the journey from where they came from. Having said that, even the best actors in the world will go all out to try to get this movie to watch remotely. Their poor performance simply contributes to disaster. Senseless violence and what I can only assume is that the written word of another crazy "eccentric" writer who probably considers himself an artist has led to a film that will test your patience. Only when my fellow observer turned to me and said: “We watched it for 45 minutes,” I realized that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Obviously, something was missing, and, unfortunately, it was not the public. Instead of offering what is missing in the film, let me tell you what it is: “Stupid blonde” (surprise-surprise), “Victims”, “bad monster guy”, about 2 minutes of storyline, which stretches for hours, days, weeks, months. ... and loans. <br /> <br /> Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde looks a little bold in some scenes, but expects that she wants to see how her face will be ripped off before the end of the movie!
