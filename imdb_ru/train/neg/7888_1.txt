knew nothing about the film or that it was based on the bestseller. I tried to guess from the opening scenes, what he would be about, the best guess, to bury the treasure and the death list. It lasted about 15 minutes, when I got a vile suspicion that the film was crap. I will not bore you with how bad the plot and the acting were, but anyone who gave him more than two stars should work for the filmmakers. He was wearing a suit, shirt and tie. He arrived at the hospital in jeans and a shirt. I have a Christian theme, it's hard to miss it.
