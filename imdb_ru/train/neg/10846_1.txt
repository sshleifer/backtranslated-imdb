Not after Caligula, I decided to turn off the movie halfway ... but with this, I had only 15 minutes when I was mulling over. Sorry, I went through it all. Make sure you do not. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s not that Cradle of Fear is shocking, bloody, intimidating, intimidating or sexy. The fact is that this is not one of these things, but she desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it is boring, banal, ordinary, predictable and unusually poorly executed (filmed, special effects in high school, the lack of meaning even basic visual narration, the dialogues are barely audible ... although it is not worth hearing). /> <br /> This film is proof that even a live video distributor needs to draw a line somewhere on the sand.
