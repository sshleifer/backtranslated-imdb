I don’t think I’ve ever been so shocked by the sheer absurdity of a film in my whole life, the way it was when I got out of this shit. ANYTHING in this makes no sense. None of this is clever or well thought out. because of the lack of truly disturbing moments, they constantly use that complete trick when you create music, before a character does something like opening a door or moving a curtain away, and then nothing appears. it's ok to do it once, maybe, but I counted it three times. there are things added for no apparent reason, characters, half-formed storylines ... the characters were not well developed in ALL. the ending was .. bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component of this film is terrible. and I'm here to warn you about all this.
