Strange people living in the city live their own lives. There is a guy who licks everything, a scavenger diver who finds the body he takes home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll, dressed like her, a guy who wants to clean the girls from their evil ways ... strange in the extreme case, this shot in black and white film is better without color. Monochrome removes two steps from the feeling of home cinema. Like the movie "Troma", this movie is funny in hits and starts, but basically it’s strange for weirdness, and it soon becomes a terrible bore, because when you see the settings, you can guess where a lot of time is going — not always — but enough that it was not funny. (Although I did not see the approach of cleansing). Worth a try if you have nothing else to look at and you're waiting for the next set of Golden Girls from Netflix.
