If you have seen friends, the letter will seem very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of “Friends” often use the same comedies. <br /> <br /> The show tells about a group of people whose connection is that they were in the same class when they were still young (about 10 people). years I think). Now they are over twenty, and they meet again in a reunion lesson. This is where the series begins. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with multiple storylines simultaneously. They are usually unrelated. Each storyline is divided into several sections, which are then displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> My sketches are related to these series. As in the later seasons of Friends, this is often a rather stupid setting that is hard to believe. One of the main characters is doing something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation then is greatly exaggerated, as if it was not foolish enough. If you like this humor, then perhaps you will like this series. For me, this is a great trip. <br /> <br /> I started watching “Friends” because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially trustworthy storylines, with some romance that makes you cheer on the characters. The class has none of this. The characters are simply too forced, and the stereotypes are too far apart. Therefore, it is impossible to treat them and love them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, several seasons passed before he exhausted himself, and all character traits were completely eliminated. But in The Class it seems that he was exhausted even before he started.
