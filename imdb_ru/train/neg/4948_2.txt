I have always been in awe of historical dramas, an art form in which the BBC has succeeded in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was incredible. Incredibly bad! The script was terrible, the acting boring and all the characters terribly tasteless. Obviously, Byron was "insanely bad and dangerous to know," and made the ladies' hearts tremble. Not in this production. Here he appeared in the form of a tasteless, squandery squirt instead of the fiery hero of women and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron was limping. This image of a man was just limp. <br /> <br /> I watched for two and a half hours waiting for something to flare up in life. Neither spray nor glimpse. It was a complete boredom, if not a direct boredom, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Having the opinion that no one would be better than Bard Avon, I also think that Byronâ€™s poetry is too esteemed and my mind should be thrown into the background, and this dramatization of his life should be given the same attitude . <br /> <br /> I think the BBC has lost its meaning with this
