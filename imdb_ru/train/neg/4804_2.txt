I don't watch TV very much and stumbled upon this show. Reality show? I really hope this is not real. If I were a man, would have such a nagging and would be married to someone so snotty, it would be a reason for divorce. I think it shows a bad example of how a person should relate to the person he loves. This is one thing that is not so with our world right now, so many people are in bad relationships, are selfish and do not know what it means to truly love another. It is a self-sacrifice, not something that should be for the good. It does not give a very good feeling to see what should be in a private consultation. If his personality in the show is real, then he deserves someone much better who would show true true love, care for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this show a reality or is it filled with ratings ???? I really would like to know. Sincerely, GB
