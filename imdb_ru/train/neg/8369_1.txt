Since this picture is classified as “purely entertaining” work, and since there are already many comments on it, I would like to turn to something related to the abuse of humor. We see Marlon Wayans playing the role of a joker in this film. Of course, as long as he was involved in casting, he always acted like a little man - an actor can change his usual clothes, but he can hardly change his appearance - and the latter can be an advantage if necessary. However, far from what I expected, I saw an image, very disguised, pretending to expose various aspects of a child’s life by mistake of a forty-year-old criminal. And with a funny happy ending. So what's the point? Many elements are confused, some of the main ones are violence, sex and criminal activity, among which the story is poorly composed and to some extent lacks common sense: where is Vanessa when the calmness of her home is disturbed and the life of her husband is persecuted? In addition, the diamond is even larger than in the world No. 1 Cullinan! But the most disgusting aspect is the constant attempt to make the little man a superman, revealing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material, but can only be defeated by the hot blood of a male goat. Consequently, this is not a diamond, but fragments.
