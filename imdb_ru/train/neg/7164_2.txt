This film is more deceptive than ever, with the help of an actor with a tense appearance, such as Walken, who played in this piece of garbage, it seemed that he had nothing to do but to play a boring role like this! And the fact that the film was supposed to tell about some kind of witch, and you really don’t see it almost until the end of the film, but at the same time you have to sit and watch this boring film while it is going or trying to understand the meaning and you must It’s boring actors and actresses who thought all the time about how you acted in another film and decided about it, and how you just spent your money, is simply useless to sit there the whole time. I would prefer to watch cartoons for God's sake. Leave it, please!
