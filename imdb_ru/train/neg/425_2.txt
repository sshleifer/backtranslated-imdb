I can’t believe that I got so angry after seeing this, that I’m going to write my first IMDb review. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is nothing more than the rewritten literature of Planet Earth. I now knew that it was advertised as “from the people who brought you Planet Earth,” but I had no idea that they would explicitly use the same abbreviations as the innovative documentary mini-series. I just paid $ 8.75 to see what I already have on DVD. Shame on Disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here (except for the voice of James Earl Jones and 90 seconds of the sailboat, which I do not believe was on Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime is that, although Planet Earth uses the tragic story of a polar bear as proof that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for environmental change, Disney took this story and turned it into a family cheating After the death of the male polar bear, they show that its young have grown significantly a year later, and spew some rubbish about how they are ready to preserve its memory, and that the earth is really a great place in the end. No mention of the fact that adult cubs are expecting death due to the same difficult situation that their father experienced, no warning of problems for future generations, if we do not act together, nothing. Just montage of the material that we have already seen throughout the film (and many times more if you are one of the billion people who have already seen Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> I have never left the theater, feeling so ashamed and changed in my life.
