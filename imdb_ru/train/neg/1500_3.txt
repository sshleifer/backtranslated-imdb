Oh, this is so bad, this is ridiculous. The only way one could explain, something like this is a porn party with drugs, which led to a resolution to make a movie just for fun. I mean: you can see porn actresses topless, sex, then a man killed by mutants. There is a lot of blood here, including the classic “there’s something wrong with it, oh no, that's half of what it used to be” and the occasional murder caused by panic. But you can also find funny things, such as intestines stretched through someone's ass, and a guy running through the woods and finding himself with headless wire tied between two trees (which later makes a metallic noise, like in cartoons). Somehow there is a market for people who go beyond pornography, they really need to know that inside the actress, just genitals are not enough. Therefore, you can see a lot of brief autopsies on dead stockings. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have very small roles, and I really wonder what Richard Greco wanted when taking the role here. I think this is a movie that needs to be watched with a fast-forward button and you’ll only watch juicy things to remind you about old-school C-class horror movies.
