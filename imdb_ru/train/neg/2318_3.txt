The kid, who was found in his childhood in a garbage dump and brought up at the martial arts academy, can drown in baskets. With the help of the person who found him, he goes to college and moves to the championship because he is looking for his real parents. Infinitely better in the comedy action movie - a real mess in general. It seems that he aspires to the hipper basketball version of Shaolin Football, but comedy is a point hit, its focus is greater than Chihuahua with ADD on quadruple espresso. I kept asking "What am I looking at." I watched it from start to finish, and I still donâ€™t know what the hell happened. It's a shame because there are some great scenes, some funny jokes and random moments, but nothing, none of this will ever come together, I would take a pass.
