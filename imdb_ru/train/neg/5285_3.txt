Somewhere on this site, someone wrote that in order to get the best version of the works of Jane Austen, you just need to read them. I agree with that. Nevertheless, we love the adaptation of great literature, and the present strike of the authors reminds us that without good authors it is difficult for actors to put their roles into practice. The current version of PERSUASION, Jane Austen, shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare with the 1995 version with Amanda Ruth and Ciaran Hinds, who acted well and preserved the essence of the era and the restrictions on the characters (except for the strange parade and kisses on the street scene in Bath), the 2007 version depicts a quirky Ann passionate. Other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austin could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel, was completely scattered, and Mrs. Smith, bedridden and impoverished Anna's classmate, walks in Bata, writes on Twitter, as many of the characters seemed to do. Captain Wentworth's character strength and intellect, which caused Ann’s love in the first place for him, did not seem to fit into Wentworth Rupert Penry-Jones. Kiaran Hinds possessed more substance and was able to express much more than Pee-jay with his postures. Overall, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel into a hard time, a costumed melodrama of debatable value. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional excesses to Austin's work, they had to do what they do with Shakespeare's adaptations: adapt it to the present. At the very least, “The Bride and Prejudice” were excluded from historical and local conditions, and it was interesting to see how “Clueless” was. It is not a PERSON, but they did not know what else to call it.
