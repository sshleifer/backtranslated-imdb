I doubt that Jigsaw was fashionable even at that time, the whole subject of LSD was that the mystery of the murder was a clearly obvious attempt to capture the young audience of that era, although it did not show a real understanding of the sixties counterculture. In addition to the outdated aspect, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including overwork, stupid and unnatural dialogues, memories of LSD that go on indefinitely, even after the point has been crammed home in the first 60 seconds, inability to create any real anxiety, even if the real plot on paper is a great way to do this, and the ending is so banal and predictable (not to mention reminding of many bad television shows) that the culmination is in fact anti-climax. If it were a better film, we could stop disbelief in some things that would help to get pleasure, but weaknesses are so obvious that they serve only to emphasize the improbability that viewers might have overlooked. I saw Jigsaw on TV, and this is definitely a late night TV board, designed to fill the airspace and spend time to kill someone's insomnia, and not something that someone should actively look for. At best, three out of 10.
