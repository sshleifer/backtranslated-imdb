This film is a little more than a poorly made fetish porn, and that says a lot, considering the kind of shit that was made in that era. This was recommended by my friend as a “unique film experience.” He was right. I mean, he meant it as a joke. Not nasty, not even shocking. Just a mediocre game and unsuccessful attempts to shock art. A little about the value of the camp, although I do not believe that the creators of this film intended it. And yes, as the previous reviewer mentioned, this is sex with a guy in a bear costume. Do not spend a lot of money on it. Try borrowing it if you have to see it. Or contact me and I will gladly sell you my copy at half price. <br /> <br /> I may have to watch another movie of this director, as he seems to have some fans. But if this is something like that, I will regret again that another 2 hours of my life are gone forever.
