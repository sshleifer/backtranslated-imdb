Well, to answer the question of one person, "why no one remembers this film?" that's because not many people actually saw it in 1978, and since then it has not been shown on television. (If it was on video, it would be news to me!) Even in the era of the sometimes senseless comedies that was in the 70s, moviegoers had the sense to avoid this movie. Unless they love Billy Crete, Paula Linda or Joan Rivers "like that"! <br /> <br /> Paul Lind was funnier on "Conjured" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers at the time in his career laughed at the cruel jokes about the lack of weight of the singer Karen Carpenter! Har Har Joan! It also seems that every “somewhat” known name from that era is in a cast. (The most surprising thing is Doris Roberts, later from “Everybody Loves Raymond.”) <br /> <br /> In any case, a good idea for the plot: a man who is pregnant and not a woman loses strength here. With the help of a male friend, Crystal tunes in with a prostitute to finally lose his virginity, but because she was "on top" in his stead, he got pregnant! (Comment on the fact that women occupy a strong position in men). <br /> <br /> Crystal grows belly, he experiences all feminine emotions and feelings associated with them. Unfortunately, he is now socially misunderstood outcast! He was attacked by a crowd that wants to be erased (I guess). <br /> <br /> He is forced into solitude to have his child ... in the barn. Or, if you wish, a creche (God only knows where this could have come from! Ewwww!) It turns out (not shocking) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else in this film is useless and forgotten, humor at the secondary school level or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and some good touching and relevant moments with Billy Crystal. Do not pay attention to the rest of the test Rabitta, he fails! <br /> <br /> I can't believe Roddy McDowell signed too! (END)
