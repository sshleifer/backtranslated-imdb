Since “Rugrats” fall from the category of good and funny cartoon series into mediocre and, indeed, absolutely terrible tariffs for two-year-old children over the past three or four years, it is obvious that tyrants in Klaski Chupo should not have ideas. After thinking over all the characters, adding even more stupid new ones, replacing some voices (although I like Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chuckie Finster!), And I have no sense of continuity (for example: in the episode with Kimi, I watched others today with Tommy and Chucky appears new puppy, but in the next episode, the above-mentioned dogs never appear), you might think that the creators can kill the show for the mercy. But nooooo. <br /> <br /> All that I will say about this particular one is that it sucks! Although it’s not as bad as Kimi’s episodes, everything is even more stupid than them, including Grandpa (My God! He used to be the best character in the series, but now he doesn’t have a real goal). The end is unduly fluffy, and the only thing that is different from this and other crappy new episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can interact with adults. Wow, how fun! <br /> <br /> There are no stars for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klaski-Csupo, please DESTROY this show until it gets worse.
