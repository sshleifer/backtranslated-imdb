I think that's almost all I need to say. I feel obligated to explain my actions, though. In principle, I have never seen such a production of valves, and I mean this in every sense of the word. Although he works with the camera, working with a microphone and other technical aspects of this film are ridiculous, unfortunately, these are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic independent films that have been preserved in their scripts with excellent character and plot, this unfortunately has a terrible scenario, a terrible game and, worst of all, terrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> The crime is that for every independent film that is distributed, for example, “Haiku Tunnel”, there are 101 other indie films that have died by silent death. I do not know who the Kornblut brothers know at Sony, but this may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production has spread. I am completely confused as to why they brought it up. <br /> <br /> The ONLY part of this film that stands up to any intrigue is its title. However, the reason for this is even disappointment. I hope this review will save a few people who might be intrigued by this movie title to watch it. I saw a lot of movies in my time, and I really forgive when in the movies, but that was too much. I will never forget the “tunnel” because he marked an important moment in my life in the cinema. Shame, this is such a low point.
