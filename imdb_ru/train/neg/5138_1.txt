I watched the VIEW because of the surrounding noise. Well, I can not imagine that someone would like this film, because it is just bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the one who made this film knows nothing about horror. The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres: an action movie (weapons and criminals) and horrors (live stuffed animals). When criminals are killed one by one by scary looking scarecrows, the two genres automatically destroy each other, because, firstly, they are criminals and who care about criminals, and, secondly, because they are stupid criminals! Having a stuffed zombie behind them just doesn't work here. Where is the horror in this? I wanted the criminals to die a horrible, painful death. <br /> <br /> But the story is so poorly designed that this marriage of genres, which could have been original, if it had done well, would NEVER become gels. We just stayed with a handful of superdense criminals and a handful of scarecrows that are "alive" for some fragile reason, invented by the creators of the film. Worse, the fact that cinema is terrible (like television), and, even worse, whole conversations of dialogue are about CB, and we constantly hear meaningless dialogue being told from disabled images, as if we were watching some kind of radio show. . This part was really BAD. The director should have been shot on the spot for having come up with such a stupid idea! I can't tell you how annoying it is. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, the criminals in TRAVEL are surprisingly stupid. For example, when someone suddenly appears, gutted and filled with money and straw (yes, straw) in his huge open wound, others ask: “What drug is it on?” After tons of bullets are shot at him, he cannot kill (his "zombie" stuffed. Do not ask ...). Get the damn key morons. I have never seen such stupid people in a movie. And there is a girlfriend. I wish one of the stuffed animals killed her quickly, because she was a pain in the ass. When she finds her father nailed to the "cross" of a scarecrow, she actually accuses the criminals of the embarrassing scene (bad behavior), although the criminals could not do it. What nonsense she was! But scarecrow is the biggest weakness in this very weak click. They are not scary. Nothing special about them is explained. This is just a plot device in this film, filled with a plot device. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley, continuously removing the stuffed face for 30 seconds, causes nothing but obvious boredom. And that scene with a talking head in the fridge. Thanks for the laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, this was supposed to be one of the worst films I have seen recently (and I have seen many films these days!) Between equally sad SILO Killer or foot soldiers, I would prefer to watch again SILO KILLER. Yes, TRAVELING is so bad.
