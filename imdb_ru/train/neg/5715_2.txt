“Say Yes” is one of those films for which you continue to hope that you will recover, but this will not happen. This is a kind of “pointless psychopath who decides to threaten an innocent couple,” so beloved by direct video directors. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is clumsy and poorly translated. Acting skills are equally bad, especially from the villain of the play, played by Jung-hoon Park. He seems to think that, without blinking and not trying to speak in a deep voice, he makes his character seem threatening, when everything he really does makes him seem a bit simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves a special mention. After all, this is idiocy beyond conviction. “Heroes” do not consider it strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The “heroine” twice fails to see the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. The villain passes through a police checkpoint (dressed in a shirt drenched in blood and a bloody headband), showing the policeman a burned corpse in the passenger seat of the car he drives. The villain is beaten with a fist, beaten with a shovel and thrust a pitchfork into it, but it seems that he is not hampered by these rather serious injuries. And don't even lead me to this terrible end. Shish. <br /> <br /> The only plus for me in this film is Sang Chu. Which is very cute, but in fact nothing more than a mediocre actress. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film comes off as a poorly written, sluggishly played and shockingly directed attempt to copy The Hitcher and Spoorloos, but it fails at every turn due to the lack of talent of all involved.
