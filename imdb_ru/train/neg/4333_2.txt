Quote: theurgist: Anyone with I.Q. more than 50 years would have seen this film as it is, a clever, well-played prequel to the modern classics, yes, it does not have a blockbuster throw or a huge budget, BUT it is still very well made and I was hooked on all the time. <br /> <br /> IQ for 50 you say .. what most means that you have I.Q. below 50 .. his name is KARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! it means that he should have something to do first .. <br /> <br /> everything and everyone is a good movie if .. YOU CHANGE THE NAME, AND NO CHARACTERISTICS ARE NAME. /> Ps do not comment on the film if you do not know anything about the movies. but I think I.Q. until 50, you don't know what the hell I'm screaming about ... <br /> <br /> peace!
