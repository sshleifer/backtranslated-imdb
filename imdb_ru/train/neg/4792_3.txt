Ghost .... Class. Ghost II ..... cool. Phantasm III ..... um ... terrible. <br /> <br /> Even if I wanted to support this film, I just can't. The film seems to be "sold out." The first bad signs appear when the video has trailers for other films in the beginning (something that others did not have). In addition, too many meaningless characters, vivid examples of a child (who at first glance is funny, but first you want him to die), a woman who uses karate to beat off balls (um does not work, or rather should not) and blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there is no connection with them in other Phatasms). In addition, around not enough running dwarfs. <br /> <br /> The only good moments are the start of hacking and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (A SPOILER may appear) <br /> For me, this film seems like filler between II and IV, since the additional characters just leave at the end, so you can continue with the main 4 in IV. <br /> <br /> On the whole, very, VERY disappointing. 3/10
