This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This says a lot, given some of the choices I made at the movies. <br /> <br /> I got it on netflix, based solely on the fact that the one with whom I was in high school is topless in it. The topless scene lasted only about 5 seconds, and the rest of the film was about as funny as pounding panjie sticks under my fingernails when they were forced to listen to Roseanna singing Big Spender. <br /> <br /> "Parody" "is stupid and consists of the worst kind of humorous humor in the bathroom and jokes in the locker room, and this is so blatant (and bad) plagiarism of the" Kentucky Fried "film that you will ask Big Jim Slade Break through Protect us from the stupidity of "Vince's proposal" (whoever it is). <br /> <br /> If you're not a masochist, avoid this pile of garbage.
