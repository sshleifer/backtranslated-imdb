Where to start, in this film there are so many bad and terrible things that I don’t know where to start. Well, the two puppets who wrote this shit. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton at first could not decide on the so-called names. I believe that they share the difference, so the main headline is “The brain that will not die”, but on the last screen it is written “The head that will not die” No one knows anything about the medical profession. After all, doctors take an oath "do no harm." Killing a woman for a head transplant will be considered "harm." Plus a little thing called blood and tissue. Failure would mean death for Jan in the pan. Plus who keeps the patch at work, monster. What medical school did Bill graduate from, FRANKENSHEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST MAD? The monster didn't have a name that fucking annoys me. In addition, the brilliant surgeon Dr. Bill Kortner does not know how to keep the patient in a state of sedation? The film’s total disaster is incredibly stupid and invisible, except on MST3K. I give it THANK YOU TURKEY.
