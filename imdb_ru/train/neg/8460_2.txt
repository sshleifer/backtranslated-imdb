I made this film only thanks to the promises of William Defoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that after seeing the name of R.R. on the cover (as an actor), this film will be good. Sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would do, so if he is going to give him his name, then it should be good, right? WRONG WRONG. By far the worst editing since Manos' Hand of Rock. The way it was edited did not make sense and made the film impossible to watch, and after the first 30 minutes you donâ€™t even want to watch it anymore. I have no idea how Defoe and Rodriguez got involved in this film, maybe they owed it to someone, but they are a good way to do it. In addition, they were in this film just a couple of minutes, and Rodriguez did not even speak. So, if you want to watch a movie with a bad installation, a bad game and a confusing storyline, be my guest, but do not say that you were not warned.
