As I and my other half are big fans of horror of horror, we could not help but release a film that contained both great people who we were excited about! However, for the 2004 film with a breakdown on the cover of "Freddy vs. Jason" is a shame! Worst movie I've ever seen, but it’s good to laugh at him if you can sit with him! <br /> <br /> The game is terrible, the effect ... well, in fact, I could improve my camcorder so badly that they only bothered to put makeup on the faces of the zombies and lowered neck, hands, etc. No storyline, weird memories that make no sense, and a horrible script! <br /> <br /> “You broke my tooth! "from one vampire" you broke my cigar "was the answer from a man who looked like Uncle Jessie from a duke crossed with Santa!
