RATING STARS: ***** Works **** simply do not hit the target *** This is a bit between ** Pitfalls * Pitches <br /> <br /> In this debut effort for a loved one, Nick Park and the dog, they forced to fly to the moon when good old Wallace runs out of cheese. <br /> <br /> In addition to the shortest function in just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the earliest and itâ€™s like a show. The plasticine animation here is a bit creaky and funny, reminiscent of Mork's animation about the little man in the box. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that mastery is behind this, I have never been keen on Wallace & Gromit (maybe too pure and traditional for someone from my generation). The only thing I really liked was The Wrong Trousers (and this was more from the time when I was younger and less aware of, let's say, the dark joys of life.) I was forced to actively seek out this early effort because of the resurgence of popularity in the result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation. <br /> <br /> As technically impressive as the first two (all given the circumstances!), this lacks the emotional angle that his successors should have. However, it is quite fun as a first try, and certainly sets the standard for more important things. Two stars, but good two stars. **
