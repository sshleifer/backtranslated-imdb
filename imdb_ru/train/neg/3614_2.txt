The schizophrenic escaped from a psychiatric hospital in New York, and soon teachers begin to be offended at the University of the Holy Trinity. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) must deal with the mess of red herrings. Despite the 78-minute run time, this cheap slasher stretches and continues until it turns out that an unfortunate finish, where the person you suspect is a murderer from the very beginning, will not be such. Director Richard Haynes struggles with some sort of “lame stalk-n-slash” performance, but gives out the cry that the public of the early 80s longed for. For all of our amateur anthropologists, this was filmed in New York in the early 80s so that you could check out all the culture, beliefs and customs of living people from this far place. The film received recognition for having starred in "Final Girl". You rarely see it. It is also always a pleasure to watch a horror movie, where the priest is the killer. Don't you trust the clergy, my favorite film industry? Fortunately, this is just a fake priest, and he will be caught. However, he is still working on the moral point of view.
