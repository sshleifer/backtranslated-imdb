Well, I have to admit that it was one of my favorites as a child when I watched it on my home projector as a super-8 movie. Now, not so much to recommend it, except for the inherent value of the camp actors, "frightened" copies of human skulls. Special effects are pretty stupid, mostly they consist of skulls on wires and superimposed "ghostly" images. <br /> <br /> But there is something that can be said about sets. The large mansion in which it is located is rather creepy, especially because it is mostly unfurnished (probably for budgetary reasons?). <br /> <br /> However, he definitely causes more laughter than screams. Just try not to giggle when the wife (who does more than her share of the cry) goes into the greenhouse and faces the ghost of her ex-husband.
