Listen, I won't lie to you, but I got this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend, because it was Danny Filt, the lead singer of the ever-popular death metal band "Cradle Of Filth". Of course, I expected violence and bloodshed in all its glory, because that is exactly how Mr. Filt can be depicted among the storyline. <br /> <br /> But oh my god, I was so wrong. This film seriously bites, great time. Being a low-budget film (haha, wait, make this zero budget), it clearly lacks the beautiful musical scores of the Howard Stern Orchestra and the special effects of Spielberg. No, it's all one camera, bad camera angles and bad bloody scenes. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, when our star and the cruel villain, Mr. Filt, forcibly kills a robber. Enough for the throat, and the blood spits out, but, oh my God, it seems that in the shirt of a man there is a package of juice, filled with fake blood. <br /> <br /> To you, fans of Cradle Of Filth: you will hear two songs throughout the entire film, but with a camera angle and poor-quality shooting, they pull the overall pleasure from the song DOWN. <br /> <br /> My last comment: stay away from that. This is blood, blood, chest, and hey, even a crappy story. So if you like horrific violence, almost no voice (yes, there are almost no words in this film), then by all means buy it. But if bad movies are not your thing, then avoid it. Do not waste your money.
