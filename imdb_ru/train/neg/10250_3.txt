A boring, cheap sci-fi thriller, made almost without conviction (in the control room, full of computers and other devices used to receive and decrypt messages from space, only ONE MAN works, and VERY poorly guarded at night) and full of hiking sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but also gives one of his few performances “I'm here for money.” (* 1/2)
