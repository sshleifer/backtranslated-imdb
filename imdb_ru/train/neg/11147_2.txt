I have nothing to comment on this film. It's so bad that I had to post my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting, instead of watching this “movie” ... even looking at the walls better. <br /> <br /> And since I need to write at least 10 lines of text, I tell you that this is also a budget film, bad behavior, nameless actors, a stupid fool, like a wolf, and so on ... Also in history There is nothing new, special effects are made in the style of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The film is almost as bad as the film Megalodon. <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (don't watch this movie)
