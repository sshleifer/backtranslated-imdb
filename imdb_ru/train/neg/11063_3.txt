I have the courage to tell you, please stay away from Dahmer, a biopic based on the true story of a grotesque serial killer. "Dahmer" more deviates from the mentality of its subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed over 15 young men and ate some parts of his body, was probably the most inappropriate serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick people are the creators of this terrible spectacle who had to inspect their heads before deciding to create a new horrible project "dahm". This film is not easy to digest, although Jeffrey would easily digest it with the help of some mozgiltilian fire appetizers or even real life. Potato peel '. * Failure
