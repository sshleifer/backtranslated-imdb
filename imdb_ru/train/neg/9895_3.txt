If this book remained true to the book, then we can only assume that the author did not know the story. Marc Anthony never died from injuries sustained in battle, as pictured. He died the death of a coward, committing suicide, and even then he asked his slave to do it for him. Instead, the slave decided to commit suicide. In the real story, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the great prowess of a slave and decided to copy it. But even in death, Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed in his own suicide attempt. He shouted for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding profusely. She pulled his rubbish on the ropes, and Marc Anthony died some time later. If you want stories, do not watch this movie. If you want a romantic fool, then you probably will like it!
