When converting a book into a film, as a rule, it is better to save at least some of the tones or concepts conveyed by the author, and not to ignore the author as a whole. Although it is obvious that the director had access and followed the advice of the children of Elinor Stewart, it is important to note that the children believed that their mother was a complete liar for a good, enriching, reinforcing experience in owning her land. The book details her life a husband on the vast border of Wyoming; she chronicles the daily adventures with her many friends and acquaintances, although they lived a few dozen miles from each other. The film, however, takes a standard position at the time when it was made, portraying the experience of this woman as harsh, implacable and almost meaningless. The director may have shared with him his impressions of the Vietnam War (as some movie lovers said), but this seems like a lousy excuse to take all the joy and beauty of the book and turn it into a dark disgusting landscape, devoid of friends or hope. Do not waste your time on this film; read the book instead.
