It was John Pertwee who said: “Being funny is very difficult, but silly is easy.” Well, if this is so, then PASTY FACES is "very simple." David Baker (as a director / screenwriter) and his actors seem to be under the impression that comedy involves the theft of scenes and style from excellent britomcoms such as LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING using a completely undeveloped script and jumping up down, speaking very quickly the voice is very loud. Alan McCaffrey suffers especially from this type of OTT performance, but it is not enough to spoil the film, because there is not enough film to spoil it. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially in the script. I could not understand why it ended the way it happened, it just seemed that he stopped very abruptly and stupidly. Oh, and other glaring mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the United States and a green card to work there. This film will make you believe that you can leave the plane and start a new life in America without any permission - that you still pay me for donating blood in America - people I know in America and who donate blood, tell me that the donation payment stopped a few years ago, and that you can buy any weapons from a gun shop. As far as I know, gun laws in America are different from state to state, but no gun shop sells anti-tank weapons without a prescription. Thus, we got a very wrong idea about America from a very unreal and oh, such a funny movie. Maybe this revenge for BRAVEHEART is a very Hollywood look at the Scots? Probably, but it does not stop PASTY FACES from comedy shit
