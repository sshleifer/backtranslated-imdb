It gets really bad. The only quality of the ransom halfway is the effects of the thousands of bullets used during the film. Everywhere there is a context error. The game is terrible, except for Kirk. The story is as leaky as the Grail, and the belief that the film is a video game by itself, simply kills the film if it was not already a corpse. So as a whole it is a waste of your life. I would give it a zero if it were an option on the rating scale.
