I don't often try to write comments, but for this I just needed to warn anyone who might think that, having seen this, they would see a comedy. This is not close. While the premise (change of color / sex / whatever) is bad enough (and done better many times before), the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever appeared on the screen. It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script were a replacement for white chickens. However, vayan brothers are required to disguise as two specific white women. As you may have guessed, they fail completely. I have seen how transvestites without makeup make women more convincing than these two with the best special effects and make-up artists that Hollywood can provide. It's horrible. Add to this a mix of a basketball player, built as a building, a terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course, and this film has reached a new personal minimum. And I like bad movies! Avoid the plague.
