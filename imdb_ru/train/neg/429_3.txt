I was attracted to watching this movie by its star power, but in the end itâ€™s all he gives. It's more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about corruption in a big city. Its greatest flaw is its predictability and complete lack of expectation. We know who the bad guys are from the very beginning, and just follow them, falling like dominoes. The film on his account really refrains from unwarranted violence and sex, but forgot to replace a good, pure novel or excitement in any other way. Everything tastes like a good, caffeine-free, cola diet. Q & A, which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative, like LA Confidential.
