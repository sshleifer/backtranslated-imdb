There are bad films, then there are films that are so bad that they almost become art. This is one of those movies. You know, my partner and I are still in shock, looking into space and drooling! You can say that the people involved (I hope they changed their names to protect themselves) were experiencing an explosion, and they were definitely not shy. I give it one of three out of ten only because of causeless smut and REALLY bad blood effects. I laughed out loud during most of the film, so I think we can say that he showed me a good time. Beware, the viewer, the above words in no way interpret that this is a good film, because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to give up a movie with such a BIG title!
