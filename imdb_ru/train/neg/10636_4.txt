I was really looking forward to this show, considering the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes were not justified! Again, we are inclined to believe that the KGB is a group of inept idiots who have no idea what they are doing. At some point there is a ridiculous scene in which 4 KGB agents cannot cope with one CIA agent. I am tired of these biased, one-sided and completely inaccurate images of the espionage game that took place during the Cold War. I find it funny that the United States is not able to make objective films about their participation in World War II and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the United States purchased the Enigma machine, again, completely wrong. <br /> <br /> To the credit of the “Company” was very well removed and acted. Places are also exceptionally well implemented. Alfred Molina plays great, as does Keaton (the conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted this show to be pleasant, and, no doubt, I will eventually watch the other 2 episodes, but I really would like American production to stop trying to portray their spies, military personnel, etc. As supermen, who are significantly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet. It quickly grows old and seriously diminishes the likelihood of what would be 10/10. <br /> <br /> s
