Klass is a comedy series about 27 year old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That is why it saddens me that The Class is not funny, although it has obvious potential. It's not enough traffic, just a jerk. (Ha ha.) This is due to the slow pace and lack of really fun highlights. Also, some actors have difficulty timing. <br /> <br /> The most inventive characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzie Kaplan and Heather Goldenersch), but even they seem too square for a good show. On the other hand, the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the ex-couple Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> In the series, I’m worried that the only Latin American character Aaron will be chosen because of his accent (although not a respected character, but in any case).
