I thought this movie was terrible. I am Chinese, so I thought that everything was wrong. Many facts were wrong. The only thing that was right in the film’s history in China was when Wendy’s mother told her husband about the statues that guarded Shi Huang Dee. I also thought the fighting scenes were very stupid and fake. Many of the actors and actresses were not very large. Some of the jokes that were supposedly “funny” were really stupid. I think this film should get the worst possible rating. Disney really should get more information about Chinese history if they want to make an extravagant film. Mulan was pretty accurate. Watch this movie if you want to spend some time.
