There are some good shots in this film, it captures some landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact, cinematography is probably its best advantage. <br /> <br /> But basically this is more done for a television movie, and although there are many twists and turns in the plot, which makes it quite interesting to watch, there are no subtitles, and the key plot developments are in Spanish, so they don’t speak in Spanish will remain a bit lost. <br /> I had it as a Christmas present, as it is a family trait - to work on the films of the actor, whom we find talented, and Matthew MacAonie was just great in “Time to Kill”, and “Newton Boys” so I expressed a desire to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> However, although the DVD says that this is Matthew McConaughey’s movie, and he uses it as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and he’s on the screen. for not quite a few minutes at the end of the film, it’s mostly superfluous, and it definitely doesn’t light up the screen while it’s on, so die fans, from this point of view it’s not worth it. <br /> <br /> Although the movie star Patrick MakGo is great and very light in appearance, and his character is very cute, kind and caring, a real saint about a guy, he would be well recorded in ROM com. <br /> <br /> So for the true McConaughey playing the brilliance of those I saw, I would recommend “Time to kill,” “The Newton Boys”, “Frailty,” “How to lose a guy in 10 days,” “Edtv "and" Amistad "and avoid too" Larger Than Life "and" Angels in the Outfield "if you don’t feel like a kid’s movie or kids around, because none of them shows his talent, but are pretty funny movies for children, again, MM is really nothing more than an auxiliary artist with a few, if any, lines. <br /> <br /> As far as Scorpion Springit's is a good movie, but it is also not a screen theft.
