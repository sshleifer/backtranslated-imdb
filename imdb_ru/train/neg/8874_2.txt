but there are not so many of them. Probably the worst movie about the "main release" that I've seen in my life. Definitely the worst this year. It makes no sense to comment on the plot, cast or action. The problem is beyond all this. This lies in the absolute stupidity of the annoying (not funny) kind of everything that happens on the screen. I don't know why I gave him 2/10 instead of 1/10. Perhaps because of Stephen Martini. He really tried. The result - for 95 minutes, flushed the toilet along with several brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
