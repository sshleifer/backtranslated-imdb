I can't understand all the hype about this movie. Well, if you like cheap splashes, you will like this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors, don't watch it. Personally, I really didnâ€™t like the actors in this film, they seem to be hired straight from the street. Dialogues are completely flat, and you always know what will happen next. The overall quality of this film lacks an estimated very low budget. When we saw this film (I and 3 other people), we all had in mind that this film was made by some people who had to do it just to get a diploma in film school - with minimal effort. Another problem that really reduces the overall impression is a bad camera (very shaky) and a bad sound. It seems that the entire movie is recorded using a single microphone.
