Personally, I really liked the 1995 Prophecy. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and although the film was not perfect, it was a terrible and very original horror / fantasy film that entertained immensely. This continued continuation of 1998 is still worth seeing, but mainly due to Walken. In my opinion, Walken is one of the greatest actors in the world, and he is again outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel Gabriel, whom he plays here for the second time. Once again, the war between the fallen and faithful Angels is brought to earth. Gabriel is returning to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danjala (Russell Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child once could be the determining factor of the heavenly war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is again as excellent as Gabriel. However, besides Gabriel, “Prophecy II”, unfortunately, also includes many horribly annoying characters. The character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danael irritated me even more. However, the biggest pain in the ass was the character Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicide girl who did not shut up. However, Walken’s performance is not the only redeeming quality of the film. The whole film is rather dull and well shot in dark colors, which is very conducive to the atmosphere. In addition, Gabriel’s resurrection scene at the beginning is quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the Prophecy films. "Prophecy II", however, is the weakest of the three films "Prophecy" with Walken. Definitely a Christopher Walken show for one person, interesting, but nothing beyond that.
