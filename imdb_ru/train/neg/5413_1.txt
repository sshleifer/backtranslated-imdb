After the rather successful MASTI, which was a little better, Inder Kumar returned with the comedy PYAARE MOHAN, based on the Hollywood film “Do not see evil, do not hear evil” <br /> <br /> The film reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994 ) where Kader and Anupam play blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This film is a tedious task. <br /> <br /> In the film there are such nonsense that you do not want to laugh, like the head of Snezhala Dhabi. get stuck in the back of the horse and all those typical comedies that we don’t laugh at now, but scoff at. <br /> <br /> The film begins in an ordinary manner, and some scenes are funny, unfortunately, such moments do not last long, until the story never moves in this half, even the comedy becomes boring. The turn is well resolved, and the second half becomes a fighter, where the blind and deaf go to save the heroines, and we have all the scenes of the OTT pursuit and the battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Directed by Inder Kumar bad Music is fine, one song stands out. I love you, my angel <br /> <br /> Vivek Terrified in comic scenes, his time is very bad and in serious scenes well. For some reason, he continues to make comedies and ruins his career. Fardeen Khan is a little better, but too wooden. Among the rest of Ash and Amrita are heroines who are annoyed by Boman Irani. Dubby's fine
