The girl takes a shower, not knowing that the serial rapist looks at her through the window in the roof. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone are watching him hotly, but not enough to find him after he kills, rapes and eats the girl's nipple. He is shot. Hopefully this will be the end of the film. Not because it is too terrible, but because the level of action is terribly awful. Unfortunately, this is not the end, and a few months later the rapist Satanists resurrected like a zombie. Therefore, he continues from the place where he stopped, with detectives again in action, this time behind him is also a flying child (do not ask). There were VERY good VERY low budget movies (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty come to mind), but this one scraped the bottom of the barrel. Awful game, stupid store special effects for ten cents, an unsuccessful attempt at a comedy and oh, yes, and the final sucks too. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Teresa Bestul gets completely nude; Ann R. Ki gets topless
