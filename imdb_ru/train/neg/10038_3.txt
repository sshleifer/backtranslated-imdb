The film lacks style, I mean the original style. everything looks copied, including actions, first appearances in the film, songs, dialogue delivery, etc., etc. Yes, there were insincere moods, as in the beginning, the car is shown with the number UP **** and after a few seconds he begins to fall from the hill with the number MH ****. It was one of the many nonsense movie :) Anything good about the movie? Yes, for Karina fans, if any, Karina in a bikini. For fans of akshay, his dialogues and action tricks. This is it. Nothing more. So look at your own risk and do not blame the director or actors. The director is already crazy and actors, I feel sorry for them.
