Naberezhnye brothers are directors, judging by the generally accepted ideas, you should be engaged in the creation of short films. I myself really really liked their first feature, the Benjamin Institute, but judging by their minor efforts, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I agree that they did not come close to equalizing their past genius in length. Piano Tuner is without a doubt a great movie that you can watch and listen to often. Unfortunately, itâ€™s very difficult to border on his confusing narrative and glacial pace. Reading the plot summary, it sounds like a pretty good story. But the Brothers failed miserably to bring it to life. One thing they need to consider in order to completely avoid in the future: dialogue. My God, this is a terrible Huge bust.
