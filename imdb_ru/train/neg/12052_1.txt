What happens when you give a free man enough money to catch him in a rat race and watch him wriggle? Homeless do not answer anyone. They have no mortgage, no rent, no idiots. Homeless people don't have to worry about the IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. But give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car, and suddenly they will have to worry about taking part in the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying for insurance in their car and working for someone else. They get a chance to become "productive citizens." This film was as explosive as possible. This is a way for rich and middle-class sheep to say, “See what happens when you try to help the poor?” And this confirms capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not a film that asks: “What happens when you take away all that the rich man has?”
