Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He's kind of a bad showman who can make you feel bad ... Very embarrassing. Nacho made several commercials on television, I remember one in which Nacho was searching for Paul Mac-Carney all over Madrid (the ad was about the Mac-Carney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This little movie looks like a Nacho commercial: a bad plot, bad direction and terrible performances. I can not believe that such a disgusting film was in the Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho could make this film because of his wife, producer 7:35, a woman who is very well connected with Spanish TV people.
