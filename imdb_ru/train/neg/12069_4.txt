Z-Class horror director Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors working in the field of low-cost bloody riots. His films are full of inept blood smell, ridiculous actions, boring scenes and terrible dialogue. A mysterious black clad Figure cruelly kills guests living in a family mansion. Unfortunately, this film is almost bloodless. In fact, you do not see the killings, except with shadows and a few splashes of blood. The pace is lethargic, and the plot is rather uninteresting. competent, but lack of blood and mutilation left me disappointed. Generous 4 out of 10. Just beware: don't confuse Monson’s film with Andy Milligan’s equally weak Heritage of Blood.
