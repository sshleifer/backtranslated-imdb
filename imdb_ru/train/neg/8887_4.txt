Good films cannot be based solely on the beautiful garden and the top of the hill. Surprised to see that he won two awards. Extremely overpriced. I first saw such films from China, visually stunning, but also with something really exciting to say, well, more than 10 years ago, and I am sure that there are more. I'm afraid this is not one of them.
