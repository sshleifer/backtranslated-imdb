The script is good. Although the casting is absolutely not monitored. No style. The costumes are not like some of the High Highbury society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Miss Beckinsale speaks British English better than Miss Paltrow, although in the actor play of Miss Paltrow lies the nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northham is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp and unfeeling, like Mr. Knightley in the television version. P.S. The viewer does not see Mr. Elton-Miss at all. The development of Smith's relationship, as it was in the movement version, so it’s impossible to understand where Emma’s whole attempt was to pick up Elton Smith (except for the portrait).
