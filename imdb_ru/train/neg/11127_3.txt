I'm not sure what Dian Silver was thinking about when she was making this film, but it clearly had nothing to do with the Richard Wright novel on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> We read the novel last summer on AP English 12, and the film just watched. During periodic recordings and checking hours, I reflected on the likelihood of a lightning strike. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I had to watch the rest of the film ... and then write an essay of 5 paragraphs. <br /> <br /> In the novel of Wright, very real topics were discussed, the killer's mind and the psychology behind it. The film Silver has turned the killer into a victim, and this is NOT what Wright wanted (see “How was born more”, 454). <br /> <br /> I want to make it short and sweet: if you want to leave your mind, unmarked, according to Rafael Lambert, skip the film and read a book. Adaptation 1986 is not material for thought. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I have to write an essay.
