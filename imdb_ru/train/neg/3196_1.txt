The only words you need to fear more than Joe Don Baker, if you are thinking about watching a movie, this is Graydon Clark, and if they are both there, run for your life. However, this is a very funny movie, because they really take themselves seriously! It all starts badly and from there it goes down, repeating scenes, “Good Bad” and “Ugly Shootout” will make you roll on the floor with laughter. Yes, he is the best deputy sheriff in Texas, tracking down the Mafia hitman to Malta as soon as he can. He sets his own rules, does everything in his own way, all the time in cowboy boots and in cowboy style. Do you want to watch a bad but funny movie? Go on, this is your turn!
