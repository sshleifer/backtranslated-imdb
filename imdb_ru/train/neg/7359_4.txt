Anyone who has watched several Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that dismisses the planning table. So, when crazy Lara moves into Patty's house and methodically starts driving her crazy housewives, I haven't even blinked. When Lara eventually stepped up her activities, threatening poor Patty, and dares her to do something about it, I simply nodded. You see, on the LMN Planet, people do not behave like they, for some specific reason, they just do it to support action. Only on the planet LMN can someone almost throw the master of the house from his home with the help of his seductive abilities !! Poor Patty - she just trusted too much, and Lara refused drugs, and then at the top of the stairs there was a big fight with a syringe full of deadly things that eventually injected into someone's tummy, and the body bag went out the front door. Horror! <br /> <br /> But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is classic. You need to watch it once, just to make you laugh. On an incredible scale, I give this film 95/100. Make a large batch of popcorn and take the apple slices. You will understand later.
