It has its merits; Morvern Callar is both a virtue and a disappointment. She is so mysterious, so original. Is this her method of dealing with the pain of the lost, which makes her so distant and unapproachable? Or did she, as one reviewer, call her a revolutionary? Personally, I would call her incapable. <br /> <br /> Morvern is completely separated. Having gotten rid of her boyfriend, without thinking about telling her family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, she selfishly throws herself out on a trip to Spain. She seems so devoid of anything about human greed. The only element that allows viewers to see her human side is her close friend, whom she takes with her on vacation. Although in the end her friend left, and Morvern has nothing to link her with humanity. She might as well have committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Spain looked as gloomy and sad as the UK, the director’s pictures were great and the lighting and color made the film visually stunning. <br /> <It is a pity that there is nothing in the film that could be of interest. It is a little over 90 minutes, but it feels much longer. They manage to make Morvern look interesting to get your attention, but do nothing with it, just push it away from you to a greater extent to such an extent that you don’t care about the characters or the movie.
