I just watched one episode of this program, and I could not even get to the end of the program. Every minute when I watched this program, my level of intelligence dropped by about 10 points. This is mainly as a children's program, but with a curse. Even the abuse and insults she tells other people made me laugh. In any case, the story had to be written by a monkey, and the people who actually used this script for this program for filming had to be at gunpoint and had no other choice but to remove this backward, disappointing, terribly working program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually earned on this program and get a few damn acting classes.
