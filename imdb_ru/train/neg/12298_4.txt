The Witchers may simply be the most inconsistent and deplorable horror film of the 80s, but, fortunately, it has several compensating qualities, such as the fantastic effects of blood, an exciting musical score and a terrific selection of actors. Honestly, the script doesn't make the slightest sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with a blown up haircut) portrays another girl possessed by evil abilities, and David Hasselhof portrays a smart photographer (who seems to be unable to be caught) a film in which bloody voodoo is constantly present, hard-wired lips, crucifixions on its head, cruel arsons and an overly used, but truly eerie tune. Eight random people gathered on an abandoned resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. A young couple is there to explore the dark history of this place; a dysfunctional family (with pregnant Linda Blair, despite the fact that no one seems to care about who the father is and what his whereabouts are), is considering opening a hotel, and a tasty female architect is simply flagged for casual sex. They are forced to stay overnight in a dilapidated hotel, and then suddenly to the previous owner ?? an aging actress or something who always dresses in black ?? starts outputting them in various exciting ways. Everything is somehow connected with the opening sequence in which a woman accused of witchcraft jumps out of the window. In any case, the plot is definitely of secondary importance in the Italian horror franchise, which began as an unofficial outlet for The Evil Dead. The atmosphere is sometimes disturbing, and the effects of makeup are undoubtedly the most excellent element of the entire film. There is something extremely painful and disturbing in that I look at a defenseless woman hanging upside down in a chimney and waiting to be roasted.
