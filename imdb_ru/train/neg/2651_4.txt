The first 30 minutes of the film were unstable and it was difficult to understand what was going on (unless you read the book - which I did not know). <br /> <br /> If you can stick with the first half, the second half Sweet is predictable, yes, but sweet nonetheless. <br /> <br /> As it was shot, you might think that it was produced in the early 80s, and not in 2005. <br /> <br /> There are no special moments, to say the least, but they moved without missing me. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, her role would have been better played with the player more at the level of other actors, in order to maintain balance.
