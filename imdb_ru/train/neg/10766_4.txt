Anyone who has seen the Tammuz Child Eaters knows that this is a director who can do better. Let's hope that this was a case of not too many hands in a sweat (Telefilm anyone?), And this was a case of minor jitters. Symbols are one-dimensional and more used. However, the landscape is stunning and beautifully demonstrates the northwest Pacific. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. Shot almost completely outside, the images are clear and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically, this film is as good as they are - just not enough heart.
