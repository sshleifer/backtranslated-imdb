Kubrick meets the king. I remember it sounded so promising in the spring of 1980. Then the film came out, and since then the Kubrick cultists have quarreled with the King's cultists. <br /> <br /> King's Cultists say that Stanley Kubrick took a great horror story and destroyed it. Kubrick cultists do not worry about King’s story. They talk about Stedikamah, tracking images, camera angles. This is a film that they insist on: it must be considered independently. As it happens, both camps are correct. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If we consider this solely as an adaptation of King’s novel, “The Shining” is really a failure, a lost opportunity, a series of unsuccessful narrative narratives. <br /> <br /> I blamed the screenwriter Kubrick. Writer Dianne Johnson (by Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) Has a reputation as a novelist of social manners. Maybe she was chosen for her subtle understanding of marital relations or family dynamics. But the small town of Sidewider, Colorado, does not exist on any map in its francophile universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick Anglophil probably found her congenial, however. He is, of course, the real author. And if we look at it in essence, his script for the film “The Shining” - with its confusion of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernatural and implied reincarnation - simply does not stand the logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I am ready to consider Kubrick’s “Shine” on my own terms. I’m even willing to accept this as something other than a regular horror movie. But this will not succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation, and madness. The film, taken apart in any case, largely falls apart. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real? Or do they only exist in the mind - first as foreseeing nightmares that little Danny Torrance suffered from, and then as hallucinations of his father? You can see that whenever Jack Torrance talks to the ghost, he actually looks in the mirror. You can see how the frozen labyrinth of trimmed hedges in the hotel symbolizes the undersized, confused psyche of Jack. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> But if the truly “ghosts” of Overlooke are purely a manifestation of Jack Torrance’s growing insanity, who exactly will release the locked Jack from the hotel’s kitchen intake cabinet, so that he can go to his rampage with ax? <br /> <br /> And can NO ONE explain, with a black face, this black and white photograph (marked “1921”) of Nicholson as a tuxedo party? - a visit that jumps out of the left field onto the wall of the hotel-ballroom during the final seconds of the movie? Should we seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Madness stems from a kind of past life experience? (And if you swallow it, since when did reincarnated people have to be exact physical copies of their past?) <br /> <br /> Maybe Kubrick could not care less about his storyline. Maybe just wanted to cause a mood of horror. Anyway, the film tries to insure its narrative bets - to do it in both ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story becomes a mess. This film has not improved with age, and, of course, it will not improve with repeated viewing. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that a few minutes of fear, claustrophobia and general eeriness are scattered throughout this long time. long movie But these feverish “Blood Lifts,” repeatedly encountered in the visions of little Danny, are absurd and ridiculous. And the notorious tags of Jack Torrance (“Wendy, I'm home!” And “Jonie Heeeeeer!”) Just break through the dramatic tension of the film and dissipate its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and heard the audience laughing in a comic relief: “Phew! I’m glad we shouldn’t take it seriously!”) Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea - or completely cynical - during those scenes in which Wendy is wandering around an empty hotel, and her husband is trying to rub his son. Is the lobby full of mummified guests all sitting there dead in their holiday hats? Yes, now I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> Given the brilliance of Jack Nicholson over the years, one can only assume that he gave exactly what the director was playing with his eyebrows, moving his eyebrows and decorations. wanted. The speech of Shelley Duval, as a kind of female version of Don Notts in “The Ghost and Mr. Chicken”, is best conveyed in silence. <br /> <br /> This film simply did not succeed - not as an adaptation, and not on its own terms. It probably deserves 3 out of 10, but I give it 1 because it was GROTELY EXCELLENTLY overestimated in this forum.
