I'm not a horror movie lover, but my wife's nieces and nephews. So, I saw the first movie. It was awful and tense, but not for my taste. Still good though. For the same reasons, at this very moment, I proceed. <br /> <br /> The very premise is non-absurd. I can buy that disasters occur in the desert. I can buy that mutants exist. I can even buy that events can be so strange and strange that the military can take part. Hardly, yes, but I am ready to give up my faith. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, under no circumstances can I believe that a military unit designated for reconnaissance of such an area cannot repel a defeat. mutants. As a member of the US Army, I can assure you that, although recruits may not have enough experienced eyes and experience of combat soldiers, any such recruits will be integrated into an efficient unit. <br /> <br /> A detachment of armed soldiers is not going to be destroyed by several mutants with knives. Here is how it works. The movement of troops, surpassing firepower and, of course, radio support, would guarantee nothing more than complete victory. I'm not saying that you will not have victims, but once the area is declared hostile, military training will become a priority, no one will leave himself, even to use the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it was discovered that the area was so contaminated by enemy forces that the detachment could not cope with the danger, they would be contacted by radio for backup. And believe me, their radios would not be blocked if there was a chance that the usual radio stations would not have worked, the detachment would have a military satellite phone. Most likely, if they could not register every hour, a search would be conducted. <br /> <br /> To accept this film, you have to admit that our soldiers are incompetent fools with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command. Although it is still possible that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and a compass, our armed forces are filled with smart, well-trained, competent soldiers. Mutants with knives are far below our ability to handle it. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole depends on the impossible to imagine; the film cannot be presented. Instead, we must believe that our soldiers, sailors and pilots are not able to cope with even the most mediocre threats. <br /> <br /> As a combat veteran, I find the film offensive.
