Despite the positive reviews and shows at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other films in which a teenage girl from an immigrant family must overcome many common personal problems of her age, as well as to combat the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does this by choosing a sport and, with the help of a local boy, who for some reason falls in love with her, she faces her problems and wins. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight this is boxing, in Bend it like Beckham, this is football, and now it's kung fu. <br /> <br /> But the Fighter is much worse than these two, it was just awkward to watch him. Semra Turan, the “actress” playing the role of a teenage girl, can, can do a lot, but she cannot act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and awkward, the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are terrible, her body and tongue from an amateur actress poorly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just can't save this cliché film with stereotypical characters and a small plot. Apart from a few relatively good moments, this film is nothing new or interesting. <br /> <br /> Even fighting Kung Fu is no reason to watch it, it's just boring. Slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and she lacked inspiration, and most of the kung-fu scenes just train or stand in all kinds of kung-fu, and do not actually fight. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and thin girl fights with big and muscular boys and knocks them down. <br /> <br /> The only reason this film was spotted is that it is European. It is very easy to advertise this film - the first martial arts film from Denmark, but do not be fooled, it is not. It's just a drama about a stupid teenage girl and her problems, which, by the way, are not very convincing. <br /> <br /> Bad film with embarrassing lines, acting and history.
