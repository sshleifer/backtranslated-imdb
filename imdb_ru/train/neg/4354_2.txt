this show is terribly no comedy, no plot, no good characters. America, you're blind, giving a reward to a real show. I hate this show along with 30 rock. To be honest, I'm so glad they canceled this show. thanks CBS. leave two and a half men, leave Christine, follow the rules of engagement, remember how I meet your mother, which is not really funny, but much funnier than that. this show rips off friends. with the same director, so that's all right. but keep this show away and never return it. Never, the only reason that I did not give him a grade of 1 is that she is awake and not awake. These are the films or series that I give. The only reason I wasn’t asleep was because of the laughter of the audience, and I was looking forward to the next show. I really want this show to be funny, sorry, but my opinion is stupid. very stupid. I don't understand why everyone loves it. my opinion again. but I also find the big bang theory pretty dumb. my bad nerd. class while I have a smile, and it’s not from watching your show.
