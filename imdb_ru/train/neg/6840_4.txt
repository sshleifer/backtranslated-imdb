Although this journey, of course, does not correspond to its predecessor, it has more than just a fraction of memorable moments. My personal favorite, right after he devastated the city block with his “Video Disk Cannon”, we see Nimea’s face in close-up. When a tear falls from his left eye, we know that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The spectator cannot but be drawn into his emotional turmoil, and we understand that his earlier flat effect was only a facade. Absolute shine !!! Sex scenes show a good balance, carnal, but not pornographic. After that, I felt that I had a pretty good understanding of how the Magnavision video player works. It is a pity that they have not produced them for more than 25 years.
