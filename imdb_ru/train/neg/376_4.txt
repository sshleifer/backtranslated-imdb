The French film "Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte", filmed by iconoclast director Philippe Harel, is based on the eponymous book written by controversial writer Michel Huelbeck. He also worked on the script for this film. According to the British cinematic magazine Sight and Sound, this is also known as "Anything." This film was hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema due to its not very common topic of sexual politics and its influence on two stupid information technology workers. The film is spoiled by a too obvious voice that introduces us to the main character. It makes us viewers feel that we are watching a book that brings reading. The basic premise of the problems associated with loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine, but the film gets out of control as soon as the hero begins to talk about the suffering he and his friend face. Instead of sticking to its main theme, the film turns in other directions leading to its fall. Beware: some women viewers can find not only the film, but even its two heroes as debility women-haters.
