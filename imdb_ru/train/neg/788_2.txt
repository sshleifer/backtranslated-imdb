A film with very little positive to say about it. <br /> <br /> First, he has a zero tempo and is positively absent from any drama. <br /> <br /> Aside from being surprisingly slow, Empty Acre seems to be using the same footage over and over again. I lost count of how many times I saw “this” field at night or that part of cracked earth. <br /> <br /> This also has a fundamental flaw in that if viewers are not aware of the things that they will be captured, and not just confused. Thus, with no indication that there are any problems, we suddenly discover that marriage is not what it seems, despite the fact that it seems to be in order. We find that Jacob may be the worst farmer in the universe, as he doesn’t seem to be wasting time on the farm, and also seems to have bought land with a completely useless acre. Does Beth have a key to a warehouse of books? There are countless other issues, some of which are dealt with later in the film, much later, in fact, too late. <br /> <br /> And about an acre. The creators of the horror film say that large inanimate objects are inherently not terrible ?? and if they are for a large acre, make them like that. <br /> <br /> There is also a frightening lack of rationality, since Beth (the best performer in the play followed by Jefferson is a policeman). ) suddenly it turns out to be blamed for everything under the sun just because she takes "medicines". <br /> <br /> The full ten minutes run through the fields in search of the missing child (did he crawl out of the window? Six months) the film descends into a poorly written scene after a poorly written scene. Bad Plinksky plonka "terrible" music does not add atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies can be funny, but not “Empty Acre”, which is just bad.
