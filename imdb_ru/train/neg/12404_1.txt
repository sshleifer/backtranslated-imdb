I have to say that this film is a blow to Mork and Mindy, when I watched it, I felt a chill, I even wet myself a little. When that Korean guy with spiders around his neck started kicking people, I was like oh my lord, Asian people smell and suck because they constantly eat dogs. In any case, Chuck had some terrible performance and did not possess the intelligence of an ordinary non-robotic person. Some people would compare him to his early days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the Holy Spirit and the ghost of the Christmas past. This film is so bad that I put my newborn baby in a box and left it in Mr. Norris' mailbox. He can raise my child. I will not let him get into the world where he thinks that Chuck Norris is a karate expert. I'll let him see how this hack is in real life for the rest of his life.
