This film pretty much sucks. I am in the army, and the soldiers depicted in this film are terrible. If you are in the army and see this film, you will laugh and be upset about the way they acted as a squad. That was funny. They acted like ordinary people in army uniform, not knowing what to do. It was a pretty awful movie, I would say, to say the least. There were a couple of scenes where they tried to make you jump. I would recommend to watch it if you are bored and you want to watch a cruel, bloody movie. It will be the best movie if you are not in the army. I also have to say that I liked the first one better than this one.
