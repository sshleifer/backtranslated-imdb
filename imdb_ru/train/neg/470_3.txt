I loved this film as a child, but after seeing it again more than 20 years later, it really sucks. Up Academy may have outstripped its time back in 1980, but today it has almost nothing to offer! Films like Caddyshack and Stripes are much better today than this steaming dog heap. No T & A. No great jokes, except for one-liners, which we have already heard a million times. <br /> <br /> I recently bought a DVD in the hope that it will be the gem I remember. Well, I'm gone! The soundtrack had only 2-3 well-known hits (and not a collection of hits that others mentioned), and frequent voice-overs were awful. The only thing that was interesting to me was to predict what character traits were before they uttered them. Yes, I watched this movie so much then! <br /> <br /> The only reason I write this review is to give me two cents about why this film should be forgotten, sorry. :(
