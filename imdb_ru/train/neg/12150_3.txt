Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies you need after your hard-earned dollars. Sentence? Save your hard-earned dollars, and let's just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this. Guess what the plots are about? Zombies take over. This time though, for the sake of originality (?) This film takes place in Rhode Island, and, frankly, I'm not sure that I have ever seen a movie about a zombie in Rhode Island. The government-controlled channel allegedly supports “normal” broadcasts so that any remaining citizens do not think that there is any problem in the world, that is, those that never watch or go outside. I will say, however, that several commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most fun part of this film. In fact, there is some kind of story in this, but I don’t worry about it, because after a while you won’t care or fall asleep. In any case, it has a lot of terrible actions to discard all the “everything that we have seen before” that is thrown out in front of the camera. Believe me, you can find a lot of other things that can be associated with your time, except to watch it. 3 out of 10
