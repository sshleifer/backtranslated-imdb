I remember when it was in cinemas, reviews said that it was awful. Well, I did not think it was so bad. It was fun and there was a lot of mocking humor about families during the holidays. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house where he grew up and makes a deal to rent his family there for Christmas. I really liked the scene of a lawyer where they sign a contract. It was fun. <br /> <br /> He makes stupid requests for family and even writes scripts to read them. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for love interest. And he learns that the holidays are not so bad. <br /> <br /> In addition, this whole game was fun, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the parents of the girlfriends didn’t say anything about it. And the parts where doo dah beats his “prospective daughter.” CONCLUDING VERDICT: I thought it worth checking to see if you caught it by cable.
