This video guide was a 1995 masterpiece. Well done! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have serious screen chemistry when they talk about what the Start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to launch the Special Edition DVD with scenes removed, comments from Bill Gates, a documentary about comparing Windows 95 with Windows XP and many others! <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 (won at least a golden globe)
