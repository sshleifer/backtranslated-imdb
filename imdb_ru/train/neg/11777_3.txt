A few years ago I saw the Godfather, and he made an indelible impression on me, the atmosphere of the film was first-class, the acting game was memorable, and the storyline was classic. I recently bought a Trilogy, and after watching part 1, I again looked forward to watching part 2 ...... I was so glad to know that at the beginning of part 2, that this was a suitable continuation of the great film “The Godfather”, everything was again almost perfect, and I couldn't wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG! I would like to dwell on ii. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me that this was a story invented just to have a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Protege Pacino was a weak character who could be eaten alive in the Godfather 1 or 2. Then such scenes as Corleone, endowed with all the attributes of the Catholic Church with a full choir, the killer on horseback, leaving at sunset, invisible shooting from a helicopter at a rally (where “goodies” run away, and all the others are shot), the daughter and cousin roll pasta pieces on the board, pathetic shooting at the steps ... Corleone is stuffed with orange juice with diabetes (a person with his own mind and cunning is not ready for an emergency ituatsii?) ... No, it was not good, and with the best will, I can not in the world to see it again. But I will watch 1 and 2 many times over the years.
