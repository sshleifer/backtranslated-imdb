What a horrible movie. I love monster movies, but I couldnâ€™t even see half of the terrible game, cardboard characters and terrible special effects. There is nothing redemptive in this film. Characters come either from an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon-feeds, or from empty, boring sock dolls. The plot is a formula, cut and paste, standard scientific chatter. Even CGI is terrible. You know, it's bad when you can't even count on a movie giving you a nice eye candy. No surprises here, just the same old, same old. This is truly one of the worst films in history. Director Roger Corman should be hung on a lamppost so that children can use it as a pinata.
