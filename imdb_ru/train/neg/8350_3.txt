I just got back from El Otro playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say that I was very disappointed. The film is very slow (don't get me wrong, I like slow movies!), Slow to the point that it drives you crazy. All you hear is Julio Chavez, breathing heavily throughout the film. This is a poorly made film, but, more importantly, this is a film without inspiration, I did not feel anything about the plot or its characters. <br /> <br /> “El Otro” was made just for the sake of making a film ... forget I would advise you to skip this one if you want to watch good Argentinean films, watch Sorin’s films.
