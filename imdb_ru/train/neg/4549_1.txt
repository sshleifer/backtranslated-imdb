Adolescence best describes the screen version of the best-selling philosophical novel Celesteine's Prophecy, which follows the spiritual awakening of a disabled teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present so-called characters, spewing overburdened exposure and metaphysical focus, while the film progresses through the extremely tough direction of Armand Mastroianni. Even though there are visible attempts to measure up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain "Lost" ABC or Dan Brown's "Da Vinci Code", the filmmakers hardly cope with the task. This film smells of ill-conceived spiritual propaganda of mass consumption, and the results are so terrible that few can sneak through this mess to find a real point.
