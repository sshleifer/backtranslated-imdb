“Igor and the Crazy” is a totally inept and amateurish attempt to make a horror film crazy hippie-cult-killing-fun. Apparently, even after almost twenty years, Charles Manson still inspired overly enthusiastic, but incompetent directors. This is a typical production of “Troma”, in other words, there are many boring and completely irrelevant additions accompanying a meaningless plot. Are there some random blood and causeless nudity on the display ?? what is not bad ?? but all this is so senseless and ugly that it becomes unpleasant to look at him. “Igor and the Crazy” are so desperate that they even use the footage twice, such as a circular saw kill. An inconsistent conspiracy is trying to tell the story of a hippie cult led by drug addict and imitator Charlie Manson Paul. One of Paul’s lower-ranking students, named Igor, becomes too obsessed with biblical stories and drug orgies and gradually makes the entire cult plunge further into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate with a small example how exactly Igor is crazy: he pulls a heart out of the chest of a really sexy black girl hitchhiker! There is an annoying soundtrack for the synthesizer and some really awkwardly mean pseudo-artistic camera stunts, such as slow-motion shots and dark sequences of dreams. Maybe there is one sequence that more or less qualifies as useful for garbage fans, and that is “when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the blade shot in the bloody stomach for fifteen full seconds.
