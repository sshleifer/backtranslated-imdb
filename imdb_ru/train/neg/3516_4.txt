There is no doubt as to who commands the cadet training in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in creating a new type of soldier from his cadets - the scorer. But he is not so cruel as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his mind about the value of women working in the army. He is tough when he should be, but in other cases he is a clear mix of a coach and a pastor, roles that he honed in other films. His character is the basis of action, around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in this role and plays it very well. Two things help in this film: the performance of O'Brien and the exciting special effects that end.
