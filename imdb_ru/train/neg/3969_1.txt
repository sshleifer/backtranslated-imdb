I am writing this because for some reason I felt that I was considered to be Dark Remains a good film. Although this is not the worst thing I've seen, it is certainly not good. <br /> <br /> Weak script, weak actors and poor direction. Even if they cannot afford to play a celebrity, will they ask too much for a more attractive leading role? It was painful to watch a simple actress through a movie with her boring performance. The story was cliché and poorly written. The special effects were minimal. The “repetitive” tricks of “waiting” were difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Dark Remains is no worse than some of the episodes of The Lords of Horror. But for now, not quite on par with high-quality films. Dark Remains is recommended only to horror horror fans who do not want to miss a single movie in the genre, even if it is poorly filmed. As for any other, time must be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
