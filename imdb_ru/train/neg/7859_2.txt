Oh my God. This movie was terrible. I can't complain too much about it. I went to see it, just to quarrel. That's enough, sort of. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the film was at the very beginning, when a woman is extremely brightly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated child. <br /> <br /> I also think it is funny that most of the famous actor in the film was a Latin American soldier who was a supporting actor next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a terrible acting job. It was one of the worst games I've ever paid to see. <br /> <br /> I also expected that it would be much worse than the first. It was not. I expected that it would be more terrible, because it is a continuation, and the sequels of horror films, as a rule, are much less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more horrible, since blood and violence usually sell horror films these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but in reality it wasnâ€™t as bad as the first which was another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Mutants in the first of these were a bit of a concern, but the filmmakers tried their best to make them creepy that they were completely funny. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of showing a clip of the son of a female soldier on her camera phone with the words "I love you, mommy" FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it in the first place, because they simply tried to make us feel more vulnerable to the vulnerable mother than the other soldiers, and it was even more stupid to try to make us feel MORE for her, showing it three more times for no reason. This movie was a joke.
