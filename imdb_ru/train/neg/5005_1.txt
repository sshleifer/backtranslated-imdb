Dirty, terribly awful (and NOT in a fun way) C Grade movie. Everything shouts “amateur”, from an awkward scenario (fancy rooms, limited consistency and predictable endings; turgid lighting, sound and camera’s shaky camera angles; shy and obscene sexual understatement and references; blurred and incredible dialogue on Z). Normal game. I saw it on a DVD and kept hoping that Edward Wood would jump out. Everything is forgiven - your Worst Films are works of art, and more consistent than this chatter. <br /> <br /> But still, rather than singing "Every night in my dreams I hear you" - are you sure that the Titanic team was not involved on this side?
