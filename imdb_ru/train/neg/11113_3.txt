I often feel like Scrooge clapping a movie that others are raving about - or I am writing a review to balance unwarranted raves. I found this film almost imperceptible, and, which was unusual for me, he moved forward not only through boring cliché dialogues, but even boring cliché musical numbers. Whatever originality is in this film - an unusual home environment for the musical, a lot of imagination, some animation - more than compensated by the script, in which there is no gram of mind, no plot development. Separately, June Haver and Dan Daly look like good people, but they can't carry the film on the team. None of them is truly charismatic or has a lot of sex appeal. They are both soft. I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty cute. For me, the best part of the film is the beautiful costumes of June Haver and a great body.
