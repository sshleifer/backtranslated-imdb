"Prom Night" talks about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being pursued by a suicide killer who tries to kill her during her prom night. And thereby killing her family, friends and her enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before I begin, let me tell you, you are tired of the PG-13 horror films that have not been scary lately. You are tired of the silly girl talk "My God" and talk about girl things. And you are really tired of the girls in a relationship, and then you cry. And finally, you are tired of the fact that the US is remaking Asian, Japanese and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up the prom, but I haven't finished the review yet. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see the “prom night” is to laugh at the murders. If not, I do not see prom. You never see the killings, only hear the cry, and you see blood on the wall. And, by the way, deaths repeat as 24/7. So they are not only not terrible, but disgusting. By the time I met the cast, I think I was ready to quit. Too many conversations with girls, too many conversations with guys and a lot of “Oh my gosh. This is our graduation. I understand that this is fun, but seriously - this is too much to ask not to concentrate. <br /> <br /> If I included the prom night in the list of the worst films of 2008, without seeing other films, I would also be the first. I would not be surprised if it is released on DVD cheaply and quickly. Seriously do not waste your money or time on a boring game, cheap fears and "Night to die for" when watching a movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. (PS If I could give a movie zero stars I would).
