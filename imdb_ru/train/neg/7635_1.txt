I fully agree with the review of the reviewer Variety that the film is never so funny, lively or insightful about the creative process, what his premise seems to be. In fact, it is dirty and the lighting is really problematic. If it is assumed that the film is based on characters, poor lighting does not improve the action, and sometimes it is difficult to observe the expression on the actors' faces. Many non-South Africans will find it difficult to follow spoken English in the film, and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched a movie at the Cape Town World Cinema Festival last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from invisible and careless to the desired departure from films about our painful past. Unfortunately, "Bunny Chow" will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the wonderful films about our apartheid history will indeed be recognized as one of the best in our 110-year cinema history. Not surprisingly, the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town just two weeks after its release and from most cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. This is clearly a limited appeal among South African audiences.
