I already know that critics and some viewers say that it was a satire, there were a lot of political and social messages, names refer to some other names, etc. It can be. I can’t understand such things (I don’t want to do it anyway) because I don’t care, I’m interested in cinema. As for the film itself, again they say that the film is smart and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything that we do not see in the films of monsters, except for the scene that occurs in the office in the second half. Yes, this scene says something about humanity, but that does not make the film brilliant. The film is interesting (soft) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more. As for the biggest drawback of the film, these are visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not pull myself together for a while, because I was expecting a realistic monster, because this is not one of the old films about Godzir, it was shot in 2006, but it’s not. It’s as if you don’t believe that there is a monster, you don’t care. If you agree with me about this, I highly recommend Cloverfield, which is very realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least it is planned, there is an effort. Sharply powerful criticism. Some critics say this as if it were a Kurosawa film. Yes, this is more drama than a thriller or an action movie, but this should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I don’t want to compare the Host with other monster movies, but I’m trying to say that the Host doesn’t do what other monster movies don’t. By the way, maybe some people call the film a masterpiece because of its sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I also love Asian movies, but this is a fact.
