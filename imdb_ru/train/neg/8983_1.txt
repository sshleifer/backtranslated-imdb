Ulis is a literature teacher who comes to the coastal city. There he will fall in love with Martin, the most beautiful girl in town. They will begin a tumultuous romance that will end in the tragic death of Ulisa on the sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city, and lives a quiet happy life surrounded by money. One day, the appearance of Ulises will make her passion rise and act without thinking about the consequences. The plot is rather absurd, and none of the actors plays a decent role. In addition, three-quarters of the film are sexual acts, which, while still well-filmed, are quite tiresome, as we want to see further development of the story. This is just a bad Bigas Moon movie, in which there is a lot of sex, no controversy and stupid characters everywhere.
