By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yafet Cotto could not save this turkey. I heard that the original film was supposed to be called Treasure, but was changed to Shark Treasure to take advantage of the excitement created by Jaws. I think the sharks were in one scene of this film; the fact that they got into this “thriller” had to sell tickets. It didn't work. Every time something good happens in a movie, the crew of the ship drinks each other with a certain brand of beer that was just introduced during the making of the movie. Gee, do you think beer could be a sponsor? Could they make it more obvious? The only time someone has to break a beer is if they make it through this thing. This is enough to celebrate.
