As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. Comic colors are bold. I think that the director has taken a great interest in his “artistic vision” of looking at the film, and not by the sharply needed attention to the content. Despite the star composition, the performances are dull, and the story is almost incoherent. Madonna, most likely, played the role of a trick to get a press release. Good thing, because her appearance here gave some faith to her album “I'm Breathless (Music inspired by the movie Dick Tracy),” which was a stratospheric hit (thanks in part to the dance hit “Vogue” - which relationship to this film). I assume that the bulk of the money from this film came from Madonna’s investment in the album “I'm Breathless”. <br /> <br /> If you watch it at home, at the end of the game you think that I have two hours from my life that I would like to return. Save yourself time - do not worry about it.
