Ah, the infamous Guinea pig series ... I, frankly, have to say that I was generally disappointed with the whole series ("He Never Dies," "The Mermaid in the Hatch," and "The Flower of Flesh and Blood - exceptions ... and even those that are by no means great ...), but Devil's Experiment is just simple strikes. There is nothing realistic looking, except for climatic (or perhaps anti-climatic, depending from the way you see it) the piercing scene in the eyeball. It seems that the victim really doesn’t care what happens and she whimpers or whimpers when subjected to "disgusting" (more often sometimes "ridiculous") torture. "A flower made of flesh and blood" is a more violent and bloody image of fake "snuffing" material, but this film also fails at the level of realism. I applaud to the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and over the past two decades they have really gone a long way to wear the crown in “extreme” filmmaking, but Devil’s Experiment simply does not stand up. It is worth seeing if you are a die-hard, if not for any other reason, except how to see what the fuss is, but I can only give this film a very generous 3/10, and it is only for a needle through the eye scene ...
