I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr. Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> This is bad .... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a horribly boring home movie. <br /> <br /> I really like his other films ... but if you're a fan like me ... stay away from that. This may change your thoughts about Adam. You can never recover from the horror of this film .... I had better watch old people play scrabble in the house .......
