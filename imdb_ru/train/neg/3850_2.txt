I saw this movie on SXSW with the participation of the director. A lot of people came out, and the audience could hardly collect even polite applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films that I saw at this festival, Frownland is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> At 106 minutes it's at least 95 minutes more. You will be able to observe the unsuccessful and prolonged attempts of the main character to communicate in extended real-time mode. The same grimaces, movements around the mouth, kinetic and frantic repeating words and syllables over and over again - WE GET A POINT. <br /> <br /> One site actually compares this work to early Mike Lee. What drugs would you need to take to make this statement? Given that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, you may have to play a heavy spin on the Trout Mask cue to appreciate this movie. Incredibly, it won the jury prize at the festival. You can bet that he did not win the audience award.
