The only reason I don’t give this film less than 3 stars is because it’s not exactly on a par with a film like Manos: Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this film is the fact that it is incredibly boring and terrible, inexcusably British. Sending this movie sounds potentially promising, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction in which they went was completely uninteresting. It was more like a film about research funding and ties than designing lasers. The actors were wooden, unemotional and alienated. Like the love relationship between the two scientists - it was not at all intriguing. I could never say that there was an attraction between them, because there was no chemistry. I also did not understand why the main guy with a melted face decided to kill everyone he met. At least, now I know that I must always give someone a fair hearing before I give up their research grants, otherwise they will rape, unceremoniously killing stupid gestures.
