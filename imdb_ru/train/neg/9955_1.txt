All this looks very nice. European location was a good idea. Leading actors are attractive. Account can be serviced. <br /> <br /> BUT THEY TALKED THERE! And no plot is developed! And from there everything was downhill. Pacino is a lunat, and Keller continues to talk about how bored she is ... hello, dear, you are not alone. When he imitates Mae West, you may have to hide your face to look at which hurts so much. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the actor or director Sidney Pollack became interested in this, or better the question, why did it stink so badly? <br /> <br /> Since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you have little pleasure here. Maybe he should feel empty and cold like death. But I still can not recommend it.
