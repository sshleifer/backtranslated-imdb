I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi film. On the one hand, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing is a remake of what should be a classic. I found it boring, rude and funny. If you saw it, you know what I mean. Almost everyone in Imdb says this is crap and they are right! If not, avoid it. This is a snore 1 out of 10
