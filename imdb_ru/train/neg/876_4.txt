Until the last 20 minutes, I thought it was probably Jackie Chan’s worst film (excluding his work until 1978, which I don’t know). The final battle has changed all this: it is long, good and tense - indeed, one of the highlights of Chan’s career. But to get to this, you have to go through a lot of “comedies” that can entertain five-year-old children (oh, look! Someone threw a tomato in the face of this guy) and endless “football” scenes. Not to mention duplication (which includes the line “How can I turn it off? This is not a touch” - look to find out what this applies to). "Lord of the Dragon" is rented only for the final battle, but the rest of the film is only for Jackie's collectors, and even then only for those who have already watched at least 15 of his other films.
