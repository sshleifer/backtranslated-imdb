Judging by this film and “Strong Man”, made in the same year, I would not put Harry Langdon in the first place in the list of great silent comedy films. There is just not enough there. He may have been on his way to developing his style, but he sabotaged himself by taking his first great successes too seriously. In any case, all his tricks are reminiscent of big funny people, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and Lloyd's incredible ingenuity. He also undermines his personality, dressing and walking like Chaplin’s wandering character. His trademarks are childlike innocence, timidity of approach and a tendency to underestimate a disaster, looking puzzled, fighting in the eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of the index finger. The comedy in Langdon films is a result of the fact that fate throws various obstacles in his way that he tries to overcome in stupid or naive ways or with minimal physical exertion, for example, throwing stones at an approaching tornado in order to drive him away dodging boulders, raising his leg to roll under him. In this story about the son of a shoemaker, who participates in a cross-country race to advertise the shoes of a rival company, he manages to win thanks to a happy accident. There is nothing here that would not have been done better by the Big Three.
