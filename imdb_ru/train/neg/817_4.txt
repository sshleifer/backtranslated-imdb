“You are not going to shoot these little creatures. First, they have not caused you any harm. Secondly, they can be radioactive. ” Ah, the joys of non-budget sci-fi 50s ?? And yet, despite the strange pearl, Superman and Mole-men are pretty boring, even though they run 58 minutes. It is cheap (one shot of Superman's flight - incredibly inept animation footage) and pretty boring, although it has a surprisingly altruistic message ?? dumb people-moths, miniature actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats that look more like Mr. Mxyzptlk without a hat than underground creatures freed from the underground world by oil drilling are not evil, they are simply misunderstood, and the man of steel George Reeves is trying prevent the local crowd of a small town led by Jeff Cory from killing them. Perhaps an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, but with a little more than good intentions to recommend it.
