In a distant galaxy, there is a planet called Ceta. These are native people worshiping cats. But dog lovers wage war with these feline loving people, and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people for food. This is one of the stupidest movie ideas I've ever seen. Leave it to Ted Michels to make the film more incompetent than the low standard he set in previous films. As if he likes to play celluloid in Limbo. How low can he go? The only losers in the script are the American viewers. Mr. Mickels and his silly little mustache steering really have people who still buy this shit. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> More info on DVD: Comment by Ted Mickels; Creation history (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds off-screen; Ted Mikels filmography; and trailers for the films “Eaters of Worms”, “Girl in Golden Boots”, “Detachment of Dolls”, “Ten Cruel Women” (depicting nudity), “Orgy of Devils Blood” and “Corpses”
