Treasure Island DVD should be mandatory for viewing on any filmmaking course! This is an example from a tutorial on how NOT to make a movie. Watching a movie and then listening to a writer / director’s commentary clearly demonstrates a huge gap between what he knows about the characters and what he tells his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of films as a way of communication, and communication is not complete if viewers do not know what the director is talking about. The director’s universally accepted goal is to make the film devoid of the Hollywood Accords. Alas, among these conventions - the consistency of nature and clarity of the concept. The director himself understands that viewers often do not understand the moments when he deliberately avoided the “Hollywood cliche”. However, he never realizes that clichés exist for some reason. They are designed to quickly and clearly convey complex ideas. It is good to avoid them, but they need to be replaced by some other way of conveying the same idea, and not just eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich in potential. Two puppets are designed to make the person and the background for an unidentified corpse to be used in the disinformation mission in the last days of World War II. Soon everyone begins to fill his personal fantasies with a character, and their invention becomes increasingly real for them. Someone with less disregard for the “Hollywood Convention” of traditional narrative could have created a great movie with this idea. This film, of course, is not so! Dolls do everything they can to give consistency to these characters, but they are too often defeated by a bewildered and confused script. In particular, I am increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays a living corpse. In a number of Muppets, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
