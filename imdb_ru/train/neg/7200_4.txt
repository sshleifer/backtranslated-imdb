I really wanted this movie to be liked - the location shots were mostly taken in Pittsburgh, and there was a great photo in the trailer. But even for the filmed cartoon, it was a really poorly made film. Continuity and pace were just awful. The best bits in the film are under the final credits, so itâ€™s (almost) worth putting it to the end (although, oddly enough, it does gain a little in the last half hour or so). <br /> <br /> When the best performance in the film is Andy Dick, you know that there must be a problem ...
