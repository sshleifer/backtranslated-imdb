This film was a critical and box office failure in 1957. It was based on a novel that was later turned into a play - which failed on Broadway. The story of some navy officers who were on vacation in San Francisco during World War II. They have a 4-day vacation they spend at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The film is a lot of sinuous, and none of the characters does not look very real. Cary Grant is great at all in comedy and drama - but here he plays a sort of dealer for Wheeler, and he really can't handle it. Tony Curtis or James Garner would be the best choice. Audrey Hepburn was originally going to play with Grant, but she had other commitments - so Susie Parker intervened. She had never acted before, but at that time was the main photographic model of America. I think she did a good job, given all the pressure she felt. Mating Grant with Jane Mansfield in a few short scenes didnâ€™t really work. The studio tried to give it some class, acting with Grant, but the character had no meaning.
