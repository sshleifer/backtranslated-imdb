Generally overpriced film, which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialogue and, of course, the songs of Dean Martin. The problem is in Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher, and they are the main love story. Cher almost makes up for this with her reaction to Cage's changeable accent and uncontrollable body language. Cage simply never accepts his role. He tries his best to come up with an actor, not a real person, and this is what is needed in a love story. Cage had the same performance problems in other roles that require more character like Jimmy Stewart. Cage continues to take on these roles, perhaps because he likes such films, but his actorâ€™s own energy does not give in to them, although he has become better at this through repeated attempts. He has to leave this type of roles to less interesting actors who fully devote themselves to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent on more non-standard roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting me.
