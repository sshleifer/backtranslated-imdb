I could name a lot of funny movies. There are comedies that make funny, and there are. Some films, such as Gymkata, for example, try to be serious, but ultimately ridiculous. "The ladies' man" is a film that desperately tries to be funny, but could not be less ridiculous if he were talking about a guy who has many chicks in the midst of fragments of a nuclear disaster. This is anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I laughed harder than laughing at anything in this film. It's just not funny. This is boring, stupid, senseless, annoying, dizzyingly bad, but not funny. I don’t really care about Tim Meadows or this SNL character, but I expected better than that. <br /> <br /> The film lacks logic or common sense. As if the writer had a bag on his head when he typed, and he could not see which keys he was pressing. They talk about the "origin" of the Lady, but do not include the motivation of his bizarre passion for acting, as if it were still seventies. The film tries to get the humor out of a man who seems to be pleasing porn porn, soon after he tried to hang himself. This is a comedy? I like to think that I have a rather keen sense of humor (I spend a lot of time writing comedies, like me), but maybe I’m just not talented enough for this film. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans is as funny as Tucker in the movie “There's Something About Mary”, it's terribly bad here. I begged him to shut up in my head. <br /> <br /> By the end I was banging on the chair, mumbling to myself, and if the film continued, I probably would have tried to commit suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but this is the first movie I saw that is very close. <br /> <br />
