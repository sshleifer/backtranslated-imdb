Bernard Rupp passed away last year and was a very cultural journalist. Cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a huge global dictionary of films), and therefore he had to own a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left collected warm reviews: “Tiré à Part” (1996), despite the sensational performance of Terence Stamp, was very caricature of the characters, “une Affaire De Goût” (2000) was tricky, even if Bernard Giraud delivered a perverted performance, “Paz Si Grav” (2003) was another disappointment, and “Una Petit Chu Sanz Sequence” was just as overwhelming as its predecessors. His comic potential is used unconvincingly. <br /> <br /> And yet, the original idea makes it possible to predict a revolving spiritual comedy. The married couple Ivan Attal and Sandrine Cyberlane, who invited their friends, completely moves to a luxurious mansion. To play with their guests, they pretend to part with each other. And everything goes wrong, as planned, because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. Two lovers begin to think about the reality of their couple. <br /> <br /> Despite the lush scenery and promising material that he possessed, Rapp's extraordinary direction cannot revive this game with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well thought out pattern with characters that have certain well-known functions and masks that reveal who they really are. Verbal or situational comic effects are often inconclusive. Bad editing slightly obscures the film with this bad habit of Rapp to sharply cut many episodes. Even the sincere contribution of the actors to the enterprise is controversial. It seems they are bored and read their texts than live by them, especially Sandrine Cyberlein. The viewers are soon in a deep stupor. <br /> <br /> It is regrettable to say that Bernard Rapp’s films never corresponded to his intentions, as evidenced by the “Un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence”.
