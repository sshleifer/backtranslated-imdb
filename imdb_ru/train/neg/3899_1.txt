Where do I begin? By the name of this film, I expected a certain degree of certainty, in the end I was let down several times. This is not the story of Leila Andersen or the song of Lily Marlene, rather it is the story of Hollywood (or choose your film production center) based on real characters. I should have had an idea when I heard a strong English accent giving an introduction to the film in German; the blood red text (title, performers) was to be the second key. The storyline was invented (Leil was not deceived from Switzerland by Rolf Lieberman's parents, there is no information that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews out of Germany, the original song was recorded outside the control of the regime of the National Assembly, but not under control, the recording was played at the station, which was taken in Vienna, when the lieutenant was there on vacation, etc., etc.) The costumes are bad and wrong for the timeframe (the black SS uniform was used everywhere, from border guards to full-time positions, they left daily use as soon as war, and so on. d.), the characters are stereotypes (SA thugs in the club, they were essentially out of power). Do not waste your time.
