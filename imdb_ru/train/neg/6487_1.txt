Well, thank you very much for Disney, for destroying fond memories of my FORMER favorite movie. I was about 5 years old when the original film came out, and it was one of the first films I remember. So, now that I am 16 and I feel quite masochistic, I decided to make this film. In this way, I managed to poison all my memories of the original film with this excuse for the film. This film tells about everything that made the original love attractive, and to the smallest detail. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter Melody and go to show her all in the ocean ... WIDE STYLE! After the musical number ends, the sea witch Morgan appears in a few minutes and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. So he throws it even without a fight. Eric stands staring, although Ariel is figuring out how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never approach the sea until Morgana is caught. <br /> <br /> Well ... nothing really happens. Eric is total. He never manages to do anything. Ariel is doing something. Melody manages to spoil everything. Plus, the animation is a new low level for Disney. Computer graphics faces the background. The only opportunity for character development is missed. The songs bite. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste time. Iâ€™m pretty sure that even these little children will be bored with their skulls, because nothing that even remotely exciting will ever happen. They will not want to sing songs. If you manage to take a copy of it, throw it into the ocean and hope that no one will ever find it. Ever
