For the love of God, please do not watch this movie! This is a waste of time, the plot is predictable, like the romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with very little, this film and its evil predictable villain are just limping. The characters are not developed, and most of the film is supplemented with frames from Rome, which is much more interesting than the movie itself. To top it all, action is a shame. I know that everyone is trying to find their niche, but this is really a disaster. I can not believe that someone actually paid so many millions of pounds to put this film on the screen. Do not waste money or time on this film, see your grandmother or something worthwhile instead.
