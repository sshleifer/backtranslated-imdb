I usually have no problem getting away from a bad movie, however it was a unique case. This film was so bad that I actually spent it all, almost praying that he had a minute of good time to justify the half hour spent. Needless to say, I was severely disappointed. Filmed in a beach house where a group of friends from college is celebrating a vacation, this film suffers from numerous problems that make it not worth watching. First, there are gaping holes in the plot. Secondly, very few of the C-list (I don’t even dare to call them B) can act in vain, so any scenes that may have potential fail miserably. Thirdly, the speed of the film is very changeable and awkward to watch most of the time, which complicates the creation of an unknown building, which leads to very few surprises for the audience. Fourth, and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic, partly because of how it ends (the installation / who the killer is), and partly because the dialogue is simply terrible. To the credit of the film, this is the only film I will ever say, this is the worst film I have ever shot, and I have seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, like a bad joke, you would be happier to never hear, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you will shout no, you really don’t know when running in the opposite direction.
