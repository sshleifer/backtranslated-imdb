I work in the Blockbuster store, and every week we have films that are released in just a few copies, such films show Sci-Fi channels. That film that no one ever wants, and only what idiots shoot when they return it, I ask them: “Was that good?” They say: “No, we turned it off after 15 minutes!” Films with horrible computer-generated, monster-imposed, and so on.) good movie based on Beowulf, then try Beowulf and Grendel with Gerard Butler in the lead role, which will also be shot in the expected 300s as the Sparta King Leonidas. <br /> <br /> In addition, this year we will have another Beowulf film with a star cast from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleason to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But don't let it hope, like we are all with Eragon, or we are all in for another big disappointment. <br /> <br /> But in terms of renting, here is my rule of thumb: if there is only one or two copies, do not rent them out, because this is a bunch of crap. % of time, usually not true if the heading is foreign or documentary.)
