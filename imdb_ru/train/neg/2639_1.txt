Let's start this review first with the fact that I signed up just to write a review and warn people to save their money !! <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst pieces of garbage I have seen since the days of the Hulk. The storyline was the most predictable trash you could come up with. If you are expecting 24, but on the big screen, immediately flush this wait down the toilet, along with the money you would use for the ticket. That way you can have more fun. The action was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic (along with the so-called "turn" at the end. I must say that this ... The ending surprised me. I do not mean the turn of the plot that surprised me, but instead the easy way they connected what can be considered the ONLY scene of some decent action in the entire film. They urgently sent the ending, so I didnâ€™t even realize that it was all over until I saw the captions roll and at that moment I thought about burning the coil with the film if I could just figure out how to get to this room. <br /> <br /> Casting was terrible for several reasons. First of all, they must have accidentally changed the character assignment, because Michael Douglas played the role that CLEAR Sutherland was to play While Douglas sneaked around among agents, tapped phone lines, hacked systems and killed people who were chasing him, Sutherland plays a less capable agent who is always in an advertising mood, even when things are not that bad for him. He plays a very soft agent, nothing like his type of Jack Bauer, in which 24 fans love us. <br /> <br /> I can only promise you that this film will disappoint in all areas. It may be better than a remake of The Runaway / In the Line of Fire, but written by people with intellectual disabilities.
