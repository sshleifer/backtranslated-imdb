I bought this DVD for 1 dollar at Walmart. Seeing this, I could just go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave film 2, not 1, is that there are several innovative elements in the story, although it never rises to the level of interest. This film has all the signs of being made for the driving theater market - an ultra-small budget, amateur action and a liberal dose of sex (for the movie from the early 60s). Actually, Iâ€™m wondering, perhaps, the only reason the film was shot was to make a quick buck and because someone knew some strippers who they could use as add-ons. The film tells about a tramp doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are a stripper or stripper whose only real goal in the film is to chat when they take off most of their clothes. Nevertheless, they do too much to make the film even worth watching for vicious pieces, and the film is not so terrible to deserve to be viewed by bad movie lovers.
