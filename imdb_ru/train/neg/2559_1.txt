Well, this may be the worst movie ever, at least the worst movie I've ever seen. They tried these 666 children of Satan on anti-Christian films about 1000 times, and none of them is good, and perhaps this is the worst of them. They think it will be the best movie because they use this fake blood. This film has no idea, the actors and the shooting are terrible. I can not even make out this 10-line minimum of this film. In fact, there is nothing to say, but it's just terrible. How they can make such films in their right minds simply cannot understand this. This is not a Hollywood movie? Just do not go see how your money is spent more wisely.
