This film is so bad it hurts. The car accelerates to 30 miles per hour, when it should accelerate to 100 ... the gear lever is stuck (in the park!), The nurse, who travels for almost 2 hours with a mobile phone on her shoulder ... canâ€™t take anything from 2 morons damn phone? There is nothing credible about this shit. I would be ashamed to see in such a film!
