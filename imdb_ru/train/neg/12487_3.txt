This film was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I hold the opposite view of critics. This is not the case when the material does not match the level of the actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not up to the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were as big as Davis and Cagney, and see how “One Night” turned out - a classic for all times. With a very similar story, Davis argues that she has no talent for comedy (good for her, that this is almost the only comedy she ever tried!) this happened one night. Cagney, who was a great comedian, just seems out of sync with his partner Davis. The script provides several decent lines and jokes, but the delivery seems better adapted to the drama than to the comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more appropriate for a light drama rather than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, worked more skillfully with very similar material. In a rather typical supporting role, Evgeny Palitra provides a respectable performance. Harry Davenport, a little different in the role of an ancient Western relic, is very good. But in one of his worst speeches, William Frawley is pretty annoying. Permanent links of his character to fictional policemen are a bad attempt at irony. <br /> <br /> I really love each of these artists, and it’s a shame that, as an ensemble, they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
