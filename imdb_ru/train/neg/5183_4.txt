This is the first of this collection of "8 Films To Die For" that I saw, and, of course, I did not want to see anything else ... although I heard that at least some of them are decent. I do not know, it was not terrible, but in fact it meant little to me. Your main dysfunctional family of cannibals in the suburbs, something like mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), Where they continued to bring homeless food sources when possible. The best part of this was the creepy sister Goth, who, of course, invites a friend from school who never leaves. In any case, of course, we have a butcher shop in the basement, and so on and so forth. This family is like the white version of Sawyer’s clan, they are disgusting and do bad deeds, but they don’t compare with the soul. I see a lot of feedback from people who like it, and I think I don’t know what I missed, but I found it very mediocre, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10
