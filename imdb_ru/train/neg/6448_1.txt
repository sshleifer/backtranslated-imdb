Unknown creature is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called "Unknown film." This movie is a piece of shit from the start. This one has a really stupid "conspiracy", a really pitiful "cast" and so-called "special effects". <br /> <br /> For more than thirty years, the “post-teenagers” were trapped in the woods, and the endlessly hidden reptilian creature in rubber suits was hidden around. What you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and priceless action. The girls walk through the forest and talk, and then the guys (with thick mascara) walk through the forest and talk. Everything is so boring! <br /> <br /> The creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the film. When this is shown, the image is distorted to hide the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, hence the reason for the blurring and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> This is the BEST film, not because it is a word, and those who praised it are most likely people who were taken from the street to “play” in this truly stunning film. ! Skip this one for sure!
