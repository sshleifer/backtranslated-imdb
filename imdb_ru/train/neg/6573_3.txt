I read reviews for this, and, not expecting the rescue of private Ryan, I was expecting a film of some substance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very casual attitude toward the usual introduction of the story and how the apparatus appeared. into being. But right away, 1944, and you are not sure where everything is. Accents, etc. Very bad, as it is assumed that this device is Hawaiian / Asian American, but everyone speaks very badly about the Harvard English imitation of Japanese. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 3 out of 10 because after 10 minutes I could no longer watch. The characters were one-dimensional, and, although they were most likely based on real people, I didn’t have feelings for them, and I didn’t care. Very bad direction of a very average television film that will be shown at midnight on some cable channel. I would have avoided and tried my best. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, but it deserves a better story. You feel that the director saw a group of brothers and thought that was enough to sell his film. My advice, avoid and watch a group of brothers, pilots Tuskegee, Glory or any other film, for example, when the pipes disappear ...
