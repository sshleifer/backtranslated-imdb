This film is an idiotic attempt by some kind of action movie. A tour bus heading to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving a dune buggy. They drive them into the wilderness, and then steal all their valuables. The plot is constantly changing. In one minute, they want to kidnap the daughter of a rich herder, and the next - a collection stamp worth $ 90,000. The dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
