I will say one thing about this movie: no lulls. You can't be bored watching this. The problem is that it is too intense. Too much action and SHOULD be put to sleep! This is the risk that you take in modern action movies. You want it to be interesting, but not overdone. This is too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the acting is good and has several “names” in the film Gary Busey and Roy Shader, it still resembles the movie “B”. The best part of this is the Shader dialogue: the only part of “A” in this movie is “B”. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly the Rambo mentality, but there were some outstanding scenes in it. In particular, there was a very innovative scene with mines. It was unforgettable. There are not enough other scenes to make this a keeper for a long time.
