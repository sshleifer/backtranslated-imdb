I think that Jason Lee has great potential, but it was a WRONG car in which one could try to flash like a star. The plot is terrible, terrible comedy. I laughed twice, I think, for relief, because, looking back, they were pretty stupid jokes. I was frightened for the future of Fletch, and I had to console myself with the fact that it was a flaw in the film, and not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are so hot, but I recommend looking at a photo of a photo on this site to figure it out, instead of this movie. Save your time. 1 star
