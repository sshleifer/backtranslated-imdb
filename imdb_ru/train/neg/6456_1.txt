Well, what about this disaster? I watched it because it was broadcast on cable. I regret spending my time, but at least I did not waste money. <br /> <br /> This is the cutest creature you can get! Please, you need to be very generous, so as not to get angry at the CHEAP Halloween costume. Oh, well, there are also shows of terrible action, f / x, and dialogs. Confronting a creature is incredible; you can't get a more pitiful scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst thing you can get from a live video. “Creature Unknown” makes films of the FULL MOON look like “Halloween”. <br /> <br /> Please avoid this at all costs. The only "positive" thing in this garbage is sexy women.
