I sat through this turkey because I had not seen it before, and because the room sounded as if it had potential. It was mildly interesting before the sequence of hurricanes. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to knock windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly level, and not a single sheet moves! In fact, when the characters leave the house, bright sunlight is seen illuminating the tops of the trees. At this point, regardless of what the filmmakers created, they evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film. It is a pity that all hurricanes are not like this, this will certainly help our insurance companies in Sunshine State.
