I thought it was a new york movie: wrong! This is a small British countryside. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! This is a drama ... Well, to the last third, because after the story becomes completely "abracadabrant", a symbolic word for the French presidential mandate. This means that it is almost nonsense, even if the motives would like to cause a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What did I leave? Maybe a good duet of the actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the red-haired police officer is a little invisible to me. High teacher surprises with his blow, and McDowell demonstrates the beautiful game, as usual, everything in a delicate, soft and almost silent attitude. This softness puzzles me, because, like other great artists or directors, the same picture repeats itself again and again. In her case, it looks like whatever the film is, it is always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who lives in endlessly different stories. I still do not know how to set the limit (or merger) between artists and works. <br /> <br /> Another positive side of this film is his feminine touch and interesting different points of view. Every woman has her own way of life, even if they are all alone. It brings a lot of patience and learning to witness how the same unique reality can be perceived by many people as well as people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is enough to watch, but the gorgeous finale removes the desire for the next vision.
