tell me about your spending money ... I just wonder why Michael will act in such a movie turkey ... Michael is a great actor, especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer ... it was wonderful. how does he tape for his son to see it when he grows up .. Michael is such a talented actor .. so what made him do it ??? I watched it and thought it was really stupid ... I think that once in their career they had crappy movies ... especially "Compression", I didn't understand this at all, and I feel that his best performance was in "Pacific Heights", "his character really scared me ... and I really liked" Multiplicity ". That was so much fun! And he was just perfect for the role of" Batman "... and I kind of liked" Night Shift ", and I love "Johnny Danger" too ... it's just too bad that some of them end up making lousy films ... like this one was ...
