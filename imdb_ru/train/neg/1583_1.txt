I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved the Running Man. Obviously, I was very excited that someone made a film about it. And when the local network showed the film, I was in heaven. I was fully prepared for a night of fun! <br /> <br /> The first sign that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had played Arnold Schwarzenegger. I simply could not believe that a person who gained fame through the films in which they shot were shot could play a more cunning role, as described in the book. However, I was still confident that it would be a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, no. Soon I learned that the only reason why he was even filmed was that someone rewrote the whole story in order to MAKE it about fighting shooting. Yes, it was the standard Arnold film: the hero is made incorrectly, the hero solves problems, straining his powerful muscles and scaring everyone away, and the hero gets a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is NOT what the book says. I know that books cannot be literally displayed on the screen, but it did not even have a connection with the book. Stephen King should have openly condemned any affiliation with the film, and he should have banned the use of the name “Running Man” for this shameless waste of the film. I don't say that often, but this film was bad. If I had not watched at home, I would have thrown rotten tomatoes on the screen. Once again: bad. <br /> <br /> (Note that I often used “someone.” I did this because I’m sure many people are embarrassed to work on it, and I don’t want to embarrass them even further by calling them here)
