I just finished watching this movie, and I found that it was just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> I am playing RPG (computer type, not DnD desktop stuff), but I have not found a single joke. in this funny at all. <br /> <br /> Some scenes seemed to be very long (the tilt and scale could be reduced to 5 seconds, and not more than a minute), and it seems that the director was just trying to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I think I laughed only 2-3 times for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game itself was not so bad, around the standard that a class B movie should have. <br /> <br /> I would advise not to worry about this movie if you are not a big fan of DnD and even then it is probably best to avoid it.
