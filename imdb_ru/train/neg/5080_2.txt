This is a review of the Wizard, not to be confused with the Wizard or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a film from the end of the eighties about the ability of a seriously silent boy to play video games and walk throughout the entire initial caption. The Wiz is an unnecessary update to The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is the guy who put 100 straws together, and he had some kind of child who drank the smell. <br /> <br /> Now that we've got it all out of the way, let me say this: there is no reason to watch this movie. This is just a 100-minute Nintendo TV commercial designed to benefit from Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word “intended” in the simplest sense of the word, because it seems that this film was written on weekends a great team of people who have never played Nintendo, and led a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Perhaps if the writer and the director sat down and played some games together, they would understand that they are going to take off the full trash, and instead go to a vocational school to learn how to install car stereos. <br /> <br /> I hope this was a rewarding experience for you. This is definitely not for me. In fact, I think I could lose a few conclusions when watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you find yourself in the video store and see that the Wizard, Wizard and Wizard of Oz are sitting there on a shelf in a rather small row, let them all get bored and play Duck Hunt instead.
