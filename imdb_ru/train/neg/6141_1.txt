One evening, I waited for my friends to return to the apartment, and Gimkata was in place; I watched too much of it. It's really fun and awful, really. Think of it this way: if you had an idea for something so bad at your job, and you continued to do it as badly as this, how long would you last? Not as long as this movie. This is a must see, obviously.
