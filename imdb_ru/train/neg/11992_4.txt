I have never read Gari Paulsen's novel "Ax", for which "Creek in the Wild" is an adaptation, so I can not compare this book. I will say, however, that as a film in itself, with or without adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that does not give a serious explanation to its few characters. <br /> <br /> Think of a "cry in the wild." “As a less luxurious teenager mountaineer (was Quincy, California, the only place where it was shot?), The version of“ Outlaw. ” Jared Rushton - 13-year-old Brian Robson, a boy flying a small plane to visit his father, before the ship crashed over some deserted mountainous terrain, leaving the child aground for a while and forced to defend. <Br /> <br /> The film consists of three parts. Obvious is a ten to fifteen minute representation of the characters, namely Brian and his mom. <br /> <br /> The next third of the film (which actually absorbs almost the entire film) is Brian’s “Rough” film. In these scenes, there is nothing particularly surprising, nothing special, apart from the many beautiful cinematographic shots of the beautiful Yukon landscape. Nothing that could excite you, no real meetings (except lively confrontation with the calf) and no serious dilemmas to initiate some kind of pleasure or connection with the character on the screen. You may even be a little bored over time, when we see Brian, who first deals with his situation, using primitive means, and then more advanced (using tools, etc.) to survive. This is more like the usual time that passes, if you are actually stuck in a situation, and this is largely about it. In other words, they do not attach any meaning to the words of Paulsen when they translate them into visual media. <br /> <br /> And of course, the third part of the film is his salvation. <br /> <br /> However, there is a plot that constantly seeks to assert itself during this time. Some conflict between Brian and his parents, which created a rocky, awkward relationship between them. However, for the most part, this is explained only in brief, intermittent, minimal conversational memories that look more like the background of a music video. At any moment, the singer from the Jefferson Starship should start singing "Sarah". Apart from the fact that the viewer can learn from the consequences or guess his own need to fill in the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped story, which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection with the characters, whether Adventures of Brian in the third part of the film. These are flaws in the narration, which makes the viewer fall into a stupor when he tries to find out what the hell these people are doing on the screen and, for me, almost shouting on television to such an extent, say something and tell me more! <br /> <br /> This, of course, was not a good adventure tale for me. But for Jared Rushton fans, this was one of the last few films he shot. So watch out for nostalgia, if not for anything.
