I don't particularly like redoing or stealing modern Jargon “retellings,” but this film really annoyed me. The original prom, though not by my humble assessment as a masterpiece, still realized that it was ... horror. There are a few simple things to remember when creating a horror movie. Suspension is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry, guys, but on a white film was not like this! The panic was cheap and foreshadowed terribly. (A good example of the panic that was made to cliché too much now is that the cat jumps out of the closet, and soon after this there was an unexpected demonstration of the villain from the movie). This film could not successfully deal with it, since I could expect it to fulfill any of the other horror movie conventions. There must be a cute hero or heroine. This film does not have it. The man I most identified was the main detective. His calm demeanor, but a balanced approach to the killer escape, was what other films of this kind were supposed to have. A sensible approach to current events. (If you run away from an ax holding a psycho, you turn and run in the opposite direction. Do not jog, looking around for every three seconds, watching the progress of the killer, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If your friend disappears, you will not look for them alone. And if you suspect dishonest play, you tell someone, and do not investigate yourself. These clichés are tired and beat well. In the horror genre in general and in this film in particular.
