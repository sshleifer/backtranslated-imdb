The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Canefsky, finally makes a film that does not go directly to the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily from everything that came before it, from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable ... hardly. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is thin, and the actors could not get out of the grocery bag. Put it all together and you have the pulp for the movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is very similar to this. Chew it for 90 minutes and you will have a strange taste in your mouth and lack of nutritional value.
