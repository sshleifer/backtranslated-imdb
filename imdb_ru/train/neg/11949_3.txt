This stupid comedy really spends comedy talents. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are poorly used here. I might laugh once or twice during this movie, but overall, this is a boring movie, with a bit of nonsense added for good measure. The package, although it was a routine, was still quite good, but as soon as the plot was filmed, the film did not go anywhere. Do not waste your time with this misfire.
