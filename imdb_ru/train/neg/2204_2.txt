I love sharks. And mutants. And the explosions. Theoretically, bearing in mind these parameters, HAMMERHEAD: “The Shark of Madness” was supposed to be the best film in history. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The monster is like a villain from the Power Rangers, and has about the same range of rubber movements. It can be good if manufacturers are not as proud of their design as it seems. That is, for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action / fantasy / horror who can benefit from some kind of riddle, the shark gets a lot of screen time. Of course, it is usually shaky and unstable. I guess you have to assume that it is so scary that even the guy with the camera goes crazy. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to the person who is going to eat, the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to the person who is about to be eaten, only now they are screaming and unarmed. And so on. <br /> <br /> The costume is bad, the game is bad, the special effects are not correct, but the writing is the worst. Things happen quite by accident, so more people can be eaten, or something can explode. Because “LET ME TELL YOU”, the people who made this film definitely went with a lot of explosions = better thinking. Characters shoot at cars and a massive explosion occurs. They take off the helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, stones, trees, whatever, all of them explode, so much so that the nasty shark even explodes at the end. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, I don’t care how crazy a person I’m found Shark babies are a good idea. That is, IF this person is not a mad scientist in this film. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that the film is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its badness is actually not enough to keep a person’s long-term interest. It may be good for MST3K with your friends, but if you happen to catch this bad guy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
