METAMORPHOSIS I make my way through the collection of Chilling Classics 50 films, and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of the “Vampire of the Atomic Epoch”, in which a scientist also participated, striving for similar results. Established in our time, METAMORPHSIS is not my horror movie. <br /> <br /> A university researcher is working to crack the human genome to create a serum that will prevent aging. The administration is putting pressure to publish its documents; and, having obtained some results (or risking losing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first, thinking that he had no side effects, he eventually discovers that the serum has really changed him in unexpected ways! <br /> <br /> acting stilt; and the performances have caused me much less interest in the film. The score indulges. And the science behind the experiments and their results is not only wrong; it is absurd; is it ridiculous ?? best case scenario. <br /> <br /> As already noted, the end turns into a 30-minute gag that seems endless. Without giving away too much, I would call it this way: “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the creature from the Black Lagoon and meet at home alone.”
