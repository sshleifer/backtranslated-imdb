When I finally had the opportunity to watch “Zombies 3” (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on a Japanese DVD “Region 2”, I was amazed at how fascinating this zombie epic was. The transfer is almost flawless, as good as ever. I will watch, unless Anchor Bay masters it. The blood really stands out, as it should be, and you can truly appreciate the excellent makeup and blood. The sound is also awesome. This is only 2-channel Dolby, but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2 you can truly appreciate the crappy music (actually a very good result) and effective, albeit cheap, sound effects. It never sounded so good, and a great show enhances the overall enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I never understood how much blood flows in this film, it is extremely cruel with exploding headshots, exploding mega-pimples filled with pussy, a zombie throat divider, burned limbs of a woman (how is it that the guy also did not burn)), intestinal chewing, children of zombies and much more I lost track. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt, for hardcore fans of Zombie fighters, especially Italian. There are some great scenes and cinematographic works, I think that people don’t find it popular enough if you see a clean print and not some horrible pirated copy, it’s a completely different experience. <br /> <br /> This film never gives up for a second, and I understand that it is inconsistent in plot, rewriting is terrible, the action is tough, and the feeling of disrespect is glorified grandly, but this is part of its charm. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best horror movies you have ever done, you can't do. Shoot this bad, so good, on purpose. This is a random genius of the highest order. If they played it for a laugh, it would be a disaster, but they played it just like an arrow, and the result was an amazing cult classic that is fussing to wear by any and all traditional filmmaking standards. <br /> <br /> Lots of action movies, exotic locations, great scenery design, good, sometimes great in cinema, surprisingly stupid acting and inconsistent, but still interesting storyline, great makeup effects, beautiful women who can kick ass, great music, and sometimes fun, sometimes creepy, but always entertaining zombies. there is everything, a cult classic that stands the test of time.
