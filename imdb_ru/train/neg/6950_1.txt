We all knew that even before the airing of the mini-series Ron Moore - not Battlestar Galactica. Everything is good. It simply means that it must stand on its own. It cannot rely on Battlestar Galactica. If it is good, then it is good in itself, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the reports are correct, this is what Moore wanted. However, if his mini-series is rotting, he has disgraced all the excellent actors who performed on the screen, not to mention countless shots behind the scenes. And this is what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series is not a replica. I would not even call it rethinking. This new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not occur in the universe of the Galaxy, with the same places and jargon and technology. This does not mean searching for the Galaxy of the thirteenth tribe. It also does not rely on the legends and riddles that underlay the galaxy. Ron Moore mini-series is a space opera, an action movie with a ceremonial nod Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say, “just another” space opera, an action movie. Because in the course of the plot he has little original or even interesting. I could pass all this without warning spoiler. But I will not cause you this. I just hit the most important point. Ready now? Here it is: just watch the trailer. He will tell you all that is in history. <br /> <br /> Yes, the creations of man give birth to man and seek to destroy man. (I guess they forgot the rules of Azimov again.) They are like humans, so there are all aliens among us. At least there is no time travel. Oh, and lots of fight scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore really removed this ceremonial nod from the Galaxy, he sounded more trivial than respectful. I mean, couldn't he come up with something of his own? <br /> <br /> From the first few minutes I wanted to see something else. I didn’t care about any of Moore’s characters, as I couldn’t identify with any of them. This fact hit me in the face when the Cylons launched their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I do not care. How depressing. <br /> <br /> Moore's characters face an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, rather tucking their tails and saving their own asses. In the end, it was the only way to save humanity, the yadda yadda yadda. They chose a safe path, instead of risking their own lives to protect others. At least disgust is not apathy. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Ron Moore mini-series was just an activity without a goal, a film on a treadmill, always running, but not going anywhere. And I just wanted it to end. And by the time it ended, my life force was sucked out of me. Against my will, I turned into a thoughtless, soulless zombie, probably of the kind that this mini-series would suit. I needed to replenish myself. I had to - and I swear that it was true - I needed to watch the episode with Babylon 5. In fact, two episodes, and I felt much better. And happier.
