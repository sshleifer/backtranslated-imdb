Completely pompous nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring, and most of the cast would not even have appeared in Allen's earlier films. And the need to listen to unfriendly Will Ferrell, who does his imitation of Woody Allen, makes me hate second-rate (albeit mysteriously popular) Ferrell even more. It seems that the gloomy 70-year-old Allen should have knocked down work when the clock rang in the new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to participate in the film, but it was just impossible; my snaps could not shoot so slowly. So, instead of falling asleep and killing noon while sleeping upright, I got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater, and went out to the car, where I had to reread a really good book (George Bailey's wonderful tommy from 30 years ago was "Germans". ) In the end, the day turned out pretty good, not thanks to Woody.
