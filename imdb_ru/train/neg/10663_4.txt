The film was not a waste, except for some boring scenes in between. But the actors played a pretty good show than the men, who were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen is really excited about the movie. Her voice was so seductive and sexy. The scenes in bed with the participation of Krista should have been reduced, but she made him so watchable and sexy like no other. Krista is actually one of the best in such roles. She also played the role of a villain well in the last 5 minutes, which is an interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds was not so good, and it wasnâ€™t the best as a star action movie. He could have chosen a better script than this. I really think he did it for the money.
