As a former resident of Kalamazoo with a love for the city, I was looking forward to the opportunity to see this film. But what a disappointment! Although the acting and production values ​​are not bad, the script is horrible, the plot is unrealistic, and the topic is alarming. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​this film is “Women are nothing without husbands and children. I can hardly believe how regressive this view of women is. The writer lived under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I liked to see my favorite city on the big screen, I wouldn’t offer this movie to anyone. It's horrible. This is an embarrassment for the city in whose honor it is named.
