I was so concerned about the real shots at the beginning of the film that I felt nauseous in my stomach and ended up turning off the film. How anyone can give this film more than a score of 1 confuses me. I know that the purpose of the film is to shake, but to show real shots with a dog that has a live skin (restraining vomiting when I type) - ATTENTION! I turned it off after a scene with a decaying baby. Up to this point, my eyes were closed most of the time. Unsurprisingly, this film was found in a trash can in the HMV. I really have no desire to see any other film of this man Uwe. Anyone who enjoyed it needs therapy. Period.
