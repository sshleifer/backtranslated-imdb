This film is the work of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. Despite the fact that he has several problems, like any low-budget production, this is a good start for Miss Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not so new, because it was filmed in films like The Burning and every Friday, the 13th, starting with the second part. But the performances are very soulful. In many films with a big budget, the actors go through the movements, and it's always nice to see the actors really trying to hone their skills. <br /> <br /> This story tells about the murder (and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. Others swear secrecy, but the trauma of this event directs each person in different directions of life. Ten years later, a terrible persecutor known as "Bagman" kills friends one after another. Who will survive? You have to watch. <br /> <br /> If you're Roger Ebert or some arrogant critics, you probably shouldn't worry. But if you like Joe Bob Briggs more, and you want to see a group of people honing their skills, then check out The Bagman.
