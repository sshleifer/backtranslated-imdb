Dragon Fighter is the first sci-fi channel (although I think it is now called Syfy?), The original film I've ever seen. But since then I have seen one or two others, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but this one really scratches the bottom of the barrel. CGI is bad, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the very end is unexpected and inappropriate (if you saw the Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean; put a spoiler in my review). Plus, there was one musical melody that was used in almost all dangerous episodes. It was really stupid; they just played it over and over. And it is definitely not original; I know that I've heard it somewhere before (I just can't remember where). This is one to avoid.
