Worst movie ever !!!! I can't believe that I spent 90 minutes of my life watching this shit. The only reason I didn't turn it off was because I wanted to see the Gangster dude on the cover, and he didn't even talk about false advertising. The people who gave this movie ten are either stupid, stupid or CAST MEMBERS, or friends of CAST MEMBERS. <br /> <br /> I gave him a solid 2, because no one else did <br /> <br /> I need to write more, but I donâ€™t even want to. spend time talking about this garbage. Please do not watch it, and if you did, then vote so that this film can go where it is. bottom 100 movies. I can't even tell you how bad it really is. Think of the worst movie you have ever seen, ten times, and this is a movie. It sucks !! If you just think I'm bitter, then look, I dare Thee! This film should be used to torture war criminals or Terriosts. If they watch it at least twice, and they will spill the beans and ask for mercy !!
