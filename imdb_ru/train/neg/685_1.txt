My wife and I thought that with this actor and director the film was at least worth seeing. We were wrong. In fact, we abandoned it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young, and Tone are British, but speaking with an American accent, was impossible for me, but it's hard to believe that this is England when nobody speaks with a British accent. There is no chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and, repeating the previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for each other for no reason is ridiculous. There is no reason to take care of any characters, so we threw the towel halfway through. It was hard for me to believe that Hawkes was in charge of this, since none of the actors spoke with the Hawksian rat-a-tat trademark. So save your time and miss it.
