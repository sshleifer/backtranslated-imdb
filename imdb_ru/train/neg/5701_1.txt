And so the great rewriting of history continues in the Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> It was pointless ridiculous trash. <br /> <br /> It shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent on producing what is the most contrived, poorly played, inaccurate film I've ever seen. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> Nick Cageâ€™s short flirting with a serious game seems to have ended. I can only assume that Departure from Las Vegas was a mistake in a number of horrible films. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger argues that her performance in Troy was not an accident, she really cannot play. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of working on such a prank. <br /> <br /> Recommended only to those who are recovering from a recent lobotomy or to people who believe that America has invented peace.
