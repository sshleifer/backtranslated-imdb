This film is one of the worst comedy films I've ever seen. I hate the looting of Napoleon Dynamite. Just face it, folks, stupid humor has already been mastered. Do something new at a time. All these new comedies are just awful. And the exit from SNL Andy Samberg is not yet ready for the main role. I hope he can bounce back from this horrible movie. And the character of Will Arnetz is just bad. Hey, Will, did you read the script? The plot is really the worst ever written. Now tell me if this is weird. (this is a film) Stepfather Frank's native Kimble dies, and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod is planning this huge leap to raise money for Frank. Only so that Rod could defeat Frank in battle and prove his masculinity. Yes, this movie, you say, will you spend $ 7.00 to see this piece of shit! <br /> <br /> 3/10, just awful <br /> <br /> to adams
