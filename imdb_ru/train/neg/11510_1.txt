It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me see him. <br /> <br /> Nothing positive can be said about this movie. For years, the idea existed that Madonna could act, but she could not. For years, the idea was that Guy Ritchie was a great director, but he was only mediocre. Embarrassment on all sides. <br /> <br />
