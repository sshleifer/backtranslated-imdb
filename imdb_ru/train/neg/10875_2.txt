Saw this “movie” recently and have to say that it was the worst attempt to make a movie I have ever experienced. What the hell is going on with Culio? Completely unprovoked shooting at people in distress. Absolutely unappealing, slow, tedious and detached. Worse than Spawn. Long live the "Evil Dead II."
