As with all cult TV shows, there is a group of people who love the Twilight Zone so much that they rate almost every episode as if they were the greatest show ever. Although some of them are really great classics, true for every great episode, some were mediocre and at least one smelled. However, like die-hard Trekki, these Zone lovers insist that they are all gold. In fact, this is what initially made me revisit some of the individual episodes of the cult series for a couple instead of the films that I usually watch. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the worst episode ever created and is very bad, it is bad by any reasonable standard. A widow watches as a long procession of civil war soldiers passes by her house. In the end, there is a very unexpected turn, and there is not much excitement or expectation.
