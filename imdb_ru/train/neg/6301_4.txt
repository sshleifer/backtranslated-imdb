Despite the flawless work of auxiliary actors and the clever script of Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character / actor. One of the characters describes Richard Grant’s character as “nagging a little poop,” and unfortunately it sums it up perfectly. There is nothing in his or his performance that could convince him that his girlfriend and the publisher / friend of the upper class would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and completely annoying. In this role, an actor was needed who could make you love him, even when he plays, —Evan MacGregor, for example. <br /> <br /> All the witty satire in the class system, etc. Was wasted thanks to this annoying and completely incredible presentation. All I wanted to do was shake him up and tell him to commit suicide.
