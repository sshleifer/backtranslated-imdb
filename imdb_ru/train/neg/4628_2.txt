Misty Ayers had a smoking body, and that's all this movie was about. Clean operational click. I started playing the game with myself, counting how many times they looped the usual orchestral music. And, of course, the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Illustrative example: accidentally entered the room and said “Hello”, he was crammed with chases from the Roman epic. I would like to know why this film has been on the shelf for 11 years before it is released. What I learned from this movie: that women's low-rise panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the original panties from the movie "Alien". At least 20 of the first 30 minutes, Misty slowly removes and puts on her clothes (unfortunately, except for the bra and panties). Also includes a terrible dubbing leading to "Beware! Godzirra!" Effect.
