Rarely do I feel the need to write a review of this site, but this film is very noteworthy because of how poorly it was created and how its product was biased. <br /> <br /> I felt a clear attempt to play the role of filmmakers, demonstrating the Palestinian family as boorish and unreliable. We hear them discussing the sadness they experience from oppression, but the film is made and arranged so that we believe that the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that would correspond to the position of the Palestinian teenager. We hear only from other Palestinians in prison. I understand that restrictions exist, but the political nature of restrictions is intended to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I came out of the film, feeling that the victim's mother was selfish in her mourning and was completely closed. because of her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to not want to see the pain of the bomber's parents, and her angry and unbiased words made the last meeting go out of control. In my opinion, it is more realistic to see Israeli thinking as the root of the problem; ignored requests for understanding and freedom; ignored requests for recognition of the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land. <br /> <br /> I gave him two because of these mother's selfish weaknesses, which would normally be delightful in a documentary, but in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. In addition, due to poor edits, lack of knowledge in the real situation and, finally, the lack of adequate representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, this is a bad documentary and a bad movie. I recognize that this is partly a result of the political situation, but I have to point out flaws in the direction regardless of the heartbreaking and sad themes.
