In the movie "Behind the Scene," the director says he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the film to Dario Argento, as well as to other famous directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. In fact, to dedicate this film to these great directors is the same as giving your mother a piece of the Day for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. FAVORITE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACT. In addition, do not throw a person who is 40 years old, to the role of misunderstood 18 year old hermit. That's right, he was in high school for 22 years. The reaction of people watching their boys tear out their hearts is fun. Or, for example, one part is when a guy is stabbed in the ear with a corncob (haha, understand that), and his girlfriend just says: “Oh my God ... Lord?” The scarecrow itself is quite a character. Do flips from cars and call people losers. <br /> <br /> The film does have one ransom factor ... oh wait, no, it's not. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely MUST see this movie, than just watch a rock and roll trailer on DVD. It covers everything and has a really awful dude song.
