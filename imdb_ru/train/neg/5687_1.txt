Although this is not as bad as his adaptation of the game to the film, this piece is not very good. <br /> <br /> Ball seems to have a pathological inability to admit that he is not making good films. One of these days he will run out of money and he will stop bombing the world. <br /> <br /> The action was not at the proper level, the dialogue sounded as if they were reading TelePrompTers and Boll's special little “touches”. were visible everywhere. <br /> <br /> As with all Uwe Boll films, this just shouldn’t be. <br /> <br /> Simple and clear. <br /> <br /> Just like Uwe Boll himself should not exist. > _>
