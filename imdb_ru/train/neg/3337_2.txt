Discarding the many positive comments that obviously come from friends and / or relatives who cross this and many other low-budget independent companies listed in IMDb, one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate indicator. So in the end you have to go out and rent a movie to be sure. One of the first things you need to understand is flashy phrases that mask the reality of the film. In this case, the term "dark psychological thriller." Read: â€œHack a writer / director who considers himself an author, who replaces the plot, story and action with what he believes is a deep understanding of the human soul. His great understanding? Purulent and suppressed childhood traumas appear to destroy chaos when we become adults. Wow, I bet Freud would really be impressed! Too many filmmakers such as Kallio, who grew up on low-budget horror films of the past few decades, could not dig their fresh grave. Instead, they fall into the pre-dug graves of many other directors before them. They are happy with the rehash of old and tired horror cliches that they borrow from a dozen or more films. The result is a non-original, not inspired, incredible waste of film.
