Before I continue, I must confess that I am a big fan of Bon Jovi. In fact, this is exactly what attracted me to the DVD case. I probably would have bought it anyway, being such a big fan of horror and enjoying the first name of vampires. <br /> <br /> But this is not so good. Even John could not save this film for me. My main problem is that it's just not scary. Besides the character John Derek Bliss, none of the other characters make any impression, and you don’t care if they die or not, especially the annoying vampire woman / drug addict. A female vampire is just not scary and not sexy. Rather, she looks like an anorexia of a 14-year-old girl, it's no wonder that she so desperately needs blood. Another huge problem is that everything is just "too bright." There is no atmosphere or feeling of fear. I know that the first vampires set in New Mexico were not exactly a twilight zone in terms of eeriness, but they were still gloomy and grim when it was necessary. There is no such tension in this film. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. The vampire wants Berzier’s cross to walk in daylight. However, this time there are less steep bits in history. No wonder that this is the master of all masters - the original vampire, as in the first film. You really don't care who or what it is. No army masters. Instead, she hides in some old ruins that look more like the Disneyland attraction than the eerie temple. <br /> <br /> So you really have it. No panic, no atmosphere, no interesting story. Really let down for me personally.
