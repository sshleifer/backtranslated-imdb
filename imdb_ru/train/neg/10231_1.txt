Honestly, I am very excited that, based on the dazzling reviews attributed to Stephen Smith, I spent almost two hours on his debut offer. Were they all written by his friends? The action is delayed, the music is annoying and too much used, the script is simply terrible, and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) are mediocre at best. I really think that we should support the efforts of a young director, but to say that this is great when it is not necessary to only encourage him to repeat the same mistakes, that is, to continue writing his scripts and using the same actors for another enterprise. Yes, this is his first film, low-budget, etc. - I understood, but it is also available for the general public to buy, and this is simply not from scratch.
