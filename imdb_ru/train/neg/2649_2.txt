My wife and I started watching this movie with impatience. It looked warm and touching. It started off well; but soon became dull and frankly idiotic after a while. It became so bad that we turned it off. The film was bad and honest, we could not really understand or wanted to understand what it was, why and how the hell they could put up with this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acted while singing and retreating. I would do it. And, of course, like most T.V movies and TV shows made in Hollywood, we have to give him the character of the “fun” character! This film was boring. I expected more from Diane Keaton!
