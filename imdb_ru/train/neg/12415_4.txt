I do not remember that “Barnaby Jones” was nothing more than a boring, standard detective show in which, like in any Quinn Martin show, act I was murder, act II - the main character finding out the murder, act III was a plot twist ( another character killed), Act IV was a resolution, and Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether), asking her father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he found out the crime, and then someone said something witty at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember was the excellent song of the late, great composer Jerry Goldsmith. Oddly enough, the initial credit sequence made me want to run a show for seven seasons when the show was on the air. I also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role different from Jed Clampett, even though Ebsen was greatly mistaken. I just wanted the show to be more exciting than when I first remembered it. <br /> <br /> Update (01/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their Archive of American Television channel. Let's just say that I was more kind than Goldsmith about the Barnaby Jones show.
