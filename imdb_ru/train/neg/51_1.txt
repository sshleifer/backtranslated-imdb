This film was a major disappointment. the level of merciless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were really ugly and vicious. the main characters were impossible to identify or even sympathize with. the character of the main character was as slippery as they come. the atmosphere of the hospital / greenhouse building gave itself to theatrical performances. Little or nothing can be learned about the Spanish Civil War from this film. Fortunately, I was in Spain and realized that this is unreal! In addition, using same-sex attraction as an ominous "horror" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. The actors seemed inconvenient in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I think if you enjoy watching children and pets being brutally murdered, you may especially like this movie.
