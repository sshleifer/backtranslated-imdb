This is a bad B movie disguised as a gun. Porn documentary filmmaker has almost as much screen time and dialogue as any other character. This completely destroyed any “documentary feelings” that they might have wanted to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film is not really imaginary is the least of his problems. The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film has nothing insightful to say about the porn business. It is not even particularly obscene. While the floor is modeled there, the amount of nudity is soft for a nominal R. film. <br /> <br /> Someday someone will make a good pseudo documentary about the porn industry. This is not true.
