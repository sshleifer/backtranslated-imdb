This film was not such a hard task as I expected. In this somewhat idiotic hardcore plot-paranoia-fest UFO there are a few seconds of brilliance. Much of the game is mediocre, but rather typical of 1970s-style things teeming with pregnant pauses. The photographer and model witness strange events in the forest and soon become victims of the same events. Flying saucer spots are disappearing, more and more people are disappearing - but are they aliens or the top-secret group of our own government covering up the guys? Soon, the reporter and the “ULlogist” (apparently following the model of the character of the writer-director) are drawn into this devastating fiasco and become targets for top-secret agents who are as formidable as they are incredible and meaningless. Then the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> The film, as expected, has the same meaning as the usual UFO conspiracy theory, but deserves praise for taking itself so seriously. Working with the camera is fine for a low-budget film, the pace is pretty good, the script is stupid and absurd, and there are problems with continuity that are fun to watch. What a few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I can not tell you much without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the film, at least, is worth rewinding, if you can't take the middle.
