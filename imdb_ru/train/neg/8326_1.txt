This is the funniest and funniest thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> <br /> The plot (which is not enough): Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire with a bad heart, desperately needs a transplant Clay was secretly engaged With his mother, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. That night, when these two were secretly married, it happened that a donor was found with the same rare blood type. Go and find out the odds of that! Once on the operating table, Clay discovers that anesthesia is not working, and he can feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay seems to be able to filter out pain from a razor-sharp scalpel. open his chest, just by concentrating on his memories of Samantha, who, we are told, he does through an annoying voice-over, which, it seems, never stops. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet burst out laughing, you will definitely begin when you see surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How could a young billionaire agree to a heart transplant by one surgeon, one nurse, a doctor and a drunken anesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth broke loose. Not to mention medical behavior, which is too ridiculous to take it seriously ... the operating room is not even sterile ... people can practically just enter and leave the room without even having a bath ... During the operation, the viewer hears Clay's thoughts, or one of which is not too exciting. Ah ... but that's the point ... the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money. Considering that he is unconscious, the villains speak freely. Gosh! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least, no one intervenes in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor, who has four lawsuits about negligence, is undergoing a serious heart operation. It seems that even the super-protected mother Clay cannot verify his status. The only one who is interested in keeping abreast of events is Samantha ... but, oh, no ... maybe, dear Sam will participate in this ... You will quickly learn about it in the Scooby Doo dialogue ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it doesn't even matter if Clay passed through the awareness of anesthesia, because the end would be the same in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to laugh at patients who have become victims of anesthetic awareness, there may be some silly fun that you can get ... <br /> < br /> Enjoy ...
