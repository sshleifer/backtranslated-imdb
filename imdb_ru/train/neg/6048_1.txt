Even more boring, if possible, than the original (I hope I can say this in accordance with the recommendations of IMDb). THE FRENCH CONNECTION, at least, tried to absorb European influence, complicate the generally accepted point of view of the American police detective, even if the attempt was based on Friedkin's ambivalence, Americanization and general indirection. The (relative) art boom of the 1960s (especially with the new vague) made it possible to get a huge influence from European cinema in Hollywood. This has given a new strength and complexity to a weary environment, and in the best of them (for example, BONNIE AND CLYDE, early Scorcese), to a new undermining of the received practice. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its hard-to-distance style and anti-detective figure. TWO is the right evidence of old American Hollywood American values. <br /> <br /> This can be seen from a very tedious picture of the film “America against France”. For example, the DVO is removed as a French policeman of the 70s. Of course, the French insisted on the greatness of American films when they were ignored at home, and this, in a sense, is a complaint, a warning against the Gallic presumption. This can be seen in the scheme of two films. At CONNECTION, French gangsters invaded New York, and the French style strangled an American thriller - this leads to the dissolution of the detective figure and the indecisiveness of the plot - the villain escaped. <br /> <br /> TWO returns the American to France, where American thrillers impose a native genre - the power of the detective story is once again confirmed and the traditional resolution is achieved. This is even more dramatized in Doyle's relationship with the French inspector Barthelemy, whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot. <br /> <br /> TWO seems to follow the original, undermining his detective hero. From the very beginning, Doyle’s importance diminishes at every turn. Despite the end of CONNECTION, he is considered a hero. But he is American in a foreign country, and his inability to control language or customs means that he cannot dominate the plot. He even misinterprets the signs of the police, mistakenly takes the informant for a criminal and kills him. <br /> <br /> The detective’s power stems from his ability to perceive and interpret, but Doyle spends most of the film watching, manipulating, the object, the body (literally in the scenes after Charnier resets it) for viewing and interpretation. IN CONNECTION, he provoked the action, chasing criminals, forcing a conspiracy; here he is passive, tied to a bed, locked in a cell, a drug addict, a dependent. <br /> <br /> This loss of phallic power, as expected, is symbolized by the loss of his pistol, and the film pursues a depressingly familiar oedipal trajectory. In episodes with heroin, an old woman comforts him who says she looks like her son. His condition with drugs is similar to returning to the uterus, deprived of adult pressure. Her taking of his watch enhances the timelessness of this state, which is doubly significant for a person whose career depends on schedule and accuracy. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective, and in order to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother who dissolves his single identity and kills his father (Charnier) so that he can accept his accepted male role in society. Psychoanalytic theory was popular among scientists in the 70s (ironically provoked by Frenchman Jacques Lacan), but you rarely see a film literally filled with it. <br /> <br /> If all these facts were aimed at minimizing Doyle, then the style of the film is not. Fridkin distanced us from his hero, refusing sympathy or character motivation, focusing on the mechanics of the plot. Here, Doyle is a very ordinary Hollywood hero. Instead of being lost in a dark long frame, it is made clear and comprehensible to the viewer with the help of traditional devices - pictures from the point of view, close-ups, junction pictures, etc. <br /> <br /> TWO is all about fall and rise of papaya doyle. The plot in this case is subject to the current one, which is the usual Hackman showiness. Scenes of cold turkey, so, despite their tediousness, do not bother. We are allowed to share, not cold to watch; This is a much less unpleasant experience. Scenes are also filmed with tearful male sentimentality, which is very American. <br /> <br /> So, while CONNECTION tried to emulate Jean Pierre Melville’s complex thrillers, TWO does the exact opposite. In LE SAMOURAI, Melville was a gangster who started the film with a whole, powerful, outward language and outlined his possible breakup. TWO begins with a disintegrated character, achieved in part because of inability to language, the dominance of which begins when it goes beyond the language - the final sequence of actions is largely devoid of words. <br /> <br /> In the film, locale and language are important, as they corrected and undermined the detective, but when he regains his strength (appears in the return of the pistol and in the cathartic burning of the primary site, vulnerability, tower block, where it was kept Charnier) , the situation in Marseille is becoming increasingly irrelevant, and the mythical confrontation, which can take place anywhere, takes effect. Compare the ending of two films: one admits ambiguity and despair, the other - absolute certainty. <br /> <br />
