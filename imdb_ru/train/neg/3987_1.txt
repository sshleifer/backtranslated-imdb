I came out of very few films before they run out, but I couldnâ€™t finish this piece of trash. It was the biggest burden of racism, which he tried to present as a legitimate film since "The Birth of a Nation". The characters were slightly larger than the cardboard cutouts. I do not understand how any actor would like his name to be associated with this film. Lee must have better things to get rid of such garbage. I know that with me and with every person with the mind there are more important matters ... for example, to watch how the paint dries. I would like someone to make a film about race relations, which really dealt with this topic. In this matter, there is much more depth than the harsh ranting of such a bitter director as Lee.
