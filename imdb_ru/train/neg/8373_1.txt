I was not impressed with this film, especially because I went to the cinema with my family with a bona fide desire to watch a film with a 12A certificate here in the UK. To my horror, this film was full of awkward sexual jokes. (What is not a problem for me as an adult, but not suitable for viewing with children). This film was at times very rude, sometimes with frightening jokes, getting into the groin, etc., and for the most part the film is not very funny. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is that Calvin Sims, who is a 2-inch dwarf, comes out of prison and steals a giant-sized diamond, but then has to put it in a woman's handbag. Thus, in the rest of the film, he impersonates an abandoned child, getting into this woman's house so that he can return this diamond. <br /> <br /> So far I have enjoyed most of the output from the Wyana Brothers - but this film certainly takes cookies. <br /> <br /> A little useful advice - wait until it appears on the TV or cable.
