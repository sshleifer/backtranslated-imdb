A reviewer from Poland should be a feminist, because she considers Young Catherine to be a great film and historically accurate. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many, many years, I almost at every step objected to YC, and especially with a politically correct image of her as a boss who single-handedly promoted Russia in the direction of domination. True? She was brought to St. Petersburg only to become a wife and mother, and it turned out that she had to “bind” the Nobility, boyars and military, in order to survive. Until she challenged them, she was allowed / allowed to indulge her cultural desires (fill the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that it was not “great,” but in this area of ​​postmodern revisionism, the evidence is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, an excerpt from Ted Turner, who, like Peter the Great in 1986, is another example of how badly Russia is portrayed in the West.
