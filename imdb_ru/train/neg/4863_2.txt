Why not make a blockbuster movie? Everyone in the cinema, young and old, was there to see how the talking animals were joking, and while they were doing this, we were all happy ... And then, like in “The Lost Space,” two murderous blows followed - a conspiracy and feeling. Who really cares what happened to the tiger or did Eddie Murphy make peace with his daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
