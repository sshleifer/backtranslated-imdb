Western society was fueled by the idea that India is a poor country. Such films only reinforce these beliefs. Such illustrations make it more difficult for Indians to take overseas. They agreed that there are poor and homeless people in India, but why there are no educated people, if not successful ones. <br /> <br /> I totally hated the idea of ​​a film depicting Patrick Swayze as another Mother Tressa. In my opinion, this film showed India in a very bad light, giving wrong ideas. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. That is why people ask me: “When we go to India, can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so that we don’t have to go on roads full of mud and snakes?” <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion on contemporary Indian society, should see the "Monsoon Wedding".
