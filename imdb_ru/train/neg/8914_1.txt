I had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious viewers) after twenty minutes, because it was mediocre and boring enough to cause yawns, not to mention that I was soon close to tears because of 3.99 dollars I spent on Blockbuster, Joanna Pakula's game and her horribly pronounced Slavic accent are horrible enough to make a person bite the bullet. I knew that two hours would be two hours more. Both Breuer and Nietzsche play unremarkable actors with a strikingly small number of talents. While we are on the topic of talent, Breuer's haughty assistant seems to have been taken out of the local acting troupe. She obviously did not learn her craft. In fact, it is really terrible. All public scenes looked staged, and the extras went mechanically on their best Sunday. Turning off this movie was much nicer than turning it on. Do not shoot this terrible movie. You will regret spending your money.
