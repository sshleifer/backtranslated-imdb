This film is just a reason for a writer to make a film of two unsuccessful scenarios. <br /> <br /> his characters are simply a collection of characters with tragic or comic cliché attributes, the total amount of which is a neurotic dialogue, such as Woody Allen could write. Women like it because it’s like looking in a mirror so that they like this movie. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like these films because there was no car chase and there were no fights in the film. there were also no drug lords or bandit groups. Not to mention the absence of snakes. There were no snakes in this movie. Not my cup of tea and perhaps not your broadcast, so think about what I said before you realize that you are watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If, of course, you are not like a woman, you have problems with weight, men have problems with sex and a city and an ally MacBill, then it matters to you.
