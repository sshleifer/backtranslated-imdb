True, the situation in Paris is excellent. The actors are fine. This story is a perverted moral game. Does it have to say that if you want someone strong enough, then you can hurt everyone else along the way? In this novel, you want less cliché than a man who became bored with his wife, and who wants to leave his family, and a woman who agrees to do so. So what if they look decent and if Karen Allen shows off her body? Characters are still self-absorbed and reprehensible. Perhaps the moral of this story is “you get what you deserve.” I give it 4, only for a quick scan through the bits of "male interest".
