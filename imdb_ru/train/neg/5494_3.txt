<br /> <br /> This cheap and ugly film doesn’t even seem to entertain children in the audience, with the exception of one rather funny joke on the toilet. Christopher Lloyd is far from his prime and is actually quite tedious in this role, although I’m sorry for the authors' jokes that do not help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateur in a supposedly comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. In fact, there is no reason to make this film, especially since it is inevitable to compare it with the often brilliant improvisations of Robin Williams in Mork and Mindy. <br /> <br />
