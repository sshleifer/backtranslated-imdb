This film is another one in a long line without budget, without efforts, without films about talents, shot on video, and with a nice cover to fool unsuspecting tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what to watch this movie, it’s all the same, take a video camera and red food and make a movie with yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night, growling and “attacking” people. Congratulations, you have just made the Hood of the Living Dead! Now let's see if your distribution company buys from you. <br /> <br /> I saw a small budget shot on videos showing the talents of directors and actors, or at least efforts, but this is not; Avoid if you are not a real masochist or are not surprised by poorly made horror movies.
