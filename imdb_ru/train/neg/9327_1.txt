So far this has been the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I have seen some REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the film. When to start? Filming was scattered and boring. At some point, there is a minute scene when no one talks, but the car just goes to the ranch on a typical sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with an annoying, incredible dialogue and almost no plot. If you rent this movie, watch it with friends, and it can be a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.
