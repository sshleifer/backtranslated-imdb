Given the limitations of this film (the entire film in one production - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors), it should have been made much better. If you have these limitations when making a movie, how can the lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, they talked about the hair below acting in Clerks, except that it was a nice movie, there was no point. Well, he tried, but actually fails. <br /> <br /> He is trying to make self-reference in a couple of parts, but the actors reacted so badly that it was bad. And the main character is Neil the guy, what a pathetic loser. Obviously, only 10 people shot this “film”, and they all knew each other, and maybe it was a real rock band, but unfortunately, these people really do not know how terrible they are around. This was done in 2005, but they all look so naive that it smacks of the pre-grunge era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not pay to see it (Starz on Demand delivers again!), But it was called Obsessed, not Studio 666, it doesn't matter what you do with the name , it can not help. It could have been much better than a movie made - there is no excuse for this bad filmmaking, when you have the obvious limited parameters that the filmmakers had, when they did it, working within these limits, you have to do things that you can control and things you can work with what you can. Instead, they believed that mediocrity would be good enough. And this music video, wow, it was bad, I quickly coped with it. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is honest, if you're passionate about all the shit with a b-movie, I guess you go and see it,
