Wow, this movie was pretty damn awful. So bad in fact, that although I did not pay to see this, I still wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> There is nothing intelligible in the film. This is a mixture of science fiction clichés that were made by much more experienced directors. The performances, especially in the main roles, were excessively less attractive. Speaking of Ed Wood, he would be proud of the character's dialogue. It's just too silent, without a hint of irony or sense of humor. On top of that, it makes no sense, nor does the plot, or the lack thereof. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are fine, but they are not enough to say: “Wow, this is cool” to be “cool” and not a good plot device. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is another confusion that never really creates a mood. Again, it seemed that the director simply adds the songs to the film, trying to “be cool”. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my last point. Perhaps if the director was actually more concerned about the plot, the story and the dialogue, and did not try to be cool, he would not make such a blunt cliche of a short film. <br /> <br />
