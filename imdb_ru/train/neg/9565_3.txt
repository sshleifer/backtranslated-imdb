I can't say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, because there were one or two decent moments in it, but I can easily say that this is the most transparent movie I've ever seen. . Never once did the plot device appear without my guessing for more than 10 minutes. In all that the film did, there was no subtlety, no backstage was generally visible. The intention of every conversation or dialed line was so obvious that it was impossible to “get into” a movie. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the terribly thought-out plot and indiscriminate attempts to return the audience, much more often than I enjoyed the film.
