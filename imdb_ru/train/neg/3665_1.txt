There were too many to mention here, but I must say that the two that struck me were especially joking: the schizophrenic nature of the werewolf character (i.e., moving from a raging beast with a single shot to a stunned, zombie the next state is as if he is on a random midnight walk in the countryside, and in his sports wardrobe is completely different ... and, yes, I knew the reasons for this in advance), as well as the “Phantom of the Opera” look of Wolfstein's character! But what do I know - perhaps the elusive, full-length version of this mess could well have been a bona fide classic of horrors!
