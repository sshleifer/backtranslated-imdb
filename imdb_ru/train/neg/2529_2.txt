Bobby is a dumb kid who smiles too much and wants sex. Therefore, he buys a van to help in this quest. The action is lame, comedy is pathetic, and the script is nothing more than a loosely stretched chain of cliches and cheap thrills. The filmmakers obviously wanted to capture some of the craziness of other films of the time, but were far from being realized. They even resorted to the fact that Bobby slipped on a banana skin, because it supposedly adds comedic value. <br /> <br /> I’m trying hard to find an expiatory feature in the film. If you like DeVito, this is another classic role of DeVito - but he is just an auxiliary actor, and he is valued for his clichés.
