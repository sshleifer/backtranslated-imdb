OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg is standing next to Danny Glover, parodying a picture of a famous farmer and his wife. Then you insert this child into the DVD player, and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. This is supposed to be a comedy. And I have to admit that I laughed about ten minutes before the final. In this film, there are the following elements: a beaten and abused neighbor next door, a boring legal process, racism, talk of lynching, death and arson. Cheerful, huh? No, please, if you never listen to someone else's feedback, do it here. You can't even bring yourself to watch this shit. SHIT! I said it, Slam! Whoever put a name there on it must really sue.
