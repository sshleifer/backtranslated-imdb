I bought this movie on the cheap for sale, having read the back of the DVD case and assuming that in any case I cannot lose, if it was rubbish, then there is no loss, if it was something good, and then to bargain ... < br /> <br /> Then I watched it ... <br /> <br /> I am usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this film he showed a very modest presence on the screen, it seemed that he didn’t do anything, even his death a friend at the very beginning, which causes an “action” in the plot, seems to have very little effect on him, and his possible revenge is simply boring and reckless. <br /> <br /> Usually, a film that has such themes as the Great as a revolution and revenge can capture an audience and make them feel something for the characters, but watching this film was more like a series of confusing and almost random events which are loosely connected to each other for final completion ... <br /> At this moment I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this film was the most terribly painful viewing in my life A scene in which a pilot sacrifices himself, refusing to jump out of a truck loaded with explosives and Because of the reluctance to kill civilians, it is not so much tragically sad, but terribly terrible and painful, although not as bad as emergency surgery on a wounded girl. Acting was bad on all sides, the script and the story were weak, the “action” was even weaker, and the “visual effects” were, but frankly, not so visual. Summing up, we can say that there are good films, bad films, such bad films that are good, terrible films ... <br /> <br /> And at a completely new level - “McBain”
