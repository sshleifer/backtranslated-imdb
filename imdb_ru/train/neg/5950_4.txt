My first question after watching this movie was: “Why the name of LIAM?” If the goal was to tell a story from a boy’s point of view, it was not well done. Of course, in the boy's scenes there was a formal use of camera angles, but much of the decisive action took place outside his field of vision. The presence of a “main” character who is unable to speak (obviously, implies a mute, impotent position of the child) makes it difficult to give this character great depth. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as: “a dramatic or other literary work is characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplified morality and conflict”. LIAM fits this definition to T. The spectators are beaten in the head with typical stereotypes of the Catholic Church of fire and sulfur in a harsh school marma and a well-fed priest clutching money from the parishioners. (The stereotype becomes very tedious.) Moreover, the Jewish characters are lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Most of the film was predictable ... Whoever thought we would see Teresa wiping the toilet after her mother told her: "Not one of my daughter will wipe another woman’s toilet ! ”I am a fan of British realism, if everything is done well. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
