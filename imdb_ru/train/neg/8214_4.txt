This does not quite match the depth of the Creepshow 3, but comes close. He also uses the same technique of using the same actors in different roles throughout the anthology, which distracts, to say the least. <br /> <br /> This is also quite annoying when breaking out of the Twilight zone (when the bookstore is comparable to Serling’s late night gallery). Unfortunately, producers and screenwriters have forgotten that Serling will grow sympathy for his characters before spoiling them. None of the characters show any particular sympathy or interest until the last segment. <br /> <br /> Framed story: Adam West ... well, myself. He does not follow the route of the 60s of Bruce Wayne / Batman, but rarely does this. He just plays the not-so-mysterious “Jay” (ominous, frightening name of the spine compared to Dr. Terror, Eram and the Keeper of the Crypt), and makes some awkward / creepy statements. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Have you seen the Serling Homeland in Willowby? Then you saw it. The red herring of the wife of nuts is introduced uselessly, but even the friend of the main character identifies him as a weakling. Aim as expected, but mostly inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Snack Bar: Recalls various travel stories during a Serling, mixed with Steve Allen's Meeting of the Minds. Most of the actors are not so bad (with the exception of Josh Astin in the role of Cassius, who manages to walk, talk, and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is a bit interesting. But, like Abernathy, this is not going anywhere. The main character raises several relatively reasonable questions, makes a bit of a mistake (who would not?), And for some reason he is eventually driven into a nuclear wasteland. <br /> <br /> Life Replay: A nice little piece and it manages to precede both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose it means that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls. The main character is softly responsive. There is nothing really innovative here, but everything is in order. <br /> <br /> Morale: you see a turn beyond the mile, but, like the protagonist, he has a heart, and this is a worthy story of defeat and redemption. <Br /> <br /> Final: So ... why do people get into refrigerators in silver lame suits? I do not know And it does not make sense. So ... all the main characters wandered into a bookstore and were trapped? Kinda is undermining the happy ending with the boxer (thanks guys!), And the guy in the first segment is dead. So how did he fall into the trap? He visited the bookstore before he died, fell into the trap and ... did not die? What kind? BUT? I suppose it does not make sense because it is supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> In general: basically no different from the two newer Twilight Zone series or some episodes of Tales from the Dark Side or Monsters. The last two stories and part two are probably worth your time. But there is nothing really impressive.
