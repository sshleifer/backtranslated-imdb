Remember the chain smoking channel, set up 60 minutes ago a few years ago? That's her. Many people watched this movie without verifying the true creators of the movie. Manufacturers very successfully use fake word-of-mouth promotions without disclosing the financial and philosophical foundations of this marketing fraud. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age and day joke, this film is for you. If you want to discuss quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to convince you that Ramtha is not crazy, so you will give her a lot of money. If you can tiptoe through the Ramtha website without howling in disbelief, then perhaps you will think that the money you dropped on this commercial for insanity was well spent. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
