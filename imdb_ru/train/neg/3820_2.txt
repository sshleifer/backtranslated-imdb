Watch “Talk Easy” hurts for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comedian, director and stuntman who has undergone this humiliating spectacle is like seeing Picasso used as a tissue for falling out, or perhaps more like seeing the best Camembert faked by solid serums and recycled in cheez-whiz. <br /> <br /> Kithona is viciously called Professor Post, whose bloated vocabulary is the only thing that keeps him from saying: "Tell me about the rabbits, George." (The post would say something like: "Please tell me about the status of small mammals in the Leporidae family of the Lagomorpha squad, good sir, to whom, I believe, the epithet George is primarily addressed.") When Keaton created his own characters, they may be situationally ignorant, but they were not stupid. They quickly learned and became masters of their worlds. Not so with the Post, which never ceases to stumble and clumsy, and one who does not have more control over their destiny than the bilge rat of Titanic. And although the original characters of Keaton had charming naivety and innocence, Fasting is perceived as such a deep sexual delay that, if he ever becomes physically excited, he will put an ice bag on the tumor and seek medical help. <br /> <br /> There are several small, redemptive moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of the vampire theme Todd or his proposal for a suitable outfit for the Greek dance, but it's just not worth enduring the entire movie to see them. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch “Talk Easy” with friends, a la “Mystery Science Theater 3000”. But besides this, keep silence. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton remembered.
