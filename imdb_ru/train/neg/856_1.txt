These notes write about the end of the story, so don’t read it if you haven’t seen this garbage. <br /> <br /> I found this trash movie in the horror section, which made me think it would be horror. If I had a video store, I would put it in the “Boring” section. This film is so rubbish that it makes you feel that you have lost your socks. <br /> <br /> In this film, endless shots of people who rode as if it was scary. Well, I go to work and back (and sometimes to the store or visit my cats) almost every day and, believe me, this is not a problem. It even starts from 20 minutes behind the wheel of some people. Even a little kid does it too. He walks in a circle and never stops. What is so scary about a little kid riding a bike for an hour? I don't think ANYTHING, and if you look at it, you won't think so either. <br /> <br /> The family in the car arrived at the big castle, and they were given a tour, just walking endlessly, looking at the kitchens. Then the man walks for about an hour and, for no reason, tries to kill his family. That's all that happens, and, as you can see, it's rubbish.
