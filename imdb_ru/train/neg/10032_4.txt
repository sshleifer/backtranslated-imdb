The storyline was fine. Akshay Kumar was as good as ever, and that was the only good thing about the movie. Karina Kapoor looked bad. There was such a shade and weeping in its zero size, but it did not look more slender. I do not know why the hell Anil Kapoor took such a bad role. The film was nothing special for him. The fact that this is a Yasraj film does not mean that an actor has to accept the role, however bad it may be. Said Ali Khan was fine. I think the time has come for Indian directors and producers to start thinking of Indian customers as reasonable. Who are we ? fools !!!! What they think, they will show 2 men taking the special forces detachment to the balance, and we will believe them. Is the Indian police so foolish that they are trying to capture some of the criminals ... they take a whole group of over 100 policemen, and there was nobody there to surround the palace. The action was crap, and I had never seen such a bad action. Akshay Kumar was surrounded by 30-40 policemen who shot him ..... and he shot them. None of the police bullets touched him, but he killed all the policemen. Shit. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the battle director who thought about this scene should resign. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS FILM.
