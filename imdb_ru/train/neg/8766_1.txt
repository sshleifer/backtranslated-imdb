I have to announce that the film is not worth watching. He does not fit into a tribute in such a magnificent way that it is almost an insult to the memory of these brave people. The special effect was terrible, I did not expect a complete refusal by the director to evaluate military technology. How can a machine gun, which usually shoots at 600 rounds per minute, fire at 1/10 speed? How can soldiers fall forward if a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when artillery shells fall down to 20 feet? Why artillery shells fall only on both sides of the road, and not on the road itself? <br /> <br /> Not only did I disrespect the weapon, but confused situations and inconsistencies of dialogue made me scream murder. There were standard dialogues, such as “Ye bhi kishi kak bhai hai”, “Ise laat mat Maro” and “Pakistan se jyaad musalman” with Hindus meh hai and Lok cross mat karoe e hukum hi. At least silly. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De wrote is true. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no flow to the film. There is no gradual transition from one battle to another. This is just one shootout after another, in no way connected with the general scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are terrible. The chief of staff of the army looks unconvincing. To exacerbate the situation, people in the theater indiscriminately cut frames to four hours of the film lasted three hours.
