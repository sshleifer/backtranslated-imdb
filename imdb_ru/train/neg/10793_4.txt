I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. This film, based on the novel by science fiction writer Brian Aldis, is trying to tell a story about Tom and Barry Howe, twins, whom the impresario had pulled from the family to create a rock band. /> Almost intentionally useless, the film is also half too clever (if you excuse the pun). Mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was an excellent documentary film Lost in La Mancha) quickly go astray. I was never sure if I should take it all seriously or not. Flashbacks, sequence of dreams, all of this was a bit. Plus, the promised rock and roll just did not move me. I was a little reminiscent of the times of Hedwig and Angry Inch, a film that I found original and touching. But in this case the songs were not so good, and the main characters were not sympathetic. A more unfavorable comparison would be just as disappointing the Velvet gold vein.
