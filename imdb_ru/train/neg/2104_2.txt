I bought this video in a Walmart shopping cart for $ 1. I think I overpaid !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of Level 3 films for small studios (in this case, Monogram - those who made most of the films about Bowrie Boise). Although the horror of most of these films does not come close to the level of horror achieved by his latest films (Ed Wood’s “classics” such as Monster Bride and Plan 9 from Space), they are nevertheless bad films and should be avoided. all but the most loyal fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie buff, so I tried. In addition, some of these smaller films were actually quite good - but not this one. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, like everyone else, is a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather weird and cruel wife in blood serum from young brides. They never explained WHY it should be a bride, or why it should be a woman, or even what kind of illness his wife had - so you can see that the plot has never been solved at all. <br /> <br /> In any case, a really annoying female reporter (like Lois Lane without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to sort out all those obvious murders in which bodies were stolen! So, she follows some tips right up to the threshold of Lugosi. The house of Lugosi is staffed by his crazy wife, assistant, and two strange people who are obviously the sons of an assistant (an ugly humpbacked sex villain and a dwarf). Naturally, this brave reporter is constantly losing consciousness throughout the film - obviously, narcolepsy and good journalistic journalistic work go hand in hand! In the end, maniacs ALL die - mainly because of their hands and everything is fine. In conclusion, the reporter and the doctor with whom she had just met decided to get married. And, naturally, the dumb reporter operator loses consciousness when this happens. If you have not noticed, in this film a lot of fainting. Or maybe because it was such a slow and heavy film, they just fell asleep!
