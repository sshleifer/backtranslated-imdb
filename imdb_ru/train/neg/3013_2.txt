Starting with a long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes is trying to show the destructive impact of industrialization on the environment and traditional societies. His buzzing story suggests that industrial development in China and elsewhere is completely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx never visited the British Museum. The fact that there may be some connection between the modern Asian desire for industrialization and wealth, and the earlier experience of hunger and terror is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, attempts are being made to present photographs of Edward Burtynsky. Industrial waste is somehow “beautiful”. Most of the film is a slide show of these images. They are well made, museum-sized and, apparently, have appeared at several exhibitions. For me, however, they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made beautiful if presented well. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The link between the photographs and the voice message of the film, if any, remains unclear. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that when countries seek industrialization, there are no real and sometimes desperate problems. However, "Artificial landscapes" offer only strange and bitter hopelessness. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Perhaps this has some meaning as a demonstration of what is wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
