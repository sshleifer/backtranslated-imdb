Seeing people behind the Sun, I hoped that the evolution of style and technology would correspond to the larger scale of this film. It was also very interesting for me to see how someone makes a cruel, fact-based, made-up story about what happened during this most infamous Japanese atrocity, but it’s not. This is similar to the European Nazi film about exploitation at the lower and middle level, created in the 70s, for example, the SS Experimental Camp, etc. (Perhaps, it looks more like deported women from the Special Section). Of course, he has more opportunities and more people run around, but he resorts to the same cheap and dreary device of many unfortunate non-actors, limply falling to the sounds of ridiculously fictional shots spiced with an occasional poorly executed “shock” sequence. Admittedly, horrendous documentary shots are roughly divided between scenes so battered that even these real images are devoid of much of their power. Watch Channel 4 of the Holocaust (recently aired (still working?), Starting on issue 1 of 2006) to see a really disturbing documentary about the evil of war (with excellent contextual use of real shots). This is the type of treatment that the horror of Nanking deserves, and not this beaten trash for exploitation (a better film about exploitation minus disrespectful use of video would be good, but again, this is not even a very good film about exploitation). Rating: 3 (5 - exploitation, 1 - treatment of the subject).
