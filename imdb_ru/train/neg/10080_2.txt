I had to look for actresses to find the board of this film, because the title now is Unexpected Love. In fact, this is not worth looking for, but I was not familiar with both of the presenters and wondered why they became the lesbian headliner in Lifetime. Everything is rather restrained, and you really do not understand who these characters are, so, as a spectator, I could not emotionally plunge into the storyline. I guess I'm not a target audience for this, but I'm not sure who. Everything is muffled, soft focus and earth tones ... nothing special. I was particularly interested in seeing two women staring, but it was so careful that I was disappointed. Rent Personal Best.
