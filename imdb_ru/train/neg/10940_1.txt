First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamasa can never be considered a qualified actor, hardly even decent, sometimes just lousy. However, in this snippet @ *! ^ Under the name SnakeEater the film industry as a whole sank. <br /> <br /> First let's start with the plot. A Vietnamese vet named Jack Kelly, who is also a Soldier (who should be as strong as a leather strap and then some other thing you can believe when he pushes a nail foot through the legs of two guys and pins them to the floor) finds out that his family was murdered, and his sister was kidnapped. Therefore, he goes to a solitary mission to save his sister. There was some potential, but still rather thin to begin with. <br /> <br /> Now the game is actors. Being an actor, I have the right to say that it was one of the worst roles in the history of art !!!!! Lam, well, myself. Hunters playing the failures of Clampets / Deliverance should be raised and shot for their so-called performances that insult actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get a big break! <br /> <br /> Finally, action. The shootout at the BEST, and the fist fight deplorable. I saw more real-looking fights at the Renaissance festival (and it was pretty fake) <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS CACA PART FOR ALL COST! IF IT WAS ONLY A FILM IN EXISTENCE, YOU WANT TO WANT IT! For the sake of counting the number of brain cells DO NOT watch this!
