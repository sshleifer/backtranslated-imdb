It was an impulse for me from the local video store. Do not make the same mistake as me. This film is tedious, unconvincingly acting and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is especially poorly written and delivered; I cringed on every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes several rare appearances and is his usual disconnected self; his role was clearly not a stretch for him. And while the film is supposedly taking place in Puerto Rico, it looks more like a Hollywood film; All the main characters are Caucasians, and some, as a rule, speak English with a pseudo-Irish accent. Strange. In any case, when you see it on the shelf of your local video store, keep going.
