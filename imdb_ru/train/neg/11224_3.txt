... and even then, even they can live without seeing it. To be honest, this film (if you can call it that) is of real interest only to freaks. Betty Page's fans will recognize absolutely nothing new (and I really mean * nothing *), nor will they enjoy the warmth of thinking about the experience of something familiar, loved or cherished. <br /> <br /> Never mind the horrible scenario, the wooden activities of the theater community, the complete lack of direction, shoddy lighting or any other values ​​of the production base. This is definitely "Hey kids, let's make a movie!" filmmaking of the lowest order. I guess you can be thankful that they even knew how to control the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of this has to do with why this thing is so straightforward * wrong *. <br /> <br /> This is wrong, because the young lady plays Betty Page, a somewhat aftershire girl, whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is dark hair and a brand bang completely unable to bring anything to the role except for the desire to be bound and gagged. Apparently, this is a good thing for her film career before and after this wretched excess, but not for the wretched excess itself, which consists mainly of the many lovingly recreated B & D scenes sandwiched between horrendously terrible artificial biographical scenes delineating Ms. Falling Page of Grace (so to speak). In fact, there is probably more information about Page's life in the opening and closing credits more than in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not a worthy companion of the movie "The Infamous Betty Page". This is not a worthy movie. This is a fetish that sells the charm of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time and does it without class, without style and without any real sense of Betty Page's character in general. No real Betty Page fan would consider it anything but disappointment, I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If you are free, remember that time is also money. Yours may not be very expensive, but I bet it's worth what you regret for wasting your time with it. That's all I did, you were warned.
