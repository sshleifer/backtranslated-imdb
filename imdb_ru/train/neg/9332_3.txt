In fact, this is not a terrible film, but Glenn and Keitel are first-class actors. In addition, they do an acceptable job with a very weak scenario. The landscape is magnificent, and the plot has some interesting twists and turns. In addition, I understand why these actors and the team made the film, they are professionals, and they are paid for it. But I wonder why studios spend time and money on making a film, and then do not release it for a theater audience? Even if the film is a box office failure, it will certainly bring some money. If you're a Keitel or Glenn fan, rent a video or catch it on TV like me. Of course, the film does not help solve the problem of immigration with Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% of the standard TV tariff today.
