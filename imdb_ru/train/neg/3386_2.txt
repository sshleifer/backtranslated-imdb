Yes, I was lucky to see the long-lasting original production of the hit Michael Bennett. It was an amazing experience, and I paid to watch the movie when it appeared in theaters in 1985. It's horrible. Almost everything does not work. First, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is a pitiful choice - almost as bad as when John Houston was hired to hurt Annie. The camera is always in the wrong place - they cut the songs and CASTING !!! They are terrible - the power of the game was in these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted to show what they were capable of, and when they had a chance - you couldn't take your eyes off of them. But this cast simply dances, sings well, but none of them lights. Actually, look at the cast of IMDb - none of them actually did anything. (Good, good, Janet Jones married Gretzky - shish). So this cinema was wrecked for one second, magic, despair, the passion of the musical. Total blow! (But even though they try to stifle music - great music still rises from time to time and reminds people of how great the score was).
