I have to admit that I don’t have much New Age humor. When people “exchange energy”, I always wonder how much kJ is really exchanged and how this can contribute to solving global warming. When energy is “imposed”, I always wonder how they managed to break the laws of entropy and there are still no Nobel prizes. When people feel how well instinct allows them to perfectly navigate the complexities of life, I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing, for example, to find a station. <br /> <br /> But again, this is not the first film with openings for the plot, and I consider most of them perfectly acceptable and interesting. If this had been the case with Celestine's Prophecy, I would not have burned this film, but unfortunately it is not. It seems that every actor is bored from his head and cannot understand what he really should do on the spot. This leads to a lot of “ah” and “ah”, as I usually say, when I talk about quantum physics with someone who really knows what he is talking about, and pretends that he understands. <br /> <br /> Direction is not inspiring. You can expect more from the guy who made “What dreams might come,” but, hey, I assumed he had paid well for the job and accepted the position of the New York taxi driver: “This is your money, mate ...”. the only one who seems to be having fun is the bad guy Jurgen Prokhnov all the time. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few actors in this film who may have several wise cracks in this timeless and terribly boring New Age chatter. <br /> <br /> This movie is very similar to one of these dinner dates, when you find out that your date is actually a terrible occupation that seems unable to shut up. At some point, the words seem to turn into small ping-pong balls that are continuously thrown at your head until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good time and choose between this film and sticking safety pins in your eyelids, take my advice: choose the latter.
