I bought this film for $ 5 at a used CD store, and I regret it a bit. To begin with, I'm a big fan of cheese horror films. They provide terribly sticky cheap entertainment. This film was entertained for the first half hour, because it was so bad that it could be easily ridiculed in the style of MST3K. Then it got boring. <br /> <br /> Acting is the worst part of the film. Although you should not expect a great acting game, it was ridiculously bad and, frankly, provided all the entertainment that was supposed to be. This is a plus for the film. Where the film really does not give rest to fun - it is to write, light and edit. <br /> <br /> This movie has too much "What happens to $ $ #?" moments. There are many moments, for example, that the mother has strange seizures at dinner, and then it makes absolutely no difference in the film. In the course of the dinner, one of the leaders decided that it was fun to watch people eat delicious food for five minutes without dialogue every time food is served. During food and other inappropriate moments, the scene goes into the dark outside. Then it turns on again. And, speaking of the darkness outside, one of the funniest parts of the film is the climate, where, apparently, not night, if it does not rain. And speaking of the dark, the big problem with the film is that it is so poorly lit that you can't see what happens half the time, which is a big disappointment than anything else. In one of the climatic scenes you cannot even say that you must see that it is so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climate scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I saw people saying, “Wow, that surprised me, and that’s good.” I can say that the great discovery really surprised me, because I did not expect it to appear. The reason I did not see this happening is because it made absolutely no sense. I won’t spoil it for you, but I’ll tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding different parts of the film to find something that could confirm it at all, and everything we found had more things saying that it was impossible. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is really better when you watch it with comment tracks that make fun of it. I love bad horror movies, but that was too much.
