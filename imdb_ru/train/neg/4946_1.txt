Admittedly, I watched this piece with already VERY low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a rather incompetent composer Perven, whose lack of talent exceeds only the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> This was the first cartoon that I watched without 100% humor. This is a rude, abusive, trash and clearly anti-woman. As such, this is a creation suitable for Bohlen, but the average viewer is more likely to fall behind him. No wonder he was never shown in the cinema: it could blow up a GREAT time! <br /> <br /> Even 6.5 million Euros could not save this piece of shit. Save your time ... and money!
