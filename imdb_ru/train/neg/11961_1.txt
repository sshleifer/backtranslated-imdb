Anyone who can find redemptive value in this piece of shit should check their head. We have a submissive, heroin-dependent, part-time wife with ragged wounds all over her body, ripped wounds from repeated beatings by an abusive son. Now she sprinkles breast milk all over the kitchen floor, so the release is somehow akin to Helen Keller, putting her hands on running water. We have a husband who starts by patronizing a prostitute who simply turns out to be his daughter (she is upset because of him because he came too fast) and ends with the murder of his female colleague, sex with her corpse and the subsequent separation . We have a child who is brutally intimidated by his classmates, and who comes home and beats his mom. You see, this is all round. Deep, huh? The only worthy moment in this terrible pile of deception is when dad kills the torturers of his son. It's good that this turkey was filmed, because otherwise it would have been a waste of an expensive movie. If the guy who thinks that artists should be interested in this wash is really serious, itâ€™s no wonder that most people consider artists crazy. We watched this lousy movie, then put "Zero woman accused." My God, it was a question which of them was worse. What is happening in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
