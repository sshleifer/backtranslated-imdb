> You are warned that this is a spoiler! > This film is so bad that I doubt that I can write enough lines. Excellent direction, frames were well thought out. The actors were very good, especially Richard Pryor, although I would like to see more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classics. Dudley. God bless him, could be better. John Ritter again, I would like to see more of him. In my opinion, this failure is entirely related to the failure of the writer. Perhaps the producer might disconnect when he saw what he was creating. Itâ€™s just too bad that so much money went into this pot when, in my opinion, with minor changes here and there, it would be fixed. To produce one chuckle.
