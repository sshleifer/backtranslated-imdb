What a horrible, horrible movie. The worst collection of stamps I've seen in a long time. Not that I've seen much. After about 40 minutes, I left the theater shouting for a strong drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was terrible, as usual. How many offensive and tortured expressions can have 1 person? Aidan Quinnâ€™s talents, as is often the case, were completely wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan that she could act? Attempting to be politically correct in this film continues to impose racial stereotypes. (A brave inexperienced lone music teacher teaches children from disadvantaged families to play the violin in a poor school). The kids weren't even cute! Just written in accordance with a terrifying scenario. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe this time. real horror this!
