A very smooth modern (preserving sensual feeling) reconstruction of the history of Dracula (albeit with the observance of traditional customs) with a rather interesting, if not completely caught, story about the prince of darkness. The first time I tried to look at it, I was able to walk only half before I lost interest. A good start begins again (especially the scenes with thieves, and then their encounters with Dracula), but for me it became less exciting when he gets to New Orleans to focus on his daughter Van Helsing. Great place to install it, but never used its settings (despite the fact that captured a hell of paradise where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yes, they throw this name away), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. From an artistic point of view, he had moments with several fabulous visual effects, but some kinetic editors and cheap strokes do not help. The dirty script gets pretty silly. Lussier does a brilliant job that stays fairly smooth by inserting a lot of blood (makeup is achieved accordingly) and a lot of “virgin” advertising. No, I do not mean virgins, this is a music company, as it is often removed, and the daughter of Helsing works there. Oh, it was not an obvious fit. The soundtrack is a fun choice of rock melodies. Now the performances are going around the store, but there are a few familiar faces that can be seen (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Laughlin Munro). Gerard Butler in the role of Dracula just did not come off, because not so much was formed. He was simply illuminated by the lush night ladies; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides. Johnny Lee Millar and Justin Waddell are fine. Christopher Plummer turns gray when Van Helsing and Omar Epps play with his role.
