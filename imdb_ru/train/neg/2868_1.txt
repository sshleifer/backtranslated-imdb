In fact, it is an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in this film do not even closely correspond to reality. Why they could not make a film about real events does not make any sense, because real events are more interesting than this contrived farce. Don't even waste your time watching this for free. Low budget and shameful description of events over which you can not joke that actually made this film. If they allowed me to give -10 in this film, I would. The game sucked, and it looks like it was filmed on an old VHS video camera from the 80s. Save your time and money by not watching this movie.
