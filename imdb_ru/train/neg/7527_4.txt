There are so many stupid moments in The Tower of Death / Game of Death 2 that you really wonder if it is a fake. At times it seemed to me that I was watching the continuation of the movie “Kung Pau”, and not the Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film has everything related to the “Game of Death”. In any case, it is rather a continuation / remake of the film “War with the Dragon”, which includes many elements of this film, in particular, the actual frames. Bruce Lee's character Billy Law (apparently) investigates the sudden death of his friend and meets a fragment of the film that was left with the man's daughter. When the body was stolen during a funeral (!), Billy was also killed, and his lost brother must avenge the death of both people. <br /> <br /> Thong Long plays the role of brother Bobby Lo. a kind of charisma for wearing a movie. However, his fighting abilities are very good. Bruce Lee, obviously, comes from (no longer removed) footage just to make money from the heritage. Having said that, in general, the footage is actually edited better than in “The Game of Death,” but this does not prevent the film from becoming a mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so the fights are actually very interesting (I dare say, mind-blowing) and making the film at least watchable. But there are so many stupid elements in this film that it really tests your patience. First, is there an alleged villain who lives in his luxury estate ... or is this a psychiatric institution? Seriously, this chatterbox eats raw venison, drinks deer blood, carries a monkey on its shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make him look tough and smart makes you feel sorry for him - you half expect someone to take him back to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this middle section is terrible, and when the scene involves a naked prostitute and a lion costume, I turned it off. However, I finished the film and was kind of glad that I did it, because the battle scene near the end (just like “GOD”) was the only reason to watch it. While the story is embarrassing, the action is very good and contains excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But even the final is disappointing if the premise was something to get through. We were told that the Tower of Death was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. It sounded wonderful, like turning the original Bruce Lee idea with different styles of struggle at each level. Could this be the “Game of Death” that was originally planned? Not! The film was supposed to be called "Generator room of death", because it is so far from the tower. Yes, indeed, there were one or two "different" styles ... there were grunts in foil, a minion with a leopard skin and a stupid monk. It’s as if “War with the Dragon” has never been done, the plot is a bad imitation. <br /> <br /> It’s worth to look at the dynamic battle scenes once, but sometimes they are so stupid that they hurt. If it was intended, then fine. Nevertheless, thanks for recreating the scene from the projector room from the movie “War with the Dragon”.
