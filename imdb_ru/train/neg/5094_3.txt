This movie sucks. The neighbor was removed, the script sucks and the film sucks in general. The film had two threads that were not developed, and the viewer had to do a little work to find out what was going on. <br /> <br /> I’m not saying that this needs to be stated, but you suddenly discover that something is happening and that you are being told as if you have the slightest idea that they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> Negative reviews of the heroine about the hero. The audience never shows how she knows something about the guy at all and how he is connected with the death of her fiancé. The viewer also has a minimal susceptibility to the death of a guy. <br /> <br /> In addition, a scene suddenly appears with a bunch of guys loading and cocking machine guns, and that’s all you see before cutting back into other scenes. No explanations about guns and people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave him 3 because we didn’t feel we wanted to return time. It was fun to blame the movie while watching it, so at least it gave us a little fun. ;-)
