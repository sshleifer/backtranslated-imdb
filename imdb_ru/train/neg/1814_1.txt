All these reviewers are in place. I have seen a lot of bad movies over the years, believe me, and this is much better! <br /> <br /> This is not just “so bad, this is good” the exploiter, a waste of time, but a real, funny, crime of the movie. <br /> <br /> CHECK the white fluffy monster stuff! <br /> <br /> TOGETHER TOGETHER YOURSELVES during the acting game of Tom Christopher! <br /> <br /> IN RESPONSE A ** ELECTRONIC PROTECTION! on worn sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of those "European joint productions." No wonder there are so many wars. I swear, some people in the Wizards of the Lost Kingdom don't really know that they appear in the film! <br /> <br /> FACT! I initially watched this movie on HTV Wales late in the evening, suffering from concussion and lack of sleep. I had to look for a copy a few weeks later to make sure it was really so terrible. It. Worse than Lee Majors in Northman, more ridiculous than all the John Derek films, this is, indeed, Citizen Kane of Trash.
