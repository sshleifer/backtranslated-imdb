Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space suits for girls. <br /> <br /> I love the fiction of the 50s, I even like the fiction of the 50s, but this film is really very bad. And not in the style of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Virtually unobservable, as the Bozo pair shows the best impression of Abott & Costello as a “fashion cat”. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save the cheese science. For example, in Feline Women on the Moon, but in this case it is impossible. This movie requires a mute button and fast forward feature. <br /> <br /> However, I could observe how Gloria and Dolores walk around the spacecraft for about an hour or so.
