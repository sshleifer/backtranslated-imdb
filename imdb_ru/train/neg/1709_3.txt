I received a copy of this film, thinking that it was a 1964 film with Zombie the Bloodbath as one of the alternative titles. On the contrary, this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned headline; which may mean that the other is really bad! This film is also pretty bad; obviously, you can't go to the movie that calls itself “Bloodbath Zombie” and expect to see a masterpiece, and, frankly, it really fits the title with the amount of blood shown ... but it all seemed very old and tired, which did not help brutal acting and stupid storyline. It's just your average nuclear spill, forcing people to turn into zombies, and so on. D. And so on. The film begins with a sequence that sees people melting, and pretty much lets you know what you are for; low-quality zombie trash. There is a lot of blood in the film, and this is really good work, otherwise the film would be very boring. Zombie Bloodbath also looks very cheap, and inexperienced directors have obviously gathered it! The main influence seemed to be Romero’s excellent Day of the Dead, although in reality it could be something that distinguished zombies and blood. It all comes down to a typically predictable and meaningless finale, and overall I can’t say that I was impressed with this!
