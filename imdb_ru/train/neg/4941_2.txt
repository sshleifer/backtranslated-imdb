I really didn’t mind Geico ads the first 50 times I saw them, and even found them to be a bit crooked and funny, BUT SERIOUS! Is this the BEST thing these people could come up with?!? This show sucks! It's boring and it looks like watching an episode of “The Office” with characters disguised as cavemen (I know that many of you will hate me for it, but the “Office” just doesn't do it for me). Well, I realized: we have a poor slobber, just trying to keep his nose clean, and he has a crappy boss who hates him; pseudo-intellectual, which really only barely functioning intelligence; and a sluggish one who just wants to be accepted, but SO THAT !!! I worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as on TV ... why would I spend another 1/336 week watching more candidates of this type?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they have not thrown you at the head if, after thinking about it, you are still mistaken in believing that this is entertainment.
