I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was terrible! Every clich√©, brutal, rich imagination of a boy was demonstrated, you just knew how it would end, especially with all the shots of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl. <br /> <br /> Worse, there were questions and answers with the director / writer and writer / producer they were trying to meet as intellectuals, but you could say that they are the types that go on the scene of violence. I bet they often visit brothels and take drugs. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. I had to keep my boyfriend from getting out of him.
