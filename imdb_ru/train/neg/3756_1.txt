This is really bad in the film. My friend rented it because he, well, an idiot. But then again, I must be an idiot too, because I was watching all this damn thing! The actors were on a par with high school drama fans who think they are going somewhere. The only place they go is to return to the waiting tables at Luby's. While I was watching this “gem”, I could only think about how it was actually produced. I mean, some scriptwriters actually thought that this premise was fresh, original, and profitable. Then some jerk with the money so believed in the script that he decided to fork out on a naive delusion that he was going to return it. The actors were filming, filming, hiring makeup artists, leading computer animators from the Al Collins School of Graphic Design, and this poop began to take shape. <br /> <br /> Obviously, there were a lot of them. things that I hated in this movement, but the only thing that drove me crazy was the excessive use of music. Every minute of this movie was crammed. There was not a single break in the music. And sometimes it was mixed higher than the dialogue, not because it made you miss some vital plot or something like that. <br /> <br /> After it was over, we decided to see the Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 diesel VW rabbit, then switching to a BMW 740il. You could not get two more opposite films in terms of quality.
