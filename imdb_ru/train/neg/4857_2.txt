I really liked the ZB1. Indeed, I did. I have no problem with extremely low-budget films, and I liked movies with worse performance than ZB3 (if you can imagine it. See “Wise Men vs. Zombies” if you're interested). In fact, I prefer low-cost zombie films, because I suspect that Hollywood directors do not understand what “zombies” are about. <br /> <br /> But the ZB3 was so bad. It was retarded. I do not want to worry about being worthy in my criticism. I want to return my 90 minutes, and so on. D. Except that in fact it took only ~ 80 minutes, because halfway through I transferred them to accelerated acceleration 1.4X. 1. Step was terrible. Everyone spoke in monologues. Even when someone had only one line, working with the camera, editing and inserting a set of F-bombs in each sentence made the line FEEL, as a monologue. At first I was excited for 90 minutes compared to 70 minutes of ZB1, but in fact there were fewer “events” in ZB3. That all says. <br /> <br /> 2. The effects of blood have become more stupid. Just rub the bellies of people. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposure, the plot really was not. And the exposure is really epic! I will not spoil it if you are going to watch it. (Do not look.) But then this is just a bunch of lame characters who walk and quarrel for ~ 80 minutes. or less if you so wish.
