Loonatics Unleashed is the worst thing that can happen to classic characters created by Chuck Jones. Loony Tunes has many additional and different versions, some were good, others not so good. But Loonatics is the worst. The concept is stupid and is derived from the show "Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans", There were no similarities with the original characters, and the stories are boring and poorly written. New designs are terrible, and the animation is pathetic. This show just does not work. This terrible waste of animation is a complete failure, and it should be nothing but a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
