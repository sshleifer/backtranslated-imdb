Honestly ... I loved watching Sevred. That's why I <br /> <br /> gave him 1/10 stars because of his completely unimaginable story <br /> <br /> / filming / action / everything else. This film was a riot to watch. If <br /> <br /> you like to watch bad movies to make fun of them, then you really will like <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> History really doesn't matter, some bald guy takes part in it <br /> <br /> with a sword and a walking one who beheads random people. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural twist ... no one has ever seen him do it. <br /> <br /> Even when in one very memorable scene he enters a nightclub <br /> <br /> and knocks down some girl's noodles, but nobody sees <br /> <br />, <br /> <br /> “Torn” doesn’t just look like it was captured on video, but was shot on someone’s home video camera. Filmmakers possessed <br /> <br /> knowledge of lighting (very subtle knowledge) and compositions <br /> <br /> in some scenes they actually kept together. But basically you can't hear the actors <br /> <br /> ... you can't understand what they are doing, and you laugh <br /> <br /> when the next victim tears his pumpkin from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. Such films of support are a scream and a collar <br /> <br />!
