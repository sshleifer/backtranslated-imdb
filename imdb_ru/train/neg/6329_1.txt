I saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (when the tickets did sell for $ 1). This is the only film I ever went on (with my friend, while on the screen was idiocy, which is called “Laser Bra 2000”). Obviously, the reaction of my and my friend to the film was normal. It's not that I found the film offensive (as at the age of 18 or now), but rather that it is stupid and obviously unfunny, devoid of even unintended humor, which makes Ed Wood's watchable. This is the real reason that NBC refused to broadcast it, and not the inability to understand Mr. Mike's “vision” (unless, of course, he did not want to drive the supporters of the film into bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I am still amazed that this film did not seem to be included in any of the published lists of the “10 worst films of all time”. This definitely makes mine. You have been warned.
