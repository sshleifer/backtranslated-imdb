My comments can be a bit of a spoiler, for what it's worth. Stop now if you don't care. <br /> <br /> “Salvation Grace” should have been called “Paper Excuse for Older British Women to Get High Results on the Screen.” This movie is stupid. Random music is annoying, as are obvious battered melodies that pop up from time to time, commenting on the narration (for example, “Spirit in the sky” - Oh, I understood!) Brands Bleten provoke emotions in the audience using only her voice. I literally heard people in the High Times magazine take pleasure in the huge “buds” that litter this picture. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda is trying to sell her illegal goods on a street of London in a bright white dress. Not funny. Not original. Not interested. Not a good movie. Rating 7.2 is the result of excessive voting fanatics. Do not waste your time ...
