I can not explain in any way what is the popularity of the children's TV show, the power rangers. <br /> <br /> I did not understand why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place, because the characters seem so idiotic and not worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> The costumes look absolutely awful, like a colorful spandex that people wear to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this? show anyway, but for children to learn how to fight, to solve their problems? What happened to the terrible haircuts and clothes on this show? Not to mention the fact that this show is still broadcast on cable television, just to earn money, to teach children to fight with each other when they do not agree with a particular problem. <br /> <br /> Children are much more interesting today, I hope they are not so gullible as the children of the 1990s who watched this show. <br /> <br /> Yes, and what happened to the homoerotic tension between the red and green rangers?
