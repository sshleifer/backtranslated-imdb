There is something sad about the fact that someone who is doing something so well is trying to do something completely different ... and ultimately turns out to be mediocre. I thought about Jordan playing baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This film is quite well played and directed, but the script is ugly. Martin did a fine job of adapting the classic story to the comedy in Roxane, but this attempt to bring the Victorian drama to the modern stage led straight to the wall of implausibility. If you want the old story to be updated in some style, it’s best to hire “Great Expectations”.
