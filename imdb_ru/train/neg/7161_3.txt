A young American woman visiting her Irish roots and fighting off the Druid witch who wants to take possession of her. It sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start I lost my way and most of the time thought where it was going. It seems that the film is moving in two directions - are we watching the suffering of an Irish-American woman struggling with her alcohol problem, or are we watching a horror movie about an evil witch who is returning from the past? The director cannot decide. These two do not seem to turn into a gel, and in the end you will not get anything. It could have been much better done, and the story seemed to be drawn to an end. It was very boring and disappointing.
