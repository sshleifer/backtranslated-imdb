I saw this movie in a cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I couldnâ€™t see any redemptive merits in films: Dennis Quaid was counted as a cop who never smiles or smiles, and his smile and smile its two trademarks. Danny Glover was declared the bad guy, but, again, the imagination of most viewers could not go far enough to believe him in this role. In addition, Jared Leto was not believable as a former medical student. There was no tension, since the killer was known very early. The finale, again, was neither dramatic nor tense: no one around me cared what would happen next. All we could expect was the end of the film. In general, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.
