Greg Davis and Brian Daley make a few crazy statements by terrorists, add comments from a group of ultra-right reactionaries, attribute the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Muslims on the planet to everyone who calls themselves Muslims, and present this as the theology of Islam. Perhaps their next film will include an interview with Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Congregation, adding comment by some militant atheists "scholars" and writing their film "What the world needs to know about Christianity." Ultimately, this film suffers from the poor. Production values ​​and lack of attention to the basic standards of journalism: do not waste your time and money, just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for several days for free, and you will receive the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.
