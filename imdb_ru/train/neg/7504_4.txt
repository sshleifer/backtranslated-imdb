I'm afraid I disagree with the majority. I found the last Spike Lee a bit boring! Although he tried something different, that is, not just documenting the rise and fall of a serial killer, I do not think it worked too well. <br /> <br /> In fact, too much is happening - Winnie (John Relations Leguizamo and Dionna (Mira Sorvino), Richieâ€™s lifestyle (Adrian Brodie), and then local mafia types. The story is good, but in the end is that all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, could Mr. Lee not pay more attention to this side of the film?> <br /> <br /> But there are some good moments. All the scenes with the killer " Sam Sam's son David Berkovitsa look very nice (color saturation, etc.), and the acting is pretty good in everything. <br /> <br /> Overall, I felt that different stories would work well on their own or without the killings. It just wasn't strong enough at the end. <br /> <br />
