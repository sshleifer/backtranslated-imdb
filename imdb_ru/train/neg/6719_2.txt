This is a great idea for a movie, but it is unfortunately not a very good movie. What begins as a sweet and almost silly romantic comedy about Fleffer, in love with his Fluff, gets out of control and turns into a bizarre combination of genres and a real rainbow of plots, with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK and even the curious "damn" of 400 BLOWS thrown near the end. (At least, the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but, after all, this well-coordinated, well-designed film does not quite summarize. However, the actors all make the game work with the material, and there are some good laughs at the behind-the-scenes world of gay porn. <br /> <br />
