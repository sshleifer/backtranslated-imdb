I do not know who had the idea that killer whales kill people, beat and destroy things for the sake of revenge, but, my God, this is absurd. The Orcs are definitely not the cold-blooded killers that this film makes ... stupid. Orcs are extremely clever, don't get me wrong, but I strongly doubt that they know and understand such a thing as revenge. Therefore, I must say that everything I got from this film was the entertainment of how ridiculous it was. So I was at least somewhat surprised by this. Personally, I would recommend to go and see Jaws, if you want to watch a movie like animal killer people. But if you are like me and want to laugh at something so far from realism, I would say what you need. : D
