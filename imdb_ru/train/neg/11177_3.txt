In what seemed like the longest 1 hour 35 years that I had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino provides accurate performance to be sure. Not his usual refinement, which was nice. But his character was just really pathetic. It is a pity for someone when he stumbles, forgetting about meetings, when we understand that Hollywood social life deprived him of vital energy. But in this movie, we needed someone to love. And for some reason, every character in the picture said, “I don't know why I like you, Eli,” and could not even get close to him. other actors played in their usual styles. Thea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their reputable characters created on television or in earlier films. And Kim Basinger didn’t even play the film long enough to play any show. <br /> <br /> The story of the film had no impulse Most of the scenes never advance the story, but simply collect facts about the characters who later entered the game in the anti-climate final. He had the potential, with the exception of their unwillingness to base themselves on history. <br /> <br /> What's the point of the movie? Daniel Algrant and John Robin Beitz will make you believe: "Once Hollywood takes possession of you, you will not be able to get out." Yes, right! And that's why so many people get laid off in Hollywood.
