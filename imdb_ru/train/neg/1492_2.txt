Last night I made a series of films from Blockbuster, and this was the first film I watched (it was late on Saturday, I wanted to “fix a horror movie”) ... <br /> <br /> Wow, that was awful, almost embarrassingly so ... stupid story like a slasher I really thought that films like Scream put an end to it; amateur actors who play point cliches and tasteless dialogue, which is hard to believe, actually printed and read the page; and horrible scenes that are not very enthusiastic (especially in a movie with a bad script). <br /> <br /> But I have always believed that not a single film is 100% useless. Here are a few good words I can say about this mess: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobby Phillips: I love this actress. She is the only member of the cast that shows any acting talent. The only reason I risked renting it was because her name was on the cover. She justifies her presence in this tree with her professionalism, although sometimes she looks overwhelmed by the fact that she is acting in such an idiotic story. <br /> <br /> # 2 Unintentional gaiety when there were still Grind House cinemas in the country, and they used this nonsense as the third film in a triple count with some prestigious thriller that finally made its way into the interior. Unfortunately, in our age, directed directly at the video, most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone, not having the general experience of being part of an audience that scoffs and throws material onto the screen, because the film is terrible. This leads, the purpose of which porn star <br /> <br /> is trying to act!: Mostly on hand, because the producers do not need to persuade or beg them to undress for extended sex scenes, but this compromise usually means what they really say some lines that should promote the story (except “oh baby” or “harder!”). And, with pride, they all skillfully demonstrate stupidity, trying to act. I would almost eliminate Ginger Lynn Allen from this group, if her character was not supposed to be an Irish mom, and she sometimes tries to give an accent that just makes you smile. <br /> <br /> It is pleasant to look for a positive in all experiences, and this is what I took from this cesspool aka "Evil Breed"
