The screenplay is so stupid that it hurts me to spend 2 hours of my life, I will never come back (where I heard it before). The game is so-so. Things change often enough so that you continue to watch and wait for something terrible. However, in this film there is not a single original thing. While the first Cube was a boring horror film that, after all, had no special meaning, the zero cube understood this and tries to retell the exact same story, except for the fact that this time it is disgusting. give false explanations of every detail that the first film did not answer. Comically, the director repeats the exact scenes of the first film, which were somewhat strange, and tries to explain them. But the scenes are simply copied, there is no consistency. This script is sooo pointless. I can imagine how a half-conscious 15-year-old guy wrote it with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a cool project. The best part is, after all, they hurt the “good” guy-geeks, and he becomes backward in the first film, and you see him when they find him (“this room is green ...”) in the 1997 Cube. clap that turn. First of all, that if you have not seen the first, it does not make any sense, you, the insignificant director. Oh, another great idea: instead of numbers denoting the coordinates of the room in x, y, z (cube 1997), this time it's 3 letters, each of which gives one of the 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except that permutations now no longer make much sense ... so he lets the letters disappear before anyone can use them ... I want my money back. <br /> <br /> I think I had to write it down, because there are just so many bad, inconsistent or just stupid ideas in this film. Directors / writers should have some talent.
