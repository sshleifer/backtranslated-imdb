So, I know that I voted 1 out of 10, but in fact it deserves no more than half a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic that I cannot believe that some of the stars who signed the contract made this ridiculously absurd project. <br /> <br /> James J. and Catherine O'Hara were excellent in their characters, and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but the story is terrible, and I call everyone who sees it in the video store, even don't bother to pick it up and read the back cover, but just leave ... I don’t even want to understand what the film is about, because it’s too stupid to talk about it. <br /> <br /> Don't give up! It's horrible! Terrible!
