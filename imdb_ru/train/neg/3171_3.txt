Was this the greatest film I've ever seen? Was it the worst? <br /> <br /> As a mother of four children, it's nice to watch something light and funny. It was great, but it was cute. <br /> <br /> I think he definitely had a place to improve, but he tried. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not sure if this film deserves extreme, a level of abuse from another reviewer. They obviously don't care about Eva Longoria. I think she was better at this than at Sentinel. I think films are a matter of opinion. Actors play a huge role in whether this is a hit or a failure. <br /> <br /> The actors may not have worked. Perhaps too many things were happening. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to comment on a regular movie, not a horrible one. It might just be a flick of a tiptoe. It seems like the film "Split" or "French Kiss." My husband still talks about them. :)
