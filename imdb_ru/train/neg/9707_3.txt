It was not what I wanted to see. I bought it on DVD, and under the movie I felt annoyed and for a moment turned off the movie. <br /> <br /> That's what I didnâ€™t like: <br /> <br /> 1 They shot a father <br /> <br /> 2 tribes really annoyed <br /> <br /> 3 dinosaurs ( mostly) they looked deceived <br /> <br /> 4 the bad scientist irritated him well <br /> <br /> 5 The image quality on the DVD was very poor. <br /> <br /> What I liked: <br /> <br /> 1 Music by Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have a bootleg soundtrack from this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not very good, but this time everything is fine. <br /> <br /> 2 When we first see dinosaurs, they inspire fear. <br /> <br /> 3 The baby is kind of cute when he is in the water and plays <br /> <br /> 4 This is a funny scene with a tent. <br /> <br /> 5 Children who watch this movie hope that evil always loses.
