It's hard to believe that people really like this thing! I really think that children can enjoy it, but for me this is a film in which parents cannot reconcile. Predictable plot, boring belushi and possibly the worst actor ever. I will put some responsibility on the director for the child, but it was really painful to look at her. Now I am ashamed of her, because people know that it was she. When she sang the Star-shiny banner, I had to turn off the sound - then I came here and found that they did it because she won the Star Search. I always felt that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade in the name of his wonderful, sadly bored brother, and this shit shows why. Zero stars.
