Good people, I came across this movie in the evening when I was evaluating the papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done the genre of the honor it deserves. Icelandic Beowulf and Grendel is the least offensive thing I've ever seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This science fiction version matches the version of Christopher Lambert. Muck <br /> <br /> What I did not like? CGI for one. Surprisingly bad. More important is the loyalty of the storyline, not to mention the stilts. I'm used to all the versions I saw. <br /> <br /> Peter is delighted
