Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Shortly afterwards, Dr. Price, an expert in electronic voice phenomena (EVP), turned to him, claiming that he received messages from Jonathan Anna’s late wife through various electronic devices. Is Anna trying to say something to jonathan? Is it just a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale? It is good to see Keaton in the lead role, but the story in which he is stuck is confusing and absurd; As if the film does not know how to answer any of the questions that it raises, so it simply distracts the viewer with new, unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is pretty good, the grieving widower convincingly relies on a widower who is desperately trying to communicate with his late wife. As an actor, he matured a bit, leaving behind the friendly roles he played 15 or so years ago. He looks a little rocky, perhaps a few more wrinkles than might have been expected, but he didn’t lose a single trick and meanness that he showed during his quarter of a century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So Keaton doesn’t turn in mediocre performance, this is that the script itself is not up to par. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more and more entangled as you go along, each winding path ends with another winding path. This is all well and good if the path leads to some kind of acceptable denouement, something that more or less connects everything together and explains ... something. But not white noise; I knew less about what happened to Jonathan than before I first saw him. <br /> <br /> Keaton is indeed the only reason to watch this junk, although he receives excellent support from Ian McNeiss (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as a necessary love interest.
