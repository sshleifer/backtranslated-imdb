The idea of ​​creating a mini-series about Berlin air transport seemed to me one of the most interesting German (post-war) films. This is a topic that has not been studied. Nevertheless, the creators of this series filled him with cliches. It begins with the cover of the DVD movie, which is a direct copy of the cover of Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> Louise Kilberg (Bettina Zimmermann) learns that her husband, a doctor, Ulrich Neten, died in Russia, and after the war she struggles to survive. She finds a job at the American base, gets a job with the coolest and most senior officer (Heino Ferch) in the city, falls in love with me, gets pregnant, and suddenly her husband reappears. Come on !!! We saw it too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Neten play their part quite well; Bettina Zimmermann, however, never seems convincing. For some reason, it always seems that she is too late to give the right emotional reaction to the scenes. It just didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> A scene with airplanes and an air lift, we are sometimes thrilling, more often not. It seemed that unpleasant things always happened to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of World War II films, I advise you to spend money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings much more fun! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
