Another crappy ranch Grade Z from the prolific Albert Pune. Tim Thomherson's 13-inch policeman, similar to Clint Eastwood from space, stalks an ugly flying head (!) To Earth and participates in a gang war in the South Bronx! Fortunately, short, but dull boring, with the most amusing effects since the Attack of a 50-foot woman. They should also have fired the unbroken guy: notice how Thierson’s sunglasses fade in and out with every other shot. Funny bad, but that's why we watch these films, right? Continuation of "Dollman against." Demonic Toys´ is reportedly worse if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (of ****) <br /> <br />
