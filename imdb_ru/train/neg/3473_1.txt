Perhaps this is the worst Christmas movie ever. The plot is almost absent, the acting (in particular, Affleck) at best leaves much to be desired. Ben Affleck's fans are likely to defend this film, but deep down they must agree. As far as I could tell, the plot consisted of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman who the psychotherapist orders to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood, and write down a list of things he wanted to forget as a child. By doing this, he pays the family who currently lives in the house to be his family at Christmas ... and thatâ€™s all. The film continues, and in the end he meets the family's daughter .... blah blah blah.
