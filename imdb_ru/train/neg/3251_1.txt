I caught this FX movie last night, and when I sat and watched it, it occurred to me that this is probably the worst movie ever. Bad game, bad cinematography, bad sound, absolutely incredible fighting sequences, stupid characters. All this made him the funniest bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was delighted with the complete absence of something semi-competent that I had to continue to observe ... and they did a sequel!
