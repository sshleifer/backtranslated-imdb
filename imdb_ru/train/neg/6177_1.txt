The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a high-class comedian, in other situations besides Stojah. He had a certain track record for being very funny and clever. Moe, Larry, and Shemp really knew him, or at least his many years, and he liked his work. So what happened on Earth when he joined the squad as the “third puppet”? Obviously nothing. In most of these late-puppet shorts, boys are most often opposed to each other, and Joe to the other two, and this is not Stogzha’s exact etiquette. “One for all, all for one, each for himself,” quotes Curley from Restless Knights. One thing about a good comedic team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they all try to use each other or beat each other, when the chips actually fall, they keep coming to help each other. In this particular case, none of this happens. This is almost the same as watching a dog fight when someone tries to deceive others or to be evil and vile, but this is also not for the comedy effect. It can be assumed that something happens here behind the scenes, art imitates life. Maybe that's why Besser did not stay with Moe and Larry. Just look at the history of the other teams and tell me that I'm wrong.
