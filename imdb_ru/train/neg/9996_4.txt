Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are certain improvements, “Airport 77” is not much better than “Airport 1975”: slippery, commercial garbage, plunging (this time literally), a decent cast. Jack Lemmon is a pilot of a packaged airliner who hijacks thieves of art and falls into the sea (all advertising claimed that it was near the Bermuda Triangle, but there is no mention of this in the film itself). When rescue ships come to lift the plane out of the water, we see all their cranes fall (rather blindly) into the ocean, and it’s hard not to laugh (imagining that the cranes stifle the plane, passengers and the flooded scenario). NBC used to broadcast what seemed to be a “directorial cut,” at least an hour of extra shots — mostly memories — were introduced into the process with all the subtlety of the episode “Gilligan's Island”. The most exciting moment is a plane crash, and some players have a little fun: Lee Grant is a disgusting drunkard, Brenda Vaccaro is a non-shy stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting with old men. However, personality conflicts and agonizing military details end up enduring patience. ** from ****
