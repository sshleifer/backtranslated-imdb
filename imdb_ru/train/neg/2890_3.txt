The past creeps up on a drug addict when he reconnects with his sick brother and ex-girlfriend after what he hopes was his last limitation in detoxification. The “life dramas” presented here in the simplest way presented (even in the letter there is no bite or wit). The cast is made up of attractive actors, smiling darkly at each other, and music and photography are grim (a couple of visual effects are ridiculous, indie cliché touches a paltry budget). Although written and directed by a man, it was done by a woman, and I’m not sure, but I think that this may be a clear reason why this picture of two men, alienated brothers, coming together, never quite gels, never feels natural lived This is an attempt to penetrate into male relationships, but a thorough, sterile presentation is a hoax. No heart is in that living, breathing, or bleeding from this material. The “perfect son” spreads quickly in the kitchen.
