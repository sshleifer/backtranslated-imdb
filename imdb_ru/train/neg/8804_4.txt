Gorgeous CGI effects and a truly Oscar-worthy performance of Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks in this pony movie with one trick, since he got the best actor Oscar that year for Morgan Freeman, was a crime. <br /> <br /> This film is a conniving traitorous love letter to the baby boom generation, with the right wing's barely concealed prejudice, starting with the service of Forrest in Vietnam and ending with the “resolution” from Jenny to the end. <br /> <br /> Having said this, however, it is a very interesting and American film through and through. I found some parts of this film extremely offensive, Zemecis is stunned by this film almost to the level of Gampa himself. Perhaps that is what he wanted to say. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself: “What does Robert Zemeckis say about what makes a good American?” <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to have made the “right” choice and was in " the right place at the right time ”in the last 45 years. Those who make mistakes according to the director's vision seem to pay a high price. So, Zemeckis says that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even American quality?
