"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who are confronted with the body of Dracula. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to collect the body and steal his blood for an auction, this is an offer that they can hardly refuse. Soon, the students also end up mercilessly pursued by the killer vampires from the Vatican! "Dracula II: The Ascension" is a bit of an entertaining horror movie, with many flaws. There are some good bloody effects, such as a really cool double beheading scene, but I lack the violence for my taste. The film is getting quickly boring and forgotten, and there is absolutely no expectation. the atmospheric chillers of vampires from the 60s and early 70s, such as Bloody Lips, Dracula's Brides, or Lemore: A Children's Tale of the Supernatural, are just some of 4 out of 10.
