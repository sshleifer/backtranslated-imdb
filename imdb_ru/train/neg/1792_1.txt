Let me begin this review with the words: I love vampire films. They can suck (har han pun intended), and I will still love them, because the vampires are just great at the movies. Van Helsing, considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap, gave me pleasure because there were vampires there. You may ask: “What does this have to do with this film?” The answer is that I intend to tell you how terrible this film really is, that even a sucker (harharhar) for such vampire films as I can despise film like this one. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Van Helsing, a college professor who is far from convincing. He is a terrible actor, like everyone else in this film, and he wrote it to add salt to the wound. I, frankly, did not want to offend him, and I am sure that everyone had fun making this film, but it was really painful to watch it. I'm not sure why I watched it all; perhaps it was a painful craze, like watching an impending train crash: it's terrible, but you can't bring yourself to look away. His main fault is that it’s so boring, and the plot is pretty damn funny even for a sci-fi horror movie. <br /> <br /> But I digress. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mom. Of course, he does not know that it is she at that time; he just thinks that this is one of his students (which is still illegal and everything, but not so disgusting and creepy). <br /> <br /> If I were Van Helsing, I would at least have pulled out Oedipus when I found out I did something so rude. It would be very interesting if he just commented on it, but no. The essence is not even raised by any of the characters. As if the writer did not even think about it. I would, at least, make another character laugh at him and say, “Haha, you had sex with your mother,” which would be a little funny (although clearly immature). Probably I don’t have enough space, so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this movie: there is a vampire ninja fight with an old man. It would be funny, but the filmmakers expect us to take this seriously. Even watching a movie is not worth it to see how bad it is. Stay away, away from him, if you value your time at all. <br /> <br /> I will say one thing positive about the film: the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty slippery with his knife. It's like a minute piece where he swings around his knife and actually does elegant tricks. It would be boring in any other film, but here, unfortunately, that was the main point.
