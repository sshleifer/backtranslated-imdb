Could not believe it! Cropped sentences? Sadness for good! You know? That's right! Have real people ever said that? Do not think so. Clever Fatty! Fix your upper lip! The only reason why Gary Cooper is in film 2 instead of 0 is such a dish. The film as a whole is ridiculous if you donâ€™t like to watch endless air battles on biplanes. Still seemed endless. Think of all the Franchot Ton dialogs duplicated. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British, they come as Irish. Good advice - we, the British, cut off the words, not sentences. And somehow we manage at the same time draaaaaaaawl. But this is only if we were in a really good public (private for you) school.
