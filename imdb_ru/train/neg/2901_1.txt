The fact that there are positive reviews about Dan in “Real Life” on IMDb just makes me realize that their staff from janque is working hard trying to get people to watch this horrific movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words I have no idea where to start to describe a really terrible film that I watched last night - Dan in real life. Steve's characters in previous films made me believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialogue, but, like other posters, I felt embarrassed and embarrassed for the actors. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so contrived that the family It was Walton's family, and this film was already so many times that I was shocked when someone thought it was an original idea. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and get a pass on this terribly bad film. Don't believe everything you read on IMDb since the first comments were written by people sitting in another theater and watching a GOOD movie.
