I love to watch Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this is a bad excuse for a soft core porn film is unreasonably offensive, has nothing like the mind, and serves only as a means of self-promotion for Springer. Despite the fact that the film lasts 90 minutes, the film is disgustingly delaying, and I should have had the common sense to go. Just brutal.
