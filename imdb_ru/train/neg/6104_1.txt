“Fungicide” is perhaps the most incompetent, awkward, pitiful “film” that I have ever seen. The action is criminal, the direction is practically non-existent, and special effects seem to be connected, releasing the ape with learning difficulties on a defenseless laptop. <br /> <br /> I can’t hold back creativity, but I really believe that such things should not be done. I am sure that the creators of the “film” will say that, yes, the “film” was hampered by a low (as if nothing else) budget - but in this case they simply should not have worried. As such, they offered the world something so horrible, so doable that only the weak-minded could receive from him the simplest shadow of pleasure. <br /> <br /> Starting a “movie”, I was not the same as me. waiting for "citizen kane" or something. I was expecting a low budget little horror, perhaps with a bit of ingenuity, a hint of fun, and even some energy. What I received was the cinematic equivalent of the scarf used. <br /> <br /> Story? Well, our evil antihero scientist, who works in the basement of his parents, is manipulated with some kind of fat in a cup. Apparently, such a high-level science is the end result of years of research. Then his parents sent him to a strange place, like a hotel, to rest. There are other people out there who are terrible to write about. In any case, the scientist throws his test tube for several mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people. (Wow, I'm becoming suicidal, just writing a summary of the plot.) Our heroes save the day by blowing up a barrel of balsamic vinegar (attaching a “fuse” to it - really a piece of rope). The barrel inexplicably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the mushrooms. The end. (Thank God). <br /> <br /> This resume is as good as a “movie” (and actually makes it sound much more interesting than it actually is). It really never had to go through this stage of development (by which I mean a plot sketch drawn on the back of an envelope with pencils). Someone had to really come in and give someone an energetic shake and said "NO." <br /> <br /> And these "special effects". Well, they are "special" all right. This CGI is crazy. And made by a man whom I can only assume, believes that the bicycle pump is the pinnacle of modern technology. And when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of the 1984 computer graphics package, they are represented by actors shuffling, covered in sheets (I'm not joking). <br /> <br /> One of the most unforgivable things about the film is his laziness. This can be summed up by a scene in which the hero spins his weapon (a la Clint Eastwood) and then fails miserably to take him into his pockets. I mean, come on, I will do a couple of retries, and he could do it, but just leave everything as it is - very weak. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the money was spent on this garbage, shot by a video camera. The creators of the "films" should be ashamed to hang their heads and not be allowed to go up to fifty meters from any equipment for film production. <br /> <br /> I also believe that it is wrong that friends and family of creators come to IMDb and publish false reviews and give stupidly high ratings from users who give a completely inaccurate picture of the “film”. "Fungicide" - an absolute parody of the film. Mr. Vaskavidzh either very, very stupid, or very, very cynical.
