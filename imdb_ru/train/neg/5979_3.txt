Pokemon 3 - a little more than three or four episodes of the series, connected without the usual advertising. This story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, struggle, and decision, where everyone is satisfied at the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled (for the final credits!). Without explanation, everything is too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your childâ€™s world. Both of my sons love Pokemon, and thanks to the fact that I show an interest in what they like, we have become closer. Watching a movie in a movie theater is not the same as watching it in the tube, and my sons enjoy a full cinematic experience. I gave film 4, mostly from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
