Spoilers ahead, if you want to call them that ... <br /> <br /> I would almost recommend this film so people can really see 1/10. Where to start, we will start from the top ... <br /> <br /> HISTORY: Do not believe the premise - the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people eventually understand what mysterious events are. It's damn simple, go to the cabin movie without any intensity or "effort." <br /> <br /> SCRIPLES: I usually pay tribute to independent screenwriters, it's hard work when you start ... but this is shit. The story is flat - it leaves you without emotion the whole movie. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable, it boasts such lines: “Wow, you absolutely scared me” and “I was wondering if you ... if you wanted ... would you go with me to the cabin?”? It makes me want to pull out all my hair one strand at a time and feed it for myself. <br /> <br /> CHARACTERS: HOLY CRAP !!!! Some describe the characters as flat, I want to go one step further. and say that they actually have an inverse arch of symbols. They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost begin to act tvovat back ... <br /> <br /> Actors: Worse than characters, actors. They take already bad written characters and add to the terrible acting drama of high school. "Wow, you absolutely scared me" slowly - as if he were stupid. I could only complain about the actors for hours. <br /> <br /> SPECIFICATIONS: ILLUMINATION: The eight-year-old will be disappointed with the coverage of this film. Too dark in areas, too discolored in others. A director should not use light as an emotion until he learns to properly illuminate the main stage. Baby steps! SOUND: How many sound guys do you need to make a really scandalous movie? 9. With so many sound guys it should sound awesome, but the exact opposite happened. One scene stands out in particular, these guys are driving in a car, and the sound of the car changes with every angle of the camera ... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it. <br /> <br /> In any case, I don’t have enough space for complaints ... Rent it - I dare you ... Rent it and learn from it ... give it 1 point ... it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Signing ... Amanda Christmas
