"Massacre" - a film directed by Andrea Bianchi ("Burial Ground"), filmed by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this combination of great talent, you might think that this film would be a real bloody festival. It could not be further from this. The slaughter falls right on its face, as one of the most boring fraudulent films I've ever seen in Italian cinema. I actually struggled to stay awake during the movie, and I never had this problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> Massacre begins with the prostitute being killed with an ax from the side of the road. This scene was used in the Fulchi Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene, and it raises your expectations from a movie like an ax slaughter. Unfortunately, the next hour of the film is SO boring. In the film, horror films are shot, and in all these scenes a lot of character development takes place, but the characters in the film are so boring and bad, that your interest begins to leak. The last 30 minutes of the movie are not so bad, but it could still be much better. The blood in the film was pathetic, and since Fulci used most of the bloody scenes in the Nightmare Concert, there was nothing new here. The end of the film really left a nice twist, but there was still a lot of unanswered, and the continuity falls right through the floor. <br /> <br /> It was not a very good film, but for a real Italian horror-freak (like me) this film is obligatory, since it is very rare. 4/10 stars
