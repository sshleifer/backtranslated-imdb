Awful. This thriller should have been buried. What a piece of shit. A terrible letter, the characters are less than believable. Horrible Shlok !! Put a few B-stars in badly written POS to try and give him a little credit, but it fails miserably. If I didn't need to write ten lines about this film, I would give it the word word review, it starts with “sh” and ends with “it”. <br /> <br /> Terrible end, retarded. Who writes this crap The ending of this film is so invented, weak, as if they have no idea what to do with this storyline, or they just ran out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameos in this film. It's good that these actors leave, because it will become a career killer. Good for them that hardly anyone will see this. At least, no one is important, as future investors. It could have ended in a thousand different ways, but in fact I feel deceived because of my precious time. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about it, you will feel that you have wasted time that you never get back.
