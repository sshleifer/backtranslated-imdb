This film is in many ways similar to the movie "Hostel", except that * BAD * plays and is not very intense. There are elements of blood here, but you do not feel anything about the characters, which makes violence not very effective. Some parts are just weird ... as if someone was driving the snake down the throat. What's up with that? Should it be scary or bloody? This is just stupid. As for torture, they really are not (except for the fact that the guy is first blown up, which they still do not show). The main bad guy keeps saying “make them die slowly,” but the butcher kills them all very quickly. Death is all relatively fast. Yes, I watched the "no rating" version. So, in general, the film is not the worst, which I saw, but not very good. You will not miss anything if you miss it.
