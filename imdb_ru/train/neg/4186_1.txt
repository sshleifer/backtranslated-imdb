My comment has nothing to do with the political mood in the film. In fact, they completely coincide with mine. What attracts me is the fact that, from the point of view of the cinema, it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of history, motives or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neela that replacing lyrics with songs that cannot inspire anyone outside an exhausted audience is not the same as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by a writer or director. The silly story remains so, despite Neil Youngâ€™s cult heritage. The most childish scene is the scene in which the devil dances in a bar, slips a tonic on to an unsuspecting hero, who then goes to the dance floor to say the words of a young song to a heroine who does not know what happened. Somehow, these two come up with a scheme which they will go to the west coast in search ????? Sorry, Neal, be interested in music and leave the film to Steven Stills.
