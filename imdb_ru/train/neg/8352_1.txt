I rented this film because it falls under the genres of "romance" and "western" with the addition of some landscapes of the Grand Canyon. But if you expect a typical healthy romantic western, forget it. This film is pure trash! Romance between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even passed puberty and a HUMAN-AGED MAN! The child also craves other mocking men. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as a virtuous one, trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character basically follows this relationship. At first he tries to drive her away, but in the end he gives up and they leave for a happy, loving couple. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t understand how this film could please anyone except pedophiles.
