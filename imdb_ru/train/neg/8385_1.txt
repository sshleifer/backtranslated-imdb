Now I just realized that, having seen this film, I lost valuable precious moments of my life, I will never return. This film is not just bad, it's terrible. It reminded me of every stereotypical black comedy film ever created. <br /> <br /> I regret watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia believes that this is a problem of the race, obviously, “white” people do not like it because he does not have white actors. My friend, I think you will find the reason why nobody liked it, because watching the paint dries is much more interesting and more fun than this bunch of trivia. <br /> <br /> Please stop making shit movies
