This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen, and possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Actors and actresses were terrible, and it seemed that they tried their best to play their roles like assholes, tough guys, assholes, everyone knows it, etc. And the bomber himself was terrible. It looks like it was some kind of computer image from the time of Atari & Intellivision. At some point at the end of the film, when the Sasquatch army chased after the survivors, they shot and during the race it looked like a version of the donkey-horse for the poor man! And one hit the bullet, and the blood that flows from it was just awful animation. The other thing that annoyed was the music. Too much music (classical score or as you call it) throughout the film. It never ended. Oh yes, the film is also boring. Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen. I highly recommend taking your 3 bucks or something else they charge to rent this film and spend it on a gallon of gas or some valuable menu. Really awful!
