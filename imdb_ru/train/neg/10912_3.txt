I didn't really like this movie. It was not very funny, and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely one incredibly talented person, and although his acting was good at it, it just seemed like a waste of it. I mean, there were some roles that were nice and a bit funny in a nice way, but that's about it. The only thing that really caught my attention during all this heavy joke was that there were very good looking women, and Iâ€™m not the only one to watch the movie solely because of this, but in this case it was the only corner where you could find even the slightest case of atonement. In general, it was a couple of steps below the average movie! <br /> <br /> Last request: <br /> <br /> Theaters: I am so glad that I didn't spend too much money on it. <Br /> <br /> DVD purchase: hmmm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Rental: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor, then why not.
