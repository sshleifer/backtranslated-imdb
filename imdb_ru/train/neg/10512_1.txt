I made this film for one reason, Tom Savini, I respect his work, but it was a real disappointment, I had terrible cliches, half of the film was naked women, so-called “fallen angels”, running around, trying to act scary, oh Random black and white episodes of the Black Witch with a sick camera. Tom's character was really terrible, horrible script. And you have to love these lines that they use. "Is there anyone out there who is there, this is not funny" No, but your game was. I would like to give this film 0! Oh, the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ellie, Emilio, but they left Anthony, the Breakfast Club reunited in the forest of unforgivable acting.
