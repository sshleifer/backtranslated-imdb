I saw and loved the original film, and expected more from a remake than this one. <br /> <br /> GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the score and the visual effects, they were adequate, and the performances were fine (Tim Roth was excellent, the other directors were fine, and a handful of “supporting actors” coped well with extremely limited roles). The plots were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: escape from the city of monkeys was terrible. Characters walk in circles, and then somewhere in the middle of the city tunnels appear to be saved. Also, which escape route leads through each bedroom? <br /> <br /> The story has been trimmed to include as much action as possible. I like action movies, but there was more meat in the original movie, and he deserved more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the final was completely meaningless, as was presented. Without seeing the inevitable continuation, there is no reason for this. <br /> <br />
