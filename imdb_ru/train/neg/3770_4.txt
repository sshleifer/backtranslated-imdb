The intention of the director Warren Beatty to turn the famous comic of Chester Gould into a cartoon with live action (with Beatty playing the lead role as a square-jaw detective) had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia - rather unusual and intriguing from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is a must-have ham, fun for a while, but ultimately tiring. Dick Tracy is trying to bring down the gangster whims of the Big Boy, assisted by the loving Tess True Heart, but stumbled from an evil Breathing Mahoney. For the first half hour or so, the Oscar-winning artistic direction and set design are remarkably perceived, but as the plot creaks, as expected (without a real bite in the writing), things begin to freeze. Al Pacino received a surprise in the nomination "Supporting Oscar" as the bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (which is mainly used as a decorative prop) sings Stephen Sondheim's song "Sooner or later (I always get my man)", which received the award for best original song. Thank you very much, thanks to Beatty - who was committed to his vision - but the picture is too steep and calculated. He does not have enough heat. * 1/2 of ****
