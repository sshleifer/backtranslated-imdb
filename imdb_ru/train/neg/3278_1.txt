I have to say that many people claim that some of us have to keep up with the times, because the new film "The Dukes" is a modernized version. Oh PLEASE. If this is what you think is modernized, then Hollywood can save it. Many people on the MSN website also say that (and I quote): “You old shitty, you need to overcome this, except to eat.” Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24 years old, so I'm far from being OLD FOGGY, and I don't accept this, it was a shame for ALL THAT IS DANGEROUS. The only thing that was right in the title of the film was "HAZZARD". Was all profanity, smoking and drunkenness really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica was on several morning shows to discuss the film, and, frankly, I believe that it all came to her mind. She is by no means Daisy Herzog, perhaps a fluke, but definitely not Herzog. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not like Bo. They should have included the original cast in at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew that they would not approve the script. I mean, people come, even today's actors and actresses have a negative opinion, so some of you give positive comments.
