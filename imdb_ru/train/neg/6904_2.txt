As a recent film school graduate, it seems to me that at a time when the New Zealand film is reaching new heights, the general public seems to think that every New Zealand film is great. Zion's wedding proves that this is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> This is completely overestimated and not funny, and this is far from a “hilarious” movie that other IMDb users have commented on. The only really funny thing I found in this movie was Derek, the imitator, the black guy, but apart from this joke was the recycled crap we all heard before. <br /> <br /> Being a decent Panama man, I wanted to see how the film was going to deal with the Polynesian presentation. It was a complete game - I know that this is a supposed comedy, but I did not feel that the characters had something new to say about the Polynesian identity, even if it was mocking. I was very disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the character's relationship - Michaela was a player who just lounged with white women, turned his way a bit when Dusky Maiden came to town, has an epiphany that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship, and then, at the very last moment, rejects them and accepts its position as a Polynesian playboy for women palagas. I do not understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> In general, it was very disappointing. My whole family came to look at it, expecting to laugh, but in the end I was very proud to pay to watch it in the movies. The jokes are unconvincing at best, the acting, especially the girlfriends of Sefa, IS, and, frankly, I would be happy if I picked up one of these pirated copies of the film to save myself the price of a $ 15 ticket. /> <br /> I think that the only good thing that can be learned from the film is that this is the second step (number 2, of course, far superior to this film) in the birth of the Polynesian cinema. I hope that filmmakers from the Pacific in the future will be able to draw lessons from the Wedding of Sione, how not to reflect Polynesia, and say something more meaningful and reasonable. Even if it is done in a comedic style.
