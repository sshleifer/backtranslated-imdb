I really like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with brains and wit, not to mention the face, nursing and all the rest. Since I saw him in Thelma and Louise, I was worried about the thought he reminds me of? Troy did it for me. He is the new Bridget Bardo. The differences are obvious, of course. A man, an American, etc., But Bridget Bardot comes to mind, however. He is so beautiful that he is most effective when he plays against him. "Kalifornia" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His self-deprecating humor makes him a man, almost accessible. Fortunately, the "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only motionless photos of Pitt, half-naked in exquisite sprint positions, will decorate the walls of the legions of salivary fans. Strange, “Das Boot” is one of the great films of the second part of the XX century. What is Wolfgang Petersen in charge of? Well, I suppose it would be very difficult to say “no” with the opportunity to work with the new Bridget Bardot.
