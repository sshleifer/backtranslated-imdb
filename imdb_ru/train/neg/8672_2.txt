Rai ingredients many minions and a strange villain <br /> <br /> Start well, then go to Kenya well, but then the film goes on and on <br /> <br /> The sequence of events moves at a slow pace, and nothing much going on. <br /> <br /> Many stupid scenes, such as Kenyan police, show how pranksters, especially Sharath. <br /> <br /> The climax also dragged on <br /> <br /> Rajeev Paradise copes with its work Music is fine, only 1 song works, and this is the last TOOFAN Camera work is good <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol as usual, Chunky behaves like a monkey, and his serious scenes are ridiculous, Naseer is fine, the heroines are pure wood. Amrish Puri is not even half as scary as he was at TRIDEV, the rest are fine
