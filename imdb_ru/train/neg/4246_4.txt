Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her faithful son (Ron Silver) to find the reclusive former film star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estel finds good. I may have been called Bancroft Talks because the actress attacks this indefinite comedy / drama / sentimental material throughout its life. A hot or cold director Sydney Lumet cannot achieve a stable rhythm, and the constant replay of Bancroft is not at all minimized by the director â€” he keeps it straight ahead: sweet, tearful and ranting. Estelle becomes a brake in this scenario (not that the thinly plotted plot has much in common except). Silver and colleagues in the film Carrie Fisher and Katherine Hicks end up doing almost nothing but supporting the star, and everyone is being trampled by her Hamming. * 1/2 of ****
