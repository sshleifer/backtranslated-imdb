Blimey! I am shocked to learn that this is a small world and that we are all interconnected. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunn expressed it much better in one sentence. "No man is an island." The game was not bad. The children did everything they had, but sometimes the thread became so thin that I could not follow her, and the only real “hero” in the film goes to jail after being tortured by a maid. I dont know. I just don't get it. Well then.
