The "Treasure of the Nation" is about as overvalued and exaggerated as possible. Nicolas Cage is by no means a believable fighter, and this film is not “Indiana Jones.” People who compared this film with the classic trilogy "Indian Jones", seriously distanced themselves from their rocker. <br /> <br /> I can’t understand for which target audience this film was shot. Maybe a teenage audience will like it, but I find it absolutely ridiculous. I also can not imagine that adults or young people would find this a great movie. Simply put: at best, everything is in order. <br /> <br /> National treasure is unimaginable and not inspired, borrowing what it has in the Da Vinci Code. I would recommend to wait for the release of this film in 2006 and pass on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The very idea that it is so easy to steal the Declaration of Independence and get around all of Washington and Philadelphia with this (although it never hurt him once), fight the “bad guys” and experience what to be a “non-stop action” is absurd. I especially liked the scene with the Declaration, folded in its tube, lying in the middle of a busy road, while the cars swept past her without damaging her. O brother! <br /> <br /> He reminded me of this episode of “Brady Bunch” when they go to an amusement park, and Mr. Brady is losing his architectural plans. In addition, this episode of "Brady Bunch" was much better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a huge treasure, which no one considers existing in the secret ruins of the United States, is strange. Literally, there are thousands of undisclosed "priceless" items in this treasure. Yes, right!! Funny!! <br /> <br /> Even worse, the speed and accuracy that Cage finds and finds out which assumptions should be the “hard” keys to these ancient riddles are pre-poster !!! Oh .. humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances of Cage, Voight and other actors of the National Treasure are as hard, wooden and flat as they are. However, when you work with such a lousy dialogue, it’s hard to blame the actor for it 100%. <br /> <br /> “The Treasure of the Nation” is a good movie that is worth seeing once. I can't recommend it beyond that, and would definitely NOT buy it, besides that, a scavenger's outlandish hunt for mess. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you need to see it first .......
