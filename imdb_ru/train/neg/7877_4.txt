The creators of this film have created a future in which not only abortion and birth control are illegal in every state, but women are also persecuted for murder and sent to serve long prison terms. In other words, this film is the nightmare of every liberal! The political agenda here is so tough, and the style of the film is so reserved that it quickly loses steam. No matter which side you are on, I would recommend skipping it.
