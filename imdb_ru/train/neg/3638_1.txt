The film tells about the unresolved problems of France with its colonial heritage in Western (French-speaking) Africa through the tangled and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (here symbolically represents her nation). This is often an attractive and complex portrait of a young woman’s desire to come to terms with the traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and with the desire of the nation to turn to the “other” that she once “owned” and shaped. This is reflected in the way in which it is fully centered around the concept of traveling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; remembered the realities for the undisputed modern political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> Characters all play a symbolic, albeit limited and unconvincing role. France, intended to be a visual as well as a totem representation of contemporary French society, leaves her indifferent to her plight as she seems to be still permeated with the same naivety that she enjoyed as a child, actually a child, whom she seems to have more by reality. The rest of the rag-tag is simply forgotten. Black Africans are, to put it mildly, offensive impressionist portraits of formerly colonized peoples, which are currently colonized by the director’s mistreatment of her materials. They are nothing more than a dark and dying background, on which France resembles a bleat-like image is surprised to find a world that it has never known, and hoping for one that will never be found in Cameroon.
