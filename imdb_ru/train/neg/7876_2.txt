At the panel discussion, which I attended after watching this film, the filmmakers stated that it was necessary to look at this not as a film, but at a thought provoker. Well, the only thoughts that were provoked by me were about the time spent watching the film. The film's tricks (documentary style, futuristic setting) served as a distraction from what should have been a thoughtful study of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views â€” usually a very boring film that preaches to the choir.
