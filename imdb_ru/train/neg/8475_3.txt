(NOTE: I thought that I would be the only one who would write what I did below, but I see that others agree. I think it was pretty obvious â€” it overdosed the bits with the bait. I wrote :) <br / > <br /> The owners went on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) alone and trapped in the house. This means that there is no milk, but the cat, to its relief, finds a bunch of canned tuna. However, to his dismay, he cannot find the opener. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the little mouse in the house has her ... and cat bait. This is a vile rodent, who continues to tease Sylvester with a vomer, and then tears it off at the last second. Sylvester does his best to open a can of tuna, but cannot do this. <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing story, and why they make the sadistic mouse a "good guy" outside of me. It looks like some cartoons about Tom and Jerry, where poor Tom always gets the worst of it, although many times a little mouse starts a conflict!
