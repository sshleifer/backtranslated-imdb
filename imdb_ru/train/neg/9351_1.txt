This is only the second time I stopped a video / DVD halfway through. <br /> <br /> At first I wanted to give this film a doubt, even though it was superficial and cliche Stupid ... And joyless, stupid and pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was like after school, directed by a strange ninth grade child who thinks no one understands him ... creepy and sad, with an off-screen narration that only the most deceived teenagers will think about poetry ... and about singing, and ... no, really, about the suffering of a poor child ... <br /> <br /> Enough, especially when it turns into an arrogant, clumsy, and offensive groovy orange. And did I mention singing? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but, of course, the one I felt least forced to watch. I do not recommend this to anyone.
