the lid of the box makes this film really good, don't be fooled. Splashes of the university came out in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but this film sucks. characters are so annoying. only classroom teacher. There is no conspiracy in this film, who the hell will ever produce this waste of film? <br /> <br /> Ahead is a spoiler <br /> <br /> In this the teacher dies, the woman, we all know that we must have a surviving woman, if you are going to break the rules, do it in a good horror movie and not in this waste
