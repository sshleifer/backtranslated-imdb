I saw this movie in a real movie theater (perhaps for $ 2) with my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12, I think, and really in scary movies. I remember being excited to see him, because my cool uncle allowed us to choose a movie (and we probably will never be able to do it again!), And sooo disappointed afterwards !! Just boring and not scary. The only thing I can remember is Corky Pigeon of Silver Spoons, and it wasn’t that great, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before, and it always seemed like the worst. It was from what I can remember, one of the most boring, not scary, a waste of our collective 6 dollars and a waste of the film. I read some reviews that said it was worth a look, and I said: “Everyone has his own too,” but I would not even worry. Not even so bad, it's good.
