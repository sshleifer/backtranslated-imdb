Absolute rubbish, worse fighting scenes than the 20-year-old Van Damme film or American ninja, etc. sculptures. <Br /> <br /> See how really bad this film is, maybe it was acceptable in the 80s, but this is a 2006 film, I donâ€™t really like this film, since it was not born in the 80s e years. <br /> <br /> If you like real war movies, check out Tony Jaa in Ong Bak and Defender. These are real martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> Look and see this today. You can see unpredictable humor in how dark it is.
