What happened to Robert Pretentious Altman? Did he save on lighting? In this boring movie, everything was so dark that it was funny. I mean, have you ever seen a lawyer's office, where everyone works by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. In fact, don’t waste your time on what Altman does: it’s all a pretentious waste of a movie.
