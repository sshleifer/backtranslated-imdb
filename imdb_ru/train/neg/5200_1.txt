This film is very, very, very bad. I have seen the best films. <br /> <br /> It was a bit of stress, but not too much to make you jump out of the chair. It begins slowly with increasing voltage. What is not a success. At least if you ask me. Although at some moments or moments I have to say that it was a little funny when people were shot and how they fell. <br /> <br /> They had to do something like “Scary Movie,” then this could be the best movie. Because I only watched fragments of the film, skipping scenes, and it became boring throughout the film. I have to say that I felt sleepy while watching this movie, so I’m sure I can say that it’s not worth it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time even thinking about doing something with this movie, except to leave it where it already is. Somewhere very dusty ..
