I could not believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. Everything starts very slowly, the backgrounds of the Nuremberg processes become clear step by step, among the Germans with a funny English accent, but then, suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, viewers can see the most shocking, terrifying scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very important that people see such frames (although I absolutely disagree with people who say that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this type of material), but in this film itâ€™s it was completely ridiculous. It was simply intended to improve the impact of the usual series. It should have shaken the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly simple. Instead of trying to move us with well-made scenes, inspiring dialogue or interesting looks, the audience is plagued by horrible images of prisoners made of skin and bones. It shows no respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
