On this day and in the era of incredible special effects from films, this one was very disappointed. Actors seemed tough and not inspired, as was the dialogue. Nowadays, westerns are not so popular in Hollywood, but films like “Silverado” prove that someone else knows how to do good. Given this, it is difficult to imagine that anyone will go to any costs of release, especially creating such a weak film like this one. If you love and are looking for a good Western, keep looking!
