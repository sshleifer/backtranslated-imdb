Well, I found this film in my old film bundle, and it looked pretty good on the cover, but the film really sucks !! Well, the first swimmer story was pretty good, but it took some time to figure it out, then the boy story was completely backward! It was not even scary! His dream sounds like a bedtime story for a small child. Then the news girls were also completely backward. I'm sure someone will call the news guy and ask him to go with you. But he ended great when she stabbed him, and she was in the hospital, and she saw him on TV, and he told her all this junk. Then there was this rather funny story about a guy who brought back the dead people .. God, it’s so stupid that I’m not even going to talk about it anymore. The latter was the best. It was not so scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool ... yes, the girl is obsessed and kills all her classmates or something like that. Then, when they all tell each other their dreams, the losers get on the bus (FOR HELL, AHAHAHA) and see all the people from their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
