Since I am from Hungary, I heard that many people talked better and better about Uwetigtigris, but in fact I donâ€™t understand the reason for all this fuss. <br /> <br /> I liked many moments of the film, some quotes really inspired me, but the stereotypical characters are again present, as in every Hungarian film, and the story is also quite boring. I liked the first half, but then I got bored, and then I found that the whole movie was just boring. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Peter, as always, is good, Revichki is also great, but others are only here ... doing nothing. <br /> <br /> How many more years should pass for a GOOD Hungarian film ???
