Two things are good in this film, these are two unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in the film, is young and flexible, with an appearance that still covers her body today, steals the very beginning, in which everything she is, and it's all. She is obviously just starting out because her game has improved with her next projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the assessment of then-known composer Christopher (Chris) Yang is what prevents this bitch from getting one star ... yes I know that another star is not so much, but in The case with this movie is a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just a stupid, senseless horror of a couple of students who are trying to remove the hostel because they were torn off, one after another offended by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah ... we are all know where it goes. <br /> <br /> See the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
