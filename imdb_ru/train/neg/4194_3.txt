This film began very promisingly with a story about a director who loses his sight, and a blind woman who will definitely help him. However, somewhere in the middle it seemed that the writers did not know where to go. <br /> <br /> One incredible event followed another (Russia must have been very small, because they all collide with each other. All the time), the main character’s motivation is clear (why does she still follow him after , how did they get off the ship? Why isn't she trying to borrow a cell phone on the ship to call someone?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (did the story with the mother and the guy have to be funny? And what was the story with the younger sister?) . Despite all this seemingly arbitrary plot, the film turned out to be quite predictable. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this is that he had a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the visual effects and the score were very beautiful, and the actors of the main characters were also good. So it could be a really good movie ... but it’s not.
