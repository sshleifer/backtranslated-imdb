Wow, the worst thing about this episode was the price of a house 40 years ago. I am the preface, saying that I am not a fan of narrated episodes. If the story / actors / etc. worth their salt, they should be able to convey the main part of the story without having to read it, reminding me of characters who cannot come up with, but rely on TV shows. The nickname was tedious and boring, but some like these things, it's just not my cup, oh tea. They could have saved the story, but at least make it more believable and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or, perhaps, from a newspaper reporter or something else. Sniffing stuff like Peugeot, located in a house that has a special semi-circular road, yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree under which he stood, because he is nowhere to be seen on the road or on the stretch. Sloppy editing when she drives into the driveway (which seems to be the hundredth time) exactly who are these 2 guys you see at 24 meters 30, going to the car when she drives up to the driveway of an abandoned house? Close-ups of the cart also overdid it, like, for example, some junior student studying drama, having first discovered the zoom feature on his cell. I could continue to take apart, but it can be almost as boring as this episode. This continued, and the true goal seemed to be to use absolutely all the footage they shot when Elaine drove the Newport gig. I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a pleasant jingle game, and my voice over told us all about the 8-track player, the automatic top, etc. The only thing I have to say about his one thing is that he just ends abruptly. No loose ends, nothing explained or terminated. Not much to notice, I suspect that most have already changed the channel or dozed off towards the end.
