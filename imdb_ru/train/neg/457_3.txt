Of course, I love short cartoons, but I did not like this one. Naturally, children will like it. But then again, I am no longer a child (although I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> I will not tell you anything about this story, for the simple reason that there is no story. How is it possible that the dragon cartoon was nominated for an Oscar ?! Well ... I think this is because the people of the 30s were not so much more pleased than they are now. In the present, where we live, everything must happen quickly. Watch movies now, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to be slow. This is really a shame. I would like to live in the 30s, because it seems so peaceful. But every time there are ups and downs, I think ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion: if you like music (and frogs), you will have to watch this cartoon. Otherwise, do not waste your time on this.
