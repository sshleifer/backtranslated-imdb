I must say, I am very surprised by the high ratings of this film. I found it absolutely idiotic. Does a mother get “visions” when she touches certain things or people? And the one thing she touched twice made her vision go on ... It just seemed so ridiculous. Didi Pfiffer performed terribly, I thought. She was very annoying. The girl who played Laurie did a good job, as did most of the supporting actors for what they had to work with. <br /> <br /> I usually love LMN and is very open when it comes to films, but this film seemed to have a funny plot and excessive acting, and it was not for me.
