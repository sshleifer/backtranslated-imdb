At what point does a good movie become bad? When the movie switches from “to view” to “where is this switch & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF? Thank God for a DVD like this, which you can take in the library - for free! In addition, thank God for "fast forward" on a DVD player. I feel sorry for those people who were deceived at the box office. <br /> <br /> At some point (I just forgot when, because now it’s just a blur), our “hero” Luke Wilson starts to run through; I think he was looking for a taxi. It was at that moment when I gave up, realizing that I didn’t care if he found his trip or ran into a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the film was interesting was when Luke Wilson was rising from the dumpster, with a hair dryer in his hand, and for the first time met “the heroine” Uma Thurman. This scene ended with the criminal who snatched the wallet, helplessly dangling from the fire escape, far above the departing Luke and Uma. Was it the last time the movie was funny, and when was it the scene? Ten minutes later? <br /> <br /> Every time the movie tried to be “fun,” he couldn't do it. Every time the film approached “excitement,” he lost consciousness, heading in the opposite direction. When the musical score could help squeeze life out of this impasse, the sound track remained empty and quiet. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were not needed and were beyond the limp; damage to sets and props is unnecessary and childish. When Uma turned into a crazy ex-girlfriend, it seemed to me that I was watching "a 40-year-old virgin meets reading matter"; it was then that I realized that there was no going back, because I really didn’t like the “40-year-old virgin” and “Pulp Fiction”. <br /> <br /> The ghost of Luke Wilson, Rainn Wilson (also seen in the grim “The Last Mimzy”) adds nothing but insult to injury in this terrible film. Rein Wilson, the king of television boredom, must remain in the same terrible Hi, Raine Wilson! Leave the full-length movies alone! Every time Uma's rival Anna Faris appeared on the screen, I expected Jason, Freddie or some horrible monster to pop up because of the landscape; one day you will see Anna Faris in "Scary Movie" is all you ever see, never mind, fil m, it does not matter, the medium. The character played by Wanda Sykes was simply terrible and completely inappropriate in this film.
