The director, wearing chains and leather, warned viewers at the SF Frameline film festival on Friday night that we were going to watch an "experimental" film. Experimental? Leave the camcorder in the back seat of the car, let the cassette roll down and edit all meaningless traces of vision. A winding maneuvering road show that starts nowhere and does not occupy the audience. Unreasonable violence, opening the film, led to the fact that in the Castro theater is not one patron. I would have left too, but my cine friend needed a trip home, and he should have seen that the worst had come to an end. By the time the lights came on, the public had lost much weight. Warm applause. Proforma questions the director, who seemed pleased with the product. Avoid this movie!
