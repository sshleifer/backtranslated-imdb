(aka: The Bloodthirster leads the dance) <br /> <br /> There are a lot of naked babies in this film with the addition of a couple of lesbian scenes. The film is to be held in Ireland, but more like Rome and the Adriatic for me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited to the count's island castle for the weekend. One by one, they seem to be losing their heads because of a running madman. <br /> <br /> It's not very scary or bloody, and the rooms look as if they are lit by spotlights, even if the candles are lit. Go figure ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Duplication is worse than usual, and the plot serves only as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by the euro horror film Alfredo Rizzo, one of them. <br /> <br /> Pretty boring 2 out of 10
