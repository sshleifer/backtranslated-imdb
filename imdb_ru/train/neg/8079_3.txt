Another movie with an interesting background and some amazing special effects that fall right into the trash. <br /> <br /> Boring tutorials and performances (with the exception of the beautiful Annabelle Schofield, who is much prettier than a brunette and probably deserves the best material and the most serious Charlton Heston) get the rating of a real smelly. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to watch Heston show his usual qualities and show how bad this film really is. He even plays in a plot that interests me, just to see how he is connected to the main line of the film. The way they finally decided, is that they did not. It just falls from the end. <br /> <br /> Indeed. Do not waste your time on this.
