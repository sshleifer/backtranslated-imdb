I really wanted this film to be liked, because the critics were unkind <br /> <br /> (to put it mildly) ... but it was awful. Really awful Poor <br /> <br /> acted, reckless script, stupid manual ... Watch this movie was <br /> <br /> like a car accident - you want to look away, but keep watching </ br> # 2 because you want to see how dirty it will be. Well, the machine <br /> <br /> is broken, and there are no survivors. On the other hand, cinema <br /> <br /> was pleasant, made me want to go on vacation, at least in order to clear myself of this wicked <br /> <br />
