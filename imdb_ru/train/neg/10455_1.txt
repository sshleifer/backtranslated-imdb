$ 25,000 Pyramid Tips: Deep Blue Sea. Shocks. Slither. Eight strange wanderers. <br /> <br /> Pyramid category: movies that were more fun and more exciting than Airplane Snakes. <br /> <br /> Hell, with this definition, I would have had to include the relatively painful journey of Ted and Elaine on a plane! surpasses the Serpent and in laughter, and in the thrill. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that it is not even close to the mother of all the unintentionally intentional funny snake films: Anaconda! In addition to never seeing the JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer casting in the same movie, you had Jon Voight, who was filming cinema robbery all the time. His last scene alone represents everything that SOAP has tried and failed to do, like the film “so funny, it's fun.” <br /> <br /> In the end, “Snakes on the Plane” is the ultimate proof that studio leaders and fans make the worst employees possible. Each big stage was so much discussed and discussed last year, and all that was left for fun at the opening night was the number of fan flop sweats that had to be removed in my theater. I heard more mocking laughter here than in “According to Jim” studio recording.
