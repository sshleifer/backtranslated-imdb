If you study Wells and want to see how far he fell after Citizen Kane, this film will prove it. The cheap justification for turning the main character into a self-styled dummy to explain how he can get into such an unfinished scheme does not explain the absurd theatrical production in the courtroom and the ridiculous plot twists that ultimately occur. Do not take into account the high rating of this film in the database, like me; all I can guess is that there are a lot of old fans of Wells and Hayworth.
