This film "Alamo: thirteen days before glory" is complete nonsense. The game is terrible, it is too patriotic, and its historical accuracy is not always at its best (historians will have a field day). He has a few good points, but not enough to maintain interest, because itâ€™s too long. Rating * out **********.
