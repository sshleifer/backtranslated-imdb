Shirley Jackson's novel "Ghost Hill House" is an atmospheric tale of terror that conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well thought out, and the chills are well organized. Phantom masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Chiller 1963 The Ghost is closely related to the book, but also adds its details to the plot. Fortunately, there are very few of them, and therefore the horror of the book and the chills on the screen look even better. Black and white photography only adds to the eeriness of the film. Fine! <br /> <br /> And then Jan de Beaune did it. In 1999, a remake of the film The Haunting hit the cinema, if you can call it a remake. Why they should have done a remake of the 1963 film is a mystery in itself, but for now let's look at the film itself. <br /> <br /> It starts on average, like most horror movies. The set used for Hill House is beautiful and strangely mysterious, and within a few minutes it seems that the film will actually be a fairly honest retelling. And then comes the first fear: the wire harpsichord cuts through the female face (Dr. Marrowâ€™s assistant). This is ridiculous, and, in truth, it almost burst into tears. <br /> <br /> Since then, the film just rolls down. As the movie continues, the acting seems somewhat wooden, the character of Owen Wilson is especially annoying (so this is a relief when he is decapitated by a chimney). <br /> <br /> Because of the special effects of this film, this is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very outdated. There are many examples, so I will not list them. <br /> <br /> In general, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you look at the original chiller or, alternatively, buy Shirley Jackson's novel. But please stay away from it. And, if you decide to watch it, watch it on TV (as many channels like to show this film, and not the original) or rent it cheaply, but please do not buy it, whatever you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final Rating: 4/10
