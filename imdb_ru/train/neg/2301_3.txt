Does anyone think that this show actually helps some people, or does it only make people angry who watch it? when I flip through channels and see this show, I’m half looking out of painful curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. what I don’t know is if his viewers are like him or they are good people and they think they will have a better life if they listen to what he says. Pat Roberson does not matter much. he is an old man who thinks the old way. fear of a curse no longer has the same effect as before (thank god). Now, if someone answers my question, I will dodge the lightning until the end of eternity.
