I hated that shit every Friday, as part of the tgif he was on, and I constantly sucked big nonsense every week. If you want to see something funny, watch “No, if you tell me” with Candace Cameron and Fred Savage in the lead roles, this is really fun, shows why no one makes a good movie career after a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate these kids, and Bob Saghet has to jump off the bridge to make this shitty holiday someday. I saw funny things everywhere, but here. I write 10 lines! Look "sold out" to see the smallest thing that humanity can offer on the way to art and entertainment.
