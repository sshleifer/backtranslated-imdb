The first few minutes of The Bodyguard have charm: they start with a creeping text from the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson tells his future victims in “Pulp Fiction”), continues in two schools of karate in New York, arguing about humanity : Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), And then Chiba appears, playing himself; he immediately stops the hijacking of the plane and smashes the bottle in half with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, intentional or unintentional, is soon lamented by a disconnected history, lack of action for long periods of time, and the poor quality of any existing action. Simply put, this is why “Bodyguard” is an unbearable movie to watch: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what is happening. <br /> <br /> 2) Almost no fights. <br /> <br /> 3) The fights that take place there are short and horribly shot. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is gorgeous, her face is gorgeous. Only for them I give the “Bodyguard” the 2nd star out of 10. This film makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours.
