As is often the case, films about heroes who hate themselves usually do not contribute to good drama. "Download Nancy" is no exception. Supposedly, she is based on a true story about a woman who was murdered by her own will by someone she meets via the Internet. <br /> <br /> The main character is Nancy (Maria Bello), who is married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who developed the game of golf, which his company successfully sold in various bars and bars / restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has almost no positive qualities (except for his ability to be successful in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a gloomy and stern expression. He does not sympathize with his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to the protection of prostitutes. When his wife asks for sex, he punishes her, masturbating instead in her presence. <br /> <br /> Nancy is equally a unicameral character. Not only did she have a hopeless 15-year marriage, she was also sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up (fortunately, there are no memories of this story in the film). Her self-loathing takes the form of self-destruction, and as a result she is forced to heal. However, she so despises her therapist that she cannot make any progress. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis via the Internet. He is a kind of sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money, while causing a tremendous amount of pain. It turned out that Louis has two children, but they no longer see them (the mother of the children no longer wants to have anything in common with him). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is to have painful sex with Louis first and then force him to kill her. There is a particularly unpleasant scene when Louis has sex with Nancy while at the same time chopping her vaginal area with a piece of glass. These scenes are shown as memories after Louis visits Albert, who ties him up and hits him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has a double plan to see Albert: 1) scold him for Nancy's treatment and 2) enjoy the beatings that he receives. It takes some time before Louis learns about the fate of Nancy. First, he makes Albert do him a favor to take his dog with a relative so that someone can take care of it in the future. Of course, Nancy’s fate is that Louis eventually suffocated from her to death (but at first he showed some doubts when he made it clear that he had “feelings” to her). Soon we learn that Louis is sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Nancy. <br /> <br /> What exactly are we supposed to take away from a movie like “Download Nancy”? Should we pity victims of sexual abuse and domestic abuse? Is this the main thing in the film? Is Nancy's sympathy really justified? I do not think so. The film writers create a solid person in the form of Albert, a man so detached from his emotions that he is responsible for the decline of Nancy. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I think no. They have a disgusting Louis, a man who makes a living by hurting, approaches and scolds Albert for neglecting Nancy. In addition, his expression of love for Nancy (before he kills her) should show his “sensitive side”. <br /> <br /> In the end, it doesn’t matter whether the directors have identified where the various characters in the film have their sympathies. They are so bent on tickling their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence that Nancy’s download becomes nothing more than an exercise in bad taste and soft pornography.
