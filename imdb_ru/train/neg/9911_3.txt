If you have favorite actors, Peter Falk, Rip Thorn, George Seagal, and Bill Cobbs, you don't need Billy Burke, Culio, or other distractions. Mass talent is completely wasted in “Three days in Vegas,” with the accusation, right on the script. My neighbor's vacation films are just as interesting as this misguided road film. If you want to know how to use veterans with a good script, see the “Crew”. There are really no redemptive factors here, and to look at these wonderful actors fighting such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the small script deceives the audience without actually letting the actors work. - MERK
