Brilliant technology. But what good is this if the content is empty and stupid? I left after <30 minutes of observation, bored and annoyed. <br /> <br /> The administration of the theater returned the money to me, but the time dragged on and the aggravation remained. I was not due to the stars whose names were the main attraction. <br /> <br /> George, Meryl, Bill - I hope you paid well. Perhaps you even liked it. Therefore, I apologize for my limited mind. Many people liked it too. Look at the comments. Well, oh well ... <br /> <br /> I would like to know - what remotely redeems in the story of Mr. Fox, husband, father, citizen, ... whatever.
