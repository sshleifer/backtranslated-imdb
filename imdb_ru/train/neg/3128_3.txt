... from this horrible movie! There are so many bad things in this film: acting, scripts, directing, editing, etc. Whats surprising is that something goes up and turns out to be the worst. Music! I noted that there are two composers in the film. This should be the reason that in every single frame there is music, the absolute worst "D" style of the film. They have never heard of the expression "less means more." It was so painful to listen, I muffled the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You should feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I am sure that they did not see such roles in the twilight of their career. Take a look at your own risk.
