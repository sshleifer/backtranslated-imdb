It was the slogan "in the tradition of the American pie" that fooled me at the hire of this film. What I got was a piece of junk-style trash, with the main difference that, compared to this, Jackass film looks like citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie made me regret that I rewarded other films of 1 out of 10, because now I can’t go below that. Because of this, some bad movies look like cinematic exploits. <br /> <br /> I actually turned it off after 45 minutes, and I very rarely do that. But it was just too boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some people really award it to 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Drop your head when you were a kid? Or was it the very first movie you’ve ever seen, so there’s nothing to compare? Are you still a virgin and breasts - is this all you have ever thought about? At least something must be wrong. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this. Even if you are in the mood for a simple movie that requires no thinking, choose something else, or you will regret it for sure.
