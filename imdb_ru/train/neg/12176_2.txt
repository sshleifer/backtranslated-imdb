Original Trancers is by no means a great movie. He had huge holes in the plot and very little internal logic. However, it was interesting, better done than most low-budget B-films, and could be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems of most flock sequels. The plot is thin enough to see through, and the letter is tasteless. It seems that the people behind this film felt that the return of familiar faces of the first film would have been enough, and did not worry about anything else. Even experienced Class B actors, such as Tim Tomerson and Jeffrey Combs, could not get this film out of the mud. <br /> <br /> Short storyline: Jack Det (Thomrson) - a policeman from the future who was sent in 1985 to save the ancestors of his government members. Trancers II occurs six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Det is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first film, and both live with Hap Ashby, the man whom Det was sent back in time to protect. Whistler's brother (the bad guy from the first film) was discovered to go back in time to create an army of trance, people turned into pointless killing zombies to kill Ashby. Complicating Jackâ€™s mission is that his first wife, who died long before Jack went into the past, was also sent back to stop Brother Whistler, and now Jack discovers that he is working with her. <br /> <br /> I have two real problems with this movie. One of them is that the method of creating transomics in this film is radically different from the methods used in the first film. What is annoying is the fact that in a rather bad example of Soviet revisionism they behave as if it was always a technique. <br /> <br /> It also annoys me that the love triangle between Det, Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) gives very little time to the screen. This especially bothered me because it was much more interesting than the plot of the film. It seemed to me that it was just something that was added to fill the space in the film. Alice's character, in particular, seems completely unrelated to the fact that she reunites with her husband only to find out that he is married again, which makes her either very superficial or very poorly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can come up with this movie is if you are interested in watching the entire Trancers series (there are currently a total of six films). Otherwise, even if you are a fan of the original Trancers, stay away from this cool sequel.
