This is really a pathetic little movie. Admittedly, the original (un) holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns from the third, “The Last Conflict,” which degenerates into a ridiculous storyline halfway through the film, apparently just to provide the necessary over-tangled deaths that everyone has by now the meaning of the series "Omen". But then, in order to impose this bounced television film (be careful with the buyers of the Omen kit delivered on DVD - do not be fooled by the widescreen transmission ratio, this was and is a strictly small screen) at the end of the series, in general, beautiful demonic chillers the former producer and producer of the first three films, Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would give up the plot if it were, apart from the usual death scenes (hopelessly moderated for the feelings of television) and some of the worst acts I have seen. Everyone involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed that this parody ever appeared on the screen, not to mention the disguise under the name of Omen. If my review convinces one person to avoid this mess, I will feel better.
