The Broadway defeat of Ira Levin comes to the screen with almost no meat on the bones, a mysterious story with a few tricks and turns, but no one deserves care. Frustrated writer Michael Kane plans to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his; his cunning plan may include the killing of a talented child who has Kane's excited husband in his arms. The first act, in which all are presented, is painfully dead, and Kane does everything he can, an actor, to maintain pace. Dayan Cannon is mistakenly considered his wife (she is too clever and quick-witted to be given a mockery), and Christopher Reeve (in the middle part of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable as the best writer. These three characters and the annoying neighbor Irene Worth are so vague that what happens after installation is hardly recorded until the second act begins. The direction of Sidney Lumet is indistinct and indistinct, the scenery is inconclusive and poorly lit, and the final is a complete disaster. The actors are struggling to give the script some substance, but with such thin material we see only their painstaking efforts. * 1/2 of ****
