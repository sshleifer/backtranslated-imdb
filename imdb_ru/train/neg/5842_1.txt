What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well, with a sequence of headings, but itâ€™s about as good as it turns out. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the rats turn into monsters and gather for killer fun. Acting is not so bad, but the script is meaningless, and the film is not even terrible, despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It is really amazing that some group collected this bag of garbage and thoughts it would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. This is rubbish, and I urge you not to spend a minute of your life on this! One of ten.
