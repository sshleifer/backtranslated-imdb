A remake of Alejandro Amenabar Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as the lead. For the dubious advantage of the English sound track, we tolerate Tom Cruise's heartless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his person, but we are usually given some character under this to keep our interest. His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could be between his character and Cruise or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is an actor's exercise, which involves the use of masks to free an actor, to enrich his presentation of character with verbal and physical language means. Cruzâ€™s disguise only painfully underlines his inadequacy as an actor. See the original 1997 Amenabar, open your eyes!
