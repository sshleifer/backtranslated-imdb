What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking about? Was Hollywood responsible for this parody, or can I be comforted by the idea that someone who did not speak English as their native language just completely missed the classic Charlotte Bronte? I don’t think I can improve the commentary that I read below, so I just rephrase it: “Jane Eyre is a great great book, the screenwriter should sometime read it. It is true that the two roles of this film were unfortunately wrong. But sorry for the actors, because the screenwriter missed all the best scenes. A dialogue that will help you understand that Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a general sense of fun ... removed from the script. Marriage proposal, fortune teller ... gone. Hints, half-joking, half sincere, feel that Jane, like a fabulous sprite from old England, is coming to save Rochester in his despair ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and the interaction of Jane with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find the 1983 mini-series (?) With Timothy Dalton.
