Now, please, do not start calling me names such as “non-patriotic,” “eccentric,” and so on. <br /> <br /> The biggest duration of this film (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake . No editing - it seems that J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much. Even Lagaan lasted 4 hours - but he was interesting and gave the message. <br /> <br /> It is based on real incidents and real people. Glory to this, but do we really need repeated scenes of war? In addition, the focus was constantly moving from one battalion / squadron to another, and it was impossible to track them all. <br /> <br /> Between the skirmishes there were songs about loneliness, love longing and related things. There were friendly conversations. At first, this gave some relief from the violence, but later it became so monotonous that it was even possible to correctly predict the nature of the upcoming conversation. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers walk around as if they were lions in the jungle, completely unaware that the enemy was lurking somewhere nearby? And when they were shot, it caused sympathy, but apparently they did not remember that they were so self-confident in their security. <br /> <br /> The music was melodic, and the lyrics were soulful, but did not fit the film. It is better to listen to them on the soundtrack than in the film. <br /> <br /> Actor's help was saving grace: from experienced veterans such as Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan to relative newcomers such as Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Khanna, all acted. like a professional. Manoj Badjpayi and Ashutosh Rana deserve special mention in order to lighten the mood when necessary. <br /> <br /> Dialogues ranged from brilliant (“From Madhuri .. with love !!”) to illogical / monotonous (“Pakistan from zyad”). Muslim Hindusthan Mein Hain "). And gossip, consisting of all MC, BC, C and F-words, was not really required. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to pay homage to the brave Indian soldiers, but he tries too hard and ultimately fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve better tribute.
