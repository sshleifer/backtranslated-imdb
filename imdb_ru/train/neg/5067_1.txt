It is quite simple. Friends is a comedy with a very simple humor, intended for teenagers and young people, with an innocent sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It is also painfully obvious that by the end they had desperately tried to do this over the last 10 seasons, most likely so that they could say that they won in season 9 The problem is that Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with excellent writing, Friends had (and I am very generous here) at most 5 or 6 good seasons, and then 4 bottomless seasons. <br /> <br /> This was a soap opera with reworked humor and reworked character traits that were not so good, so start with what got worse for the hundredth time when you saw them. It's so hard for me to understand why people appreciate it so highly. This is really terrible.
