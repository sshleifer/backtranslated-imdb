SWING! is an important film, because it is one of the remaining works, shot black and filmed in the 1930s. Many of these films have simply gone so badly that they cannot be seen, but this one is in pretty good shape. It is also a good chance to see many talented black performers of that period right after the heyday of the old Cotton Club - a time that is almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is historically important and there are some great performances, itâ€™s also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of that era - including the prima donna, which will spoil the show, and an unknown surprise, which appears from nowhere where to save the day. However, the writing is just awful and sometimes a bit messy - and it projects images of Black America, which some may find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really begins, you are considered a slacker who lives from his hardworking wife (a popular stereotype of the time), and when he is caught by vanity (which, by the way, completely overlaps this role), they have a fight like to the scene from WWE Smackdown! And one lady wants to cut another lady with a straight razor - a really dirty scene! Later in the film, when the prima donna behaves disgustingly, her husband slaps her face and everyone applauds him! It seems that sometimes the film wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, PLUS, that they can't even do it well - with some of the worst actions I've seen in a very long time. <Br /> <br /> However, if you can look past the lousy staging in almost every way (with cheesy characters, bad play and directing and bad writing), this may be worth a look, so you can see great singing and dancing to the sound is like catching a glimpse of a forgotten black culture. Just do not say that I did not warn you about the acting game - this is really very bad!
