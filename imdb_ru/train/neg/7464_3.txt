I have not watched the entire movie. I could not watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour, and I suggest to everyone who is thinking about how to watch it stop before removing the disc from the box. <br /> <br /> I like films about the mafia, both tragic and comic, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano is just trying too hard to make the audience laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Cattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely exaggerated and he lacks subtlety or gullibility - all his strange manners seem far-fetched - Chris Kattan obviously "plays", but does not play a role - this puts you out of action. Each scene is absolutely predictable, the “comedy event” that happens on the set becomes obvious as soon as each scene is presented. In comedies such as Mr. Bean, disasters caused by the title character are funny, because you can empathize with the motives of the characters and the original event, and the situation in which the character turns out is not telegraphed. Corky, however, creates the feeling that he deliberately screwed up in a desperate attempt to make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> If Chris didn’t play such an alien character (who never links up with other characters in the movie) and whose behavior is completely inexplicable (except for trying to cause laughter), and the comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotypical all the jokes seemed too familiar) this film could be watched. But it is not. Do not look.
