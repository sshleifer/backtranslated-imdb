I went to see this film, based on a review by Siskel and Ebert; I was not only deceived, but also took a few friends with me, and I spent the rest of the day apologizing for making them sit in this meaningless crap. After that, I never went to watch a movie based solely on the advice of Siskel and Ebert.
