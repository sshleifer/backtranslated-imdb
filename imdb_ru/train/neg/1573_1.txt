I don’t understand how this piece of garbage was filmed. The only actor that I generally know is Judge Reinhold, an experienced actor whose presence is only an excuse for his launch. <br /> <br /> I don’t even think it is worth the Rotten Tomato Reward, this film really makes films B cinematic enjoyment. The car is on the highway with the police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> The script should be written on the back of the cigarette box. Most television movies are terrible, but it overrides the word. Check out the bridge acting, pure Oscar stuff.
