Another great movie is Costa Gavras. This is an excellent presentation of the situation in Latin America and the US participation in Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be accurate, but it is a fact that the United States was deeply involved in the upheavals and support of the Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Despite this, although the spirit of the film follows the typical Left / Communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer, and his films are always biased. For example, he presents US actions as cruel and inhuman, presenting Tupamarosâ€™s extremist activities as something positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America, this was a blessing for the United States. got involved. Europe is filled with poor Eastern European prostitutes. I have never heard of poor prostituted Uruguayan or Chilean girls, as is the case in most Eastern European countries. The United States waged a dirty war, and God bless us so that the monster of Soviet communism will be defeated. Unfortunately, the United States should have done the same as in Latin America (and other places), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world, as Costa Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. If Matamoros came to power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> In general, this film follows the corrupt and untenable left ideology of the past and tries to present it as idealistic and moral. right.
