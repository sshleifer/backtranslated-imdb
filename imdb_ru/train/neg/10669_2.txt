The ensemble of uninteresting and incredible characters twists and turns its way through an inaccurate plot, which can be interesting, if only you can force yourself to take care. This “twist and turn” I’m talking about does not refer to the story (which contains all the obscurity of the tuna casserole recipe), but to the director’s inability to keep the faces of the characters even in the center of the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very beautiful nostrils and a left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the film is the big names that they are convinced have done. If you think that this movie never went to the cinema, despite the fact that it stars all the stars, you may be inclined to think that something stinks. <br /> <br /> And indeed it is.
