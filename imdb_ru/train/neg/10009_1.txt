This film is one giant cargo of pant. Paul Schroeder is completely lost in his bad script. And his leadership is as comatose as possible without his sleepwalking during the process. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, this is Woody Harrelson, whom I usually love when he is properly filmed. He plays a “walking man”, a homosexual man from the District of Columbia, who plays for a social company to the bored wives of the Washington elite. He could not have been more one-dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and jumped in front of an eskimo camera on a stick. His “southern accent” lies in the fact that the “from the rack” version decreases from the beginning to the end of each line that he supplies, as if the heat and humidity of the South still take away every ounce of energy he has. It is monotonous. But this is not the worst accent in the film. His “boyfriend,” played by Moritz Bleibtro, is trying to influence some clumsy accent in the Middle East, which can hardly convey the bad lines written for him. He is not able to ride, despite the fact that in real life he is German and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! This is a good reason to play someone else, isn't it? <br /> <br /> This film is bad, from beginning to end, from the plot, the script, the direction, the camera work to the leading plays. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to get through this movie with their tact. In fact, all three are great, despite being in a very bad movie. Unfortunately, no one could ever be good enough to atone for this endless series of flaws. If you like these three actresses, see them in another. This movie is not worth your time.
