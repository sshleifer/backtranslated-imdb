Labor comedy has I.R.S.S. agent Tony Randall, investigating an eccentric farming family in Maryland that never paid taxes; Debbie Reynolds - the daughter of a tomboy farmer who puts pressure on the not so disinterested taxman. Debbie certainly did her share of the worst theatrical sitcoms during this period — and this one is neither better nor worse than the others. The picture begins brightly, but the flags halfway turn insane and insane. Randall fits Reynolds well, but the vehicle itself beats chemistry. Based on the novel by G.E. “Overgrown May Buds”, Bates with poor sound mixing, forcing all the actors to sound like they were stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****
