Time is precious. This film is not I have to learn to ignore critics who are delighted with such small films as Fargo and this complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was overcrowded, and everyone had the same reaction: is this a movie that critics are crazy about? What a piece of shit! <br /> <br /> The hook of this film is a moveable black daughter, searching for and searching for her family white trash. Get it? <br /> <br /> The game is great. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, decoration, editing, sound) is approximately 2 steps above the 60-minute history. The characters are petty and foolish. I was offended by the fact that these people could not understand each other about what was obvious to the audience; the audience whispered on the screen of the movie what the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> It was much more interesting for me to wash clothes.
