I try to be very objective when I watch a low-budget film. I also use less weight for independent and low-budget productions compared to large budgets. I expect almost flawlessness from large budget productions and their studios. Therefore, I apply more stringent criteria to the main releases of the studio. But this film was just stupid. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was an incredible high school student with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in her character or her actions that dragged you into her world. In addition, to make this film more mysterious, lighting in certain scenes did not create a mood, especially in stock. <br /> <br /> Once again a disappointing film, which I could give only three points.
