This film had the potential to be much more than it was. But he not only can not deliver, but at the same time causes nauseating righteous preaching. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even more flattering than at midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he should have a southern accent, which he noticeably loses several times in each scene. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino does his job, but he seems to be following this film and collecting wages. He, as usual, is good, but hardly outstanding. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast - add a romantic interest to the woman who added little to the story. Speaking of this story, the tangled story of who really care about where Cusack is the boy of a smug mayor who just needs to find the “right thing” to be ready. <br /> <br /> People do not act here. The character of Cusack eventually loses all authority from which, without revealing him, preaching and nausea. The last scene makes the penultimate stupidity seem deep. This is also completely inaccurate, but I will not enter into law. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie by numbers. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes, and then it’s really a preaching, proselytizing, smug film in the last hour. Better with pointless crap than this pile of garbage.
