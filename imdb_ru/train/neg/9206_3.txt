The topic seems rather outdated today. Adapted for television from the book of Rhone Jaffe; we travel and stumble upon a fantastic existence. Four college students are deeply involved in the live version of the Labyrinths and Dragons board game (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, young Tom Hanks, is too deep in the fantasy world. His comrades must come to his aid and save him from self-harm. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace complete the game with four of us. The cast is composed of veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Ann Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> At the moment, he seems clumsy and tame. But the main thing that you can see is to see Tom Hanks between his salad days "Bosom Buddies" and his big splash SPLASH on a silver screen. The youngest viewer will have more fun.
