This deadly rattle of a direct action to the video from the Tremor Series contains sixty inspired seconds (saw blade: you will know about it when you see it) and more tedious and filling than you can shake with a stick. Tremors 4 were apparently shot with a terribly low budget. This means that they had enough mojo special effects for only three or four minutes of the precious worm in humans, tops. Dim, cliche-causing cast and battered writing ensure that the remaining one and a half hours of Tremor 4 experience will be felt for at least fifteen thousand years. Only hardcore Tremors fans can sit down, much less enjoy this movie. If you are not among them - do not worry.
