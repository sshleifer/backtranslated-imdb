Avoid the US version. This is with added footage from the USA and the worst dubbing you've ever heard, possibly made by New York fans. Rewriting is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black guy from the Bronx pronounces Tiba's voice. I could not watch the whole movie, it was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version, see other great Chiba people, such as Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
