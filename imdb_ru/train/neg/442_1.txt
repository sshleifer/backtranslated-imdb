This game was made by Sega. I did not expect much from Sega, but I did not expect this junk either. First of all, the corners of the camera work in this game against you. Motorcycle is your vehicle. Motorcycle - the worst part in the game. Whenever you encounter something, you simply stick to it and do not move. You will never fall off your bike or crash for that matter. The main character hardly speaks, although he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are terrible. You ride through the trees on your bike. The camera makes the fight with the enemy impossible. This game is not even worth renting.
