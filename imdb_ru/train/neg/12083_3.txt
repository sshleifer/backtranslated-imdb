Ooh! ... I think. It is hard to say. It's hard to have emotions about a movie that has no emotions. This film is as barren as a surgeonâ€™s scalpel. For settlement, it has several stone pillars, several stone places, several stone crosses and several stone actors. They have no emotions! The only thing that saves this film is the fact that this is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a stunningly written literary subject. Dubbing was actually not that bad. The voices remained loyal to the boring, gloomy, dreary, life-affirming atmosphere of the film. I saw this version of "Hamlet" in the fabulous Theater of Science 3000 three times, and each of the three times I was on the verge of turning off the TV, despite the fact that MST 3K. inspiring drama that deserves much better.
