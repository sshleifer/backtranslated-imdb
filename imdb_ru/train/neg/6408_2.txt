UPA films are surprisingly well priced on IMDb, despite the fact that the quality of animation lags behind the light years of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM. Unfortunately, due to the growing costs of creating cute cartoons with a high frame rate and a beautiful background, the style of the UPA (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. In the end, the films were very cheap, and they received several Oscars to "prove" that the cartoons were mainstream. As a result, lousy animation became the norm, and this trend did not change until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This film of the UPA is one of the earliest. The characters are very simple (simpler, and they would use stick figures), and the background was ugly - simple line art with flowers added very casually (often with a sponge and rarely completely fill the objects). <br /> <br /> With regard to history, this is a story about jive with a strong jazz style. Someone will like it, but someone will be very, very loud. This is the traditional story of Frankie and Johnny, and due to filming and everything else, this is probably not a very good movie for children. Damn, because of the animation and jazz, for me this is also not a very good movie! Some read my review and no doubt think that I am an eccentric (and I am to some extent). However, I love animated films, and a little of this minimalist UPA style goes a very, very long way, and you can't seriously consider them great works of art - just very, very quickly made cartoons. Do not pay attention to Oscar and try to watch classic cartoons or something else!
