if my grandmother made films, they probably would have played a much better figure than this ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mom, dad and son) are fine. Especially the mother, she is a good actress, and the child also turns out to be good, especially in scenes where he has to be scary. But does the director know the meaning of the words “storyline”, “thriller” and “good script”? The script has no evolving atmosphere to become an indefinite thing. If you like trees chasing you, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay home and sleep. oh ... there was actually something funny: a 2001 film, but we couldn't understand it, because the image is very bad (like on a mini DVD), and the cars are so old (like the 70s and 80s) .
