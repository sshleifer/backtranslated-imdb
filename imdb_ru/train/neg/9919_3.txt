At the discovery of the Maltese Story, Mr. A. Guinness bore a striking resemblance to Noel Trusard, which I fully expected his first words to be "Some women need a regular blow - like gongs" or something like fatigue from the whole world. his dialogue is hardly immortal prose, and even the Master would have problems with his realization. In fact, Mr. Guinness wanders through the picture, as if he is looking for a trick and cannot find it. And therein lies the fatal weakness of the entire film. Mr. J. Hawkins also gives up early and ends up giving the play "Jack Hawkins" without an ounce of individuality. He could be spliced ​​with any of a dozen British war movies. Many of the suspects in the early fifties usually appear and make them tread to a very small target. The Luftwaffe did not succeed in bombing Malta in subjection in much the same way as it could not bring London to its knees. The courage of the Maltese people in the face of continuing danger was recognized by the king, and the island was awarded the Cross of St. George. a worthy subject you might think of a film, but Maltese Story does not even fit the term worthy in its most protective sense. This creates the impression that you hastily come together to meet the deadline, possibly before the actors lost live.
