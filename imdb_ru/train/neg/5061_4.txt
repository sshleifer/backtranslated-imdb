Anurag Basu, who was one of the directors of the KUCCH TO HAI flop, made his debut in this film. <br /> <br /> The film was ahead of its time, although there is a story in it that is no different from others, and it was closest to HAWAS, which came out a week before, and, fortunately, it was better and brought the best result. <br /> <br /> The film begins well, Maliki’s wine is well manifested in the beginning, although the scene with Emraan-Malik is too rough / vulgar. /> <br /> The scenes between Emraan and Malik are well developed, and the turn in the story where Ashmit confronts Emraan is great. <br /> <br /> The tempo moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge, but Emraan’s friend’s second track is not entirely convincing <br /> <br /> Also, the cop track seems half spoiled <br /> <br /> The ending is too boring <br /> <br /> Directed by Anurag Basu Well, the music is a winner, all the songs were amazing. The filming work was stunning. <br /> <br /> Emraan played his disobedient series well, this role gave him fame, and although he continued to play such roles and annoyed in this film, he was excellent, Ashmit also was good in his role this time, he did a good job and one of his only good performances, and he looked too good, Malika was great in her role, especially in the second half, but her delivery on a scale was sometimes not up to standard. Unfortunately, she rarely showed such potential in other films. Raj Juzzi is fine
