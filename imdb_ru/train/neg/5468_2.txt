I absolutely adore the series The Poisonous Avenger, but this weak offer of the people of the troms made no sense, and it made me yawn all the time. <br /> <br /> Leaking nuclear plant (and growing grass near it) makes young people from Tromaville High go crazy, which makes them join gangs, have sex, explode and so on. Besides, in a high school some kind of monster gets divorced ... My God, this film is a mess. <br /> <br /> After that, the actors almost ceased their efforts, and they have to do it. The (supposed) replay began to get on my nerves after about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointment. 2/10.
