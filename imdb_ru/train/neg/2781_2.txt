This is a film about Thai history filmed in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this film because I thought that it corresponds to many Thai films that I watched and watched, in which there are Thai actors who speak Thai and have crazy martial arts. Well, it is not. This film was shot entirely in English, jam-packed with English-speaking actors, and its production values ​​are so terrible that it is ridiculously bad ... but not ridiculous! Who can we blame for this garbage? The acting, dialogue and most sets were pretty bad. Some fight scenes looked like they were set by a local high school drama club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but some of them were just cheap animation inserted on the screen, which provided a particularly gentle effect. He has one big scene of battles in the open air in an epic style, where several thousand additional people can run around the field in costume, but when we see two armies clashing in battle - HA! Well and a joke! The film has a pair of beauties. What a pity that they did not show a little more skin. At least it would be something that guys could appreciate. Do not worry
