The premise of this film is revealed on the DVD box. Textile worker develops a wonderful fabric that does not deteriorate. But with the film does not work. Instead, he attacks 45 minutes, sorting out the preamble, before he makes a big discovery. Since it is not very useful for viewers to see how a gifted child solves things, this is a strange choice: the film is successfully deprived of the opportunity to deal with any topic. As soon as fabric is discovered, the film establishes too quickly that both major industrialists and colleagues at work want the invention to be destroyed, with the result that the film is only two unconvincing movements; invent chemicals and run away from oppressors. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why someone would call it a comedy. The tone is not funny or funny. This is more like a serious social criticism of the time: capitalism distorts both supply chains and production. Which, in turn, prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, this is probably true, but without some attitude to this fact, the film is just a serious argument. You need a very broad definition of comedy to find them here. <br /> <br /> This is more like a British acquaintance with John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
