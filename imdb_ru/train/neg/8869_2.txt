With the release of Farligt förflutet, the Swedish film industry has really reached the bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived a peaceful life with his wife Maria (Regina Lund) for the past years. One day, Stephen’s old friend comes with a favor to ask him. Stefan has to do a little courier work. He must bring a suitcase filled with heroine, at the Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately, in Germany things are not going as planned, and Stefan is now in big trouble. It is always a pleasure to watch a Swedish film that violates the traditional family-dramatic style. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how the film should be written, shot or shot, the result can only be disastrous. Content can be concluded in: bad behavior, disjointed plot and idiotic dialogues. The only highlight in the film is the unprovoked sex scene with the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. It only lasts a few seconds, leaving approximately 90 minutes of clean, let's say that this is actually shit.
