This film was made for people who found the Gremlins too serious and Malicious to hardcore. As in many films about critters / trolls / gremlins of the 80s, this film is bad. The sad part is that there is no highlight in this comment. This is just bad and not funny. <br /> <br /> The problem with this miniature monster film is that it actually tries to be fun and ultimately does it as successfully as Howie Mundell in “Walk Like A”. The man. What turned the other horror films of the 80s into classics is that they sincerely tried to be scary, but they were hilarious because they failed so badly. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes, Bettina Hirsch) that she had the ability to comedy before she started making this film. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, seeing a strange little mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor in a brown coat and throwing balls into the pool to an exile from Lost Guys is fun, but not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> The most annoying part of the film is the character of Paul. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough for you to start fast rewinding from the moment of his first scene, until the final credits stopped only once to see the scene where the munchie throws balls at the guy ... it's not that I did. br /> <br /> So, the point is that run, do not go to the nearest blockbuster, shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having grapes to put this pile of garbage on the shelves.
