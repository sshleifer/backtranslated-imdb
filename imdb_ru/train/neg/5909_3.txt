The first 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved that he only has one good idea for the rest of the film. The absolute lowest common denominator of humor. Painful browsing. Complete routine. Written without a doubt in less than a week, like the first. Give Meyers a detour and lock him up in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let him go until he develops a decent script for anything, anything. He is capable of that. These things Austin Powers just confused. <br /> <br /> Let the Golden Member sink without a trace.
