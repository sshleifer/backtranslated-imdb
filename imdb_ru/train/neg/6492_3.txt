I was not completely sure what to expect from the genre of comedy, drama, fantasy, fantasy, but given the actors involved, I thought I would do it. The tone of the film felt awkward, looking at the patches of each of the genres, but I never felt completely balanced, so in the end I gave up trying and focused on the cinematography and individual performances, which, in my opinion, were good overall, given each character had shallow depth due to the nature of the story (we will not give out anything here). I have to say that he felt a lot longer than his 96-minute lead time, and not in a good way. In the end, I was looking for closure, some measure of satisfaction, but this was not the smart or ingenious part I was hoping for. I think that Tony mistakenly thought that what he did at the end of the film gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to test the previous 95 minutes with an ill-conceived conclusion. In the end, I feel betrayed. IMO, it would be better to leave it without end as a work of art ... simply. Or ... I may have completely missed the point :)
