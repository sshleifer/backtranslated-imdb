Without a doubt, the worst movie I have seen for a long time. I endured to the end, because, of course, there must be something here, but no. The plot, when it does not deal with cliché, thunders to the point of non-existence; dialogue, which should be a street, just beaten; characters never develop outside of sketches; The scenery is cliché. Worse, considering his co-directors, photography is only so-so. <br /> <br /> Comments in other places that raise it along with Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are far from being true; The lives of the saints lack their innovations, not to mention the depth and shading. In short, their craft. A ruthless editor would probably cut him to a decent 30-minute short plot, but in its current form it is a 6th grade film project, implemented on a scale of a million pounds; incoherent and bloated with their claims. The fact that he received funding (of course, only because of the name Rankin), while the struggle for cash with other small films depressing for the British film industry.
