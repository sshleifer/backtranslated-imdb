Why do people take good stuff and feel the need to change it somehow? After reading the book on which this film is supposedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little in the original book. I entered this film with low expectations - I knew that he would have a crappy tele-study - but he could not even meet them. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only relationship he has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, this is the story of a completely different character, who was given the same name. They had just spat in the face of every fan of the Way of Carlito there; adding insult to injury, throwing Louis Guzmán, who plays a key character in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that now that this film has been made, no other film will be made. Turning to the original, untouched material in The Way of Carlito - what I really wanted would see. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books, as well as interviews with fantastic science fiction material, and they could make a brilliant biography of the most dangerous figure of the underworld in Australia, instead they made a scandalous film about an abnormal, but a strangely pathetic little trickster of time (although Eric Bana’s performance was accurate). Now we will never see the real initial rise and fall of Carlito. <br /> <br /> Three stars is that if you look at it simply as a separate film, it’s not so bad - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but he can be good at other roles) and the story is not so bad. Even Puffy Combs suits his role. But they completely misunderstand the nature of the underworld at the time (I'm a little criminalist) - something that was correct in the original film and books (written by then-attorney, and now Judge Edwin Torres). <br /> <br /> The fact is that this is not loneliness - this is perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.
