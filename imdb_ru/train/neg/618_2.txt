Perhaps one of the worst teen slasher I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad moments of the movie, which pretty much covers the whole movie. First of all, something that no one can avoid: HORRIBLE ACTION. I swear, they picked up random kids from the street based on how they looked. Secondly, BAD / CONTINUOUS CHARACTERISTIC WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You barely know half the children who are killed here. All you think is that they deserve it anyway. The stuffed character was exaggerated, and the cheap robbery of other great fantasy killers, such as Freddie or Pinhead. Read more: BAD DIALOGUE: The scarecrow was full of horrible single-row lines that made you laugh just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's go, let's find a few small animals to torture them!" Actually just leaves you with a raised eyebrow. Last but not least: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? How is 30? For the sake of God, his head goes bald. I could have said much more about this film, for example, about cheap special effects, about “school films”, but the essence is clear. This is just a bad movie at worst. As for what I found "good" in the film: - Entertaining for those who have low, low, low standards - Will help put sleep to sleep. Very cheap laugh or even giggle.
