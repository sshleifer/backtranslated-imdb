There are two reasons why I did not give 1 to this film. One of the reasons is some actors (for example, Malcolm McDowell and Gwyneth Walsh) who tried to play at their usually good level of acting. However, in many scenes they were somehow blocked by a bad script. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the cool idea and appearance of cyborg, which is very different from most other such roles that I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as possible. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, poor script performance. And it seemed that it was the first film for many actors. It may be an interesting story, but they completely failed.
