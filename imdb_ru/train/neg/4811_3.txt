I watched the Canadian videotape of this film as The Witcher, which somehow ended up in New York State. The sound was pretty bad, I had to raise it to 7/8 to hear it, and the soundtrack often suppressed the dialogue. Orson Welles was a worse talker, and some of his conversations and others passed through the echo chamber. The ghostly figure that continues to appear distorted her voice. Some private signatures would really help! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or Satanists (at the end it is said that the group should not represent any real group!) They perform a ritual in which they undress and cause a miscarriage by cutting the doll. A woman who had a miscarriage and her husband moved to a town called “Lilith”, where he was offered a job in a toy factory. Despite the fact that one of the AKA of this film, apparently, is "Toy Factory", we will never see him, and it is referred to only occasionally. <br /> <br /> On the way to Lilith, her husband loses patience because of her questions that his new boss, Mr. Caton, wanted to know about their religious beliefs. He aggressively drives a car and makes another car get out of the way and explode. After the arrival of the police, she takes the doll that fell out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the film. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mr. Caton and all the townspeople are witches, and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage, although she is not aware of this. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, which she did not really know about. <br /> <br /> Some of the images in the film have some influence, but in general the film is not very attractive. The film seems a bit erratic, and this, no doubt, largely due to re-editing and adding new videos. The original version, according to the final credits, was called Necromancy - Life for Life. DVD Magic may allow us to see both versions on the same disc, but the re-release of this film is probably not a priority.
