Just watched this movie on TV, and I have to admit, I was a little surprised that it was even on. There were so many stupid things, unrest and bad editing, that it would be better to watch the old episode of "Sesame Street". With the acting, everything was fine, but please, you can really feel the feeling “Right on video”. The acting team made this film a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the film, but just wait ten minutes before it ends to hear it. Believe me, you won't even notice the difference.
