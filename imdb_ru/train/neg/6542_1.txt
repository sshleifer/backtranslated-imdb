The person who wrote the brilliant review of this erroneous project should be associated with the writer / director / star - or, in fact, the same person who challenges the rational thinking that this film will be attractive to everyone who is not tightly woven inner circle. How about this? You want to make a film - tell a story; entertainment; attract me with bright characters. Of course, you can do it skillfully, without bowing to commercial elements intended for mass appeal. However, do not turn to the elements of artistic expression in a vacuum, in which the audience is constantly trying to grab onto the meager subject threads. If a dreamy psychological thread touches me, make concrete easier to buy.
