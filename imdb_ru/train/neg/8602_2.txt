Everything you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene where the guy falls into the lake and is eaten. Then they start throwing title credits: you see "Slugs!" in big letters, shortly afterwards - "Cinema". Phew! I was worried that I accidentally tuned in to "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show." In any case, from there the film turns into a killer holiday. You see how the guy cut off his hand because he had bullets in a garden glove, two people attack the bullets during sex, and the girl falling on his back in the underground passage stops deadly bullets. This is a pretty stupid film that falls into the category of "so bad, it's good." He also filmed so badly with such a granular film that you are shocked to learn that he was filmed in 1988 (I think, in 1974). I am VERY surprised that he got the same high score as here, because most people here don't like movies of this type. But if you want a movie that tries to be scary, but ultimately makes you laugh, this is one of your top candidates.
