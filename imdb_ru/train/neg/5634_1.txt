The poster, which called it “meaningless and meaningless,” literally took the words that I would use in my theme. The only thing I would add is “impassive”. For a film made by a real couple and showing a lot of graphic sex scenes, this film manages to turn what should be in a hot situation into something more than ice cold. Defoe and Kolagrande look boring during sex scenes, and the viewer could also take Valium and get it over with. In addition, please, women in the audience have seen too many used tampons at one time, and any guy who is turned on to see how Willem Defoe pulls a bloody tampon from his wife's vagina really needs therapy. <br /> <br /> I think that the key to the film (if there is one) is the scene of the restaurant, where the waiter explains to the ever-drowsy Dapho what “destroyed jambalaya” is. (All the ingredients of the dish are still separated, not stewed together). This film is “deconstructed thriller”. Here are all the elements: a creepy, isolated house, a dead spouse, creepy violins on the bill, a strange caretaker who comes and goes, as he pleases, death in a car accident and almost death, characters with a secret past. Basically, every thriller cliché you can think about, but NOTHING unites. Everything just sits there and never fits into a consistent plot or even an artsy mood. The restaurant Dafoe drives through the "deconstructed Jambalaya". The future renters of this mess would be nice to leave this deconstructed thriller on the shelf of a video store.
