We entered this film because my husband enjoyed the original version of “My Favorite Martian”. We had our 6 year old daughter. She wanted to leave halfway through the movie, which was good with both her parents! The parts we saw were only occasionally humorous, mostly either too stupid or rude. I expect that this film may appeal to children between the ages of 9 and 12, if so. It is definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I heard, the original series was much better, and if you are going to “relive the past,” you will probably be disappointed.
