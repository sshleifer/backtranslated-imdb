When I was a child in the 1970s, children's matinees were held in the local theater every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (does anyone remember them?). They showed this thing one year at Christmas. Me and some friends went to see it. I was expecting a great Santa Claus movie. What I got was terribly dubbed (you can tell) and a really creepy movie. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Merlin Maga (do not ask me what these two people are doing in the same film), Satan is fighting (some kind of joker dressed as a stupid devil with horns!). Images made me cringe in the chair. From the beginning, I always found Santa creepy, so it didn't help. The guy in the suit of Satan did not help. But what REALLY terrified me was the wooden deer that pulled the Santa's sleigh. When he turned them on, the eerie sound that they made and the movements - I remember how I had nightmares about these things! All these years, I still remember how I left this theater more than alarmed by what I saw. My friends were scared by this too. I just saw the announcement of this on TV, and ALL these nightmares began to roar. This is a creepy, disturbing little Christmas movie that will probably scare off the pants of any little child who sees him. Avoid this - if you really do not want to punish your children. It gets 1.
