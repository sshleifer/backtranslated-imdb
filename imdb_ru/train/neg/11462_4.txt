I generally like monster movies. Even if they are implausible and stupid. But this film is hard to love when it is so unbelievable and stupid, and tries to take everything seriously. As in a really chic way. <br /> <br /> Although the idea is somewhat factual, as if the Orcs are known for killing the Great White Sharks, it is very difficult to find it scary when I can't help but just see the evil Shamu destroying things. Especially the scene where some building exploded because of the work of the Orcs ... and while it explodes, this thing jumps out of the water, and it seemed to me that I was watching a show in Sea World with fireworks. In addition, they kill a lot of scary moments before even hinting at what will happen. On top of that, JAWS takes several hits. It's like, "hey, look, we are valid, and we can come up with the BEST reasons why Orc attacks." <br /> <br /> Yes, ignoring your glaring ups in logic, of course, But JAWS had one thing that your movie doesnâ€™t have. This is scary. Yes, it is implausible. Yes, this is somewhat outrageous. But, frankly, a fact or not, the killer Shark is not as scary as the Great White. And an unsuccessful attempt at character development and writing a letter only hurts him. Even Jaws Revenge is worse than this.
