A vampire henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar prostitute in this extremely budgetary horror comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments on this film. I will accept this for mass hallucinations, but nonetheless it is confusing. The only saving factor (and this is me very generous here) may be Grandfather, who is the only half-dead character in all this mess. Do not waste your money or time. In fact, here's a tip for you: if Troma releases it on DVD, but does NOT do it yourself, in all likelihood, this is crap. <br /> <br /> Additional material for Troma DVD: Comment with Omar and Kirk; second comment with actors and deleted scenes; bloopers; interactivity throms; radiation march; Clip from "Terror Firmer"; Theatrical trailer, the trailers for the films "Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My rating: D
