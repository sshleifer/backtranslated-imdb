This film is definitely one of the worst I've ever seen. And I do not mean it in a good way. We wanted to see a shitty horror / thriller, so we chose the one that seemed the most disgusting in the store. This time the film was everything we expected. And more! (or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by placing a red transparent plastic in front of the camera to create the impression that we see through the eyes of the killer rats. And the script? Do not even get me into the script ... And when you thought that it could not be worse, it turns out that the first part of the film was an Oscar compared to the final. <br /> Take it from me, this movie is hilarious, if you are into horror horror movies, but if you want a GOOD movie, keep watching. It's not for you.
