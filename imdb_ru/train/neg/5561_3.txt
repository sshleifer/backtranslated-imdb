I saw this movie called “Tied up”. In general, I liked Dolph's films, so I tried this one. It was not worth it. I read some of the previous comments about the box that seduces viewers. Do not be fooled. This is a bad movie at best. The game does not exist. The plot, which is small from one, is very predictable. The film in some places seems to have split. It just stinks the place up. Not even worth the price of a cheap nightly rental. Being a little Dolph fan, I kept waiting to see him in action. By the end of the film, you will still be waiting. It is best to avoid this movie and spend your time watching almost everything else.
