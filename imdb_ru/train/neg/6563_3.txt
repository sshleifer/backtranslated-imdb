Bugs Bunny accidentally hits the South Pole while trying to rest in Florida. Where he meets a little penquin, whom he is trying to save from an eskimo. This short try and penquin is adorable, but in the end it is too easy in the laugh department. The Eskimo is actually not so good for foils for Bugs, and I frankly saw much better Bugs Bunny cartoons, even other shorts, when he is paired with other unknown antagonists. So I cannot recommend this with a clear conscience. However, it is nice to see it uncut. This cartoon is on the 3rd disc of the Golden Collection of the Looney Tunes, volume 1
