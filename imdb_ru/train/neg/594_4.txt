I just rented a creep and was not impressed. I did not feel anything in this film. I felt bad because one blood was shocking. <br /> <br /> I went out of the living room several times in despair that something would happen to this movie. Have we not seen it all before? I did not like any character except the guy in the sewer cage. I was bad for him. But again, I could not understand why he is still alive and not killed by a creep? Many questions need to be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned the links to the Silent Hill game for PS2, and I vaguely see the similarities. <br /> <br /> Not a bad, not a good movie. judge for yourself.
