This film was terrible. and not as some claim. First of all, the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second, the WTF continues this van love. The plot, basically, is this: the boy wants sex, so he buys a van (which, frankly, is pretty cool). Incredibly, considering that he looks like a newt, he slaughters lots of chicks! And he fails with some. Then he clogs with a really hot chick and realizes that he loves this silly bird, which is difficult to play. Then he runs a race with a guy with hot chicks. And he knocks over his van. At this moment Danny DeVito saves the day. Although he did not need it, because, turning the van over, the red-haired guy first crossed the line. I gave these 2 *, as I am ready to assume that there is some sort of Vanning 70s subculture, which I do not get, and also because there is also something from the 70s.
