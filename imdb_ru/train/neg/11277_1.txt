There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast, but unfortunately this does not help with the significant shortcomings of the film. I never understand why directors are not asking actors / actresses to use their own accents when it’s obvious to everyone they can't convince. Fiennes simply cannot speak Irish, and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When the voice is wrong, then no matter how good the playing character will never be convincing. As for the main problem .... the plot .... was there one? I guess there was some kind of storyline there, but it was so full of breath that I just couldn't wait for the movie to end ... it was funny. Save 90 minutes of your life and don’t watch this movie!
