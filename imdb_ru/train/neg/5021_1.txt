This is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was cruel and acting boor. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of homework in film school, but he certainly played it that way. He is not even particularly successful in his central idea of ​​trying to act as a single continuous take. Loud horizontal camera pans are a cheap and non-original way of hiding cuts.
