The film begins with a good song. It looks like a thriller. Arbaaz Khan suspiciously walks around, but suddenly we are forced to comedy. With such stupid idiots as GOLMAAL, Tussar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal behave like adult children. Their scenes are pretty funny at first, and then they get boring. There is a boring story in which Brother Tanushri is killed. In the end, the film tries to become serious when the villain kidnaps our heroes, but then he becomes even stupid. HERA PHERI and wait, in the house of Payla is also a long chase. <br /> <br /> The film is so boring that it makes you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Directed by Priyan - very bad music (Pritam) is a common thing, except for the first song. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is bad, the film looks cheap. <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good at his first scene, where he is going to pay the rent and I was happy that the actor is not as loud and noisy as other films. But no, He becomes ordinary for himself and annoying most of the time, when Tussar should not speak in the film, his delivery of the dial is terrible. Sharman - saving grace. He is the only actor who plays very well in this film. Kunal Hemmu tries his best in his first comic film, as an adult, but not impressive. Tanushri is bad, as always, Arbaaz Khan has fewer opportunities and, as a rule, Payal is not an actress, Murly Sharma is terrible.
