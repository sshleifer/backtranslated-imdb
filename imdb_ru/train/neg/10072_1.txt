Unfortunately, I made a mistake and paid 7 euros in the cinema for watching this small meaningless film. My points of view; <br /> <br /> The film is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic point of view: as it happens in most American films, the writer considers himself an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But, unfortunately, this is not enough. The knowledge of a kunif and two names of other products does not allow the person to understand culture. For example, shaving is a sign of a clean life in Asia, but everyone has tried to stop it. Lebanese people are Christians (well, they understood this), and their cultural forms, beliefs and attitudes are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we are not engaged in ethnocentrism. Therefore, we do not judge people after their first question about our lives, as the father did in the film. <br /> <br /> 2) The sexual revolution of the girl: there is nothing special to say. Show me 10 girls who have had these sexual awakenings, and I will say that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre. Please see Dr.Strangelove for the meaning of black humor. Black humor should reflect the truth and focus the audience on the funny parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film.
