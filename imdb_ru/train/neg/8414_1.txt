Yeah. I’m sure I saw this movie many years ago when it came to the films “Superiority”. <br /> <br /> Another redesigned storyline flashed in the Hollywood style, borrowing the screenplays from the best films "Do it in the music industry." <br /> There is nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More makeup, bright costumes and choreography = more money for the doubtfully “talented” rally in Beyonce. <br /> <br /> If you like the style of the return, you should appreciate the real groups who fought (not having digitized votes and the Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce’s involvement makes this hypocritical trash.
