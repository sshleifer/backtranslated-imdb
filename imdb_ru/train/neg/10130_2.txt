I own almost all Seagal films (yes, even those that have a low budget), and I have to say that this may be the worst, not only his films, but all the films that have ever been made. The only highlight of this film, and the only reason I gave him 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. is Seagal, and B. Segal does have some pleasant episodes, especially in the store, and also whenever he takes whole army with a knife. Next time, give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people, and don't even worry about the storyline, because the storyline is not only smelly, but also acting, the fact that the F-18 and F-14 somehow turned into F - 16, and the fact that the Stealth was as fast as the F-16. Also Stealth never had to refuel ??? And since when is Afghanistan considered a hostile territory from the point of view of the Air Force. The last thing I checked, there is no air force in Afghanistan, we (the US) control the sky. In addition, this top secret mission was played through loudspeakers for the whole team in the room, but the admiral still whispers to the other guy that this is a secret. Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top? Please tell us why they put him in jail, since when did the Air Force pilots be excellent commandos (aren't they Owen Wilson?) And since when are they drunk in Arab countries, given that Muslims do not drink alcohol? In addition, since when do the Arabs listen to the orders of women, such as No. 2? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal, killing people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as a very short and completely random lesbian scene that appeared from nowhere.
