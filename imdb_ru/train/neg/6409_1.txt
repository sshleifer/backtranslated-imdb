I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the reviews on this site. Those who give it one at a time should be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm a Buffy fan of first order, but I know that this is crap when I see it. At each level, this film is terrible. Technically, most of the time you do not know where you are in this film, even in one scene, it jumps insanely from the first person, like crazy. No cinematic logic. Emotionally bleak for the sake of despondency and trying to be a psychological thriller when it just confuses. Throwing unpleasant-looking red necks into your film is a cheap way to convey the "atmosphere". I lost my temper before the last act, but I had a lot of fun when my friends recorded MST3K riffs to turn it off. After leaving Buffy, SMG had 2 successful films, even if you could even include Scooby Doo on your resume. Gellar is a wonderful actress, but she (or her agent) definitely cannot find a car for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you have problems with paying your mortgage, I will send you a few dollars if you promise not to appear again in such a movie! (Also, Patsy Kline estate must sue for defamation!)
