It is hard to praise this film. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but it lacked the correct modeling for light and shadow. In addition, the same frames are endlessly used when the dragon stomps through the corridors, which becomes a bit tedious. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see “Marcus Aurelius” in acting credits, wondering what the former emperor of the Romans was. The empire played in this film! Like Whoopi Goldberg, it must be a pseudonym, and is it possible to blame him for using him if he appears in this bitch. <br /> <br /> The story may be interesting, but the actions are flat and the direction is exhausting. If you MUST watch this movie, go to your friend's house and get drunk at the same time - then it will be nice.
