Reviewing this film, I can only rely on my weekend warrior experience, which took basic training in July, August and September 1971 in that place in the garden in Fort Polk, Louisiana. “Take on a hill” was not at all what I remember as basic training. <br /> <br /> But it must be remembered that at the time when it was after Korea, it ended in a dead end, but it was an ordinary war, as we knew it. It was not Vietnam, but partisan war in the jungle, where we continued to flood the conscripts into an endless pit. The bill at that time was undesirable, but was adopted as necessary for the defense of the country. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a Korean veteran who is now charged with the state party to train troops to travel abroad. The film tells about one of his training cycles and about the men of a platoon whom he has to train. This is the usual kind that you will find in almost any military film of the last decade. <br /> <br /> One thing for which I praise “Get the upper hand” is the fact that MGM recognized that our army had become integrated with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. This is consistent with the spirit of the times, which has changed. <br /> <br /> But I’ll say that a new recruit like Russ Tamblin would have been cured of his clever lips from day one. Richard Widmark would not risk dying or becoming a eunuch to give Jerome Cortland confidence in a weapon. And he would not have been so worried about anything because of the desertion of Robert Arthur. He has just allowed members of parliament to deal with him. <br /> <br /> Of course, he was shot dead in Fort Bliss and in its vicinity, in El Paso, Texas, will give “Sights” a good authenticity. But consider it as a film about recruiting an army, and you will surely understand why the government was so willing to cooperate that day. <br /> <br /> I remember that sergeant teachers had small conflicts that you could remember when you didn’t worry that they would get into your business for what was 95% of the time. But by no means Carl Malden would not have been able to kill Widmark in the open air while training in front of several witnesses among recruits. Both would understand that this would undermine credibility, and the military simply would not allow this to happen. <br /> <br /> I would like to say something better about “Take the Height”, because I certainly like his talented cast. a talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme of Dmitry Temkin and Ned Washington, just released from Oscar a year before noon. In fact, the film received an Oscar nomination for the best screenplay and story of Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman’s vivid imagination.
