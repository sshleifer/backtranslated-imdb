I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out, since I was a big fan of SNL. When my boyfriend and I came to see this, the people who came out of the early show shouted: “Don't waste your money!” But, of course, we had to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Although there were some funny moments (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most of them seemed like they could be seriously edited before the funny 1-hour show. That was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer appeared, many rose and left. It made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue just deliberately presses the buttons of people in this film. Or he was just mad. Anyway, you don’t have to spend time watching, it’s so bad.
