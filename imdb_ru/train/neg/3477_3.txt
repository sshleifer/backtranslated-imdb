Not as bad as you heard. There are actually some fun parts, and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is attractive and attractive as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are unsurpassed professionals. They are pretty good at almost everything. In the end, “Survival” is not the worst holiday movie you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not focused, and most of the comedy is forced. Attempts to dark humor seem harsh. Affleck is trying hard to be truly spastic and overly enthusiastic, but she looks alarmed. The cartoon character of his character is very happy when he is looked alongside the more muted and believable representations of Gandolfini and O'Hara. Even by the natural standards of holiday films, you will never fully agree that Affleck “rents” this family for Christmas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that border on a surrealistic strangeness. The scene on the eve of Christmas is replete with incestuous humor (the son is found looking at the nude provocative photographs of his mother), which is not only not funny and not believable, but also disturbing. <br /> <br /> Worse, the colors in this film are dirty, almost noir. The house where most of the film takes place looks scenic and cheap. <br /> <br /> “Survival” is mainly of interest as the fourth in a series of box office (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and that) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how serious the damage will be.
