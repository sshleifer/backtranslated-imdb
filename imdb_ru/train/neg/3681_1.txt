Oh my god, this movie is bad. I was completely misled by my local film review because it is verifiable trash. Yes, yes, the good guys wear white, the bad guys wear black .... and the good guys always win. Now go home, hug your children and feel how good Hollywood feels you. Blech! I can't believe that this film with a dead brain was shot by Wes Craven. I guess he needs some money to pay the mortgage, so he made this piece of manure. This is a production that makes anyone who watches films regularly believe that he could handle it better or better than such an experienced director. <br /> <br /> You see, a bad guy needs a cute girl who loves his dad to do a witty act, otherwise he will hurt his dad. But being Mrs. All-American girl next door, we know that she will save the day and win the bad guys ... the end. Female power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> C'mon, only an idiot will find this fascinating ... "rollercoaster ride", not to mention something new or new. All the “super duper” reviews that you see on this site are made by industrial hackers who either make money on this film, pay for a favor, or sell their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is beautiful .... yes, that's all. Not a good performance, not terrible ... she's just cute. She would have to show a lot of skin to save this film. She is not cool enough to be a good leader of female action. <br /> <br /> Killian Murphy was at least bearable in 28 days. But here he plays a stupid villain, pretending to be smart. He gets his ass back and forth from 5'5 '' McAdams, because, after all, she was a fan ... and a field hockey player ... and I’m sure that she owns all the tapes of Tae Bo .. so that she should be able to throw the shit out of the international terrorist for hire. I wouldn’t trust him to steal a pack of chewing gum from 7 to 11. <br /> <br /> You see, this film was shot before, except before they did it well. Rent any Die Hard movie. You have relatives in danger, international terrorists, except that the characters are more pleasant and believable, and the bad guys are MUCH more competent and interesting. I just don’t understand how Hollywood can continue to do shit like they don’t notice proper patterns that they can easily copy. Not surprisingly, film revenues are declining. <br /> <br /> Throw your $ 6 in the toilet and save 2 hours of your life, you'll never come back. <br /> <br /> Chao, FreddyShoop
