Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is beautiful until the former appears and everything becomes a little more complicated. When I watched this film, I asked myself several times why to do it .. because the film is so funny, blah and poorly written without any credibility. The audience also does not understand what is happening .. Even the beautiful Cameron can not save it on a scale from one to ten.
