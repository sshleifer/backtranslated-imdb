If you thought that the original of the 83 was bad, then try this modern masterpiece. How could it be worse, you ask? Well ... at least in the first one, Ellie Chidy was running in a sports bra. In addition to updated graphics, modern themes of the day (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a new sexual voice for Ripley, unfortunately, this is the same sad, weary story. Anyone who saw the first could see exactly where the next scene / line is moving in the story. And for those who have not seen the first ... well, believe me, you are lucky that you only watched it once. Perhaps in another 23 years, Hollywood will try again.
