Volleyball genre is strangely ignored by most writers. Fortunately, the famous director Nelson McCormick brought us the second best volleyball film of all time (rating is lower than Side Out, and higher, well, well, well, mmm). However, do not let the cover of this film kill you. Kill Shot - the stars of the rising star Koji in the role of the modern Sherlock Holmes. Using such high-tech devices as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, Kouji can help FBI agents track down a person who has not committed a single obvious crime. While there are other actors in the film, including short episodes of Denise Richards, a hilarious black and a ridiculously ugly and annoying girl, Kouji wears this film by herself. Any fan of movies like The Matrix or Hackers will surely love Kill Shot.
