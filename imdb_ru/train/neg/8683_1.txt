This show is not smart. This is basically what it comes down to. The “original humor,” which these authors try to accomplish in order not to bite off the beating of the bushes from the rest of the world, is simply unmixed. In another comment, someone quotes a couple of fun lines. Outstanding to me was George H. V. Bush tells the children that they should not watch television except Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a highlight for the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with talking, like this sad excuse for political satire, is that these people get a second season. I am a liberal Republican, and I know that Bush was not a good president. We all do. But this is no excuse to spend this completely useless waste of time. I put these authors on the same level as the geniuses behind "Meet the Spartans." Their formula is to bite off as many unfunny themed jokes as possible and add even worse original material to actually give yourself writing. <br /> <br /> Again, just bad. Not funny, and it only makes me more and more unhappy that the nonsense like this is resumed, but amazing and original shows, such as Arrested Development, will end after 3 seasons. Please do not watch this shit, unless you are one of those green-blooded liberal hippies who think that any sentence that says Bush and dumb is comedic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush’s voice sucks. All he does is mimic the Texas accent slightly and breathe out very hard at the end of his sentences. At the very least, South Park recognizes that voices are not accurate. If you need a funny political satire, check out the Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for some political sketches about Robot Chicken, which is interesting to watch, since the animation of the figurine in the freeze frame is VERY well done. Look for George Bush in the role of a Jedi on YouTube. invaluable
