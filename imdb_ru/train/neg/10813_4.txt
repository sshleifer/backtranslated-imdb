The first half of this version was the best that I saw (and I think I saw every version of Jane Eyre ever made). The development of childhood and Jane's character were exceptional. Then, as if someone had said, “Oh, this is too long,” and cracked the rest of the story to shreds. The main scenes, if they are included at all, are darkened, combined and disabled in such a way that they completely change the storyline. There have been so few changes or even the development of the scene that anyone who is not familiar with the story will even find it difficult to follow. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end broke it.
