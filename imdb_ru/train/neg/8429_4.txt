This film cannot offer anything new to the genre, which traditionally shows the story of intercultural love, backed up by Indian politics of the mid-20th century / until World War II, where the British and their modern ways are bad, and primitive, but honest and real Indians are good. Of course, such clich√©d images of British people are pretty dull now. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama that feeds the second part of the film, the narrative is predictable, the action is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the direction is obvious. and unimaginable. <br /> <br /> The story really needed clarification and certainly would have won another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and the narration more depth and make the viewer feel like they were investing money in. <br /> <br /> All in all, pretty boring. Oh, and Linus Roach simply cannot commit tragedy - emotional pain does not suit me, cross-eyed!
