When my friend gave me a boxed set of “12 amazing Scifi / Horror movies!” I was understandably a bit careful. But, since the subject was a gift, I really did not pay much attention to common sense. In the end .... movies for free! So what if they are a bit constrained? After much deliberation, Alien Intruder was the first of those films. Ironically, it was the first choice, because he looked the best. All I can say is that if this is the best of them, I can't wait to think about what the others look like. <br /> <br /> At first glance, this had good things. Four (count!) Actor with whom I was familiar. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conavey. I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy were in some good science fiction (" Star Wars "and" Babylon 5 ", respectively), so they will not subscribe to Turkey. Max is a veteran soap story who never got to the movies. ... but not too bad actor. Jeff ... well ... he did good and bad with regard to film and television. "I soon discovered that Jeff decided to add the" ugly "to his film repertoire. <br /> <br /> The first clue was in the first scenes. Jeff gladly sneaks through the scene "I'm crazy" before finally committing suicide. A really funny cameo. Unfortunately, this is, without much exaggeration, the highlight of the film. From there comes the descent. <br /> < br /> Next we have a mission commander (Williams) who is sent to see what happened to Jeff and his coma Ndoy, who is collecting his new comrades in the ship from the ranks of the criminal element. But this range is not so much the “dirty dozen” as the “unconvincing four.” In addition, one of the criminals, a computer hacker, is shown in his cell while working on a laptop. is it not like letting an assassin run a gun shop in a prison? A rather lame prison if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When they finally remove the effect, it's really terrible. It seems that the model of the spacecraft was knocked down in the afternoon by some bored 8-year-old, who still had spare parts from his Airfix kits. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not end there. On the way to the place where Jeff's ship disappeared, the criminal team is rewarded for good behavior, because they are given a weekend of virtual reality in which they indulge their male fantasies. Everything is good, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the “Alien Threat” that begins to appear there. But they had to pull this out for a pretty sooooo loooooong? Alien Intruder? Alien Boring, more like. <br /> <br /> Finally, they get to the G-sector, and the presence of aliens forces them to fight each other for her attachments, until only the good old Max remains. The end, in a truly optimistic vein from the trash film, hints at a sequel - as if! Also in this movie will appear a character, whom I will call “Sweaty Android”. It is assumed that he is an android, but, obviously, this fact was lost in the dressing room team, which provided him with sweaty facial features at every opportunity. But don't worry, he is just ready to count the numbers at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, to be honest, do little in the film. They are only awake, not to mention acting. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff goes to the shower early, so his mania does not allow to cover most of the film. Max is trying his best, like several other actors, but, to be honest, the film is just terribly brutal. <br /> <br /> The one and only creative thing this film offers is an agreement on the names of ships. All of them are named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is boring and not inspired. <br /> <br /> Filmed in 1992, I thought that when I first viewed it was one of those works of the 80s where you could watch a video. Looks like they were still making shit movies in the 90s. <br /> <br /> This is best avoided. Even as a “beer and chips” movie, this movie is ugly, but at least you can speed it up, I suppose
