This film was absolutely ... ugh, I can't find the word oh, wait ... shit! I mean, when it started, I looked like yes, it looks good, and then after it was so boring. I almost fell asleep, and it had nothing to do with the fact that I caught the late show, because it was total dirt. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best, but the cast could never match the cast of the original Sholay, I mean what he thought of doing a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Lily Bhansani and win all the awards next year, how did he do for blacks? Ajay and that other guy were good, especially the other guy who played raj, because of all he was the only one who could be looked at. What did Amitabh do? He destroys his dignity, acting in all these silly films. First Nishabd, then Chini Kum, then Jum Barabar Jom, and now I mean that he must collect some of his money and go as far as possible from Bollywood before he loses all his respect, and I tell you that he already went half my way, I mean, all this is really good for other actors, such as Shah Rukh Khan, who now gets a really good name because of the recent fall of Amitabha. I never liked him because he thinks he is God, and I just knew that Abhishek would be in this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to save Â£ 17.75 and spend it on something good, check out Heyy Babyy, because this is the funniest movie in history and number one on the charts!
