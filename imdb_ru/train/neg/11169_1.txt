Are you kidding me?! A show that illuminates someone who opens cans and envelopes for food? How talented should you be for this? She CAN be able to cook, but she is NOT depicted in this half an hour painful work. I know that she has the empire of Martha-Stuart Esq. Like Warren Buffett, but I donâ€™t see him with fake hammers opening cans of corn and Alpo. <br /> <br /> She has a nephew named ... Bryser. Brycer? Stop talking about someone who calls himself stupid. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on "cooking tables" than on cooking. Who has time like this ?! Silicon should be on your shoulder, not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, not Food Network.
