I do not want to go into details, because I cannot justify wasting time on watching this film, but I had to give an alternative opinion in order, I hope, to help people avoid the film. The animation is rough and the story alternates between boring / meaningless and extremely annoying. The humor was completely lost to the audience, and yes - the fans of “Ghost in the Shell”, this is NOT a sci-fi action or something like that - this is an attempt at the farce comedy, and the humor simply did not work after the translation. Watching this movie was hard work, and for me it was a terrible way to start a film festival, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was to everything - I did not expect the continuation of “Ghost in the Shell”, but I was expecting something interesting and he just did not achieve it. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent a Kino's Journey.
