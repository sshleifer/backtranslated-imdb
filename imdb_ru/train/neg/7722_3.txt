Extremely bad fighter with Dof Lundgren and Brandon Lee, who played the role of a double, which never turns into a gel. The action is, at best, average, a little nudity, and yes, Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> The situation is an ordinary renegade policeman who is forced to intervene in the business of a new partner in a large case, the manufacturers at least try to give the formula a turn, making Landgren a cop with Eastern values, and Lee is a modern city, but character development is zero, which makes it almost comical, it must be assumed that the eastern warriors of Lundgrens must believe for the big fight. Sequences of actions are listed by numbers, and Lee (which will be an excellent "Raven") never gives an opportunity to demonstrate any special brilliance of martial arts. But given his outstanding origins, he must have been under tremendous pressure, and he would have been served much better if he didnâ€™t match his father, taking on a completely different role in Crow, which showed how unique an actor he could be. if not for his tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> Unless you're an avid Lundgren fan or an 80s poor action movie fan (think Cobra, etc.), then avoid. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
