This is the saddest collection of clichés, joined together in a straight line, without a conspicuous plot or any decent course of action that I've seen for a long time. The scenes from the movie Star Wars, The Kingdom of Fire, Godzilla, The Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter all led to a full-scale war with the viewer's intelligence. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Even if he isn’t so low as to actually be funny and reach the cult status of a comedy, the film does offer a bit of laughter. The trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films. Gandalf can be a funny Korean speaker, a basilisk looks like a snake when compared to a kitten, and an evil minion can take a lot of pleasure in switching between Sauron and Judge-bing, or whatever his name is. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: any pleasure derived from this film depends entirely on the state of intoxication and the imagination of the audience, and not on the director / screenwriter. Shame on you, Shim!
