Graduation night 2 is a good horror film, but the prom is much better, and this film is about how prom queen Mary Lou in 1957 is killed by her boyfriend and returns 30 years later due to revenge. The best actor in this film is Michael Ironside and other good actors and actresses are shot in the film, such as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monett (I). And there are some good bloody scenes, for example, when Mary Lou kills a girl who tries to hide in her locker by crushing the lockers together and one of the students at the computer, and Mary Lou kills him with an electric shock to death. In general, this is a good horror movie, and my rating is 4 out of 10.
