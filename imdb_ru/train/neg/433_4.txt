This film is predictable; it's more predictable than Vinny Testaverdi's pass when he catches the ball for the jets. One saw the end approaching the middle of the film. Politics reminds me when I returned to the east. Many people know when there will be a fix. I gave it four because of acting, but the story is unconvincing.
