This is a candidate for the most disappointing film in my life. A cool title, a great director (I saw “To Die For” and “Drugstore Cowboy” before), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, this is a question that pulsed in my temples for a few hours after I looked at this turkey. <br /> <br /> Disconnected and unfunny in an attempt to be original, this is the dead zone of the film that should be avoided at all costs. His critical condemnation was well deserved. You have one of those rare films that does not contain a single quality of redemption. Zero of ****.
