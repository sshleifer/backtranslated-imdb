<br /> <br /> The film “Slugs” is unique in that title parasites are actually good guys in this horrific story about nature that went awry. You see, these poor slugs are mutated because of the contamination of evil people and do not want to do something evil, they are just slugs with sharp teeth that eat meat and give off poison, but nonetheless slugs. The real bad guys are people who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs, or overreact when faced with them. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the guy puts on a glove full of slugs. They just hung out in a comfortable working glove, when out of nowhere this giant hand stumbled upon them, and they instinctively responded, protecting themselves and biting the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical help for his bite, this guy runs through his greenhouse, screaming like an idiot, pours some volatile chemicals, lights a fire, knocks the bookcase off of himself, and cuts off his own hand - then fire and a mixture of volatile chemicals, and his house explodes. How can you blame slugs for this? <br /> <br /> In this film a portrait of people is drawn, which is less than supportive. The characters in this film include a blunt sheriff who hates everyone, a drunken guy who is mean to his dog, and a comedian whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There are also a few drunk teenagers who are attacked during mating, and we should see the genitals of thin, long-haired freaks. Meanwhile, there is a guy who looks like the demonic Leslie Nilson, who shouts: “You have no authority to declare happy birthday!” For some reason. Finally, this hate parade ends with the MST3K classic “Pod People” guy, whose face explodes after eating lace salad (another easy fate that can be avoided by blaming useful, harmless slugs). <br /> <br /> People are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and, in one meaningless scene, as potential rapists. In the climatic scene of the movie, the villains are trying to burn the slugs helplessly shrinking in the sewer. Well, since they are idiots, people succeed in the explosion of the whole city. They alone do more damage than slugs ever! <br /> <br /> If you hate people, and I know that this is so, you will appreciate the "Slug." If you're a fan of bad cinema, you'll also appreciate this crappy festival from the directors "Pieces" and "Pod People". Bad enough games, stupid dialogue, illogical plot twists, settling special effects, meaningless scenes and poor rewriting to keep your attention.
