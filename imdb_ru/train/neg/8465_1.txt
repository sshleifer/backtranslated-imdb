I can't believe how horrible this movie turned out to be. I feel generous, even calling it a "film." The acting was flat, editing was terrible, and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered. The premise was fine, if not original: a small group of aliens lives in the USA and is trying to slowly seize humanity. But from there everything goes quickly down. How could they convince the “man” to accept the alien as his wife, to make them a hybrid of the alien and the man they demand? They show a larval alien, but they never show what he does. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale. They throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth. The ending was too painful to watch. I believe that I’m mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxleatner will have anything to do with it. How could he say to a huge alien monster with teeth: “Get away from him, son of the devil” with an imperturbable face? This is a long fall from his Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
