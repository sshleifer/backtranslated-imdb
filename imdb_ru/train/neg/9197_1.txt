There are some movies you just know, they will be bad from the first frame. Even if you didn’t notice Ed Wood’s work at all, take a look at this commentator from Plan 9 from space, and you just KNOW you won’t see the next cinematic masterpiece. Likewise, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Boll's “House of the Dead” masterpiece, when this guy was sitting at the entrance to the house and began his acquaintance, desperately trying to say that he had just arrived from the City of Sins, I knew that I in anticipation of a hell of a drive. <br /> <br /> So the film begins like this - first the main character says that everyone else will die. You know that you continue to wander. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma ... thinks she is Fox Fox Brown "or" Alicia ... my ex ... we just broke up ... I got study, and she had to shut out. "No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> In any case, this group of twenty people who could not get out of the wet paper bag, goes to" Century Rave ", rave we are talking about several tents, a pot-port and a crappy scene located on a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Our gang missed the ferry, but fortunately will find a way to get there like a fishing boat operated by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get it? The man, whoever wrote this script, is a genius) and his partner, who is the bastard of the baby Simpsons "Cpt McAllister" and that hook killer who knows what you were doing last summer. <br /> <br /> In short, the gang gets to the island, doesn't find anyone there, except for the bloody T-shirts and then decide to run away from there. Do not wait, they do not, they are in fact all happy and, as if there is a free drink. <br /> <br /> With this scene the film reaches the bottom, and then, no matter what, continues to go down. Some guys in rubber suits start to run, some shout and shoot, our gang goes to some house to meet with another gang, they leave the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman (who have between them about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decided to return to the house. Somewhere along the line they turn into C.V.AT. Team, enter the Matrix, guys in rubber suits start to multiply like bacteria, and I start crying, because I actually paid to see it. To add insult to injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game on which this crap is based, and there is a pretty game passing scene for several characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. It does not even fit into this famous category “So bad, it's good.” This is just bad. The script is bad, the zombies are terrible, there is no tension, the lines are bad, the actors are bad ... the list just goes on. <br /> <br /> You might want to watch this movie just because of its terrible reputation as Not. There are bad movies that are worth watching. This is not one of them.
