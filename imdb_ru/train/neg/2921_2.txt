The story concerns the genealogy researcher (Mel Harris), who was hired by her cosmetic aunt, Queen Estee Lauder. Her aunt (by marriage, which we can assume) is trying to track down her long-lost family in Europe. All they need is a photo of a young girl standing near a richly decorated music box. The researcher goes to Europe and conducts searches in places such as Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenery is a real thing, and they are actually filmed on site (unlike Killing, She wrote where Jessica had to visit a vast region, and Lansbury never left Burbank). In any case, she meets a young man who is also trying to uncover family secrets, and they come together to track down the evidence and threaten the bad guys. The dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched it because of the scenery, but the script was so bad that I stayed to see if it would get worse. Did it. The acting was also turned off. I understand why Mel Harris' career did not start after a thirty-year period, but it is adequate (although it seems to be too old for her colleague). But supporting players directly from the gaming community complex. I also lost count of how many times they say Budapest to each other. Yes, it is pronounced as Bood-a-phesht. We know, ok? Halfway through the film, I realized that it must be one of those Harlequin films, and this is true. I think that says it all.
