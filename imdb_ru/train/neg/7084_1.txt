According to many others, this is a terrible film, from all sides of film making. It's amazing how they attracted famous actors to participate in this project. <br /> <br /> Many people complained that he was filmed on “cheap” video cameras. Yes, it was videotaped, but not on a “cheap” video. Poor lighting, white balance, shooting and editing. <br /> <br /> There were so many different methods of shooting and editing that it was a production mess. Sharp, unstable lighting, excessive use of manual shooting (ala Woody Allen), intermittent editing (another Allen technique), but poorly executed, without a real goal. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the kitchen of the restaurant is embarrassing; very amateur. <br /> <br /> The simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level. <br /> <br /> As this video was printed, I can’t do it. Worth seeing, at least wondering how bad it is.
