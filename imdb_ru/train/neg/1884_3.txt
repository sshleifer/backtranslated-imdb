Fragmentary film about a couple of people in Austria during the heat wave. Such films were made more often, and most importantly - better. The stories really have nothing to do with each other, except for the pitiful finale: "people are cruel." Ugly flesh, unpleasant people and a film that lasts too long, without paying much attention ... Ultra-realistic? Hardly ... boring? Indeed. Even the gorgeous Francis Weiss cannot save it! 3/10
