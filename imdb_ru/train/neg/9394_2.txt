Oh, man, how low the series fell like by 1952! This boring thing is exactly the show that annoyed Annie Wilkes (from the movie Misery). Not only do the characters get out of the traps, adding scenes that were not in the previous chapter (and which CAN'T be there - tell me that when the villains blow up the plain in episodes 7 through 8, they won't see the characters jumping), but I think that in this series there is a world record of stock photography. I mean, most of them are stock shots! And not only from other TV shows (apparently, all the flying episodes come from the “King of rocket men”, and the scenes with “melted stones” in episodes 2 to 3 - “The Adventures of Captain Marvel”), but also from himself! The entire "Journey to the Moon" sequence (which is probably the shortest in the entire history, lasts 30 seconds and the characters never leave the atmosphere of the Earth) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (Ever wondered why MST3K never made episodes 10, 11, and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9, so they wouldn't have to do it all again!). <br /> <br /> Don't get me started on the scientific factor. Get ready to see the sunniest moon! And what about men of the moon who cannot breathe in their own world? What do they smoke? <br /> <br /> And if this is not enough, it’s too talkative, and tricks (as a rule, the best thing on TV shows) are rare. Visually, I'm the only one who thinks that Cody's commando helmet (or lemon) looks completely ridiculous? Roquetir was much cooler, no matter how bad this movie was (and, damn, it was terrible). A car that looks like a tank is not much better; it looks like a bunch of children gathered it on Halloween. The only positive thing I can think about is that the actor who plays the hero is a homely and not just an ordinary brawny (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then he is so unattractive ... <br /> < br /> Not even worth watching for nostalgia. Look at Captain Marvel instead. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (By the way, in the section “Memorable Quotes” you will find the real feminine pearl of the Bible).
