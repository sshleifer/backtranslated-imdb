This is a very bad western, mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It appears that he was shot dead in a rear section in California, not where Jack Slade, Idaho, Colorado, and Montana lived and died. This invents everything that is known about this mysterious "bad person", "good person." The script is terrible; there is very little guidance, and lousy action. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife. Mark Stephen seems to never know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good stage manager. His local residents were afraid of his drunkenness. When he was drunk, he started fights and caused other problems in Virginia, Montana. To ensure that he could never terrorize them again, the militants lynched Jack Slade after he ignored their warning to leave the city immediately. This is a terrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie, except how to see how Hollywood beats the story at will, even to this day.
