I caught this Sci-Fi movie before heading to work. If you are interested in seeing Dean Kane dive and not be engulfed at least a dozen times, this film is for you. If this is of no interest to you, I am afraid that you will want you to be on fire, because this film is pretty bad. Acting, for starters, terrible, terrible, terrible. All the characters are completely disgusting, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-grade sci-fi movie. By the end of the film, the film began to remind me of “The Hollow Man” (complete with escape through the elevator shaft), with the exception of the dragon, and not the naked, invisible person. However, unlike other similar films, this film was not even very bad ... it was just bad.
