This is just a bad movie. With what seemed like a pretty good budget, he had the potential to be much better. It almost was. With such a beautiful heroine as Salma Hayek, a hero who fights almost like Jackie Chan, battles and fights, almost like in “The Crouching Tiger”, music almost like in, say, Konan ... and so on. Almost. But in the end, it's just boring, and it's hard to find something interesting in it. Maybe, apart from John Rhys-Davis, flying in a duel, like those warriors in Hero or the previously mentioned Crouching Tiger ... I really feel ashamed of poor old John. In the end, he is a pretty good actor and deserves much better. Just like you - so if you still have a chance, just look at something else.
