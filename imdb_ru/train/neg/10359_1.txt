A series of books "Wrinkle in Time" - my favorite series since childhood. I have read and re-read them more times than I can count in the last 35-odd years. The characters, with all their strengths and weaknesses, are close and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual history that I love so much. To say that I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you have never read a book, I think you will like the movie. The action is tolerable, special effects are well made for a television film, and the story is interesting. However, if you like books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia novel page: “In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the film:“ I expected it to be bad, and it is. ” <br /> <br /> I, like another reviewer, feel the need to read the book again to dispel this film.
