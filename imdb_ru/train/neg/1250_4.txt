I have to admit that this “rethinking” of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. Especially if you take into account that this is a Tim Burton film. He is definitely one of the most original and, one can say, tough directors that Hollywood produced. <br /> <br /> I am personally a big fan of his work, but something went wrong with his latest film Planet. monkeys I really liked the original movie. When he first came out, people were waiting for the next science fiction film Cheezie of the 70s, but very unexpected and convincing proved that the theory is wrong. It was a really clear message. An obvious anti-war message. Fear of the cold war, where it captures the world, and the fear of the use of nuclear weapons have played a big role in the minds of filmmakers. For these reasons, the film exceeded all expectations and became a real classic. Although the new film, "remake" or something else, does not leave us with nothing. No message, no ideals behind this. This is just another blockbuster money. <br /> <br /> Visually, Tim Burton won't let you down. The dark and eerie settings were excellent and, of course, the makeup was awesome. <br /> <br /> This is obviously not enough to get people interested in the film. There should be an exciting plot or storyline. In this film, the plot is extremely uninteresting and extremely poorly thought out. The script is very lame and full of gaps. Looks like this movie was written in a big hurry. The explanation of why the monkeys were there and why they ruled the planet was really very stupid and proved the ignorance of the writers. <br /> <br /> This caused a lot of questions to which there were no reasonable answers. <br /> For example; Why do monkeys speak english? Why were there other species of monkeys on the planet besides chimpanzees (considering that there were only chimpanzees on the spacecraft crashed on the planet) Where the hell did all these people come from? How a few chimpanzees could turn into a huge growth of all kinds of monkeys in just a few thousand years. (I mean, it took us several millions of years to turn from a monkey into a human!) <br /> <br /> And finally, the unfortunate unexpected ending was just stupid. It was probably just added because the original film had such an end, then they felt that the audience was expecting the same end. The final also raises many questions that I KNOW that have no clever answers. Did Teid learn how to operate a spacecraft ?, Who was helpless, and learned how to fly back in time and take on Earth’s only arm? And what did he do, breed with all women? And suppose that this happens, I strongly doubt that the story will remain the same, as Washington will be built in the same way as today! (I mean, wouldn't there be a huge banana instead of a memorial?) <br /> <br /> Well, just say something positive about the movie. Some of the actors were great. Helen Bonham Carter's character was interesting and successful, as for Tim Roth in the role of Teid. He was very good, a bit saturated in some moments of the film. Michael Clark Duncan was also fine. I was not happy with Mark Wahlberg. He is not a very active actor and plays a very macho colorless character here. Very unbearable and nothing compared to the character Heston in the original. And the main character had no reason, no place in the film. She was simply thrown for appearance. Hardly said the word throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Well, I think that in the future, when people think about the Planet of the Apes, they will think about the original. The latter will soon be forgotten.
