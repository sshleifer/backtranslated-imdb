Isabelle (Lucci), the volatile wife of venture capitalist Stuart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love relationship just for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davies (Philip Kaznoff), just for her thing, but a serious matter for Richard. apparently hypnotized by his lover, while she uses his ardor, drawing him into a perilous plot that will grow into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis is convinced that insidious Isabel is a victim of physical violence from her husband, he desperately tries to free her from what he believes is a family trap so that he can marry her himself, believing that the only clear decision is his difficult the position will be found in the rudimentary essay when hiring a professional killer who will get rid of the allegedly violent Stewart. After the assassin's assault on Collins, a couple of police detectives played by Joe Grifaci and Dean McDermott are becoming increasingly interested in Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while the reality comes to the admiring Richard, who could pay a high price in exchange for maneuvering his foreign vehicle.
