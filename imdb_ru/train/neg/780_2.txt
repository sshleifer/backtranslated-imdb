This show is terrible. How does George want his mother's death to be funny? This show is terrible. Parents are obviously terrible, and children should be accepted into children's services. Daughter - a witch with a capital letter, and the son - just a brat. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his loud and nasty Spanglish brand. Ernie is a loser, but at least I laughed at him several times, but mostly because of how pitiful he is. George's mother, Benny, in a terrible, despicable temper. Of course, her husband left her, but how someone can laugh at how she treated George, like a child, is taller than me. <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain to me how George’s big head is funny? It's not even that much! I switched from characters, because they are too terrible, and it would take me hours to write, and I honestly don’t care. I can't wait to tell everyone who looks at it and wonders if they want to watch this show, that this show is a terrible excuse for a comedy show and is not worth your time. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 starts because the wife is extremely attractive.
