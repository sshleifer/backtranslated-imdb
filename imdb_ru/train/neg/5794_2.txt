The Germans all stand out in the open and are cut off by a machine gun. Good guys never die unless it's for dramatic purposes. the "conspiracy" has so many holes, it's funny. (Where did the German soldiers go when they rolled the fuel tank in the direction of the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea is to steal the train? How stupid it is! The Germans KNOW where you are going, but you cannot leave the track and go! What a waste. I would prefer to hit my head with a hammer with a hammer 10 times, and then sit back through it. I mean, seriously, he felt like it was done in the 60s, but it was done in 88! 1988 !! A-Team is more believable than this horrible excuse for a movie. Just see if you need to laugh. This film for Tele Sevalas is the same as Green Beret for John Wayne.
