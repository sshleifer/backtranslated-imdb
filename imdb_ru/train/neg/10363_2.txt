I grew up intertwining with the intertwined stories of Wrinkles in the Chronicles of Time. My dream was that one day the screenwriter met his child, sitting on a big couch and reading Winkle in Time, and thought what an amazing film it was. Unfortunately, the screenwriter failed, changing characters, adding weak humor and destroying the plot. I know it's hard to turn a favorite novel into a movie. But why can't you stay true to the book? Why should you change the way people think and behave? For those of you who have not read the book yet, grab it, find a soft couch and unleash your imagination.
