The sad thing about this is that these 87 minutes I will never return. I knew that it was terrible from the very beginning, with a guy dressed up like a crazy Indian leader on the roof. (See if they can get away with in 2008). My 10-year-old boy really enjoys baseball, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Despite the fact that he seemed to enjoy parts of it, I had to cringe when I heard all the unnecessary foul language. Bad bad movie. It was a terrible robbery of bad news bears. Totally shameless and absolutely predictable. I don’t mind a predictable film if it’s made well, but it absolutely wasn’t.
