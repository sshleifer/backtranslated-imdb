Cavemen were by far the biggest load of crap I've ever wasted watching This show, based on Geico commercials, is less interesting than a Geico ad in 30 seconds. At least, the makeup was half conceived, it is difficult to imagine a caveman with snow-white teeth even after visiting a dentist. This show could have the potential for a funny show if they could get the cast of the commercials, which in itself makes a lousy show. Perhaps if the writers were the same from Geico's ad, this chance would have had a chance; instead, the pilot didn't have a good storyline. I give this show 1 out of 10, I would like to put a zero out of 10, but this is not an option. I pray for a quick death for this show, I would give him less than 5 episodes before he dies a worthy death.
