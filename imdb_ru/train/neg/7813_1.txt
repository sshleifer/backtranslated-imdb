In my opinion, this is an almost perfect example of the Hollywood ego, defeated only by a new film about King Kong. Superman - a real superhero, deserving respect, even if he wears pantyhose. Brandon Ruth was the worst superman I've ever seen, from the very beginning of the movie you just want to shove a piece of kryptonite into his throat. He looks just stupid in a suit. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for Lois Lane, she has to be a reporter with a tight ass, but in this film she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (wow, he really is a son of supermen who would have thought ...), and the game was terrible. There is one good thing about this movie, and his name is Kevin Spacey. His image of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but even he could not save this film. In this film, the cast of Lois and Clark (with the exception of, of course, Kevin Spacey) was needed, and another story. I watched this movie after watching "The Hills Have Eyes," and I was shocked to learn that there are worse films than this.
