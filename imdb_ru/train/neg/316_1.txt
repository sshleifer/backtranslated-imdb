This film is definitely the worst movie ever made. If you need to create a movie with a guy who plays Lars in heavyweights, don't make this damn movie. I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS movie. Adam Sandler should be banned from any film after this shame. Watching this movie is like listening to Cher and willingly driving your dick into a blender. Anyone with half the brain will understand that this film is not worth a dime. If I had an extra dollar and I had to spend it, I would transfer it to the Lorraine Fund to support Bobbitt before buying this film.
