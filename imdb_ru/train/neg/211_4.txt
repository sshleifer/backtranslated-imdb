A fun and obvious “drama” about a bunch of school children (I think) who love nonstop hip hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a DJ at Roxy - or something like that. Honestly, I was so bored that I forgot! Even people who love music agree that this film acted terribly and - like a drama - fell through. We need to find these kids nice and sweet. I found them boring and boring. The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon. He makes graffiti on subway trains, and it looks great. Excuse me? He denigrates state property, which is not his from the very beginning. Also, these "great" children are connected to urban electricity to have a big dance party in an abandoned building. Yeah. So we have to find a group of lawbreakers, nice and funny. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all this if the music was good, but I hate hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre, and they were non-stop! They ALWAYS play! It got to the point that I quickly went through a lot of endless musical numbers. (Turn off the music, and you get a 30-minute film - maybe). There are several original numbers - the subway dance bout, the truly funny Santa number and the Roxy climate show. If you love hip-hop, here is your movie. But if you are looking for good drama, mixed - forget about it. Also HOW did it get a PG rating? This is an incredible amount of curses.
