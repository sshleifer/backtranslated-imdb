I'm glad some people liked it, but I hated this movie. He had a very good idea for the storyline, but that was it. It was poorly written, badly acted and poorly done. <br /> <br /> He had some interesting plot points, but they were just skipped too quickly, the writers had to understand that you need to keep to yourself and expand these bits, how to lie about why she was kidnapped and ditch scale. Instead, it was "what's going on?", After 5 seconds they tell you <br /> <br /> This film was not expected, and I was bored from beginning to end. I just wanted it to end. <br /> <br /> Go and rent misfortunes, or better-thought-out plans, if you want to wait or make turns that make you guess to the end.
