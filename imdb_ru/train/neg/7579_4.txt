The name “cult film” is often given to films that continue to be shown or sold in a home cinema format, more than a generation after they were first released. Superchick, which was first released in 1973, now falls into this category. His cult status is largely due to the constant interest in him from those women who consider him an early and effective feminist film. <br /> <br /> Despite the connotation of Superwoman, Superchik is not a cartoon character, but a very competent young lady working as a flight attendant in the air — a career option that was usually considered one of the most glamorous in the 1970s open to any girl and who also allows her to imitate the traditional matelot who supposedly has a wife in every port. Since she has the status of a black belt in karate, she may well make it clear that she is very pleased with her bachelor existence and is in no way obliged to anyone from her extensive set of male admirers. This film is a comedy of situations in which a frank farce is avoided. His appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax, in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to prevent plane hijacking and save all other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To make this film like both men and their partners, the director wisely made sure to sprinkle eye candy. <br /> <br /> Those who are not too critical and want to be very light can enjoy super patch, easy comedy, which they will forget soon after watching. It is so forgetful that they are likely to find it equally pleasant, if you look after a year; despite his age, he can retain his cult film status for some time. However, dialogue and acting would make it more difficult to evaluate this movie over 4/10.
