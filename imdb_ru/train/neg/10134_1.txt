Steven Seagall's films have never been Oscar material, but with each new release they have become worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This film starts with the fact that Seagal picks up the FBI because he killed several people "in self defense." Active military rescued from prison to save the stolen stealth aircraft, which will be used by the cliche “evil English villain”, which Hollywood is so obsessed with, including these days. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the film is terrible dialogue, which almost always comes with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting, and there are segments of it that have absolutely no meaning and do not add anything to the story, to the characters in the film as a whole, such as “lesbian”, the interaction between the two main women in the cast, just to attract the attention of viewers, but at the same time do not even be misleading, just confusing, since it makes no sense to explain why this happened when it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible scenario with poor dialogue, non-nominal actors, boring and sometimes poorly-staged fighting scenes and irrelevant roles that only serve to achieve the impossible and make the film worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss, even if you are Segal’s most ardent fan.
