Less shy and far less pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTY, this Kaduo Komizu film with blood is worth seeing (at least once). <br /> <br /> Sloppy pictures accompany those who want to become actresses / models in a remote house in the forest to rape them. Unfortunately (for lustful boys), a long-stretching demon who lives in the forest was already meant for girls to have fun. <br /> <br /> It even ends up having fun with the boys - this is IF you consider beheading, dismemberment and masturbation with severed limbs “fun.” <br /> <br /> Once again, it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film. <br /> <br /> In the same way as the Comizue, because of his incompetence, he disfigured "LIFE OF THE DEAD IN TOKYO BAY", he also distorts this effort and only saves from some bold violence and a few excellent white panties. <br /> <br /> Do not buy the hype, or you will be very disappointed.
