Recently starred in GEORGE 2 on TV, but could not bring himself to watch it to the end. Just awful! I can't even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula in the first film, which was bad enough. There was a lot of climbing around, but the direction and editing was so sloppy and changeable, it was like watching scenes or deleted scenes. The initial voice of the Monkey Monkey was not enough for me to warm up before that. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst sequel I've ever seen, and that says something. God, because of the 10-line IMDb rule, I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this stupid sequel "Made for Television". Disney, put your head down in shame.
