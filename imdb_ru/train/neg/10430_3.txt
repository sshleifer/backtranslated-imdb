The new BSG has a lot of good: there are, for example, several Cylon roles for models 8 and 6, which two actresses have superbly played. On board Galactica there is an old school sense of industrial design (“My ship will not be connected to the network, because of my dead body!”) In addition, in all space battles, special effects (even if an experienced science fiction observer recognizes the cartoonity of it all) Darkness characters, their essentially vicious nature. <br /> <br /> This is all the more bitter because the finale was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, scenes in space, the Cylon raid, and it was all very good. But the ending is soft? I always watch movies and shows these days with a hidden timer, so I never know how much time remains until the end. So for me it was a special torture, to watch the end repeat again and again. Every time I thought, oh, this is the final scene, the last shot, I got one more. Each character-frakking ended the final! This was not particularly necessary. <br /> <br /> What really underscored the schoolchild's amateur skills: the young scenes of Roslyn. Why is it important for us to know that: {a} she lost her sisters and father in a terrible accident and {b} that she has one night with a former student / student? What does this bring to the story? Where was the connection? Now I’m in favor of more European style and random acts of anything in movies and TV shows and all that, but it was just ridiculous. It brought nothing significant to the story. <br /> <br /> In addition, I saw the Last Frakkina Special, and in it Ron revealed his ignorance about the plot: he could not come up with a good ending for the story, so ... he just did not! This is never so much about the characters as they did the last episode. The idea of ​​“it was in the past thousands of years”, mitochondrial Eve, was also used in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and believe me, there are many BSG observers who know this particular H2G2 storyline. And if we talk about Hera, now there is a storyline that did not work, in general. Instead, we get Roslyn to work with his former student, who is 20 years younger. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for older women with young men. The more power they have. But that ... just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> In general, this article is as erroneous as its characters were supposed to be. This is even more relevant to the last episode. I hope that Lost and 24 will do better with their series finals.
