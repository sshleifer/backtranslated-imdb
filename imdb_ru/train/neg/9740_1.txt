Now where have I been? Oh, yes, "Projected Man", yes ... ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <Br /> <br /> Oh, sorry. Yes, "Projected Man." Well, this is a British science fiction yawn. An orange-headed guy projects himself onto a laser, gets a touch of death. Finally he disappears, the end. In fact, the film is not even so interesting. Boring, buzzing, starchy, tough and incredibly boring, “Projected Man” is 77 solid minutes in which no one plays the main role. Dim like water Dim like dust of a door handle. It's boring, like Ethan Hawke - we're talking very boring, people! But wait, regarding our boring cousins ​​from across the puddle, MooCow will now make the right review for the “Projected person”: <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............ <= 8 .
