Just seeing this film, I almost feel that I wasted 2 hours of my life, but I think there is something good in everything: <br /> <br /> If I rated it like any other film, it can only get 1 or 2 vertices, but if I rate it as a low-budget ind. film, he can get 3 or 4. That is, the film must be “full” and without too long passes of boredom or waste of time. This film is not. But I think that many independent films talk about film skills, and, given this, this film has several highlights. If I want to comment on what directors should take with them to their next project, I think that the distorted sound effects had some quality. They also manage to create some characters, but this leads me to the fact that they have to leave in their next project, because building a character takes too much time, since it basically has nothing to do with the plot of the film. Also, one should not continue long periods of time devoted to walks in the next project - what's the point? I think this film is trying to be a little bit in everything (character creation, uncertainty and plot), and as a result nothing comes out (not much) <br /> <br /> This film is too much and tries too hard, and I think it’s should have been reduced to a short film. I easily managed to find one hour of walks or meaningless dialogues that can be cut from the film. <br /> <br /> Too many unnecessary things happen in this movie. The story should have been more orderly. I know that there must be some kind of mystery in this film, but a little surprise to the one who is the killer does not make a mystery. The story behind the “riddle” almost does not attract attention during the film, which leaves the final “point” in the form of a quick unsatisfactory summing up. <br /> <br /> So I would like to say that this film was a good attempt, but I cannot. I hope that the directors learn from their mistakes and will create a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in training on the bench in the production of low-budget films, you don’t need to watch it - you don’t even understand very well why everyone thinks it is bad. <br /> <br /> As others have said, I’m pretty sure that many dozens given to this film belong to people who are somehow involved in this film. This film could not get "10", judging by any distant objective point of view.
