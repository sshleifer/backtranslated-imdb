I can not believe that I spent a half hour, watching such a weak film. If you need to skip only one movie, then this is the one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father recently died, so he starts hanging out with local antisocial adolescents and takes drugs. All this makes him subconsciously more brutal and, finally, such a subconscious mind explodes ... <br /> <br /> into any single character. If the director believes that what I have seen in the last couple of minutes was a great ecstasy, I must say that it is not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is also not mature. Most of the time, I could not see the facial expressions from the actors, and I did not feel that body language was sufficient enough to make an impact. Maybe the team was so tired that it installed a camera there to include everything in the settings. Everyone is happy except the viewers. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are many unrelated scenes and conversations that can be linked, but they are really so random that you can never put them all together, perhaps if you are not the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> Within an hour and a half you can find less than 5 minutes of real acting, and the rest of the time, people just walk, talk and move. Therefore, I really can not comment on the action here. <br /> <br /> Although a good selection of music in the last couple of minutes. Perhaps this is the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I never gave Movie 1, but this film certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch Scary Movies). This is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teens meets an extremely agitated audience. I hope you do not fall into any group.
