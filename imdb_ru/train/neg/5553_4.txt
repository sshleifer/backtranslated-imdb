This third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but still much worse than the original film. What made it better than D2 was that the Bad Guy was changed, and Durant did not return again. In addition, there was actually a hint of character development when it came to the family of the bad guy and Darkman himself. It made my heart soften, and I made this click as much as 4/10, that is ** / *****.
