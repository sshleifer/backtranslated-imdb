Wouldn't it be great if Not Another Teen Movie actually put an end to all this stupid, meaningless, I get more sex than you teen movies? In a perfect world, yes. But this one is even worse. This is not humiliating for stars, it is humiliating for distributors. All jokes are mostly college students telling about things that people are probably not interested in, but this is “fun.” Devon Sawa, who was really good at Final Destination, is just boring in this movie. It makes you wonder if this is bad on purpose. Rating: F
