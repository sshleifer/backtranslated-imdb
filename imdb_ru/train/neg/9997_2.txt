Captain Gallagher (Lemmon) and stewardess Eva Clayton (Vaccaro) are supposedly the hottest things on this deadly journey; luxury 747 airliner, decorated to look like a nightclub-slash hotel ?? there is even a blind pianist who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) - hysterical b! $ 3, and he will do everything to attract the attention of her husband with a henpecked Martin (Christopher Lee) and, later, the rest of the people on board. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments: the Boeing 747 makes a slap in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen breaks her chops when she goes too far, and the furniture (and screaming people), which become “ball bearings” in a sinking pinball machine. <br /> <br /> The consequences of action and salvation are relatively phenomenal here, but little happens between them. Hitchcock was supposed to send this sequel, but I forget the reason why not ?? He would have done wonders for the original 1970, for which this sequel was partially inspired ('77 also received inspiration from 'Flight of the Phoenix'). <br /> <br /> Actors Cotten and de Havilland are reunited from their days in the film “Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte” (apparently, here they do not play heavyweights, but simply reunite with the lovers of Autumn Years). And isn't the actress playing Emily's companion the same one that played the dead girl in the movie “What happened to Baby Jane?” <br /> <br /> The TV actors include the girl from “Mayberry RFD” ( The character's daughter wins a drawing contest or something like that), Buck Rogers, Jill Gerard and Dynasty Pamela Bellwood. <br /> <br />
