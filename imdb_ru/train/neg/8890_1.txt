For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I canâ€™t believe what these people did with a perfectly good game. <br /> <br /> - Let's start with the good, okay? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogues could have been delivered with great feeling. The rest of the actors had to rally it. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are you not dead yet, Romeo? The actor, although not only completely wooden and imperturbable, but could not read his lines with pleasure. He was completely out of focus, with difficulty even looking into the face of Juliet, and he absolutely NOTHING could express it with what was given to him. He who abandons him deserves punishment. Juliet is almost bearable, but she does not give depth to her character and seems to be completely unaware of the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for his entire dialogue. Benvolio was insensitive and ruthlessly broke his lines. <br /> <br /> I had to endure this half-ready production of Romeo and Juliet. Acting was cursed, and the costumes were nothing more than a distraction. I saw the puppet shows of the kindergarten with great effort invested in them. I just wish I could give this movie a zero rating.
