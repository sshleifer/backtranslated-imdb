To begin, I would like to say that I am a fan of a series of American pies. Despite the fact that "Naked Mile" and this one are the worst two, this one seems to be a failure of the whole series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the film was that it was American Pie Film, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of bad things to say about this movie. First of all, the story has a very stale “arched” structure. First comes familiarity with the characters, then the promise of a beta house and, finally, the Greek Olympiad. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes. In addition to the general irrelevance of the plot, the character development is practically absent, which makes a double blow a bad plot. <br /> <br /> Also, I really didn’t like the stereotypes in this film. That is, showing athletes as extremely cool guys who think only about sex, and clearly demonstrate geeks as inferior. In addition, it shows that women are only sexual objects, and men only want to treat women as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting was also bad. Perhaps with the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film is terrible when viewed from a critical point of view. When viewed from a teenage perspective, I think it is better, but this film has a rating of 18+ in most countries, so in fact it should not be viewed by minors.
