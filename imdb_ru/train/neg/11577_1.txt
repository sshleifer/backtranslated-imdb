The director is trying to be Quentin Tarantino, the writers are trying to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger trying to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn trying to be Orson Welles, Michael Rucker trying to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore trying to be Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Dynas trying to get out of the frame as quickly as she can (successfully), do not ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stolz and James Spader trying to hide their embarrassment from this shit. It provides endless, meaningless dialogue and very few actions. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with beautiful elevator halls, an art deco church created by Bruce Goff, and the beautiful, luxurious mansion of Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, don't watch this movie. This does not make the location fair.
