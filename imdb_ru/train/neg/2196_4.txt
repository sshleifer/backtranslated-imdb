The brain (or head) that will not die is one of the most thoughtful low-budget films about the exploitation of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how the script of this disgusting sexist could have been written without the intention to self-parody. And the themes that the female presenter, Ginny Leith, repeatedly expressed — the detached head supported by the machines, the I-V and the clips — seem to confirm that the film had to simultaneously use and criticize gender stereotypes. Shades of Helena's underrated boxing. <br /> <br /> Genderism is abundant and about as annoying as an army of evil ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, overly dramatic and unbelievable, and the game is just normal (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie 4? Because some thoughts are clearly included in this. I'm really not sure what moment the film really tried to do, but it seems clear that he is aiming for an unusually sharp and rough look of horror (without the blood and courage that today's viewers expect). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of “The Brain” is that there are really no heroes in this film, and none of the characters are particularly likeable. <br /> <br /> With all this in mind, this is a rather painful and disturbing look at the early years. American popularity in the 1960s, from the point of view of a woman who survived, despite her missing body, after what should have been a fatal car accident. Her lover threatens to stitch her fresh, high-quality body and make her continue to live with him. For obvious reasons, she is not enthusiastic about this and is forced to make friends with a creature that is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the cliches of the 1950s / 60s about the evils of scientific evil. <br /> <br /> Recommended for lovers of science and graduate students in gender studies. O / W is not recommended.
