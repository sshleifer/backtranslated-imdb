This is a classic example of an increasing problem with movies. Why is background noise and soundtrack much louder than dialogue? What sense does this have? This film is not alone. Most films seem to be doing it now. For 2 years, I wondered if something was wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV, and here it is again. BACKGROUND, which can occur in the city block behind the actors, drowns out the dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this film, it was even more distracting, because in the English version, the woman still muttered all the same. I continued to hope that Gene Reno would say: “Sorry, you would have spoken or removed the globules from your mouth.” If you watch it on DVD and you even have French for high school, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give 4 because Renault was so good in León. People are delighted with the scenery, but I saw it on TV and I lived in the Rockies for several years, so Enh.
