Positively terrible car of George Sanders, from which he turns from a thief to the king of the police. <br /> <br /> Although Sanders was a great character, he was certainly not the lead man, and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely nonsense. Gene Lockhart provided some comic relief until a moment of anger forced him to shoot a pistol with tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and his colleague Carol Landis committed suicide. After this film has become so deplorable, it is not shocking. <br /> <br /> The usual attractive Signe Hasso really means nothing.
