In his 1966 film Blow Up, Antonioni questioned the truth of his hero against the backdrop of British protesters against youth. Asking such questions against the structure of hippie youth movements, Antonioni, intentionally or not, questioned the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a cause, when what you think is true may actually be a lie? On the other hand, the film said that we must fight and actively challenge what we see, precisely because others can deceive us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects were the most sticky parts of “Blow Up,” they created a nice texture and made the film more meaning than it could be. It was a very cautious and mature little film. <br /> <br /> With Zabriski Point, Antonioni discards all the ambiguities and subtleties of the Bang and becomes a complete hippie. The result is a movie full of bad metaphors, stupid ideas and tough stories. How could someone who has shown such restraint and intelligence throughout his career make something so stupid? <br /> <br /> The film opens with a good series of close-ups when we see a group of radicals discussing the meaning of revolution. Suddenly one person (Mark) gets up and leaves. He hates the harsh and orderly nature of the revolution. He acknowledges that while revolutionaries are fighting for freedom, to tie yourself to such a militant cause is to effectively give up your freedom. Like Jack Nicholson in The Passenger, Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a gun and goes off alone. He takes orders from anyone. When the police raid his campus, Mark shoots a guy and runs away. Then he runs to the nearest airfield, hijacks a small private plane and flies into the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia and opposes it to ruthless capitalist cities with their billboards and hollow modern appliances. He sees the desert as a kind of paradise garden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark meets Daria and quickly falls in love. Then Antonioni gives us a funny sex scene in which hundreds of hippies are having sex in the sand. Free from the limitations of modern life, these tree lovers and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism by stooping in the sun. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Mark’s death, and Daria with a fantasy about the explosion of the mansions and the magnificent houses of rich capitalists who killed him. This is Antonioni’s challenge to his audience. Raise weapons, pickets and explosives, he says. Take down the walls before they put you in a cage! <br /> <br /> Of course, the film did not affect the audience. They recognized Zabriski Point as another self-centered commercial attempt at radicalism. A sort of commodity radicalism. It seemed untruthful and tame. <br /> <br /> Thematically the film is pretty stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world and the fat cats that exploit you, you must either run into the desert (Mark) or actively fight the system (Daria). This is all good. But although artists constantly warn us about such gloomy nightmares, they all mostly can’t show us how to manage change effectively. As the end of Fight Club, nihilism and violence achieve nothing. In the real world, social change is usually provoked by modest inventors, spurred by insignificant technical progress. I mean, what freed women more than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad movie. The problem is that Antonioni does not believe in the uprising. He is a calm and contemplative person. An introvert who seems to have made an extrovert film just to get more adoration from the counterculture, which adopted its earlier film "Blow Up". Thus, “Zabrinsk points” is a very pretentious and stupid film. In fact, this is a 50-year-old man who says: “Look at me, I am a cheeky rebel!” <br /> <br /> There are many films in which viewers are invited to fight with the “system”, but they all fall. into one of four categories. In the first category, you have films such as “The Net,” “Luke's Cool Hand,” “The Cuckoo's Nest” and “Spartacus.” All this shows that the life of freedom fighters ends in failure, although in each case the “spirit of revolution” survives. The bottom line is that you cannot influence change, but by dying or failing, the optimistic idea of ​​change survives after martyrdom. In essence, we must continue to fail, not lose hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have films like Fight Club, Zabriskie Point and Fall Down, which simply cause you to explode. Take it all down. Blow it all up. All lies, so that you might as well go out of a flaming weapon. These films are made from evil, reactionary feelings, and not from any common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category "run and not fight." Terrence Malik and Antonioni are masters of this genre. Films such as Passenger, Red Desert, and Badlands show how people flee from worlds they don’t like and create islands or peaceful havens for themselves. Both directors are pessimists, because Malik destroyed his islands, and Antonioni - his islands, which do not give a feeling of happiness or a solution. <br /> <br /> Then you have a fourth category. Such films as Donnersmarck's "The Lives of Others", Ashby's Glory Effect and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" view artists as a force of change and rebellion. In these anti-utopian worlds, in which everyone is content to be a slave of the state, it is the unbridled creativity and free will of the artist / criminal that controls the system. Just by being outside the herd, you create waves. Your comments, actions, and critical views challenge the status quo. Thus, in the film Donnersmarck, novelists and artists undermine Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has Alex, an artist / criminal fighting Nazi bitches, painting the city with blood and sperm.
