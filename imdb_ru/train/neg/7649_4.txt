Joyce Reynolds seems to be able to become an adult for the role of Jeni, a sixteen-year-old crazy boy in a small town called America, who throws her steadfast boyfriend for a soldier away and gets on the cover of Life magazine (listening to the general party). ) all in one week! Continuous squall of wise men, insults, talking about bulls and unfriendly cases, such as Jenny's younger sister, bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as a maid), constantly breaking off for a cheeky child, Jeni’s mother associated with the Red Cross, and Jeni’s father trying write an editorial about problems with modern teens (since Edward Arnold’s sultry, sexless, and cheeky, talkative parents Anne Harding make an incredible couple even in 1944; he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less of them). Oscar nominated (!) For editing Owen Marx, Warner Bros. followed this in 1946 with "Jeni Marries." Reynolds must have outgrown her associates by that time — Joan Leslie replaced her. * 1/2 of ****
