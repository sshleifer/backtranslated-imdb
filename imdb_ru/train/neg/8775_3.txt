LOC could have been a very well-made film about how Kargil fought; he had the space, the budget, and the ability to be Indian "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, it looked like a bloated, 4-hour skid of attempts to mix the course of war with the Masala film. Even the scenes of the war were terribly performed, using the same hill in all their battle scenes and wasting unnecessary time on occasional conversations. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian public, the best film would be a story about what happened in Kargil (like The Black Hawk), or even waste time on a warlike point of view (for example, Torah Torah, Torah). Moreover, he could have used a competent director, such as Ram Gopal Verma, to write, direct and edit the film. Until then, I would like to see someone re-edit this film, with only the relevant parts included; the film is more watchable.
