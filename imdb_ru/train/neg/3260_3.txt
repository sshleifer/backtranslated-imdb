Doc Savage: The Bronze Man is a terrible movie. Badly written, overloaded and just silly. At the same time ... it's a really nice movie on some level. This film asks to watch in a group with a sufficient supply of cheap beer. This is one of those films like “Santa Claus Conquers the Martians” or “Yor, the Hunter from the Future” ... so bad it is almost good. If you have a suitable group of people, this film is a stunner. This is a camp. It's fun. He has a theme from Souza. If you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> By the way, I heard rumors that some studios are exploring the possibility of a remake ...
