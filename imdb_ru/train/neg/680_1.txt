I finally caught up with Starlight last night on TV, and all I can say is this. , , Blimey! It's hard to know where to start - incredibly unusual special effects (pay attention to laser beams shooting from Willie's eyes!), Brutal actions, cumbersome dialogues, inappropriate use of video materials or the kind of serious pretentiousness that Infuses all the products. This is a truly unique experience, and we should all be grateful for it. I designate Jonathon Kay as the true heir of Ed Wood!
