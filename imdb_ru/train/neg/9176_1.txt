You know that you have problems when the introductory narrative basically tells you who survived. Everything goes down from there. Unnecessary, "Matrix" caliber cameras affect the work. Senseless video game cuts. Crisp old sea captains and dumb seamen. Rivers who become skilled fighters in the blink of an eye. Even zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I was hoping, at least, for a zombie film “so bad it is good,” but this film is “so bad that those who create it cannot be forbidden to make a film again.” <br /> <br />
