Years after the fall of the last of the great corporations, the world fell into a new dark era, when cyborgs were being assembled for their parts. Cash, a cyborg woman, goes to the wasteland doctor to find out that she is pregnant. On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who prey on cyborgs), Cash tries to find his way into Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs. <br /> <br /> Cyborg 3: The Recycler is the third (and last, so far away) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a continuation of MASTERS THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial arts festival, which became something of a cult classic because of its funny scenes. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved his predecessor, but was not widely noticed (and was fired by the few who saw it as cheap food). <br /> <br /> This film, on the one hand, tries to be mixed from the first two films (the first was a funny fighter, and the second was a clever story about cyberpunk), but, unfortunately, does not correspond to both points. The budget was clearly lower than that of CYBORG 2, the film was shot in the desert wastelands (like many post-apocalyptic action films of the 90s), removing the old industrial buildings to save money. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film’s plot is the plot of a pregnant cyborg, as interesting as it’s absurd (this film is not the first to try this idea; the ARMITAGE III anime series uses it to a greater degree). But the film falls into the same trap into which many low-budget sci-fi fighters fall, because the shown subjects (synthetic organisms) are nothing but androids. Visual effects are nothing but hand prostheses and makeup effects. <br /> <br /> The acting game is pretty standard for this kind of film, and the lead actress (Christina Hajj) is the only worst cast member ever represented. Instead of rejoicing at the news that she is pregnant, she behaves whimsically and gloomily. Her colleagues are much better, Malcolm McDowell is the usual gangster type who animates the scenes in which he appears, and Richard Lynch is very funny as the main villain. Particularly noteworthy is Andrew Biniarsky, who plays Lynch's right hand, who will later appear in the remake of the Texas Chainsaw and his prequel.
