Christopher Guest does not need to worry, his supreme power over the Mockumentary subgenre is not at all related to being relegated to the background, especially because of this extremely unfriendly attack on RPG gamers. Jokes beyond limp. There is not enough substance to withstand the typical length (especially rancid) of the SNL parody, and, moreover, 87 brutal minutes that I pulled while watching this chatter. The great William Catt (the greatest American hero, House) deserves MUCH better. One thing and only one makes the fact that I realized that it is worth it to think, and that I am writing about it here, so I hope, just hope that I will save someone with such a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Additional features DVD: 2 audio commentary; 7 interviews with various actors; 4 deleted scenes; and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> Optional DVD-Rom: 2 tables <br /> <br /> Easter egg: select the eye in the picture in the main menu for a short scene
