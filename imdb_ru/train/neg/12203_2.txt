I think the time has come for John Rambo to continue his life and try to leave Vietnam behind him. This series is aging, and Rambo is no longer a soldier, but a cold-blooded killer. Every time he appears on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place, and, frankly, I was tired of Hollywood, making it seem like it was. This is not the worst of the films about Vietnam, this honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo, carrying about a 50-caliber machine gun, taking, apparently, half of the Viet Cong army, plus a lot of Russians, is an insult. Worse, the Rambos sounds silly at the end ... Please! Oh yeah, I heard they do another one ...
