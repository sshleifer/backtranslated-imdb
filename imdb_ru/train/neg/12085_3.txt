There is no need to begin this short review with a brief narrative. I mean, is Hamlet Shakespeare for God's sake ?? probably one of the most famous plays ever written. I'm not ashamed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet, like most people on IMDb ?? via Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the show may not be the best place to use to judge a film, in this case I can't imagine trying to watch it without comedy jokes In a word, this German, television version of Hamlet dreary. 152 minutes? Never! Too dark and sad to be something that I want to spend almost three hours on. I have said this many times, but fun for me. And this handcuff is far from interesting. I, however, will give him a couple of points for what I felt was pretty good to play. 3/10 sounds just to me. <br /> <br /> As much as I like MST3K, their comments do not help make Hamlet more acceptable. There are some good riffs here and there, but in general Hamlet is not the same film for MST3K. Shakespeare is too talkative to allow comedy to have any kind of rhythm or flow. No matter how painful it is, I have to give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K scale.
