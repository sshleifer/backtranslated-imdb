"The End of the World" is a film without incident, which is strange, since it is assumed that this is a complete destruction of the Earth. The main character is some kind of scientist, I'm not quite sure which one. He has two jobs in a government (?) Institution, guarded by four guards. His first job is monitoring gears in and out of space (although in reality it’s more like a hobby when he doesn’t work at work number 2). Work number 2 requires him to wear a protective suit and enter a dark room ... at least, this is the best I can understand. Apparently, the "plant" is not entirely secret, as the scientist brings his wife there. She hangs out (they go to dinner) until he discovers a message from space: a major destruction of the Earth, repeated over and over. He says something about the fact that this is the first message from space that he has ever been able to decipher; his wife tells him that they will be late for dinner. Therefore, they leave and go to the party (!?!). After a few moments, he learns that in China there was a strong earthquake. From there the film goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in this, but it does not help much. In addition, Lee gives a dim performance in the spirit of his appearance in Howling II. This film is boring, but there are enough stupid elements in it that you might want to live through once, if you like Christopher Lee or Z-Grade fiction. Plus, there are a lot of videos of land being destroyed.
