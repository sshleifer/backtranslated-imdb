One of my sister girlfriends lent me this game, and it's damn hard! It’s like a kid’s game, but you have to learn how to make tons of intricate movements that require you to turn your hands and turn them into all kinds of awkward positions, and you should look for seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, improve your score! You must also find these incredibly hidden puzzle pieces that require you to complete almost impossible tasks to get them! And I ONLY ON THE STAGE THREE !!!!! Maybe if you don't have a life, you can't stay at home all the time, you could get pleasure from it, but otherwise stay away! AND THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN - THEY DRAW HER OWN THEIR HAIR WITHIN AN HOUR!
