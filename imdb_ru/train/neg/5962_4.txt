Paul Our shot many horror films. In terms of quality, they usually range from fairly good to invisible trash; and, unfortunately, the Horror of the Rising from the Tomb is closer to the last. The plot is just an ordinary story about a witch, a wizard or (as in our case) a sorcerer who is put to death - but not earlier than to swear to take revenge on those who did it ... and so on. One thing leads to another, and rather soon the executed warlock becomes useless again. The plot is slow, painfully boring, and the film constantly seems meaningless. Characters line up stacks of diatribes, and it does not serve the film in any way. Our Paul wrote the script, and if you ask me, he must continue to play, because the dialogue is banal to the extreme and only makes the film even more boring than it is. Carlos Aured, who also filmed “Our” in “The Blue Eyes of a Broken Doll” and “The Devil’s Curse”, gives a boring guide, and he likes that dialogue does not help the film. Sometimes these shit movies have a certain charm; but the Horror of Rebellion from the Grave does not even have it. This is a terribly boring film that interests little or nothing.
