This film is a shame for the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota, and I can't even believe they left Cleveland. (Yes, I understand that at that time the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins took their place in the bottom of the American League, but they were still consistent.) In any case, I loved the first Major League, I loved the second and always waited for the third, when the Indians finally go all the way to the series. You cannot tell me that this was not the plan after the second film was finished. What happened? In any case, if you are a real fan of the original Major League, do yourself a favor and donâ€™t watch this garbage.
