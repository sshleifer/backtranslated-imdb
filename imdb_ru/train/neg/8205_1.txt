Very bad acting and very superficial story. Not even a decent B-Movie. <br /> <br /> Events that were supposed to be shocking, as if people were on board an alien ship, were boring and very lame. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst sci-fi I have ever seen. I saw 5.0 stars and decided to watch it, since I like the genre, but it is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Now there are really very few good films about Alien, I think, because most of them are low budget <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
