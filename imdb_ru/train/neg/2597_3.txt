Drew Barrymore is an actress who has lived through hard times, not only in her career, but also in her personal life. After she became a child prodigy, she plunged into darkness with mediocre movies of poor quality. While she recovered from this dark past, this film remains a reminder of the worst days of Drew Barrymore. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting premise, very much like Brian De Palma's Rise of Cain; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets a story for horror / thriller. Barrymore plays the role of Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after the traumatic event of her past, when it is obvious that her other person killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her past returns to haunt her, as her evil person returns to her life, wanting to destroy her new found world and her new found love In the middle of the chaos, his new boyfriend Patrick Highsmith (George Newburn) try to help Holly fight the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Unlike De Palma’s misunderstood Thriller, “The Double” is intended for much of the mediocre film, which not only never fulfills its purpose, but also ends with one of the worst ends of cinema history. Although Barrymore is definitely not at its best, she manages to maintain her dignity with above-average performance. The rest of the cast, however, varies from mediocre to terribly poor performances, although Leslie Hope manages to be one of the best. <br /> <br /> The script is full of clichés, and de Palma’s influence is quite obvious. While the film is trying to be original, making literary references in almost every line, the dialogues are boring, and the wooden game definitely does not do any good. He has a large share of nudity and for strange reasons, as well as excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> Makeup effects are made by an outstanding KNB and are indeed one of the few good things in the film. However, the strange overuse of effects in the ending out of context reduces the impact of KNB's work and makes it imperceptible that in another movie would be surprising. <br /> <br /> The fact that this B-Cinema does not justify its poor quality, since with a better and more consistent script this film could become interesting. Unfortunately, all we have here is a mediocre film that worsens every second. Worthy of beauty Barrymore. 3/10
