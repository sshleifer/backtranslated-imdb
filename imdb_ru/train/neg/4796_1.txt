I love John Sackson in everything he is in. One day, he takes control of the camera, although he directs the film, which should have been more successfully named “Please do not watch this movie called: House of the Death of Zombies”. A $ 1,000 shock insurance certificate is a tricky way for dear Fred Olen Ray to make you spend $ 14 on a landfill made by the legend of 70s cheese. Ray is leading to RetroMedia. Ray, by the way, makes Charles Band look hotter than the stucco ceilings on the Ford Falcon. Just bad now, both of them - and boring to the same. It's great that Ray is digging this old thing, and in some cases it is in the public domain, like the rest of the dollar video hackers, but in the case of Zombie Death House - (the word “Zombie” is casually superimposed to add possession and interest from FOR) THE ONLY METHOD OF SERVICING THIS TRAIN - ISSUING IT ON THE DOLLARS MARKET FOR ANY COLLECTOR AND SAKSON FANS !!! If you want to see a real Saxon, take a Black Christmas, a Nightmare on Elm Street or a Glove.
