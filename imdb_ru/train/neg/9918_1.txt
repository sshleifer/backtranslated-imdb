Another oscillation of the British cinema flag. Here is real rubbish again. I cannot understand (and I am British) why this excessive, patriotic nonsense has ever been done. Eight years mark you when the Second World War actually ended! Other commentators here noted editing and the obvious seamless use of archived footage. This is extremely poorly observed. The archive footage in abundance. Aircraft models sway from wires in "battle scenes", like many children's kites in the wind. The usual sequences of card numbers are tattooed on a film in order to draw us into the event of Malta. Guinness must have his worst acting performance. The shocking scenes of fights with dogs behind are ridiculous. Hawkins tires us all to death in the area of ​​the map room. Ealing made a lot of great movies. This is clearly not one of them. They should have stayed away from such inconclusive rot!
