I bought this device because I really liked the novel by Anne Bronte when I read it some time ago, and usually I especially like the BBC dramas. But I am very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh a lot more than it touched me like a novel. <br /> <br /> First of all, the music (and songs) seems completely out of place in the historical drama (it sounds like it was written for a modern horror film), and, like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by how cameras rotated and revolved around the actors. I saw several scenes shot this way in “North and South”, and there, it seemed, everything was fine, but in “Tenant” it was definitely overdone and just annoyed. Camera movement cannot make a wooden game live. <br /> <br /> Most of the secondary roles were initially difficult to distinguish, and the script was not clear enough. None of the characters were correctly introduced at the beginning. The little boy played very well, he is very cute and the best feature of the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The characteristic of Helen Graham, made by Tara Fitzgerald, made her look cool and harsh, not allowing emotions to pass through her. It seems she is not able to cry at all realistic. I just could not believe that Markham could fall in love with her, and I do not mention the terrible hairstyle she was given. I could not help feeling sympathy for her husband! I imagine that he is married to such a virago ... In addition, he was the only main actor who sounded right for me. Toby Stevens, I found that everything is fine, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to adapt the novel, which deals with such dark themes as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, the fact that only the reader’s imagination is hinted at and left in the book complains about the television adaptation: creating some scenes, both crude and comic (for example, when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed), and others - too sexual for historical drama! I mean, don't we get enough of these bed scenes in contemporary dramas?
