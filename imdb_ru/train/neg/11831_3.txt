I don’t understand how these animated films keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) they are, people like it. <br /> <br /> I saw this film with two children (5.7). They like almost all the animations (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full, and I was looking forward to seeing the film with its magnificent composition. Honestly, I was bored stupid. It was incredibly predictable and just not funny. There were a few chuckles throughout the film, and that’s all. Of course, they tried to laugh again and again, but they simply did not work. My son almost always tells me that he wants a DVD after we see an animated film, but not on that. My daughter fell asleep halfway through. In addition, the children thought that the character animation looks weird. I have not heard of this since I saw the Polar Express, because of which my daughter had nightmares. Believe me, I'm not one of those who are looking for negative in everything. But quality is quality, and, like many other animated films produced by them, it is very small.
