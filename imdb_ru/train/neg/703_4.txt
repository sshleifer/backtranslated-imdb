College students who clean a convicted hostel are pursued by an elusive killer. <br /> <br /> Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a slightly ridiculous bag for fans of slasher. The value of film production is pretty low, and the story is for the most part fairly ordinary, there is even a creepy ass milling about red herring. In fact, most of the story is fairly simple, with the exception of one or two brutal murders. But the film has indeed improved due to its surprisingly intense climax (in the atmosphere) and one rather bold, unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly dull. Stephen Sachs is the best of all, he has a pretty good temper. Also look for young Daphne Zunihgu in the role of the ill-fated student. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fairly standard attempt by B-slasher, but the final is worth it to savor, and this viewer saved the film from full haha. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
