Since this film lasted only 61 minutes and there was nothing good on television, I decided to record “Zombie Rise” on DVD to pass the time. Even realizing the era from which it came, I was very disappointed. It all started with a strangely elevated quality of the initial score (which is without thoughtful music?), And then with rather slow moving opening episodes. Damn it, I thought that a film about zombies - even from the 1930s - would have SOME chills (White Zombies, of course, have White Lugoshi, of course), but this was not the case. Zero. It was hardly even dramatic (with the exception of a few moments with burning eyes laid on the film to show someone's hypnotizing). As the least boring Zombie King, this film may be interesting, but no more.
