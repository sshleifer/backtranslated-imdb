Good Earth is not a great film, it is the usual way. Perhaps in the 30s everything was different, but who would like to see the life of a farmer. This is not very interesting for me. Yes, Louis Rainer and Paul Mooney do an excellent job of acting, but the film has been dragged out for too long. I could tell you the ending of this movie on the first act. In short, Van Lung (Mooney), a small farmer who does not want to be like his father, is exactly the same as he. Both fall in love with their wives just as they are on their deathbed. The film makes a complete 360 ​​transition from one generation to the next. In addition, there were no good characters or funny moments in this film, he was simply dismayed at the need to remain a farmer during the crisis.
