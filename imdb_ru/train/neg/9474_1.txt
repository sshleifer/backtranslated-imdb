In modern Eastern Europe, life is hard, and prostitution is one of the few career options for young women, and Melania reluctantly chose it. She attracts the attention of the American Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, paying more and more money with her for the time until he finally wants to buy it directly. She has two pimps with different emotional attachments to her, and she is usually passed on like some piece of luggage, without any feelings of her own. Nevertheless, we are in the territory of the “modern art-house”, therefore, from such agreements as the structure of the narration, the lighting of the subject, so that it can be seen, the shooting techniques that add rather than distract from action, and vaguely consistent plot , you can refuse. Most of the time I had no idea what was going to happen, and very rarely did I care. People started to leave the show almost before the last latecomers arrived, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many people come out. <br /> <br /> Images are important to the director - the characters slowly appear or disappear into a dark screen, we get long lengthy shots in which there is nothing special, and one sex scene takes place in the infrared. In fact, for such an unconventional film, sex scenes were surprisingly ordinary; Missionary positions between naked people in bed were abundant, and there were no drugs or other oddities. But perhaps nowadays being ordinary is unconventional. <br /> <br /> Overall, almost completely useless. <br /> <br />
