I thought that Hedy Berress (which managed to escape from the water grave of the first part) will be in the second part. I think no. I just think they should have killed her, like on Friday, the 13th part 2 (you know what I mean). <br /> <br /> This film, like Scream 3 and City Legend 2, followed the films in the film. /> <br /> It was a CLEAN COTTON! The whole movie in the movie is shit. <br /> <br /> BADLY REMAIN!
