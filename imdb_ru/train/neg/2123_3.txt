I go to UCSB and take several classes with the executive producer, Alison Anders. She is a great teacher and director, so whatever she calls, I think it should be very good. This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara Film Festival seemed to me a good choice. <br /> <br /> Although this film included some good shots and cinematography, the lack of plot and consistency really took away everything he tried to accomplish. My main problem was that it was someoneâ€™s first movie, and you could obviously tell. Bad game and even worse screenplay did not allow this film to fly. The soundtrack sounded pleasant music, which gave the feeling of the protagonists' struggle with sadness, which led to his departure and return to where he grew up. I just have to say that, despite some of the best moments in the film, the lack of history and performance really prevented him from being good.
