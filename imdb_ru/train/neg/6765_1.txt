* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant critic of media obsession with violence. But this statement ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers to the vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and counter this painful infatuation with the media. Instead, he gives them an excuse. In the film, almost every victim is portrayed as a man who deserves to be offended. Pursuing vicious stereotypes, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures — stupid rednecks, broken English-speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The only person who kills lovers is also a stereotype. Of course, they are friends with old American-Indian who use hallucinogen - because they are fashionable, man? Let's make him a wonderful character. Fats, Chinese clerks and "assholes" are not cool, so let's make them worthy of death. Instead of perverting, hating, that are corrupted by their wrongdoings, their frenzy makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool, and surreal visual effects are sure to seduce more impressionable people. Justice is ridiculed. Police and prison officials are portrayed as cruel, ugly and vicious compared to the GQ killers. Again, this is not in the media messages in the film, but in the "reality" in the film. There are no nuances or subtleties in the film - just bloated performances and visual effects. The film does not say anything new or concrete about obsession with violence. The proof that the film failed in its message is in real reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this film called it the inspiration for the killings they committed. The “message” of the film failed because it inspires people in the opposite direction with terrible real results. Smart posts are nowhere to be seen.
