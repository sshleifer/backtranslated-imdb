I have done quite a few reviews on IMDb, and this film is unique in that I have never seen the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and not funny that I just could not accept it - even though I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie that I call the “Mel coefficient”. In other words, the better his film, the less you see in the film. Think about it - the producers and the young Frankenstein were great movies, and he was not in them at all. BUT, films like Life Stinks and Space Balls are filled with Mel, and these are pretty crazy movies (yes, I didn't like Space Balls, but this is not the place to talk). <br /> <br /> Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I cannot think of a less amusing subject than homelessness. This is just a comedy. Think about it guys. The funniest (?) Scene in the movie, where Mel jokes with Lesley Ann Warren in a dumpster !! And how funny is that?
