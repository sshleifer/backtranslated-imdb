Since the poster (with only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the entire film has been a scam. One film after another, this film was about nothing - or at least nothing new. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you just paid to see how Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J talk about their new cop. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story of the corruption system in some cities, all secretly supported by business highways and in the city, under the watchful eye of some hot politician. The omnipotent and superior organization is called FRAT, and guess what? they have a crazy psycho shooting and beating at will - suspects, girlfriends, you name it. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so in the end they make mistakes that a young and talented (!!!) journalist discovers. An hour later, after a series of incredibly bad shooting scenes and a lot of stereotypical scenes, everything ends safely and we are served to the last line: you cannot beat the system. Bah! I do not see this waste of film. Freeman and Spacey have only 10 minutes!
