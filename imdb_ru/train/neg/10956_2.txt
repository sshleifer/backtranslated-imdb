I bought this film at Gamestop's discount bunker at a discount, and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is retarded, and they are used as ten different monkeys throughout the entire film, which are unlikely to resemble each other. Not to mention the fact that they use an understudy who is just a short person in a suit and is desperately trying to impersonate a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director most likely committed suicide murder with a chimpanzee after the debut of the preview film for some other Warner Bros movie. low rent, and he eventually owed the studio money. It also does not help that he was not even disgraceful for the terrible work that he did, he was not even known for producing a movie with poop. <br /> <br /> Why was this film shot?
