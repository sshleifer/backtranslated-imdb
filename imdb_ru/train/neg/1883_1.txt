I didn’t think it could be done, but something came and replaced “Open House” - a low-budget horror that someone killed because of the high price of real estate — like the worst movie I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life. <br /> <br /> This was advertised as the best film at the last film festival in Montreal, and it makes me believe that every other record should consist of frames with a blank wall, accompanied by people who read gloomy poetry. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was like a little piece of hell. He is from Austria, and he is trying to stumble in the footsteps of the “Short Paths” and “Blue Velvet Scenes” about various characters living in a dark-bellied suburban area. There is a fat dog owner and his fat wife, who is a stripper for him, a skinny divorced, whose wife still lives with him in the house, which includes his dead child’s untouched room, a very irritating hitchhiker who reads the top ten lists. Forever and ever. Just like two hours plus that I spent in this theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact, but not clever, not interesting, and not even appropriate. I could not say if they were good as actors, because, according to the subtitles, they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of “You're so lame!” They certainly didn’t have to learn a lot, as everyone repeated their scenes at least three times in the scene. <br /> <br /> This is not Gummo or any of the above movies. There is no art that can be opened, and then there is nothing to dwell on, except, perhaps, whether it is worth changing the policy of “never going out during the movie” (which quite a few elderly couples did during the random orgy scene), and if it sounds appetizing It's not like that, unless you are one of the few who don't think your parents are having sex — and with a few middle-aged local couples — to “disgusting shoes”. <br /> <br /> This film was insulting to me. Not a flabby nude, a non-quivering soundtrack, not unstressed scenes involving weapons. I was offended that someone really spent the money to do it when there are capable writers and directors who are looking for funding. I was offended by the fact that someone from another city might have gone to Dog Days and thought that this is the best that we Montreal people can find. Most of all I was offended by the fact that somehow the people who participated in the festival deceived everyone by believing that the emperor had a magnificent and fascinating new outfit, when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as a fat maid wife, striptease <br /> <br />
