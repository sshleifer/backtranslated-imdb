Today I found "They All Laugh" on VHS for sale for rent. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this film, but I liked the links listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to take a chance and buy it. I was looking for IMDb, and a user rating of 6.0 was a great reference. I watched "Micah Martin and Marsh Porter Video and DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Wow ?? four stars! So, I decided that I can no longer waste time and immediately see it. Indeed, I had just finished watching “They All Laugh”, and it seemed to me that this is a very boring, overvalued film. The characters are poorly developed, and I spent many minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot should be funny (private eyes that fall in love with the women being persecuted), but I didn’t laugh at the whole story. The coincidences in such a huge city like New York are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra, as an attractive and very seductive man, with women falling in love with him, as if it were Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is rather ridiculous. In the end, more significant sights, of course, are the presence of the central covers of Playboy and friend Dorothy Stratten, killed by her husband quite after the release of this film, whose life was shown in “Star 80” and “Death U-turn: the story of Dorothy Stratten”; amazing beauty sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; always beautiful, even fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn, and the song "Amigo" by Roberto Carlos. Although I don't like him, Roberto Carlos was the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60s and his fans call him “King.” I will save this film in my collection only because of these sights (courageous Dorothy Stratten). My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria "(" Lots of laughter and lots of happiness ")
