Good thing to run. A poorly conceived opponent with very little difficulty. A scientist who works in the field of communication, sending signals into space and receiving them, falls into the trap of newcomers. Together with his pretty wife, he invades their territory and gets secrets about them. He becomes rather treacherous in this process. Of course, he still has little choice. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a boring movie with a lot of long sections where little happens. The plot is technically not bad. Simply, we usually follow the car, travel through the woods, explore the building. This is what editing is all about. I believe that, technically, history will not support much more. Not much here.
