This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> A remake of the classic 1974 film about the chase “Gone in 60 Seconds” starts well. In fact, this is good, and the plot moves pretty well. But even a large Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original plot was more believable. For those who do not know, in the original story thieves worked as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them? But even with almost every aspect of HB changing. The original Halicki, a remake, is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74th version that made it gorgeous. The one in this version is diluted in just 10 minutes and ends with a special monster effect that removes all the plausibility from the chase. Where the initial chase was very believable, the star was a gimmick that performed all its own stunts, a remake failed in the last 15 minutes. My advice: if you want to watch a movie about a classic car chase, place the original in a shopping cart in your local rolling yard and stay away from a new remake.
