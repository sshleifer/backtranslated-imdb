And he gave him "2" instead of "1" (terrible), because one cannot deny that many visual effects were stunning, a lot of talent was spent on special effects and artwork. But this was not enough to save him. <br /> <br /> “Sepia” in toned, blurry tones, something like this was done many times in other films. There is nothing new there. I can see that there were some clues to other old, classic films. OK. No problem with that. <br /> <br /> But the film should be interesting and interesting, and not something that could put you to sleep. <br /> <br /> The plotline and script of this film was awful, two-dimensional characters. Slow motion It was nice to watch some scenes, but in the end, on the whole, it was pretty boring, I couldn't recommend it.
