*** May contain spoilers. *** <br /> <br /> If LIFE FOR TIME TOKYO was a bold experiment in which real actors who wanted to become reality were given roles in the film, provided they were forced to accept a combination of strong anti-fear prescription. antidepressions and antipsychotic medications (this is a classic combo psychiatric hospital that turns patients into saliva-producing zombies) during filming, then this film would have caused much more interest. Or, if filmmaking was a different type of experiment in which all the actors were deprived of sleep before and during the shooting, then TOKYO TIME could be explained more easily. <br /> <br /> As it is, this film is filled with lifeless actors with low energy. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs and talking to his sister, it turned out that it was difficult for him to keep his eyes open. In almost every scene, he utters his lines, sitting with each part of his body motionless. From beginning to end, his facial expression is best described as a “close dream”. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about the actors talking over each other, because these actors can barely finish pushing out any dialogical lines. Everyone speaks in a depressing, monotonous voice. Laugh No shout. No energy. No one has the energy to make a smile. Result: complete and complete boredom. <br /> <br /> And it does not matter that the direction is simple and amateur. <br /> <br /> Avoid this lifeless movie at all costs. It is better to watch GREENCARD, which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese romantic story, look for LONG REST, in which all that is missing in LIFE IN TOKYO is enough.
