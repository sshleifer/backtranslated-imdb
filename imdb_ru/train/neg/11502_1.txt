This film is painfully slow and has no plot. It conveys the life of a group of dismissed boatmen. One of the elders is sincere in his attempt to get a job. There may be some social comments here, but they are confused, since no one is depicted in a very sympathetic light. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t understand why he had 7.8 when I decided to watch it. I watched all this tedious business and built expectations for a huge redemption payment. Unsuccessful. IMDb rating has always been such a good match to my tastes. Everything above 6.5 was worth a look. <br /> <br /> And my wife says that Javier Barem doesn't even look good in this film. He is not my type, therefore my consent does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> Sigh. I give it 1.
