Quite possibly, this is the worst film that I will see if I live to be 100 years old. I think a group of first graders could come up with better storylines like a cool project than this one. I am dumber that I looked at him, and God will have mercy on the souls who were paid for making this film. <br /> <br /> And after I finally turned it off, I really had a desire to vomit. /> <br /> Nobody had a clue about the photo when he did it. Nobody had a clue about the action. Nobody had a clue about anything. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that f / x sometimes shows that shit. The only time I saw this was on one of Starz! channels - not even the main ones. And it was about 3 in the morning.
