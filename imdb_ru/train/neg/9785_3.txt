This after-school film is not so bad, and that's the problem. Nothing has happened. You feel as though you are still in class. The guy teaches a bunch of young losers how to be good paintball players. We will never see how these losers behave badly, as a good player trains them. They all suddenly turn into good players by meditating. There are also too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexual sister and not enough on some other children. This could have a feeling of “bad news bears” (original), since there was a girl in the team of all the boys, but there was no sensation at all in this film. He does not feel and leaves a dull pain in the bones after viewing, it is not so fun to walk on him, it’s not fun to watch, and he just ... there. Plain. Boring. Something that you will look after school before evening sleep. It's boring, like a long day, and it was a long, long day when I watched this movie.
