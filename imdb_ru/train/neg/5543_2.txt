Seriously, I really like these old movies and their simplicity, but I just watched them for the first time last night, and they were easily in my top five for all time. It should be about a love story or a zombie ??? This film was so bad that after it ended, fortunately, all I could do was laugh at how awful it really was. Fortunately, I am too anal to turn off the film without seeing all this, otherwise I could not boast of watching all this in one sitting! I like to think that something positive can be said in life, therefore, according to this theory, I recognize the most positive advantage of this film, it was very short for a full-length film.
