“P” (or Club-P) really should be called “L” for the lame. Each festival has its own disappointment, and this is something that does not correspond to its widely publicized login: "Thai lesbians are fighting monsters." Rather, it is a story about a Khmer village girl whose grandmother taught her little witchcraft, as well as several strange (but specific) rules: “don't go under the clothesline”, “don't eat raw meat” and “don't take money for your credentials”. Well, guess what, people, the girl moves to Bangkok to collect some money as a “bar girl”, and she manages to break all the rules that her grandmother taught her, which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills “alien Jones” who pay for her Services. <br /> <br /> Although this film cannot be released in Thailand due to its controversial topics, most American viewers will regard this horrible film as a cross between Showgirls and Interview with the Vampire. "as directed by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If it weren't for several scenes with a significant amount of blood, the MPAA could probably rate it only for teenagers. There is literally an adult-rate TV there, although you could expect at least least sex scene, given the fact that the film about the brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life. <br /> <br /> As for the “lesbian” angle, that is, one short jackpot and a couple “I love you” , to prove that the two main stars are really a pair (per brother). And the P-bar should be the only exotic as a dance club on the planet where girls keep their sarongs and do carnival stunts (there is a swordsman who cuts cucumbers from a girl's mouth ... oh, phallic imagery). <br /> NO nudity, NO real monster (if not count the five-foot Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no adult should pay to see such nonsense, except on DVD. You were warned!
