I know that actors and actresses love to try different types of films - hey, nobody wants to do a TV show - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should have known better than that. “Angels in the Outfield” is another film in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day. Do I even need to tell you how this ends? The film is simply frank escapism (examples of high escapism are various science fiction films of the 50s). If these films had some sort of political overtones - or at least they offered us a new perspective on life - then they would be fine; it's just pointless. Much closer to devilish than to angelic. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect that they don’t want to emphasize this in their resumes.
