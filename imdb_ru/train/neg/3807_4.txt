Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of many Woody films, obviously his masterpieces from the late 70s (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his dramas from the late 80s / early 90s (Hannah, Crime and misconduct, Husbands) . and wives) I actually even liked some of his recent efforts (Melinda, anything else, little crooks), but it was awful, although I couldn't be worse than last year at Match Point, but as far as I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was lazily built - mostly a mixture of Match Point, the Manhattan Killing and the Mystery of the Little Rogues, with all the jokes taken - Woody seems to be leaving too, smearing most of her. I mean that with all due respect ... "again and again, until all this becomes too naked. <br /> <br /> I know that most of the actors are waiting in line to work with him, but they should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than this - and in the future he really needs Woody more play the role of a camera if it has any meaning 20 miles away. <br /> <br /> It would not be so tragic if we didn’t have so many great Woody films. Compare that with - but it’s clear that his best days are over, and judging by these efforts, Woody should call it the day before he becomes an industrial joke. <br /> <br /> embarrassingly bad
