This video is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis’s career. As in the Disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of quickly getting money; This is a lazy redraw with Moranis, accidentally compressing himself and several relatives so that they can repeat all the best scenes from the original film. The instant visual effect and sluggish dialogue abound in this foolish lamer, who only did what makes me bored during the times of “The Incredible Shrinking Man,” when this kind of thing was done right. Shockingly, this is the director of the main cinematographer Dina Kandy, who must either stick to his day job or choose the best material next time.
