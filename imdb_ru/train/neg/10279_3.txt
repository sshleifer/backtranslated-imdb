This film was so terrible that it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with terrible sound quality, bad cinematography and a lot of actors who can neither sing nor dance, Anthony Rupp has really managed to give a good idea (especially towards the end). The character Marjorie, the drunken lady, was also a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could be funny without horrible singing and stupid piano music. Admittedly, some songs (fanatical) are quite memorable (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a funny movie that can be watched simply because it is terrible! We think it can be a good stage musical (with great actors).
