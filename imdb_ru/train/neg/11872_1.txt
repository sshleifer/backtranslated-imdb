The only way is family drama, if parents explain everything incorrectly with their message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: they feed a deer for a year, and then kill him for eating their food after killing his mother and first pontifying to accept responsibility for their actions. They blame bears and deer for "misbehaving" by feeding, while they do not take responsibility to use adequate castles and fences or even learn to shoot instead of crippling animals twice and allowing them to linger.
