Some children walk in the mountains, and one of them goes into a large tunnel and finds an old mummified gladiator. He wears a gladiator helmet and spends the rest of the film, killing all other travelers. <br /> <br /> This thing is so meaningless that it drives you crazy. Here is a brief list of things that make no sense: <br /> <br /> 1) The guy and the girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes to investigate and finds another tourist on the street. Then he hears the cry of his girlfriend, so they returned to the tent - arrival the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet away! <br /> <br /> 2) Then these losers hear another girl’s cry (What, 100 feet?), but don’t investigate because they are afraid of being lost. <br /> <br /> 3) The other guy and girl are walking, and around the tenth scene, they tell the guy that due to circumstances, the protocol no longer requires him to address her as a professor. I mean that ...? Firstly, this is just a very stupid thing, and secondly, he never called her professor in the first nine scenes in which they were together. <br /> <br /> 4) The wounded girl attacks Demonika, and he stops her, telling her this part of his training of gladiators taught her to hurt without killing. Hmm, yes, we kind of noticed that she was hurt and not dead, because she got up and walks. But, thanks for this piece of information. <br /> <br /> 5) One girl is tied up in the demonic den, and when someone tries to free her, she instead orders the person to go and get help. Listen, idiot, if she releases you, it will take about 5 seconds and you will not need help. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on. The entire middle section of the film is about how two idiots get lost in the forest, then they fight, then set up a tent and ignore the cries of their friends, then they wander a little more. It's so damn boring and pointless that I turned off the DVD halfway through. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are cute, especially those who get most of the screen time. Demonic himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a child in a Halloween costume, wrinkling his face to look angry. He is running, or should I say, running around as if he is gay. The special effects are comedic, the action is for the most part terrible, and nothing makes any sense. <br /> <br /> In general, perhaps this concept could create a pleasant film if they spent more time and effort on it, getting rid of an absurd dialogue, creating characters with real nice personalities, having some kind of logical flow to action and, perhaps, even the transformation of Demonika into a female character in the sexy dress of a gladiator. But no, instead we get this nonsense nonsense that wears you to death.
