This is the only film I've ever seen that prompted me to write criticism on any Internet site, and this is an important statement from someone who likes the Attack of Monolithic Monsters. This movie is perfect for those who want a harmless movie. For example, he is deprived of sex and violence. I believe that this film is safe for children of all ages. This film is ideal for those who do not want to be entertained, challenged or stimulated. Adults can easily fall asleep in front of the TV while children watch this movie. But do not be surprised if you wake up and find that the children turned off the TV and started the board game. As an adult who likes to have fun, who enjoys everything from worldly to fantastic in realism, drama, comedy and action movie, all those adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination, this film has nothing to do with the offers.
