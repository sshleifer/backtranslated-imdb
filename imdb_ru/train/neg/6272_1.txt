This is an excerpt of dialogue about dialogue, which is led by the wicked, awesome lady-assistant of a famous scientist to her primitive girl before luring three incredibly stupid girls from college to a mansion for experiments on behavior change. Meanwhile, in the local bar, people drink and dance to the lame 80s rock songs. A punk biker has sex with a bike whore on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people, then tries to rape the scientistâ€™s virgin daughter, Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with another biker (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY) who, in turn, is in cohorts with an assistant! Back in the house, the bimbo bitch swims, takes a shower, changes clothes and has sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into the victim's mouth and turns them into drooling zombie killers! <br /> <br /> If this is not enough to entertain you, there is a funny theme song ("Nightmare Fantasy"). "), roller skating, some serious chamomile dukes and an extrasensory puppet (!?) that warns" DANGER! DANGER! "just like the robot LOST IN SPACE and recommends using hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men! <br /> <br /> This mess, filmed in Florida, is so stunningly terrible that several views are recommended for viewing. all in And, hey, isn't that NYPD Blue detective Jill Kirkendall turning CNN's narrator Andrea Thompson into one of the often naked men? Sure! Presumably, this was started in 1982, and later a new video was added to the video in 1985 . <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10 (and I mean, this is a ho Osho!)
