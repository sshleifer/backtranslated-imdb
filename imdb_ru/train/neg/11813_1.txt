Before Stan Lorel became the lesser half of the greatest comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheap performances, many of which were parodies of major Hollywood roles. After an argument with Anderson, Laurel continued an unofficial series of parodies in a small (and more needy) production company, Joe Roca. <br /> <br /> Laurel’s most parodic films at the time were only slightly funny and even less funny. for modern viewers who have not seen the original film, which Laurel parodies. “West of Hot Dog” is a fairly typical parody of cowboy action movies. This is a slightly specific parody of "West of the Pecos", released two years earlier, without any major actors. Since West of the Pecos has never been a huge success, it’s hard to understand why Stan’s film studio chose this particular film as a target for its panic, especially since they had been waiting for it to parody so long after it was released. And where did they get this title "West of Hot Dog"? Perhaps the fact is that “Hot Dog!” Was a sexual interjection approved by American liars in the 1920s. (As in the initial scene of the Machinal production.) <br /> <br /> West of Hot Dog was the producer and director of Joe Rock. Among his many other accomplishments, Rock introduced Laurel Lois Nilsson, and he was subsequently the best man at their wedding. Full disclosure: In the last years of his life, I had the honor of making friends with Joe Rock and interviewing him. At a time when he was almost ninety years old, Rock’s memory was impressively clear ... but he didn’t remember anything about West Hot Dog, and I can't blame him. This film is highly memorable. <br /> <br /> The main character is called Little Mustard: if this should be a parody of something in West of Pecos, I don’t understand. There are a couple of "impossible" jokes, including the Laurel method for riding. At one point in this film, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he unexpectedly ran. “West of the hot dog” is vaguely similar in plot and tone to Keaton’s short comedy “Frozen North,” but Keaton’s version is much funnier. The plot of this film somewhat anticipates the situation in Keaton’s film Our Hospitality, but (again) suffers from comparison: here two strong rebel brothers expect to inherit the Last Chance sedan, but the previous owner bequeathed it to weak-footed Wall. However, the brothers will become legitimate heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, really: is such a testament legal? As soon as Wall takes possession of the property, any further questions about ownership or inheritance become his decision, and not the decision of the previous owner. I had enough time to think about such moments of the law when I watched this boring comedy. <br /> <br /> At some point, the gag includes a rough animation drawn directly on the film. It looks cheap and not funny. <br /> <br /> This “hot dog” is not a pervert or a winner, but simply a whiner. My rating: one point out of 10. Wait, Stan: in a few years you will become a half comedic legend.
