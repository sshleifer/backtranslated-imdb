A boring, predictable and uninteresting story about a person infected with a chemical (Weller) who travels across the country to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, he kills everyone in his path with just one touch of his hands. In his dangerous wake, the doctor (Offended) and a young reporter (Natasha) are trying to stop a man. The film is not an original premise, but even though it can be much better. The end result is just a movie without any tense moments. Even a good cast is completely useless. I give it 4 (four).
