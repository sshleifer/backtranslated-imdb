If you are a movie lover who likes original content and intelligent expectation ... then look, kids, because lunatics really sucks. I am usually more eloquent than this, but ... wow ... that was bad. I especially like when Charles offers Tanya to give her a lift home, she refuses, and then he is seen in the HOUSE. Where is his car? Anyway, just do not see it guys. I really want to be more specific, but the words avoid me. Cats jump on people. The guy got hit by the corn. Cheese is built in the notorious "Wazoo". Just do not see it. Wait, I'll take it back! See this for cameo writer Stephen King as the guy who owns the graveyard. In fact, he is pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But besides that ... wow ... bad.
