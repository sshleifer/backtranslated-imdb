A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lone avenger and a group of surviving scoundrels. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, “Darkness” caused something of a cult after liberation. It's easy to see why - he's loaded (and I mean crazy) with blood, and this is energy and enthusiasm, as was the case in other non-budgetary cult horror films, such as "The Dead Next Door" and "Raven Children", in fact pretty infectious. <br /> <br /> Although this may be true, this, unfortunately, is not enough to save him. The film was shot on Super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would be great if he overshadowed the awful mullet of the main characters.) The soundtrack, made up of annoying Casio, is also lost. The keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what if not using budget horror films and bad Death Metal?) Although no one expects Oscar-worthy performances, the acting is still purely amateur because the actors sometimes seem almost embarrassed instead of to get scared or intimidated. <br /> <br /> In the end, I’m sure lovers of off-budget griefs will like it. All the rest, however, will want a little more meat on the ribs.
