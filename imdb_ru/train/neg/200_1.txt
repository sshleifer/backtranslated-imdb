That the reviewers liked this film surprises me. The plot is confusion. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on other characters and underestimating them all. No one has an expiatory quality or interest. This is not an acute job. It is not figurative. This is not irony. This is not smart. There is nothing straightforward in this tiresome work. That the theatrical release missed is not surprising. The fact that “This Network” is broadcasting reduces this space. I would definitely recommend referring to Garden Smart re-running on PBS or even good information if you encounter this mess on TV late at night. If you come across this on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better without experiencing this routine. Life is short. This film is long.
