the film looks as if the director was forced to shoot this film by some gang of terrorists. in fact, it should be called a dinosaur. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing good about this movie ... even the actors don’t cost a penny. do not waste your time watching this movie. the director must be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad film. I mean, isn't he ashamed to look at people's faces after they watched his movie? Dinocrok looks like it was made in Power Point and pretty much cut and pasted. and this is the same old story. man plays god. creates some creature. he runs away and there are happy people. and finally, the pretty girl and the guy in the sleeveless shirt should come and kill her. blah blah .. you figure it out in the first 5 minutes of the movie
