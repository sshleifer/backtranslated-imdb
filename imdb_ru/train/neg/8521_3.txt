By the way, this gives part of the plot. Charlie Brown's Christmas is one of those timeless classics who teach you to appreciate Christmas and just enjoy the holiday. This, however, does not. He is trying to catch the emotions of Charlie Brown's Christmas, there is even another Christmas play, but it fails with the help of dull and simple jokes. Charlie Brown is no longer interested in Christmas spirit, but wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean (gloves for $ 25 ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the film. Here is one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but does not know how to write Charlie (for some reason he must be in her letter), so instead he decides to call him Sam, because she knows how to spell Sam. In addition, Sally plays an angel in a play with one word a day: “Listen!” Instead, she says hockey stick (har har). If Sally, who says the hark 12 times (everything sounds oddly the same), will not kill you, nothing will happen. Patty and Marcy's mint is a major trick, but it hardly makes it any better. Marcy is ridiculous with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. She sounds like a boy (who does not dispel rumors) and gets angry when she has to play the role of a sheep in a play (terrible baath and all that). Obviously, she is a sheep every year, and she worries that she will forget her lines (lines that she does not have). She is so worried that she mentions this twice, one by one, and receives the same answer. I guess she must have a short-term memory loss or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has annoying advice), but they are unlikely to make up a lot of airtime. I am sure that Schröder is not even that. Overall, it tries to be a parasite to the original, but has compromised the message for a few quick laughs.
