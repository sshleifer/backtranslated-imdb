This is absolutely the worst performance of Robert Duval, which sounds the same as William Buckley throughout the film. His hammy melodramatic play removes any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this was deliberate theft of the scene or unintentional, but this is the only thing that I can remember from a truly forgotten film. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class as an example of what should not be done. Thank God, Duvall took up the bigger and better things and stopped trying to create a cultural accent. He is a good character actor, but that's all. Klaus is much better. His performance is muffled and deserves attention.
