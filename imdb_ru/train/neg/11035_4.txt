This is the most sacred novel I've ever seen. Ideal for idle housewives in kerchief, home clothes and ostrich-trimmed mules in high heels to watch during the day, lying on the couch and eating candy. In fact, candy plays a prominent role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I was able to watch until the end was that I was finally able to look at Keanu Reeves’s dreamy face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast to be well to look like. The only quick action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini, waving his hands with Latin emotionality - Italian rather than Mexican. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is as hard as wood. Unfortunately, no bodices are torn - the hero is shamefully perfect and soft. The aristocratic warm-blooded family cliché of the old world is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italians or Mexicans? This is a fairytale. <br /> <br /> I knew that before the credits ended, this would not be the movie I was hoping for. Glowing grapes looked like a sample of all the commercials in the magazine Women Day. I did not see his name on the list, but the artistic director, undoubtedly, was Thomas Kinkade, who paints canvases of Irish cottages for a million dollars, pressed against fuchsias. This film was literally seen through rose-colored glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue skies, this movie is for you! (The balls also looked very good!)
