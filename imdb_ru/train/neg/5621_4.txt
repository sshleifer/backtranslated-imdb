I am an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic, and thus expected to enjoy this film. However, after seeing it, I sincerely believe that I could make the best documentary myself. His arguments seem to have only four false sources (despite the fact that he was quoted in IMDb credits, I never saw Richard Dawkins anywhere), he was roughly edited along with ridiculously amateur computer effects and does not make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial . The narrative is permeated with ubiquitous, almost adolescently anti-Christian mood, destroying any possibility that the film can really change someone's opinion, and not just preach to the choir (that is, to me). Although there are some interesting discussions about the historicity of Jesus, the film falls into an unbearable enigma when he begins to dwell heavily on the Christian school that the principal attended in his childhood, an institution that clearly psychologically injured him because it took possession of it. day. <br /> <br /> Although the TGWWT obviously had a small budget, there was still an opportunity to make a reasonable comment on the very dubious roots of Christianity. The market certainly lacks skeptical religious documentaries, and this film could help fill the void. Instead, the director decided to insult our intellect with this piece of garbage, which ultimately seems to him to be a kind of therapeutic exercise. It is a pity that his Christian upbringing hurt him, but he should not expose the audience to his mechanism of survival.
