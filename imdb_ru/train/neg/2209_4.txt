If you are reading my review of SyFy's Dinocharki, you know that I can appreciate the low-budget slok that these films can provide for television. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they are still pretty funny in the style of "so bad, it's good." So, still whipping with a sense of guilt for sympathy (and recommendation) to the undeniably fake “Sharkouzavr”, I sat down to watch “Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy”, SyFy the unmistakable recipe of the syfy channel for creating character b-films and the actors involved in William Forsyth and Hunter Tyle, how can this go wrong? Well, to my surprise, he really doesn’t hit the target ... not really, but it’s enough that I don’t recommend it. What for? Well, first of all, his title monster, a terrible hammer-head hybrid, goes to the back of a handful of thugs who really become the main villain of the movie. Despite the fact that the hammerhead does increase the number of people, it (or it, or whatever you call it) only arrives just before it starts to chew, and immediately leaves. The rest of the film is filled, contrasting our heroes with the aforementioned soldiers. For me, this is not so convincing as watching how people eat with a hammer! <br /> <br /> Read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
