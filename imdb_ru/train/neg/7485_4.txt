Of course, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in the comedy Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie and you will find out. <br /> <br /> In truth, Martin, the presenter, was wrong. He does not make a big farce, which he is famous for, from films such as "The Jerk", but instead plays a kind of intermediate character that does not work. Hawn, with whom no one can play, is terrible. Cleese is the only partially ridiculous member. <br /> <br /> To top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. I cannot say how this could be changed, but the characters seem to lack the slightest common sense. They stumble upon New York, doing nothing right, and, unfortunately, nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise absolutely unbelievable, it seems to make it clear that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, the theme is repeated throughout the film. Instead, end up renting the original “Strange Couple” to see this.
