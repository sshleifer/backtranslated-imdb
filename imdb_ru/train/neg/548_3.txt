I saw a rating of 7.5 IMDb for this movie and based on this I decided to watch this movie that my roommate made. She said she saw it before. “This is funny and sad! I cried when I first saw it, ”she said. Perhaps, compared to other films from Bollywood, it deserves 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other films I've seen in my life, it deserves no more than 3. Any film where I can constantly guess what happens next is not good for me. The characters are incredible, the act is not entirely realistic, and their motives are invented. This is too dramatic, and the songs are not so good. My biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are too exaggerated and therefore not realistic at all. Any emotion or connection between characters that is barely perceptible must be reinforced by an unnecessary song. I think I realized that the relationship between father and son was more like the relationship between friends than the relationship between parent and child without having to pass them through a five-minute song. The silly comic relief with the laugh track was not funny or unnecessary (we understand Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the barn). If the film tries to cause tears in the most sophisticated ways possible, it simply does not make sense, just confuses a little. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> As a rule, if someone has lung cancer at the terminal stage, his son, who lives with them, finds out that something is wrong without explanation. Too many wells to count. At first the film was funny and cute in the sense that Bollywood films are for people who don’t watch them so greedily, but it became tedious. To make a movie fun and heartbreaking, it takes a lot of skills, and the best way to do it, as a rule, is not to have all the fun parts in the first half of the movie, but at the end all heart-breaking. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** It may have been a little deeper than other Bollywood films I've seen, but quite a bit. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the film than in parts that were supposed to be funny. I didn’t shed a single tear and didn’t feel that this was so, rather, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust when I tried to make a dramatic finale. I do not recommend this movie if you want to see something good, I recommend it if you want to watch some sad Bollywood movie.
