“Valentine” is another horror movie to add to the list of films “Stalk and Slash” (for example, “Halloween”, “Friday the 13th”, “Scream” and “I know what you did last summer”). This, of course, is not as good as the films I listed about, but this is better than most of the robberies that came out after the first film, Friday, the 13th. One of these films was the 1981 Canadian film My Bloody Valentine, which I hated very much. “Valentine” is the best movie, but it says little. The plot: at the beginning of the film a couple of his classmates are teasing and joking. Then the film moves over the years, when all these classmates have grown up, and then they are removed one by one. It is assumed that the killer is a young boy who has already grown up and is seeking revenge. But is he? Or could it be someone else? Valentina has an attractive cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can, using the material that they have, but the dim scenario actually gives them no justice. However, there are some scary moments. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
