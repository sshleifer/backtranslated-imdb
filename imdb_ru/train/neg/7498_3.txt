Spike Lee has been in decline since his early successes, and this mess did nothing. I often looked at my watch, hoping that the movie would end or go to the bottom. Lee's first film with all-white actors is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? What Italians cuss and love cool sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to watch Scorsese, I would go to Scorsese's movie. The incredibly lame Godfather character only adds to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired several of Leeâ€™s films, especially Do it Right. This film is a waste of time.
