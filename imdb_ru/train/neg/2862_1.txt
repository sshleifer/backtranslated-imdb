Someone should send this guy from Uli Lommel back to the movie school. Has anyone told him that he knows HOW to make a film? Can anyone make films these days? In the past, TALANT was always required before someone could make a film. After watching this shit movie of BTK and the others he made, it seems obvious that the poor guy has as many movies to do as I have. In fact, I think that even I could make films better than Uli, LAME-ALL. This film has absolutely nothing to do with the BTK killer, except for the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S ALL. Where did this guy get the basic idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other ridiculous nonsense that is in the film? This is a classic example of how someone is trying to lure people to view their movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely pathetic. The only serial killer movie that I would call WORSE is the unfortunate movie "DAHMER". This child smoked so many cigarettes that it made me sick. Whoever did this should be shot.
