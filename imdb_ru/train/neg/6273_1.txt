It was a cute movie to the very end. The ending was just another hideous effort for the emasculation of men and the empowerment of women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who eventually gave up her power and control over her relations. It was not by chance that she was driving in a car when they finally left after he had to ask her and beg her to take him back. This film is a victory for all women who believe that they should be responsible for all men and control their relationship with them. For this reason, it was a disgusting film.
