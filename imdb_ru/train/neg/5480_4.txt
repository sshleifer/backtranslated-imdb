It was 1 in the morning, and I had nothing more to do. Do not judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We will be back during Spanish settlements. The group made its way to the island. It does not take long before they encounter a large "reptile" that devours their horse. Soon they are captured by the locals, and in order to be free they must kill the “reptile gods”. CG sucks; This reminds me of CG early console video games. The meetings were unsuccessful. The only positive thing I have to say about this was a native beauty, running about in scanty clothes. Otherwise, it is just an average effort.
