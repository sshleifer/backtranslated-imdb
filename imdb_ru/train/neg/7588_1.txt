A warning to potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story “The Most Dangerous Game,” look elsewhere. "Seven women for Satan" <br /> <br /> only superficially refers to the original work, using the name Zaroff and saying that the character is killing people. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Michel Lemoine plays Boris Zarov. While his ancestor hunted people because they were the only prey that really challenged, Boris’s victims are usually in a position where they cannot protect themselves. The film rumbles from scene to scene with an almost complete lack of clarity. The director seems to have completely ignored the move and left the viewer with a suffocatingly boring film. Several separate scenes are slightly interesting (for example, a sequence of torture stands), but in general the film does not entertain. Viewers who are more interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses at different stages of undressing can find the movie watchable. Most of them are likely to find it better to spend time watching Mentos commercials. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, additional material on the DVD contained a fair amount of information about the film’s history. Apparently, he was banned for several years in his native France, which largely destroyed all the chances of its wide distribution.
