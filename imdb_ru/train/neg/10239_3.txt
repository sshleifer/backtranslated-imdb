Jude Law is laid out in this beautifully filmed movie about vampires, which offers a little more value. Completely lacking erotica, excitement or leading ladies with attractiveness. One decent fight, a few minutes of easy waiting. And the plot of one note. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds a philosophy in a series of conversations between the character Lowe and the murder investigation detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But, despite all their efforts, both actors are put on the edge of the film's banality. <br /> <br /> With a smaller actor in the lead role — and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis’s cinematography — Crocodiles would blend in with a sea of ​​low-cost vampires.
