Whenever the Colombo story deviates from the usual plot (the colorful killer commits a crime, Colombo smokes the killer, Colombo becomes harmful in the process), the authors somehow cannot compare with the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates to the extreme, and the result is a major failure. <br /> <br /> You believe: Colombo never faces a villain until the very end? !! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was tempted to turn it off by about two thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices that we, self-appointed reviewers, bring !!!
