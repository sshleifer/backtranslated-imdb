Bollywood fans greatly appreciate Mard Amitabh Bachan, but I think he is greatly overrated. Manmohan Desai used to collaborate in films like Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie, and I saw everything I liked, so I had high expectations before I watched Mard and was bitterly disappointed. My main claim to Mardu is that it looks like Amara Akbar Anthony, part 2, Mr. Desai may have run out of ideas, because he used this formula for years and years. 1. First of all, some members of the cast are repeated from AAA, for example, a police inspector who educates Amara, a Muslim who educates Akbar, Nirup Roy and several other people. 2. In AAA, Nirupa Roy loses her sight, in Marda she loses her voice 3. In AAA there is a famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba), and in Marda we have Amitabh singing Maa Sheravali. After seeing AAA more than 1000 times, I immediately noticed this. <br /> <br /> My other troubles are that some situations seem ridiculous, although Manmohan Desai made you leave your brain to the movies, but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last trouble is that, compared to the songs in previous films of Manmohan Desai, I found the songs rather disappointing. I know that he has a lot of fans, but I didnâ€™t like him. In fact, it hurts me to write this review, because I am such a big fan and have loved his films since childhood.
