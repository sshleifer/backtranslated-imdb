Tom listens to one of these old radio programs that the children of the 1950s are still watching on TV. However, they did not watch TV when this cartoon was filmed, so people enjoyed it - from comedies to music and horror stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally shakes his boots, listening to some ghost story. In fact, he literally does everything the narrator says, for example: “hair stands on end, an icy chill runs down the spine, the heart beats in the throat”, and so on. D. Jerry, meanwhile, watches Tom and laughs at his frightened backside - cat pranks . <br /> <br /> Then we get the idea that we will see for many years after this 194 cartoon, in which Jerry torments Tom only because of his sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, this is one thing, but when he goes about his business, and Jerry physically (and in this case, mentally) swears at him, it is hard for me to root for the "little guy." <br /> These early T & M efforts were also a minute longer than all subsequent ones. Sometimes this minute matters. It happened here, since it actually took a while to last. It could be reduced to five minutes without missing anything, because the sketches lasted too long. This is usually for Tom and Jerry. As a rule, they are much faster.
