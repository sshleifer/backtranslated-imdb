This is a rather boring film about a scientist who creates a teleportation device and is terribly mutilated when he uses a machine to transport himself. A simple plot, made earlier on the fly, etc. Not only is it disfigured, but it can also kill people with electricity. What is really stupid in this film is that we have to believe that the place where this guy works is against him. He could probably earn millions for the institution in which he works, but the head of the institution is trying to sabotage his teleport every step of the way. In the end, the projected person kills three people for no reason, and then pursues those who have offended him.
