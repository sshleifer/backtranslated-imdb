Serious HOME ALONE / KARATE KID confuses the bad stereotypes about the character that the writer sued, and then shot. You could see the apparent use of a stuntman in almost every scene. Oh, and acting sucks, too. Although I have to say the line: “Sorry, man, I have to make a big dump,” made me laugh.
