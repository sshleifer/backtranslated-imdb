The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest films of the 90s. The second was the same funny with the same cast and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious how they could continue the same story, considering that Kevin would be 17 by 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So what does the director decide to do? He also annoys the child and makes him sick. The kid is 6 years old, and his mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of burger team are idiots? I do not want to go into details if you want to see this movie with sadness. But please, I would recommend you to stay away from this. It is not worth your precious time. Fold a piece of paper, do your chores, put a pencil on your nose, or take a nap! Better then watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
