I am completely shocked to see that the average rating of this film is 5.2 / 10. As for me, this is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I still wonder why I watched it before the end. First of all, the plot is absolutely hopeless, and the acting is really terrible. I think that any completely unknown actress would be better for this role than Susan Lucci; As for Mr. Camara Del Reyes, I think it would be better for him to stay in the Valley of the Dolls. To summarize, this is a complete waste of time (and I try to remain polite ...) to avoid at all costs. My rating is 1 and I still think that it is well paid, but since we cannot give O ....
