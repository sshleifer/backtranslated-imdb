This complete film mess was directed by Bill Rebain, the man partially responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. When I came to the end of “Cold,” I came to the incredible conclusion that this film was even worse than the 60s shocker. Story ?? as it is ?? there are about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of creepy games. The one who manages to keep up the pace and live to the end will win 1,000,000 dollars. This is a very simple plot, but Rebein somehow manages to make the process unreasonable. Things happen. Characters completely forgotten. Nothing makes much sense. And then it ends. Terribly. I mean, what was the end of it? I think you have to draw your own conclusions. Values ​​of production and action are without a doubt a pornographic film standard. In truth, Pamela Roleder (Shelley) is not even that good. She is so incredibly terrible, she is irresistible. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about this shitty fest as a whole, it’s just a basement sale.
