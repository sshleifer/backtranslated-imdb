For your own good, it would be better to ignore any positive feedback about this film. This film stinks. Now, I like (at least in theory) low-budget horror films, but this one makes the worst mistake a low-budget film can make: it takes itself too seriously. And, unfortunately, this is not the only problem. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the murderous Bin clan from the British Illiz, carried over into the modern era. An interesting premise, but there are two things that immediately perplex this film as soon as you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why is the biggest name on the box with the discs Jenna Jameson? She looks below average, can not act, and she has a secondary role. ANSWER: She seems to be a well-known porn star (as you no doubt read in other reviews), so I guess this is a “cameo” look for her. She seems to give the film a much needed “name recognition.” Her top billing is not a sign of her talent, but it is an indicator of how incompetent the rest of the actors are. <br /> <br /> # 2- How can filmmakers be so stupid as to think that Canada can be turned out like Ireland? It does not even remotely resemble Ireland. And the house where guests / victims stay is a big Edwardian thing in a wooden frame from North America. They were supposed to skip the entire Bean theme and develop a story that was happening in NA. Also, if you're going to make a film that is happening in Ireland, it's probably better to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and it was a really bad Irish accent.) Now, it wouldn't be so bad if the director hadn't tried the next "Night of the Living Dead", but it seems he was. Very bad. He could have fun with that. In fact, some scenes were not so unintentionally comic. <br /> <br /> Like the shameful scene of gutting, where the woman is chained to the table, stripped naked, and then cut and gutted. It's funny, you ask? Well, in the remote version of the scene, the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines. This is actually funny after a while. And what self-respecting cannibal eats intestines? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Gosh, we eat hams, ribs and drumsticks. Well, okay. <br /> <br /> Some other actors that were annoying: whiny, creepy Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I THINK that he should have been chosen as STUD. In fact, he is the same loser as his name. This explains why the character, played by the equally annoying Gillian Lee, fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> I checked Jillian Lee through her link to IMDb, and it’s obviously important to know that she graduated from high school with honors. I can't decide if it's more fun or pathetic to know that it is only a couple of years after graduation that a student of honor is doing a nude soft core porn scene in the shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. I wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie? If they have, I hope they get the message: AVOID THIS DESTINY! GO TO COLLEGE !!! I could go on and on, but why. If you like blood, in this film you will find something useful, but no more.
