This film, which was released directly on video, should have a warning label stating that it is dangerous to human health and may cause boredom in the viewer. This is another thinly veiled religious film “The Rapture”, in which good guys (believers) suddenly disappear, and bad guys (non-believers) remain behind. This is an interesting concept, especially because we see how this happens during a flight made by unbelievers who have a sinful relationship with a flight attendant on board (of course, the sinner also does not disappear!) Unfortunately, because all pilots were unbelievers, the plane had not crashed, or the film would have been merciful. Although it might be interesting without heavy religious intimidation, in general, because the film teases, it makes one inhibition, the game is terrible, and obviously computer simulations look very fake. In addition, this is another film shot in Canada, which claims to be the title of New York. Deliver me ... I will just read the Bible.
