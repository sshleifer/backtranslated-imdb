It could be the gay equivalent of Gone With the Wind, given its epic length, but instead he was satisfied with the fact that there was a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing happens. The characters are one-sided and have no other development in history (in fact, there is no history either), except for looking for each other and kissing. It is a shame that an interesting aesthetic position, such as a lack of dialogue, is completely wasted in the film, which makes every effort to study the psychology of his characters with some dignity and to achieve true emotional resonance. In addition, he claims the title of "feature" film using the worst naive clich√©s of cinema snobbery. But in any case, if someone can identify himself with his heavy banality, I think this is normal.
