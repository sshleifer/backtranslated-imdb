Basically it is about a couple who wants to adopt a second child. In the adoption agency, they meet the mouse (Stewart) and decide to adopt it. If you think this is stupid, hold it because it is getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Deliver me!) The rest is pretty much the usual cliché, about family problems, jealousy on the part of the older “brother”, and at the end all problems are solved, and all of them are “happy family”. No matter how boring and exhausted it is, it is also shown in the most rude and artless way. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if the director believed that he was creative by presenting a mouse cliche or he just tried to fill in the minutes, but he only improved the cliche from boring to disgusting. <br /> <br /> Then why did I give 3, but not ZERO? Because of the family cat who loves Stewart as much as the "brother." And because of some funny concerts where Stuart makes good use of his small size. <br /> <br /> In general, I believe that a film will work quite well if: a. Stuart was a PET, not a “sibling.” b. He continued funny concerts, like Stuart trying to outwit the cat, and left boring cliches that are not even combined with anything else.
