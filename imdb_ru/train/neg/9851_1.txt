Even worse than the worst David Lynch "confusathon", "The Brain of the Dead" makes no sense at all. The shamefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton) jumps around like an acid in the Tom and Jerry cartoon. There is little character development. It simply begins to rise on a “strange scale” until it reaches complete chaos. Do not soak into it because of the aforementioned beautiful actors. With them, nothing is given, and you will be wondering what is happening for the whole 85 minutes. I strongly recommend avoiding the “Brain Dead” at all costs, unless you throw your brain to complete nonsense. - MERK
