Yikes made this movie a blow. The characters were weak, the plot weaker. I figured it couldn't be too bad, because he has Christopher Walken, oops. He must have done it because he was bored and needed money. The characters were supposed to be Irish, but no one had an Irish accent. I’m desperately trying to find something good about it, I can’t, except that Walken did a great job with the wooden character. Find something to read or watch the discovery, never watch this movie.
