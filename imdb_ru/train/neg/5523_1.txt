The rule of Georgia must be one of - if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feeling that made me gasp, "what?" during the grueling two-hour course at least 7-10 times. <br /> <br /> In his video, a film about three generations of women was advertised: Jane Fonda as matriarch, Felicity Huffman as daughter and Lindsay Lohan, as a rebellious, overly sexual, poorly dressed granddaughter, the viewer thinks it will be a cliche , easy, crazy about growing up and rapprochement in the family. <br /> <br /> Talk about a false advertisement in it is the worst thing. <br /> <br /> After a lot of shots of animals doing "funny" things against the background of "turning" scenes, not to mention the whole five minutes, focusing on an elderly woman who comes to the doctor's office weekly to change a diaper or one The fact that this film actually talks about how Lindsey Lohan’s character is sexually abused by her stepfather, “Georgia-Rule” creates its own movie genre: unreasonable, horribly acting, inappropriate comedy, concerning extremely serious issues most embarrassing. in a surreal, strange way. If Harry Marshall wanted this film to be a drama / comedy, then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaum. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel that I can make the reader understand the terrifying genre to which the rule of Georgia belongs is to create a hypothetical situation. Tell me that in the film "40-year-old virgin" was told about the celibacy of the main character, because in childhood he was subjected to sexual harassment. But instead of making the film more dramatic, there would be lively laughter and comedy with all the reactions of the characters to fake, lifeless human beings, pretending to be caring. <br /> <br /> Throw the yellow parrot Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, most dimensionless character that could be completely excluded from this poorly written script, along with a male character who throws out all his religious rites. beliefs and morals to be with a crappy, too tanned girl who does not share his interests, as well as an unnecessary chase scene for a car, unrealistic moments when characters try to communicate with each other, and you get Georgia Rule. <br /> <br /> I found this film offensive to those people who struggle with directors, scriptwriters, actors, editors, etc., who have much more talents, but they do not get noticed. <br /> <br /> I don’t see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if necessary, just get drunk before hand.
