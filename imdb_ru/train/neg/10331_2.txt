God, I was bored out of my head when I watched this pilot. I expected a lot from this, as I’m a big fan of James Cameron (and not only after “Titanic,” I could add), and his name in credits, which I thought would be a guarantee of quality (again, he also wrote Lead ..). But this thing failed miserably when it caught my attention at any moment of its almost two-hour duration. For all this time, she barely went beyond the two-line synopsis, and it would be very difficult for me to try to figure out a coherent story from the whole mess of threads that have not gone anywhere. On top of that, I don’t think that the acrobatics surpassed even those that exist in any ordinary episode of “A-Team”. As for Alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she displays only one facial expression on the entire film (sullen and sullen) also makes me rather quickly bored because of her "gallant attitude." You can take me out of this, Mr. Cameron!
