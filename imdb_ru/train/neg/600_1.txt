...... in a horror movie that is. Well, first, let's start with Kate. Her main goals include being laid by George Clooney, looking good and last but not least deceiving everyone. Gotta love her. She had about 3 surprisingly good chances to finish off the disease, but ..... instead, she ran. I mean, she didn't want to take Guy out for 10 minutes, and when she did, it was too late. I mean, the guy tried to rape her. I can not get into these films, where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean, who will honestly sympathize with the guy who kills everyone she meets overnight. The film continued. And as a result, he lost all his authority.
