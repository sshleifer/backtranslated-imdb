costumes, dialogues, historical authenticity are terrible. For example, Stacy Dash and the hanging scene. The loop was accurate (as far as I can tell), but a loop of this type broke a man’s neck. Ms. Dash is left hanging on the end of the rope without any harmful effects until the rope is removed. This type did not choke the person; he killed them at the end of the throw. <br /> <br /> And just before they rob a bank (in memory), they stop in the street for a group hug — with their bandanas hiding their faces — that would be obvious to people on the street. <br /> <br /> Bad editing is a battery pack under this shirt, and obviously the long ride clip shows that they are moving forward and then turns the film over. I really liked the fact that they held the scene with a horse that took shit - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was crap.
