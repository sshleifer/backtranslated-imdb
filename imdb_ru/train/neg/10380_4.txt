I don’t think that someone sitting to watch this movie would expect something remotely similar to the classic ghost story, but you have to ask yourself when it’s all over if you have ever been afraid. It really doesn't work at this level, but the actors try their best, and the film doesn't stop at one of these happy ends. A story about an American couple who travels to Kyoto, Japan, so that Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book, and he brought his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett) with him. Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), who works at the American consulate, helps them find a home to live in and finds one that they often visit. About 140 years ago, in the same house, a samurai discovered that his wife was cheating on him, and he kills them both and then commits suicide. Their ghosts still dwell in the house, and when Fletcher arrives, it will not take long before strange things begin. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER WARNING ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes ghosts inhabit the body of Fletcher, and they start to behave like the Japanese, as they were before, and Laura begins flirt with Alex, leading to romance. Meanwhile, Ted begins to behave more strictly and after he pours the soup down Amy's throat, he turns to Monk for help. Unfortunately, ghosts force Ted, Laura and Alex to act out the scene of death, as it did 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> This film was made by Kevin Connor, known as a good television director, but he did horror and sci-fi movies earlier and worked with McClure on some of them. Although it never comes close to being a scary or developing atmosphere, there are two things in it that I liked. Firstly, he does not have one of those juicy ends where a couple embraces after defeating demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody battle, where everyone succumbs to the evil of ghosts. Secondly, in the cast of Susan George! I have always been a fan of her, although she appeared mostly in Slok, but her performances are always top notch. In addition, she usually looks naked, what she does here in two separate scenes, and although she does not have classic features, she has a unique tomboy that looks like her, and this is one of the reasons why she was so popular. But after appearing in such stupid films, as I think, this led to her going out of business or working only from time to time. This is not a bad movie, but it is never convincing and does not watch ghosts scurry around when Monk gives an exorcism, almost worthy of a giggle or two. The bottom line is that this is stupid, and I hope that George decides to resume his career.
