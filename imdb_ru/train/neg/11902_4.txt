The true thing about this film is that, according to the director, it’s hard for him to find a distributor in the US, because most of those who watched him couldn’t reconcile the seemingly contradictory messages of Christianity and American fear. The idea that someone sees this as a religious film in any case is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Because a missionary prays with homeless people in a mission or wants someone to “get speed”, does that make him a “Christian” film? It could be interpreted that this is actually a mocking religion, because in “Earth of abundance” with all its material excess the best that an organized mission can do is to distribute a bowl of soup and a verse from the Bible. Many unhappy or downtrodden maybe? Lots of useless homeless missions? How about a lot of Vietnam psychiatric veterans? Being the reckless delusional survivor of the agent "pink", should we think that America is the "Land of Plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? Of course, we have few people concerned about the policy of Palestine, based on a telephone conversation of the main characters of the film. Of course, if you were working in a German homeless shelter, it would be unfortunate to worry much more about peace in a distant land than about their own personal survival, because the world knows how Europe is a “continent of plenty” when it comes to sophistication. /> <br /> Indeed, I agreed with the title at the end, since the United States is “The Country of Abundance”, and in this particular case this refers to the abundance of bad scripts, amateur acting and impartial films. Life is too short, and even an American doesn’t have enough “time” to waste time watching this piece.
