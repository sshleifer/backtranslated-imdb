RATING STARS: ***** Saturday evening **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, who won Freddie at the end of the last film, is now trying to rebuild her life . But her unborn child carries a demonic presence - Freddie, trying to re-enter their world. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the directors who got big breaks in the direction of Freddie’s films are Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (“Long Kiss for the Night”, “The Cutthroat”, “Cliffhanger”, “ Die Hard 2 ") and Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2). But, although Russell and Harlin did a good job on this, IMO Hopkins did something fake with this record, which you need to quickly forget. <br /> <br /> The story is clearly stretched as far as possible, since Freddie himself was ridiculously father and ridiculous looking demon child. Even after about an hour and a half, it all becomes quite tiresome, and, of course, not at all scary. <br /> <br /> The phrase "Bon appetit, bitch" is the only memorable moment of this other. Wise very forgettable entry. *
