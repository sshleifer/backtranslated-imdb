This is one of the silliest movies I've ever seen. He rips off almost any type of thriller and manages to confuse them all. <br /> <br /> There is not a single good line or character in this mess. If there was a conspiracy, it was an afterthought, and as for acting, I don’t say anything good, so I won’t say anything. I honestly can't understand how this type of nonsense is created and really released, whether someone thinks somewhere, at some stage, something like “Oh my God, this is really a bunch of crap” and call it in the afternoon. This shit is similar to the fact that people download illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you downloaded it, you did not waste your time or money. Do not waste your time, it hurts.
