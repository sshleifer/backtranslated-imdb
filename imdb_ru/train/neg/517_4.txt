“The Return of Chandu” is remarkable, if one may say so, by the fact that Bela Lugosi is called a hero and not a villain. Why he even gets a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Story as such, includes the Cult of Black Magic Uchast, trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Naji (delightful Maria Alba) and use her as a sacrifice as a means to revive their ancient leader, who simply looks like Naji . Lugosi in the role of Chandu, who possesses magical powers, is trying to prevent the villains. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ray Taylor is doing everything possible, with limited resources and extensive staff. King Kong fans (1933) recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kun at bay in several scenes. The game is mostly terrible. For example, an actor playing a high priest (I suppose Lucien Prival) uses this pronunciation, inspired by an actor's coach, which was so common in early conversations. The less said about others, the better. <br /> <br /> At this stage in his career, Lugosi took part in independent events, because he was still a star at the University. Maybe because in this case he has to play a hero and get a girl who knows. In the late 1930s, his career began to decline, and for Lugosi such a tariff would be the norm rather than the exception. <br /> <br />
