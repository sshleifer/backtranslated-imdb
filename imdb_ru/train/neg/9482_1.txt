Don't even waste your time, let alone pay the rent for this piece of garbage! How it was done is outside of me. (I don’t know why there are at least 10 lines ... I’ve already summarized this crappy film, but, oh well ...) The game was terrible, as if everyone needed lessons. The plot was weak, the ending ... Fe! I think cinematography was the only thing that didn’t completely suck ... well, maybe the sound was minimalist in order. The only good thing is: if they could make this film, even make some money on it, any writer with a REAL idea might have hope. So, you - all have the spirit! I think the same applies to actors ... if these people actually pay, then you can too!
