I stole this film when I was a freshman in college. I tried to watch it three times, the second two, because friends wanted to see it. "Honey, Adam Sandler, I have never heard of this film, but since it is so funny, it must be funny." Wrong! I can't bring myself to watch this pile of crap after a battle for a dream / insulting war, where burning a guy with a good singer causes your opponent physical pain. You might think that this terrible comedy that hurts you is ridiculous, but after watching it you will know its truth. This film is not worth the price I paid for it. I watched a ton of Steven Segal films, and I even watched Crossroads twice ... but I still couldn't watch it.
