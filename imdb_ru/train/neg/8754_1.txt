This film is really terrible. After viewing the advertisement, I thought that she might have her charms ... but this is not so. Girls can't play, and they can't sing. The soundtrack for this film is full of their songs, and this is not a pretty sight, Scary storyline, an incredible story, this is one of the worst Disney films FAR !. Ellie is not a bad actress in the movie “Phil of the Future”, so I don’t know what happened in “The Cow Beauty”. And her sister AJ, it seems, just picked up the "glory" of her sisters, and she does not show any talent. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls finally learned a little cliche of morality, but it’s too late to save this movie of a train wreck. <br /> <br /> Awful
