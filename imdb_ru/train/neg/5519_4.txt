So, the preview of this film only says that the rebellious young girl is leaving for her grandmother for the summer to straighten. This is actually not the case! This is a young naughty 17-year-old girl who reveals a secret, and her mother must believe whether she is telling the truth or not. To be honest, I really liked the concept of this film. They had a really good storyline and a really good theme of the relationship of love and hate between mother and daughter. I did not like to watch Lindsay Lohan play. In fact, this film would be GREAT if they had someone else, perhaps the best actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person, and it kind of reminds us of the real Lindsay, so it takes a lot away from the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I think that if you put Beyond Lindsay, you will like this movie. The ending is pretty cool (and sad).
