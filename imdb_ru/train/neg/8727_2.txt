Let me first say that I can enjoy any bad Italian horror film or film about exploitation in the jungle of the 1970s. Seriously. This one was just awful. <br /> <br /> There are too many elements that Martino is trying to introduce, and none of them work (except for the fact that it’s just crazy) in general. Of course, there are some ignorant Westerners who have somewhere set up a resort in the jungle. I don’t even remember where this is happening ... how sad it is ... Mostly, people come to the resort to see this local tribe and its "ceremonies", but in the end they upset the "God Alligator" of the river, which then continues to run amok, killing both vacationers and some fellow tribesmen. Sounds good, yes? Well, do not expect. There is minimal violence to the end, the special effects are so bad that it was similar to how the kindergarten class performed them, and the added love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes where they seem to set. Lift the camera under water in the pool and throw a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water, and this should be the attacking gator. I am not kidding. In another wonderfully crafted special effect, the “Matchbox” van is struck by the incredibly sinking plastic gator, which suddenly becomes five times larger than the van. (A few minutes ago, he was big enough to eat a man, but now he is overshadowing a full-size cargo van ...) This is really a pity. The only other click that I can remember where the effects were so bad that I was pulled out of the story is the masterpiece of Bruno Matthew, "The Rat", which is with plastic rats on a conveyor belt and everyone who CAN'T be scared. /> <br /> Normally, I would say that Sergio Martino was just a must-see, but you definitely need to go through this. A waste of time and definitely not worth buying for $ 15 + No Shame sticker. It's a shame. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
