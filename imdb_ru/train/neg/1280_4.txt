When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "The Harvey Girls". Is not. This is a pudding that has been overcooked, hit the kitchen ceiling, and was torn off and paved. No music and no historical play, but absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> It all starts with the fact that Patriarch James Woods tells the eldest of his three daughters, a small child who becomes Barbara Stanwick, that she should keep her last name at home. <br /> <br /> So we think it will be a historical story from generation to generation. And this is for a short time. Then it turns into a story about Stanvik's reckless struggle with lawyer George Brent. Why is she so strongly opposed to him? Well, why else? As we learn in the strange sequence of memories told by Stenwick, she once thought that she could inherit some money (for her sisters and, of course, for herself) by getting married. She hit someone she called a village rogue who was actually a budding lawyer Brent. <br /> <br /> So that no one would think that he has a child, a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot. , - well, you know ... They had a hasty marriage, and during a very short time, when they were together, he was conceived. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters is in love with an artist named Gig Young, played by Gig Young. Another sister is trying to pick him up. And so on. D., And so on. D. <br /> <br /> This is a harsh, untiring confusion - quite well acting, but without the slightest logic or plausibility.
