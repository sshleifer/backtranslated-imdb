Who is Betty Page? I certainly did not find out while watching this movie. From what I gathered from other sources, Miss Page was very much in demand in the aftermath of World War II as the queen of the “naughty” paintings, and this is exactly what is depicted in this film. I never recognized Betty, the woman. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of evangelical Christian upbringing and dirty family life that is only hinted at. The film overshadows her personal life and immediately reaches the goal of the film, “naughty” pictures. Characters are introduced and left in several frames, but frame by frame - Betty in her pointed bras, Betty in her belt and stockings, Betty in slavery ..., etc. The film changes from black and white to color every time Miss Paige visits Miami Beach. Then we return to its shades of gray life in New York. Gretchen Mole portrays Betty as one of the silliest girls you've ever met. When Betty confesses to a friend that she missed getting through her high school, getting A- and not A, we can only assume that there were only two students in her senior class. The most interesting part of this film is how Miss Page's fancy "naughty" photos in 2007 look. It is really sad that if a woman who looked like a pig on a spit didn’t even get into My Space or You Tube, I’m not sure that this film was written poorly or some crazy editor tore it into pieces. I would recommend it only as a source for people exploring the history of strange underwear.
