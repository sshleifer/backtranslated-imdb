Shortly after watching this film, I questioned the mental activity of each actor and actress who took part. Elizabeth Shu is a meritorious actress, why would she take such an overvalued opportunity? I have to pay tribute to where the loan should be, though. Some moments in the film were unpredictable and quite awesome, but they hardly compensated for the destructive perverse tendencies of Kevin Baconâ€™s character, Sebastian Kane. I would not recommend this film to anyone, either a man or a woman, who have any form of self-esteem for which to explain.
