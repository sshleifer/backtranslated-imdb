** Possible spoilers ahead ** <br /> <br /> Gerald More, busy in the B-movie actor in the forties and fifties, is leading an expedition to Mars. Before we get to the Red Planet, we are entertained by the romantic patter between Mora and the learned Nora Hayden; fool resident Jack Crushen; and the appearance of Les Tremayne as another scientist wearing a goat’s beard. Martian exteriors have fake backgrounds and shades from red to pink - the Cinemagic process is advertised in advertising. These cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect, a huge Venus flytrap and an unforgettable rat / bat / spider. A whole strange adventure is remembered by a surviving Hayden under the influence of sleeping pills. According to reports, the “Angry Red Planet” has quite a few followers, and probably in the psychedelic sixties, it gathered most of its followers.
