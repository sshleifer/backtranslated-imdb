I received this DVD over 2 years ago and decided to just watch it yesterday. I don’t know why it took me so much time when I liked the show “Inspector's Gadget” and even the new “Gadget” and “Gadgets”. Despite the fact that he may have a bright color pallet and all the technical refinement of a modern animated film, some old things are not enough to absorb this gadget right in the toilet. <br /> <br /> First of all, the classic theme "Inspector's Gadget" Song and music are completely absent. The composer is trying to compromise by making a score that sounds similar, but it is still not good enough. The mobile gadget is now a talking machine, not a machine that can turn into a van. In addition, he looks much prettier and rounder than just cool. Penny no longer has a computer book, and she and Brain almost never appear. <br /> <br /> The plot is missing. There is something in the transformation formula that Dr. Claw uses for some evil that has never been shown, but that's all I got. What was the deal with the short / giant Italian guy, I will never know. It has nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the title is worth something, his last case will not be completed in any way. And it remains in force, so why this is called the “last incident” is also a mystery. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed. This is an insult to a great animated show that is strangely missing from a DVD, but don’t let it induce you to buy any Inspector Gadget DVDs. I sold it in just a few seconds after finally seeing it. No child will like it and appreciate it, and no fan of the old show will tolerate it.
