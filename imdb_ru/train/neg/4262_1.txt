Simply put, the worst movie I've ever seen. It ranges from more than 2 hours, and the decoration of the box was misleading. My friends and I shot it because, we thought it would be a poor thing by 300. You know, laugh and laugh. Not. There is nothing funny in this film, only pain. Then the film begins, and they speak some other language. We think, "Oh, this is just the beginning." But no, from there the film falls sharply and becomes something like a super boring book that you had to read in elementary school, where literally nothing happens for hours, and battle scenes compete with scenes of two children fighting in the playground. Skip Cinematography, and this film belongs to the trash compactor. Such films will lead to the world that we see in Wall-E, which, by the way, was a good film.
