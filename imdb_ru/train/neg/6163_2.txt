Hooper is not funny, not fast paced, not romantic and not informative. There is no real drama here. You would think that in the movie about the greatest stuntman in the world there will be some kind of drama, there was an attempt, but it did not seem real. No learning of the characters, no lessons, it didnâ€™t even look like the actors were having fun, they were just trying to act like they were having fun. It makes no sense to look, unless you like to look at Burt and do not want to look at Sally by chance. Prancer, the horse, was beautiful and did what he had to do. In fact, Pranser was the best actor in this film. Smoky and the Bandit was such a funny movie that I was ready to love Hooper. This film was a real disappointment and a waste of time.
