This film was very well advertised. I am an avid moviegoer and have seen a preview of this film for several months. While I was somewhat skeptical about how funny this film would be, my friends thought that it would be great and made me spin it. Then I went and saw him, I almost fell asleep in my place, until I remembered that I had paid for this film. I forced myself to laugh at most of the things in the film, just to not feel bad and not ruin the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my money out of the movie! I always enter the film with an open mind, not trying to enter them with too high expectations, but this film was not so funny. It wasn’t the worst movie I've ever seen, but it’s definitely worth the wait for HBO. If you have not seen a lot of previews of the film or you like very slow and trite comedies, you can enjoy them, but for true comedy fans, I would say that this is good. Maybe even check out the Comedy Kings again. Something told me to go see “Meet the Parents” !!!
