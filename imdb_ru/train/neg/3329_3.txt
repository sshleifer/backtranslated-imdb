Take your main Frankenstein movie, enter a little Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have Dr. Hakenstein. Of course, it was obviously inspired by the aforementioned films, but it never materializes as something special in itself. <br /> <br /> The scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie takes place during one night when he tries to revive his wife. In order to revive his wife, he decides to cut off the body parts of some of the women in a difficult situation, and, by coincidence, he decided to stay overnight in his home. <br /> <br /> I can not say that acting is bad or directing. Everything here is too standard. What small attempts at humor actually work (look at the scene when Hakenstein continues to hide behind his deaf assistant, because she is surely very upset if she sees him compressing a woman and a needle), but this is hardly enough to recommend This movie. The music is decent, what kind of blood, decent, and the cast looks good. And for half the time, I was even entertained by this film. But I never felt that this was more than a waste of time. This can be avoided. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker.
