How the hell did they do it ?! Representing oneself as a comedy with capers, the uninitiated "$" is, in fact, two hours of people mumbling fragments of sentences. Usually reliable Warren Beatty looks drunk, and usually cheerful Goldie Hawn acts as if she acts on depressants. As for Gert Frob, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more delightful than his character here. Even a guy with a bottle of champagne from LSD cannot save this list of futility. <br /> <br /> Am I comparing this film with Plan 9 from Space? I would not do such things even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was made idiot, but in the end it turned out to be ridiculous; it was made stupid and makes you feel that your brain just melted out of your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for this when they played a major role in Shampoo, but then they played a major role in the terrible Town & Country. Maybe they just shouldn't be in a movie. In general, I would rather tear my skin off than watch it again. Awful. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should redo it with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay to see it.
