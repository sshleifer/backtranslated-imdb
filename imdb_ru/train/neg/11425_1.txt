I don’t know what caused this film to make me react so intuitively to it. Perhaps these were characters who were so unattractive and not convincing enough to take care of them. Perhaps it was an unorganized storyline. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe had long earrings and eyeliner. Perhaps this happened because at some point in the movie they all broke out a song. Perhaps this was because the 1980s were never like this. Perhaps it was because everything was a bright hyperbole. Perhaps this is because during the decay the character pumps a fist, moving away from the camera. I don’t know what made me hate it so much, but if it means that I’m trying to look at it again, I don’t want to find out.
