This British film is truly terrible, and it’s hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, although it’s quite a bit moody. The idea of ​​a bomb in the train sounds good ... but it turns out that this train is ultimately parked for most of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, so there is no danger for anyone. In fact, this film can be used in a film lesson to show how not to make a film of obscurity. True expectation is generated when viewers find out what the characters do not know, and this fact is clearly unknown to the director. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs, but we tend to believe that there is only one. After the first bomb is defused, it seems that there is no longer any reason to watch a movie. But at the last moment, a villain who has no apparent motivation for his actions discovers that there are two of them. We are also not sure WHEN the bombs will explode, so we don’t even have the classic “bomb-ticking bomb” tension sequence. A good 10 minutes or more is spent on seeing how the French wife Glenn Ford thinks about leaving him, and then wondering where he is. She is such an annoying character that we don’t care if she puts up with him, so when she does, there’s nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters are almost devoid of individuality, and none of them have problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it seems long because it's boring and boring. Do not waste your time.
