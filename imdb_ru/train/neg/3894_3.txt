The Incredible Melting Man plays like an extended episode of Man for six million dollars, but with violence and some nudity. I know that this film is a little obscene, but I couldn't help but love it. <br /> <br /> The script and the script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year-old film with a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes a lot of time to really melt, but when he does, itâ€™s impressive enough; we also have one inventive death scene with electric current. Music is also worth noting, this is insane - a cheese mix of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Highlights: <br /> <br /> * Surprise yourself at the slow nurse who jumps through the glass panel for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Surprise one day in the life of a severed head. <br /> <br /> * Beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Surprised when our hero rests from the hunt for a melting madman to get a bowl of soup, and complains about the lack of crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is just too 70s for me to hate it. It is tasteless and dirty, but I thought it was a lot of fun. You could do a lot worse.
