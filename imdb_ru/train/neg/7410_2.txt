I like horror movies that reveal a lot of mysteries, like, for example, “a quiet hill” (which seemed to me to be quite good, but still lacks something) and films that make you guess, I thought it was one of those movies. At first, the film begins with a really good wait and creates a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that it just rolls down a hill, and from there it moves down faster and faster. At first, I mentioned the “quiet hill” for some reason, because I see here a lot of “stolen” themes from this film. In general, I would say, instead look at a quiet hill, it’s better, it’s more scary, I’ve got a lot more expectation, and the finale is much better .. And, best of all, you won’t feel torn off done with this ... It's just one of those "I like this movie, so I'm going to do it in my own really bad version" like a movie ... Oh, and one more thing ... Lordi ... in a horror movie ... it’s like trying to scare a child with the help of a bear cub that “hug me” and I will always love you ” sano on the belly of it ..
