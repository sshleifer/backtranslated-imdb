This film was poorly written, acted poorly and is very predictable. It was a very low-budget project, and I can understand why it was never released and immediately turned to video. It was not even a fun trip, it was just a disaster, and I would like to get 1-1 / 2 hours ago! The colors were terrible along with the plot, in which there are such large openings that it was possible to drive through them by truck. <br /> <br /> The plot itself forced the young bride to do something that she was completely incapable of physically - what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any film comes to mind that is better than this one. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
