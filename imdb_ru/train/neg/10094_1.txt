Mt's little sister and I am self-made horror movie lovers. We saw almost everything, especially zombies. Now we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones. “It's far away” is the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. Not only was the acting game awful, but the special effects, graphics, and “zombie” makeup ever were the worst that I saw. If you can even call it makeup (black eye shadows), then this is a complete proof that you should never judge a book by its cover. Because the cover of the film is the only nice thing. do yourself a favor and DO NOT LOOK THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant in this film that I went so far as to put a note on the inside of the film before I returned it to the film, saying, "This film is a shit, do not waste your time, come back NOW," ha-ha ha, I don't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie! I don't even know how he got the grades he made, that t should be negative
