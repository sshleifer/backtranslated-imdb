We were expecting something great when we went to see this bomb. This is basically a Broadway play, shot on film. The music is just awful. There is not a single memorable song in the film - have you heard any hits from this movie? You will not, because they are not. Some musical numbers sound so long that I got up to go to the toilet and buy some popcorn, and it still lasted when I came back! If they were good songs well - but they suck. The pace is slow, character development is terrible. The leader was praised for her singing, but it sounded like she screamed every song â€” it was almost impossible to resist. This film can offer NOTHING to anyone except the die-hard Broadway enthusiasts. Without a doubt, this is the film with the highest rating that I've seen in my whole life. Full waist of time and money. In this film, there is nothing memorable, except for Danny Glover, who is not enough on the screen and whose character is not sufficiently developed. Rent a video and you will agree - this film was an expensive, overly produced, polished dog.
