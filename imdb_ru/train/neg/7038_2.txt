Oh, yes, the 1980s, the time of Reaganomics and Cunning, Chuck and many other militant stars, hiding in the distant jungle, blowing away the Communists. At that time I could not believe that films such as RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who can forget about the ridiculous RED DAWN?) Earned money at the box office at these cruel action festivals with a rather inappropriate state of affairs? Agenda of the wing, and they are very poorly dated. TROMA`S WAR is a joke about films of this type, but you have to ask yourself if they need to spoof first? Of course not . The War of Tromy lacks any sophistication - although it makes sense that there is no difference between right and left tyrants - and sometimes itâ€™s more like a class-z movie than a joke. Maybe this ?
