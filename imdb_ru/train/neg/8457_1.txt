I only watched this movie because I was impressed with Olivier Martinez at SWAT. But this is not special forces. SWAT had a plot and some cute characters and made sense. The bullfighter had none of this. <br /> <br /> I had to understand that this could not have been something good, after all, the always painfully bad Michel Forbes had a major role. <br /> <br /> One of these posters is titled “Film incoherent. Another called it the worst movie. Both gave the film too much credit. I'm so glad I got it from the library for free, but I still feel deceived. <br /> <br /> IMDb needs to include “0” in the vote “Rate this movie”, only for films like this one.
