Having determined the highest IMDb rating, I decided to watch this movie. Besides this appreciation, I deliberately avoided reading any reviews. I wanted to go to the theater from scratch, not knowing the plot or not having predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my rating, you can see that I was disappointed. I liked the development of the protagonist Mike Enslin. I also liked how the hotel manager tried to dissuade him from entering the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some terrible things. <br /> <br /> The first chocolates appear on the pillow, and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts plausibly. He is in shock. I am inspired and think to myself, it will be good. People who made this film understand that less is more. <br /> <br /> But what happens next was a big disappointment. The subtlety quickly gives way to a predictable approach to the shotgun ... Just blow the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something will work. Let's see a clock radio that turns on by itself? Well, it's always scary. Objects that move in a room? Well, you can't complain about that. Is blood dripping from the walls and drowning? Fine. Ghosts who commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises, shaking, fire, even more shaking, confusion in the room, more blood, etc. And so on. It's all good. And all this has been done before. Over-stimulate our attention deficit. Randomly scatter the audience all sorts of things, and they will not be able to look away. <br /> <br /> Well, that didn't help me. And you know what else? When I watch a horror movie in the theater, I usually hear several groups of girls in the audience screaming in fear in scary moments. But there were no scary moments in this movie. The audience was silent and not interested. I did not feel cold on the back. Nothing. "Shine" was 100 times more than this film. <br /> <br /> Who are these people who say that this is one of the best horror films? Friends of the director? Sorry, I just don't get it.
