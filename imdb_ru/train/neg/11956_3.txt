This film stinks. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was so excited about the shock. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the action was gentle. It could be a good movie. I think it just relied on grotesque visual effects. I can usually work with graphic scenes and human taboos, but it seemed to me that Miike was shooting this in order to film. Just one poorly executed film. Watching this film is simply nothing, except that you are passionate about having exhausted the obvious scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-milking, cruel treatment of parents and brothers and sisters, and the dispersion of feces. I think I just sold the movie to many of you, but I meant when I said that it stinks. He excelled in other films, but I think you had better watch someone poop.
