Has anyone else noticed that when they are in a car, every time the camera turns at a different angle, they switch roads. As in one scene, it is a residential complex with one lane with sidewalks, then they are on a highway with several lanes with a separator, then a country road with two lanes with double yellow lanes. I can understand the low budget, but it was just a messy work on the film. <br /> <br /> I also read other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think that if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, then you might like this movie. However, if you find his job / not funny, I would recommend staying away from this.
