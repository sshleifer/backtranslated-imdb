I love comics. Although I have problems with a complete understanding of the stories ?? The visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decomposition. So I thought I knew what I was ready for. Is it amazing I understood the main plot ?? but some extremely unfortunate decisions were made for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really bad looking "CG human actors" - in close-ups? ??What for?! It did not work at all! Horus - and other gods of Egypt - were successfully created in computer graphics and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think that for real actors this film could become a cult. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
