It just takes your breath away - you really should see it! <br /> <br /> Depending on your point of view, Dylan Walsh is either a savior or a problem here: since he is the only one on the screen who can really get it underlines something similar to natural cadence and kinks, he either destroys the film, pointing out the shortcomings of others, or retains it, providing some context for their horror. <br /> <br /> I am inclined to a later look - thanks to him, it works like a high comedy. He is 7 footers in a dwarf basketball game, his skills are simply not applicable in this context, and his discombination is amazing. <br /> <br /> Real pleasure - Miss Eastwood, the inability to speak simple English is so common that I actually googled her, expecting to know that she is a Russian beauty who pronounced her lines phonetically, not understanding their meaning. But no: she is just a talentless American who will laugh at every line she throws. Whether she knew what those lines meant was an open question.
