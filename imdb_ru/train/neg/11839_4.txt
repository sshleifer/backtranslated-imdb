“Feline meow” contains several scenes that boast a clever dialogue, and several beautiful performances, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected, like Chaplin (partly due to the excellent hairstyle and makeup of a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is irresistible as the writer Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst wins the role of Marion Davis (although why films never use her real stutter is difficult to explain). But these elements do not add up to a successful whole. The writer seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes — the meetings between Davis and Chaplin are especially well thought out — but not so much for the overall picture. Several minor characters do not have to be there and do not behave in concert. The main plot is full of irrationality (for example, why Thomas Ince considers it a good idea to tell Hurst what he really doesn’t want to hear?), And the scenes of the parties are repeated and tedious. I would like to think that the trip on Hearst's yacht was more fun than the film shows. Davis is described as the standard bubble type of “crackers”, which is not entirely accurate, and the screenwriter's ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible. <br /> <br /> Strange, but Bogdanovich, who seemed so connected with the thirties in the Paper Moon, lacks such affection for the twentieth. He insisted that the magnificent costume designer use only black and cream, which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of that time (for example, “Yes, we have no bananas”). When Hurst insists that everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" It looks like the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson before shooting the scene. <br /> <br /> The life of dumb movie stars can shoot exciting movies, I'm sure, but not this time.
