Saw it on tv. I am glad that I did not go to the cinema to watch it or spend money on rent. The film is absolutely predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner to wriggling electrical cables. The plot is really weak and unbelievable - an avalanche-expert guy gets hit by a 20-foot wave breaking a bone (using real shots), and all he needs to do is stand up and shake things up. The avalanche thunders at a speed of a million miles an hour and stops at the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Some of the actual avalanche materials are impressive and demonstrate their destructive power. But the contract between this avalanche and the re-enactment makes this film look even more unreliable. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, don't worry about it even on T.V.
