Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Simple references to films, such as Mission Impossible 2, do not lead to comedy. The film opens quite well with funny white rap scenes and great use of James Woods and Andy Richter. Unfortunately, the film plummets from there. The game is terrible. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The film looks hacked together and at a surprisingly slow pace. Some of the longer gags in this snail movie, including the joints and the previously mentioned Tom Cruise film, are not funny with anyone in my theater. Fortunately, the film stops at the 83rd minute in a disgustingly unfunny final. (I say shockingly, because the final is not even trying to end with humor). I do not know what else to say, except that this is a careless, urgent continuation, made so that Miramax earns some money on the backs of dumb teenagers. In general, a very poorly made movie.
