“Mojo” is the story of the fifties of London, the world of novice rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. “Mojo” uses the technique for shooting the 1950s, often found in films, which emphasizes the physical differences of our time, but also presents a dialogue in a very exaggerated way (thanks in large part to the way speech was presented in films made during that period). ); I have no idea if people really spoke like that outside of films, but no films shot today and made in our time use such stylized language. As if the unnatural discourse of the screenwriters of the 1950s serves as a general symbol of the past, which, as a result, really seems to be a very distant country; and therefore emphasizes the particular, and not the universal, in history. Mojo is distinguished by the strong performance of Ian Hart and the annoying performances of Aiden Gillan and Evan Bremner, the latter still trying to build a career after Trainspotting; but it looks like a historical play, a modern film, incomprehensibly structured in an obsolete idiom. Actually pretty boring.
