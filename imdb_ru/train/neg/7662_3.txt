This should be my movie. Even if it sucks, it still had to be right in my alley; hell, I like the movies "Congo" and "Allan Quatermain." I have a weak spot in my heart for stupid aliens / demons / adventure films. Let's take a look at why I decided to watch this first. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Science fiction almost always intrigues me. 2. I am a big fan of archeology, and in this film there really is a rare treasure. 3. Supernatural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally like. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this film had potential, at least in the “Cheese-horror” section of the video store, but the boy still sucked ass. The only redemptive aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone considers them as interesting as I ... I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now we will pass to some errors. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Despite the fact that the film is generally worse, Reid's game is really terrible. We are not just talking bad, I'm talking about the appointment of Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I do not know if she is able to act, but playing for the museum curator is simply not in her league ... completely. Watching her trying to carry a roll of educated scientist is not much different from what you get by watching installations in bad porn. I mean, it's not just bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those of you who are interested, she does not undress, just to bra in a silly, completely unnecessary love scene. <br /> <br /> Even with Reed’s performance, the film could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems to be written by a 10-year-old. I did not realize that this is an adaptation of a video game until AFTER watching a DVD, otherwise I would rate stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood in a shelter, where he recalls something terrible that happened, he has, of course, amnesia. In adult life, Slater was recruited by a subdivision 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts for evil or something else. Slater had to leave, because he was too rebellious, I think you will never know if it was not in one of those voice-overs during which I zoned. The film begins with Slater's hunting artifacts, which received its last part after some deals with “the Chilean mercenary force specializing in the sale of rare antiquities”. Perhaps I have the wrong quote, but you understand. <br /> <br /> There is an evil doctor who wants to release to the earth several hellions (without explanation), experiments on children, a superdemon / alien. human hybrids, "photon" bullets (the demons do not tolerate sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf, to try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Lord, I can't even get through the cliché elements. The script was in dire need of rework to narrow the focus and provide SOME depths. I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh yeah, people are doomed, and he is just trying to save the human race. I assume it is infected? How did it happen? Oh, right, he has one of the evil demons in his cage, and he takes blood to shoot himself. How the hell did this happen? Why and where did he get superslags (oh yeah, they use the old sci-fi support of parasitic aliens / demons who “merge” with their host’s spine) Of course, Slater, like Blade, is half-super Slug fed, but his slug is “not fully burned out due to electric shock ", thank God. Oh, and people with these "fused" spines have no idea that they are half aliens / demons and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given, from where they turn into killer zombies. Yes, we get zombies. <br /> <br /> So much shit that might be interesting, but none of that. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ending is completely stupid, because everything turns out to be wrong, this is a big deal that needs to be fixed, firstly ... at least, with a small dynamite you cannot cope. <br /> <br /> Not the worst thing you see, but a really bad movie.
