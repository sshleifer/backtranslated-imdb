After watching this movie, I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or about the sound system malfunction of the cinema. At least in the first half of the film it is very difficult to understand what someone is saying because of the background music of the 20s and the scratching of the soundtrack. I was ready to blame the film equipment, but not so - it was the director. <br /> <br /> I was told that the subject of my complaint is an integral part of making a film. It was assumed that the music and sound would be distorted to create a very disturbing effect in the film. Nowadays, directors will go to great lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where and how you see this movie, the sound score will be the same. <br /> <br /> So besides the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere), the distortion sound track itself is a good reason to skip this film. You will hear only the distorted scratch of the sound track and, of course, not the meowing of the cat.
