Just a dumb old movie. At first, Stanvik's son got really stupid in his leg, and then her husband stuck in his leg to others really stupid. In an effort to save him, Stenwick is unlucky again, and he is faced with a convict escaped. She has a chance to kill him, but she is very stupid. In the end, her husband is saved, and Stanvik tells us through the narration what the stupid idea of ​​the film is. All is well, than stupid. <br /> <br /> I could never understand how such an unattractive woman as Stanvik became the leading woman of the Hollywood glamorous Golden Era; Is this nose so beautiful ?? So photogenic ?? The film, fortunately, is short, just over an hour. As if the director felt that he was doing shit, so he decided that it was better to make it short.
