Kurosawa really messed it up. Every genius is allowed to fail. The idea is good, but the performance is very blurry. <br /> <br /> This movie has a fantastic atmosphere that makes it a bit of a feature film. The poverty of Tokyo deserves a more fair and realistic image. Many of them have interesting stories. Very disappointing movie.
