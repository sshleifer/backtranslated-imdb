The plot of this film is not at all strong, many holes. If you approach it as a car movie, its not bad, there are a lot of great cars in it. I like it because I'm from the place where it was taken. I get the most pleasure from looking at recognizable places in St. Cloud, Minnesota and seeing how the city has changed since '89. This is an interesting historical part for us, the locals. It seems that whenever they make a film, everyone wants to have a relationship with him. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores, since they were all stolen as soon as they appeared on VHS. I needed to get a copy from Japan on Ebay. I wonder how the race goes around the city. I did not know that the director was from St.Cloud.
