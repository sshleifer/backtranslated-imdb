This film - the embodiment of fraud, a direct 11/10 on the scale of fraud. Fake accents as well as tight pants made of cardigan spandex are amazing. Yankees, although the real Scotland can be just as bright, if you ever go there, do not expect that you will be given the most chance to “dance” with the locals. In addition, do not try to influence local opinion with the help of other fine art of dance. <br /> <br /> There are several contagious scenes with songs and dances, but the plot is too stupid and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt that anyone will want to get stuck in the 18th century Scottish countryside in the germs of time, and not in New York City. Maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for the priest to leave the Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of this landfill. <br /> <br /> Look at this to see the beautiful alternative view of the Christopher Strid Parade in Scotland look like on LSD. In addition, I would only recommend it to Hollywood musical trailers.
