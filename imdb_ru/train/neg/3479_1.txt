I went to see this movie in cinemas, and I was shocked when I entered the room. It was just me and my girlfriend! It shouted to me that this film is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the movie was terrible. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. This is a very predictable story of how he fell in love with a girl who hates him. His play is good, but for the comedic aspect of the film he is not very good. The storyline is bad, and there is almost no comedy. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart, and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review does not allow other people to waste money. I was very confused when I left the room !!!
