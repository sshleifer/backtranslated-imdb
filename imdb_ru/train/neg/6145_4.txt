Although I saw “Gimgatu” in the theater back in the 85th year, I could not remember anything from the plot, except for vague images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against the background of stone walls and disappointment about the ending. <Br /> <br /> After reading some other reviews, I took a copy of a recently released DVD to once again enter the world of Gymkata. <br /> <br /> It turns out this is one of those films made during the 80s that will go straight to the video today. Gymnast, movie star Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, recruited out of the blue to enter Parmistan’s country to enter and win the Game, a suicidal, bloody sport sponsored by Khan, who encourages his people to shout, which sounds like "Yak Power. " The goal of the mission is a Star Wars defense system. Jonathan learns martial arts from Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves home. Once trained, he tries to blend in with the locals, wearing a bright red sweater with black and white dashes. It goes without saying that Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life through the stone streets of Parmistan, on the way to a rendezvous with fate and the Game. <br /> <br /> Star, Kurt Thomas was poorly served by director Robert Klaus, whom it looks like, was never on the set. The so-called scenario is simply the side of incompetence. See Other Reviews for many howling everywhere. The city of madmen has a few good points, but is ultimately destroyed by poor editing. The ending ... Fur. There is still a germ of a good adventure adventure here. The Hong Kong version with more intuitive action and a faster pace can even be pretty good.
