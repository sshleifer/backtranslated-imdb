This is a review of Freddie Mercury The Untold Story, theatrical release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007. One of the most fake, boring and tedious biographical documentaries I've seen. If the film that I saw in the cinema was originally released on television, I would have begged its producers and distributors not to deceive a paid audience with the false promise of a cinematographically worthy documentary. Even as a documentary made for television, sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and a pompous, pseudo-literary narration sounded more believable for the sleepy Infomercial pediatric bed. The only redemptive aspects of this "Freddie Mercury's Untold Story", or, well, hmm, was that this "Princess Diana's Untold Story" are original concert, video and television footage - Friddy Mercury and Queen. Witness interviews with inappropriate eyewitnesses with insights, such as: “He was a free spirit” (actually .. I thought Freddie Mercury was a company man ...), belittling these reviews of Freddie, Brian May or Montserrat Caballe, who shed new and delicate light in the complex life and character of Mercury. And ... what's up with Harry Potter? How did the interview with the first girl in love (“... who now works at a travel agency”) and members of the first school group Freddie contributed to what I really want to know about Mercury? The vital milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, Queen, the group remain unexplored. These filmmakers do not ask any provocative questions and do not independently or farsightedly explore their subject, instead providing a tedious montage of politely clean and completely empty comments about a mysterious and brilliant rock legend that doesn’t deserve to be remembered by the biography of the history channel, your grandfather and Grandma can doze off on Sunday evening.
