"F.P.1" means "Floating Platform No. 1". The film foreshadows the creation of "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which will be used as an "airfield" for transatlantic flights of aircraft. Based on the modern novel by Kurt Siodmark; it was filmed in German as “F.P.1 antwortet nicht” (1932), in French as “I.F.1 ne repond plus” (1933) and in English as “F.P.1” (1933). Soon, thanks to technology, non-stop ocean travel became more preferable. <br /> <br /> Stars Conrad Weidt (as Ellissen), Jill Esmond (as Droste) and Leslie Fenton (as Claire) find love and sabotage in all respects the Atlantic Platform. Karl Hartl sent. Mr. Waidt is very interesting to watch; but he is not convincing in the "love triangle" with Miss Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The younger colleagues were the spouses of Lawrence Olivier and Anne Dvorak respectively. And the concept, and the film is not aged. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (3/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Wade, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
