The fact that the cover is a drawing, like those old B-films, should give you a warning about the quality of this film. This, however, is not a B-film. This is a D-film! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors, and animals - WOW - this is the worst data animation ever created in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You are unlikely to ever see the saber-toothed SCAUAR depicted on the front cover. You just hear people screaming, bleeding and dying, and sometimes you see a tiger's teeth or paw. This is so an amateur! It may be worth seeing because it is so bad. Give it to a friend and say, “This is the best movie I've ever seen, and wait for their reaction.” He, he. <br /> <br /> The film is weak to warn him! THIS IS A SPOILER.
