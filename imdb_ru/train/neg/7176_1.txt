I have nothing more to say, but it was terrible. I can't imagine why Helen Mirren and the others were part of this humiliating mess. And if some actors don't want people to question their sexuality, then maybe they should refrain from making more of these films. There was at least one seen that left me curious. Just my opinion. Shudder to think what is happening, what was cut from the film. It is terrible to be surprised that it occurred to the actors who made this film. It is terrible to think about the thought process and voyeurism that occurred in the minds of directors. As I said before, a humiliating mess. This is not even funny. As Ebert said from the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, his is not a good movie, not a good story and its not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
