Shortly after watching this movie, you will understand why he did not even get to the theater! This movie does not deserve the prequel tag. Instead, this is a common theme in Hollywood: to break earlier good films with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film was bouncing around like a ping-pong ball, and character development did not exist. I seriously felt that I was watching a comedy in some moments of the film, because the acting was very bad. P Diddy needs to stop spoiling movies with his terrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this film is Jaklin DeSantis, which looks great in this movie and in fact I enjoyed watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Carlito's Way, I recommend you not to watch it. If you decide to watch it anyway, then treat this movie as if it had ripped off the original, because this is exactly what it did.
