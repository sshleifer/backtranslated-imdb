Yes, unfortunately, I stumbled upon a DVD with this and found it to be incredibly awful. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if some jerk in an orange hat who calls himself "Orange Sherbet" is the best creative idea these guys can come up with for a character, then they definitely shouldn't be on the set. Poor "costumes", bad "interviews", and in general on this disc there is not a single "fighter" with any tiny charisma. <br /> <br /> The “fight” in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots bouncing gently and playfully on a trampoline. They also giggle all the time together, which makes this experience more like a kid's playing time than a "death wrestling". <br /> <br /> In essence, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a rather dim clone of Backyard Wrestling. Only instead of blood, weapons, chaos and wrestling we get a trampoline, giggling children, HORRIBLE audio and some guy named Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Fan or not, avoid this DVD. It's horrible.
