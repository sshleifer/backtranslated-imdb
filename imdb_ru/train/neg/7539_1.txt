Where, where to start, with the description of the comprehensive wretchedness of the last attempt of Neil Laboute to make films? <br /> <br /> There are many fans of the movie, but the most annoying and superficial is Mr. Intriguing. You know Mr. Intriguing, don't you? <br /> <br /> He is a guy who, no matter how stupid, unconvincing and incomprehensibly boring film, he says: “Gee, I don't know why everyone hated him, I found him intriguing.” He is the guy who finds the smell of a dog shit intriguing. Especially when he spreads it in the form of Hitler's whiskers on his upper lip and marches around the house, talking about the splendor of science fiction, which has finely veiled references to Greek mythology. He is also the guy for whom this version of The Wicker Man was created. No one could bear it.
