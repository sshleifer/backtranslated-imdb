“Pandemonium” is a horror movie trickster that sounds more silly than funny. Believe me, when I tell you, I love comedy. Especially comedic parodies. The Plane, the Naked Gun trilogy, Burning Saddles, Anxiety, and Space Balls are some of my favorite comedies that fake a certain genre. "Pandemonium" is not there with these films. In most scenes of this film, I sat in a dazed silence, because the film was not so funny. There are several laughter in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh more than a few times, and that’s all that this film has. God, Scream laughed more than this film, and it was more like a horror film. How strange is that? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
