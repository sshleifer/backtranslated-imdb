Such a narrative is unacceptable. The only reason this film is above 5 stars out of 10 is that George Lucas is behind it, and in its title are the words "Star" and "War." This is an insult to beginner directors and many others who have made clearly excellent films with excellent history, composition and acting, but have not received due recognition. This is a parody. <br /> <br /> First things first. Story. Anakin Evolution? There's nothing here. In addition to a small make-up around the eyes and a few screams, they are not. He becomes a young, stupid, insolent Anakin Skywalker for Darth Vader with one blow. The only thing that corresponded to Darth Vader in the original series is his mind, how good he is in almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you call it. The only constant thing about Anakin, which is perceived in the prequel trilogy, is his consistent folly. He even loses his body due to a bout of stupidity. <br /> <br /> What part of Emperor Palpatine, telling him of the Sith legends, does not indicate that the emperor is a sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> Too many digital takes are used in the battle scenes. Everybody flies around like teddy bears in a mock dollhouse. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every fighter had a rubber digital double jump around. <br /> <br /> In one particular battle scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the battle for climate, both of them actually stop in the midst of parirs and retaliatory strikes to spin their sabers several times apart from each other. . I understand that the fights are staged, but I just shook my head from mistrust and disgust. <br /> <br /> The letter was terrible. The whole dialogue was of extremely low quality. Good actors like Evan McGregor and Natalie Portman did everything they could in their roles, but that was not enough. I can't say enough bad words about this movie. Too many special effects, drawing holes more than the center of the universe, and absolutely no understanding of any characters. This is the biggest mistake of this film: nothing new is offered. We know a rough picture of everything, all that Lucas did was colorize him. <br /> <br /> We knew that Anakin had lost limbs. We knew that Luke and Leia were brother and sister, we knew that Luke was the son of Anakin, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda were going into exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is proposed in this film. If that's all the fans wanted, then it’s good, Lucas couldn't be wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader, he asks Padme and hears that she is dead, he stretches his hand awkwardly and shouts “Neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee”. This scene all the time shouted out a B-movie, and I half expected Darth Vader to play DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER at any time. That's what it is. The B-film, disguised as a huge budget and ultra-loyalist fan base, will go along with anything now that the first two films have lowered their standards to the pits of the Earth.
