Gday Mates! just watched the movie Crock Hunter. it was good, but the show seems more real. it just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with more funny lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snake canines as a hypodermic needle. yeeeowch! for real you know what hurts. and they can't jump high? he grabbed them all by the tail and all that. There were two main shots in this film. when Terry finds this baby Joey, she says: "We have to raise them like a child." Wow! I thought she would get up and feed this baby. This would make it PG-13 though. While on Terry, anyone noticed in the film and in many shows of Terry's knowledge of ritual mating. she knows her sexy stuff. The film takes place in Queensland, Australia. I want koala, dingo and joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog, Sui, actually has a purpose in this film. although small, which turns out to be useless against dynamite beauty. <br /> <br /> Yes, and if someone else is watching this, try and agree with me, saying that the village fat lady with the herd of dogs was right shot at the crocodile he was eating her sheep !! I'd go crazy too!
