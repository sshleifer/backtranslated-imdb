The love story of a boy-girl / sequel with songs, only this time she is a panket, and he is a straight arrow. Do movie lovers really like this movie? Does he have fans? I have to say that the mind is rolling ... "Lubricant 2" is a truly settling enterprise that does not even have the courage, boldness or obvious rabies to drown out the memory of its predecessor (like Jaw 2 or Exorcist II) . No, he whimpers in slow motion and often just stops. It looks and feels cheap, with a large cast, lost among the dirty direction and unfocused circulation. This was the first time that a significant audience saw Michelle Pfeiffer, and although she is not embarrassed, this role should be forgotten. Misfire on the lowest of the levels. NO STARS from ****
