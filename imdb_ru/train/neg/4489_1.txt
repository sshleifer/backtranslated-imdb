The Matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic, but also curious to make you think in your Twilight Zone. Here the general rule is valid - and this continuation does not correspond to its predecessor. Worse, he doesn’t even compare with him. <br /> <br /> “Reboot” explodes on the screen in the most unprofessional way. In the first few seconds, the first impression is usually good, since Trinity is removed in a dream. Immediately after this, the film dives into the nose. After the catastrophic first 45 minutes, he gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix, and the battle with Agent Smith takes place. But he loses all speed when he reaches the 14-minute chase after the car, and it gets worse with a big moaning turn at the end. The worst of all is the long scene of "Zion Rave". Not only does he have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it is also a pitiful reason for porn and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The time bullets of the `The Matrix 'aspect was a good addition, but in“ Reloaded ”they over-use it to make it seem boring. In the first one there were interesting plot twists, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. In fact, this is just a series of stylish entertainment that prevents us from understanding how empty it really is. It works on the wrong principle: the more the better. It seems that the Matrix franchise quickly turned into misfires soaked in special effects that exist in other franchises, such as the Star Wars saga. <br /> <br /> The current standard is mostly bad. The best hero, of course, goes to "Agent Smith" Hugo Weaving - the only one who will be a little interesting. Keanu Reeves is the final Neo, but in all special effects there is little room for impact. The Oscar Lawrence Fishburn Award nomination comes down to a monotonous mentor with a poor dialogue. The role of Carrie Ann Moss in the role of actress could be much better than any other actress. <br /> <br /> The poor movie “The Matrix: Restart” is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first, are unlikely to rush to him. This is only for fans. Even in the film's own subgenre with special effects (“Report on Minorities”, “The Matrix”, etc.). This is still rather meager. My IMDb rating is 4.5 / 10.
