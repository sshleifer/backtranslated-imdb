Adrian had just left the shelter, being rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperately trying to make some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian search for information about his life and where his parents are. This is a film of a new director, and in most films it is completely clear: the scenes are not properly directed, the dialogues are a bit intrusive, some scenarios in the script ... In any case, the ending is unexpectedly well done a little) and this saves the film a little. The actors are well-known and with excellent quality, however, they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; they all made the best papers in another movie. The film turned out to be boring, and probably most of the time you will think how much time will pass before it ends. Of course, there are many worse films, but, of course, there are many better ones.
