I just watched this movie today, and not only is it terrible and terrible, but it seems that the director just gathered a few friends to make a film about a sick person. I also think that this movie has the look of porn videos with this clear crisp just kind of shot. <br /> <br /> Praise heaven, I work in a video store, and I donâ€™t have to pay to call this movie this shit x infinity .. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS FILM !!!!! You'd better watch "Dude, where's my car," than this piece of shit! And it does not say much about this film. <br /> <br /> A scabby scene, and the film is just unplayable. I watched this movie and I wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. <br /> <br /> I went home and escaped after watching this dirty movie, then I took a shower and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had a twilight, I would take the film outside and burn it, because no one should have been exposed to it ... well, maybe these are al-Qedah members ... especially the ones we have in custody, as well as the abusive children who are in prison for life without parole ... just make a stand like a clock, working Orange, and then make the head of this cheese watch it again and again
