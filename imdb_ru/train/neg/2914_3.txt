The title above is used to present the film “The General” to its audience. Gen about the young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The film begins with the fact that she throws her mother to start a new work. While she is traveling, we understand that she is not as close to home as a hospital in a remote area. As soon as she enters the hospital garden, she sees the body of the deceased patient. This is the start of the nightmare over the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two policemen come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are blocked due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with the outside world is also broken. No exit !! These few days will be even dirtier murders. Now everyone suspects each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could be very scary. Of course, the film has some positive aspects. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when she goes to the hospital and her first minutes in the hospital. Actions are in order. Although some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the final blow should have spread to the whole movie. I want to say that it was a good turn, but instead of showing it as a parody at the end, we had to understand that this happens when we see what is happening. The director had to explain everything, which I think did not work. Also, the most dangerous patient in the film should be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and suitable for a person who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the director. I am sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently learned that he is only 21 years old. It made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I'm not going to rate this movie * of *****, though.
