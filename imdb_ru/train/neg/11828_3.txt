A few months ago I participated in a discussion with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmaden) about this movie. The billboard insisted that if I had given “Wash It Off,” I would have liked that. Partly based on this argument, I agreed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> “Let go” has good intentions (at least from Aardman), but he does not have enough strength to put everything together. His best asset is the sewer rat / boat captain Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, was supposed to be the main character of the film instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tough and interesting, while Roddy spends most of his screen time sniffing. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me the most in “FA” is the repetition of jokes that are not funny to begin with. with. When Roddy gets into a squat, the film ensures that he was hit five more times at once. “My name is Shoki,” says one of Rita’s brothers, who then kills Roddy with electric shocks at least three times. My tolerance for cheap pain-related spectacles is always low. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time talking about Katzenberg's Cleptomanian trends for Pixar (one similar movie is a coincidence, five is a breakdown.), but I will say that I am disappointed in Aardman. They can do (and did) much better. Try next time guys.
