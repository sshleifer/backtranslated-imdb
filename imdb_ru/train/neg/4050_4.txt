This is a rather outdated film, the purpose of which is to demonstrate the desire of young people for freedom in some inhuman British school. Oh yes, it's like in the army, you learn to obey and do what they ask you. Yes, young dreams of something else, but it destroys their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. Fine. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is how you can sum up good intentions in “If ... Good Intentions”, which do not cause cinematic problems: the result is a declarative film. Do you understand how bored I am? <br /> <br /> At least, this old man helped Kubrick play McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a film with a really powerful social satire and without complacency.
