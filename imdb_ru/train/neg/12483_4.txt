This film is similar to Conan the Barbarian, but with a lot of sex, rape and murder. Somewhere under all this debauchery there is a conspiracy, but the filmmakers do not show it very well, and this is a shame, because it “may” be a worthy story. Richard Hill demonstrates a solid role in the lead role, as does the villain, who, unfortunately, has not appeared in any other note. The battle scenes are not so bad either - I like the way Deathstalker allows its sword to “drink” the blood of its victims, and there is a lot of nudity and sex to temper the overall level of masculinity in everything. <br /> <br /> In general, not good - but not necessarily so bad ...
