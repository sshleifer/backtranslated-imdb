I'm not quite sure how to begin to describe how bad this film is. I like bad movies, as they are often the most spectacular. I love bad special effects, bad play, bad music and inept leadership. With the exception of music (which turned out better than I expected), this film had all these qualities. <br /> <br /> The effects were surprisingly bad. The worst thing I have seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes that you should pay attention to are: “Thunderous baby”, a woman broken by a mechanical leg, a “Big Ben” scene, a train wreck ... Wow, so many bad effects! On the other hand, some of the alien alien scenes are well made. <br /> <br /> The acting was as bad as possible, since it was based directly on the book of H.G. Wells. In order to have such a good source material, the actors tried to be so overwhelming as to make it ridiculous. And then there is a mustache ... the most distracting piece of hair on the face that I have seen in a long time. Of course, only half of the film contains acting skills. The rest are characters, wandering aimlessly and ill-rendering spectacular shots. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director, it would be unfair to inept directors. Using multicolored filters between frames for no particular reason, using poorly traced backgrounds, even for internal scenes, poor green screening, it surprises me how this person got approval for the production of the film. I would not have thought that it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad film. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone who plans to watch this film is to do what I did: have friends who like bad movies, drink, play poker while watching, keep drinking, and maybe you make it to the end. This is really a great bad movie, so have fun and laugh silly with this disaster.
