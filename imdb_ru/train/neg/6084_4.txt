It is possible that the sled, called the Man, could cause irreparable damage to the floor of the cutting room. Maybe someone will someday demand to cut the director, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to make money on the western market for spaghetti and thus led many Americans to play the role. of. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And, of course, we have Vic Morrow, who wrote and shot this film. <br /> <br /> Garner is always taken off as cute crooks because he’s damn good at playing them. But he played seriously and did it well in films such as “Children's Hour” and “Weapon Hour”. He can and broke away from his usual stereotypical parts successfully. But Sandy, who is called a man, cannot be considered one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He has the main role of the notorious criminal Luther Sand with a great price on his head. After partner Tony Young is killed in the saloon, and Garner takes appropriate measures in Eastwood's style, he is accompanied from the salon by John Marley. <br /> <br /> Marley spent time in a nearby territorial prison, and it seems that the supply of gold was put under lock and key at a rest stop for people carrying things on a regular basis. Garner gathers his gang for robbery. <br /> <br /> That's where the movie is completely hidden behind the wall. Usually films about thefts show the main characters involved in methodical planning. Of course, this was a case in the “Military van”, which was quoted by another reviewer. But in this, Garner decides to break into prison as a prisoner of fake Marshal Dennis Weaver and call a jailbreak when the gold is robbed. <br /> <br /> It was too much to swallow. If taking gold was so easy, it should have been done a long time ago. But I will say for those who love the blood and guts of Italian westerns, during this prison break, enough for three films. <br /> <br /> This is not all, of course, the criminals fall out, and we have another blood feast until the end of the film. But by then, the whole movie had lost a lot of coherence. <br /> <br /> Great thirties singer Allan Jones is listed. But I can not find it in the film. Perhaps the Serenade donkey choir could do it better. <br /> <br /> Nothing could hurt.
