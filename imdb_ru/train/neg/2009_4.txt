This is not a bad movie. The plot (the new house built next door seems to be often visited) is not bad, the mood is quite eerie, and acting skills are in order. The big problem that I encountered was that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not understand how she is distinguished by her outwardly new big lips. I kept looking at them. They look so out of place on her face! They make her look completely different (and no better). <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim, the architect who designs and puts his heart and soul into the house, does an excellent job. And Lara (as a colonel) is also quite good (but these lips!) As the owner of the neighboring house. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson), respectively, is wooden. The various characters who live in the house were also fine. I especially liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people who moved into the house. Unfortunately, the attempt to draw us into the general atmosphere of the neighborhood failed, because the other neighbors are not particularly likeable. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director was unable to make the haunted house particularly sinister. Other films (for example, "The Amityville Horror", "House of the Legend of Hell") achieve such a terrible feeling, but here it just does not happen. The closest is when Kol draws a picture of a house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that didnâ€™t work for me was the turn of the plot that takes place with architect Kim. At first he seemed to be the victim of the house, like the others (it sucked him out of breath), but later he seemed to join forces with him in evil. <br /> <br /> In general, a movie for horror fans is a good idea if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
