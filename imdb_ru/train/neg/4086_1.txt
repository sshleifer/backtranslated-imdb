I came to this film with high expectations. I knew about the work of Greenway and “Bure” and was interested in adaptation. At first I wanted to disconnect after ten minutes, but I felt that it would be unfair. There was an image of a storm, but where do you think that little boy peeing over a toy boat? This is a symbol of what? I continued for another ten minutes, when my finger jerked over the "turn off" button, somewhere something might interest me. This is not Shakespeare, this is not a movie. There is a time and place for this, but I will not waste my time, and in my research of Shakespeare there is no place for it. After twenty-five minutes I gave up, and that was the end. Then I read all the comments on this site, and the pretentiousness of the film coincides only with the respondents. "This is a picture ... then put it in the gallery", "this is a ballet ... keep it on stage." Shakespeare can be done wisely, and the plays were performed for a mass audience, they were available, and this version helps drive a wedge between Shakespeare and the general population as a whole - and I do not think Bard would be happy with this
