A maverick policeman with family problems and a love for using his gun ?? Check out! An isolated place with a valuable object being asked to steal ?? Check out! Tasty-looking love interest ?? Check out! Assorted from the group of stupid cardboard cannon-like villains with cunning European accents ?? Check out! In German, the bad guy sounds, played by an English actor with a piece of banal dialogue for all occasions ?? Check out! Roots one liner ?? Check out! <br /> <br /> Dear, does this movie take a weekend or what? Cliches have become as thick and fast as an avalanche, and most of the actors just stared at how awful the script! <br /> <br /> In a frankly cheap and fun video made only with Die Hard to install on a mountain (complete with some rugged lines of the above) we have all the usual actions, the cliches are gradually removed when we go along with some old-fashioned violence and nudity to wake anyone in the audience who may simply have nodded. <br /> <br /> Jack Wilde is a real cop in John McClain mode, who even controls the time when the ancient bad guy with a gun used all his gags from bullets at one point. <br /> <There are a few well-known faces in this mess who, I can assume, needed only money and / or just played it for the sake of laughter right from a meaningless introductory scene that had nothing to do with the plot, even the final implausible conclusion in combination with tough dialogue and even more complicated action of cts. <br /> <br /> Looking at these three pounds from working with a basket for supermarkets on IMDb, I am surprised to find that this nonsense has generated not one, but two sequels, I need to find these gems on a DVD! It seems that the first sequel is “Under Siege 2”, and the second sequel, well, my God, knows! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing Jack changes with each film, and even the name of the character changes in the third installment. <br /> <br /> However, blind purchases of cheap DVDs will not be the same if studios did not continue to publish material of this terrible quality !!
