The script is so funny ... this, in turn, makes the actors' lines sound harsh and unrealistic, and they cannot be trusted. There is a repetition of phrases - “my dear little daughter-god” and small variations of this line that come to mind ... and this is just a sloppy dialogue of a soap opera. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the music is so WRONG! Plus, the main blues theme is terribly quirky and totally inappropriate for this. And this is felt too often, because the tools, texture and layout of this theme never change, even when the emotional context of the scene changes. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, when he appears, he sticks out like a sore thumb, like the main transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The music is banal, and it’s as if the writer was writing music for soap or a sitcom - a low-budget Canadian sitcom of the 80s in this - and this makes it seem that we are always on the verge of throwing an advertisement. <br /> <br /> This is so wrong, too many replays, and this is a real onslaught that many of these characters use only ONE type of New York accent - a thick Bronx accent. I don’t know if this is a matter of the limited ability of the actors to know only one * New York accent - or is it a question of the director’s ability to notice such an obvious anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is an amateur script with its lead lines that makes this whole “movie” ... a blow. When a foundation is shaky and unstable, it is impossible to rely on it, unless its weaknesses are revealed in exponentially more destructive and unflattering ways.
