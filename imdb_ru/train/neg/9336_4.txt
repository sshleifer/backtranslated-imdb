Criminal drama drama with "bad prey", aimed directly at the black city market of the early 1970s. The star of Pam Greer in the lead role is that of a nurse who becomes an alert woman with one woman after drug addicts make little sister Coffey a drug addict. Furious nonsense goes stubbornly, with canned energy and excitement; only Greer’s short-tempered character gives the impetus to the narrative (she’s not very much an actress here, but she connects with the audience mostly). Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at the time, the film was sold and advertised as rough exploitation, but still managed to find a significant inner-city audience. Today, however, this is just a footnote in the history of cinema of the 70s, and it lacks a wide range of other films in this genre. * 1/2 of ****
