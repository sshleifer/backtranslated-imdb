Despite all the flaws, I liked Cigarette Burn, the episode of John Carpenter’s first season in the series The Masters of Horror. Yes, the story looked like a cheap cross between the “Mouth of Madness” and “8 mm”, but it was still good enough for the budget and time constraints that were given to it. With Pro-Life, however, low budget and time constraints definitely show the most. As always, Carpenter has a clear direction, but in writing and in all the products there is a quality that creates the feeling that it was done in full and complete flux. The scenario is not always clear, the message is unclear, and the story is full of holes in the plot as soon as you look at them. Perhaps if Carpenter rewrote the script, it might be a worthy episode. Instead, it's a mess in which only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest pleasure. Definitely the worst Carpenter ever did. 2/10
