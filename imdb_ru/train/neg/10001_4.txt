There was nothing in this film that I could not understand: the lead actress charisma. This inevitably led to a lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her lead person. Even the romantic scenes seemed just like the actors in the game. It could well have been a director who figured out what he needed from the actors. I just do not know. <br /> <br /> But was it a script? Who exactly was in love with the chef? He seemed more fascinated by his culinary skills and restaurant, and, ultimately, by himself and his young exploits than by anyone or anything else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this film. But do not forget that he was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
