Except for the recognition of good cinematography, I can not say anything good about this film. The only real problem is the dilemma of the protagonist, whether to remain in the world of suffering with his childhood friends or leave them and commit suicide. Abundant "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go with this plot, and because of a bad game, they are also unable to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to present Anthonyâ€™s dilemma and, ultimately, find a simple solution. Characters do not seem to develop, although it is difficult to talk about any characters ... perhaps with the exception of Sonny. Next to him, the actors can not play a lot, and when some of them need it, they turn out to be amateur amateurs. Interestingly, the film was the one that spoiled the most: a superficial script casting off all the plot's potential, or a bad game that interferes with any attraction that may remain.
