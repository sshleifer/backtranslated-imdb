“Christmas Secret” was advertised as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was finished, which makes me think that the producers were really proud of this project. As a film actor myself, I felt that most of the performances were called, although Beaju Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not put this film on my resume. It was an embarrassment. I have been a fan of his since the time of his Waltons, but I did not feel the desire to watch any of his subsequent work, so poor was this offer. <br /> <br /> In the defense of the actors, the directing was nonsense, mechanical, and completely amateur. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not considered to be a malicious review and negative assumptions about my qualification as a critic. I turned on the movie because he had a good cast, and I was ready to enjoy the movie. However, I would challenge anyone who wants to watch this movie and don’t want their money back, even if it was on T.V.
