Jim Belushi has a mid-life crisis, everything goes wrong, when his car goes out on him ... he goes to an empty bar where Michael Kane shows him what life would be like if one event in high school were different . A good premise with some points .. but mostly flat and uninteresting. on a scale of one to ten.
