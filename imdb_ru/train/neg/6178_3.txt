Frank Tashlin's Home Front is one of the most lifeless shorts of Private Snafu, a series of cartoons created as educational films for the military. Instead of taking inappropriate actions that lead to a catastrophe, Snafa focuses instead on his loved ones living at home and on how much they can offer to the military effort. Snaf realizes that he was wrong when he thought it was easy for them. This is a concept with few good jokes, and instead, Tashlin plays a tougher risk card, extended jokes with strippers and skimpy-dressed dancing girls instead of effective comic relief. The result is good intentions, which today have little meaning or entertainment value, except as a historical artifact.
