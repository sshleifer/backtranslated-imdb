I don't even know where to start. "It's all about the family." This should be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie, although it can not be a horror movie, even if he tried !!! Ugh !!! And I know that Owen Wilson is the best actor. He needs to stop playing the token that dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). In the end, this man made a joint recording of "Bottle of the Rocket" and "Rushmore." He has talent. Also Lily Taylor should stick with indie films. She does not belong here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones is to become a porn star. There is no place in legal action for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, ever.
