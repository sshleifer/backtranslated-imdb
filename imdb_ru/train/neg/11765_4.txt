You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. Juicy, banal verse, and it will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with the film Hallmark. Here we get the ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine retiring to tell us that in fact he is not dead, as we thought. Poor Ernie, he is a poor soul who married Ethel Merman a few years ago, and the marriage lasted several weeks. In this film, Ernie first jumps to his feet and portrays his grandfather, who is associated with his long-lost grandson. We have seen this before. You may like this movie, but please do not say that you were not warned.
