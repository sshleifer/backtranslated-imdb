Eleven "great" directors, eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes each of pure fatigue, sophistry, condescension, self-indulgence. Refers to the people of all nations. Yousef Chahin from Egypt says "Hurray thighs!" for terrorism in its amateur segment. Across the green line, we see Amos Gitai from Israel, who uses his eleven minutes to show the act of terrorism and focus on the sluggish news release. Alejandro Gonz√°lez Inarritu from Mexico focused on the Twin Towers, but seemed to forget to turn on the camera. Sean Penn did not know that in the shadow of the Shopping Center there were no buildings 9-11. Shohei Imamura from Japan ignores all this. Claude Lelouch focuses on trivial and cliche love. Ken Loach from UK specializing in Chile. Etc.
