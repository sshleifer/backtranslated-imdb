SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, drove the maiden, Kate (Andy MacDowell), because she mistakenly believes that Jed has an affair with one of her two girlfriends. Kate thought she caught them at the crime scene. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, and then sits down in the middle of the road to put on his shoes. Then a truck knocks him down ("The Crushed", one of the meanings of the name). And dies. <br /> <br /> “And then a truck knocks him down.” Can you imagine a screenwriter who actually represents a script with this plot element? Before that, this is a comedy that intends to be frothy, but there is no real hiss in it. Everyone except Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed, and everyone is sad to the end, when the girls learn to love each other and support, and not destroy. I give it 2 ugh.
