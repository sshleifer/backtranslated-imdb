Where is it written that sequels should suck? Cry 2 did not! Others did not! But this is definitely ... problems include horrible actors (only Christopher Walken could play the entire movie), poor writing (you will never understand what is happening, and I had even explored the idea of ​​Nephilim before), and just a terrible choice for casting. Eric Roberts makes the most stupid Michael Archangel I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague, unless you desperately want to see Christopher Walken. In this case, simply transfer to the parts where it is removed, and avoid others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
