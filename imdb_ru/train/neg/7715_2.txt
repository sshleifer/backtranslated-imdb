Yes it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon scrubbed the trash out of their minds and came up with the worst comedy, horrible, fantastic musical. If there is any action, it is terrible or too much. Special effects; choose ... very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap thought cliche is used. Without a doubt, a funny movie to watch. Worth a cold pack of six or two. Point your finger at the radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin to attack humanity. San Diego is a good place to start. Scientists and dispersed military must find a way to stop this red threat. These are cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
