As a former submariner, it was one of the worst underwater films I've ever seen. First of all, the rebellion aboard any US naval vessel, especially the submarine "Nuclear Trident Engine", which is impossible to imagine. These people are the best of the best and committed to their mission. The responsibility they bear is enormous, and they take it very seriously from captain to the youngest member of the crew. I have never seen the crew of any ship share their alliance between the captain and the executive director. The executive director, who acted as the character played by Denzel Washington, will be relieved of his duties, and the Court will fight and then drum up from the Navy. Unsurprisingly, the navy refused to send a technical consultant to help create this film. Finally, if any member of the submarineâ€™s crew makes a noise on this ship, he will be severely reprimanded. At the beginning of their career, divers learn to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not slam doors and even quietly talk and wear shoes with soft soles when they are on the road. I was amazed at how loudly they portrayed the team while driving. Loud music will never tolerate. I know that depicting life on a submarine would not really sell movie tickets, but that would be too ridiculous. I would not recommend this film to anyone.
