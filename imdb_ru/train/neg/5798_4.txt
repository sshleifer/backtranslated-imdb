This film is a rather strange mixture of music, romance, drama and crime with the scent of the film. In fact, this is one bunch of different genres, of which none really works as expected. <br /> <br /> This film is Mickey Rooney’s attempt to be a more serious actor. He is a former star child who has always played a major role in happy comic and musical productions at the beginning of his career. In this film, he chooses a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is actually quite funny in the film. I mean Mickey Rooney as a cool player? He is a very little boyish man. In fact, he was already over thirty, when he starred in this film, but he is seriously similar to the 16-year-old. Hearing him say “baby” to women, and hearing him talk harshly with gangsters, who are about 3 times as large as him, just don’t look and feel good. He is simply unconvincing in his role. <br /> <br /> Since there are so many different genres in the film, the story really looks dirty. Somewhere in it there is a criminal plot, and somewhere in it there is a romantic storyline, telling about how to realize your dream, but none of this really works out because of the dirty approach and handling of all this. It's just not an interesting or compelling movie to watch. Laszlo Cardos is also a director who has shot only 10 films in his entire life, despite the fact that his career lasted from 1935 to 1957. He must have been a struggling director who found it difficult to work in this industry, and instead once, while he was given a smaller script for work. All his films are unknown and, as a rule, also not of very high quality. <br /> <br /> Let's also not forget that this is a film of the 50s, but still it looks more like a film of the 40s, or perhaps even as one of the 30s. This, of course, is mainly due to the fact that this film was shot in black and white. Generally speaking, 50s black and white films often look pretty cheap, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> A rather strange sight when Mickey Rooney, Louis Armstrong and his band play themselves. together in sequence. It was not the only film in which Armstrong appeared, and he often appeared in such films, often just like himself. I believe that jazz lovers still enjoy watching this film because of its music, as there is quite a lot of it in this film. In fact, the film received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. <br /> <br /> Awkward little film featuring Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
