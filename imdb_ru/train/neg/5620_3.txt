In fact, there is no point in exploring this much further because of several very glaring and biased statements that are misleading. <br /> <br /> A wonderful example is when the director declares “Saul” or Pavel of Tarusa (the author of the book of Epistle to the Hebrews). He claims that he has no idea that Jesus is or was a man, this statement is either intentionally false, because he blames others for the presentation, or he does not know what the Bible says. <br /> <br /> First we can examine his misleading statement about Hebrews 8.4; where he shows the quote “If Jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest,” so right here He is telling an ignorant and uneducated viewer to accept his false premise .. why? He does what most so-called Bible-believers who he blames does the same thing. It takes things out of context. <br /> <br /> Verse 1 of Hebrews 8; 1 .. "Now from what we talked about, this is the sum: we have such a high priest who sits at the right hand of the Majesty's throne in heaven." The above context clearly speaks of Jesus. who was on earth and ascended to heaven after his supposed resurrection. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with how the director wants the viewer to take him out of the context of the Scriptures. Here he offers the rationale that “Paul did not know about MAN Jesus, but only one in“ heaven ”watches over <br /> <br />? <br /> <br /> let's see if the director is Hebrew 7 honest; 14. “Obviously, our Lord came from Judea; What tribe did Moses say nothing about the priesthood? “<br /> <br /> Heh, didn’t the director cite the words of a Jewish writer trying to show that the author of this book doesn’t know“ Jesus Man ”? Paul probably didn’t write in Hebrew anyway, but I will not go in detail here, but the director claims that Paul wrote, and this is the essence of what has been stated here. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. This director does not earn decent points in certain areas, he does, but he participates in the same blind to the bias of the religion to which he swears. As soon as he uses these tactics, in my strong opinion, he ter trust as a religion he chooses, and the film is no longer a documentary, but personal opinion, and the director’s bias, no more, no less.
