First of all; it is very difficult to try to describe history only from the standpoint of tools, microbes and steel. The Marxists tried to do the same with economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success cannot be just stupid luck, the advantages of domesticated plants and animals. We see that all over the world, any advantages and bonuses are completely useless if they are not managed wisely. Japan does not have huge natural resources, but Japan is one of the leading world economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, success is only at an average level. Both of these countries have had and still have access to Western technologies and inventions, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Diamond stated that it is very important to understand the factors of weapons, microbes and steel in order to UNDERSTAND. Perhaps the main factor in global differences is not geography, but the ability of people to understand and use things? Mental ability to understand. And in this case, geography is only subordinate.
