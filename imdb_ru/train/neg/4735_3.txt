There is no denying that Azumi’s first film was a commercial product; it was an adaptation of the popular manga, in which young, attractive actors participated, and, of course, there was no shortage in the budget department. However, it is more than entertaining, and I cannot deny that I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Azumi 2 lacks practically everything that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that should be alarming is the absence of the magnificent Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he seemed to take not only his visual talent and kinetics, but also the originality of style, beauty and, most importantly, his heart. While the former had a simple plot on “hit lists,” it has a mess in the corkscrew's history: too many sad characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is erased. Passed effective interaction between the leading characters; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a handful of stupid teenagers arguing in the forest. A characteristic does not exist; if someone looks really like who lives and who dies, I will be shocked. The same applies to the villains here. The final battle - virtually all battles - is completely devoid of any tension. The fact that they are poorly posed and badly directed — not to mention a few and far apart — is meaningless by their own meaninglessness. The villains themselves are trying their best to be polite, and even if you combine them all, they don’t get one mile from the original Pete Burns pranks on Joe Odagiri. <br /> <br /> ## ## Major Spoiler at the end of a paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Uito is trying her best, as it should be, and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films. Azumi is now a full-fledged killer, which means that she can slowly swing a sword; unfortunately, now the hero is inspired by the mystery of the “Man without a Name” style, the Uto model looks even more out of place. I know that this should be the main thing, but this combined with the inefficiency of everyone else in the film, the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptitude of the film as a whole means that this time it is absolutely impossible to fall behind her character, the less said about Chiaki "Remember me from Kill Bill's murder, the better the Kuriyama performance; suffice it to say that its “turn” from good to evil is as thin as napalm. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was just a huge disappointment. Any virtues were made ten times better in the first film. Lazy, unsatisfactory - and generally quite boring - a mess.
