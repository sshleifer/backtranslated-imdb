Short summary: This film humiliates everyone it touches. That means you. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that I am not a purist, and it could be funny for a few minutes. Imitations are not bad. But overall, itâ€™s just boring and painfully funny. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over. <br /> <br /> It is clear that these films exist only to squeeze the last few dollars out of the currently selling Laurel and Hardy brands. Producers can have no real relationship to their place in the history of cinema or to their talents. This is what has offended me the most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a loser as a parent;)
