I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes began to "capture" the plane. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that maybe he should get “one” for comic relief. But then I realized that I could just watch the three puppets for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Whatever respect I might have for Samuel Jackson, it was irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood once again demonstrates how far they are from reality. When I was a kid, we used to catch snakes for fun. The only thing that snakes can do is pile up at the bottom of the cargo bay. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the trip to the blockbuster. Keep in mind: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. <br /> <br /> If you want to really get scared, I suggest Descent. If you want humor, go to your local comedy club. Their worst performer will be a million times better than this garbage.
