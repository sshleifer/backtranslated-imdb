Waitress: Honey, these are the eggs that you ordered. Honey, how the bee, got it? This is called a meaningless omen. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Ah? (On the way) Basket: Here is your doll, little girl. You really shouldn't be so careless with your things. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Fail! Boom! Whistling! Crackle ?? Trash: I think something bad should happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What the?? ? (Tears open letter.) Wow! The handwriting of my ex-girlfriend has really improved. And look, her missing daughter looks like a girl with a doll, whom I happened to be responsible for the fact that I was killed. And she's kind of my hairline. I wonder if I should torture myself and find her? Let's see what my friends think at the polling station. <br /> <br /> Police Basketball, male: Hahaha. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Trash: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (On the island) Basket: What's in the bag? Ahhhh. <br /> <br /> Krone with the name of the tree: Although it is not her daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the tavern) Basket: Can you do this? Big-tailed girl with a name on the tree: A? Basket: (breaks the bee). Everything is good. <br /> <br /> Sensually cute, previously promising actress, playing a lustful maid in a tavern: this is good. Honey, however, is not a plant. <br /> <br /> (On green) Willow: Oh, yes, and I forgot, you are the father of my child, Conan, I mean Rowan. (Yawns.) I could stay and live with you. But I did not. Instead, I wanted to be a hive princess. I mean, it doesn't matter. (Nods, wakes up, widens eyes in proportion anime). Mva, kiss-kiss. I love you! What we were talking about? Trash: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Iva: Edward. Sniff. Blink. What for. Are. You. Shout. Q. Me? Is it because I raised your vicodin? Sniff. Snore. What we were talking about? Trash: I think something bad should happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: My lips hurt. <br /> <br /> (In class) Rose: What is a man? Unattractive twins in unison: phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Basket: Get away from the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm a good twin. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad should happen. <br /> (Hives) Basket: Hmmm. Hello? Oh, oh, oh, oh worry. Stupid old bear. Snore. <br /> <br /> (In the queen bee mansion) Sister Summersail: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Aren't you the stallion that Cher struck in the face on Moonlit night? (Licking lips.) Basket: I was going to ask you the same thing. Where is the girl? Sister Summersil: How are you doing? Let's talk about the meaning of my extra "with." Basket: Beware of this truck attacking us! Aaaaah! Oh. Nevermind. Damn it! (Drinks another pill.) Mmmm. Torazin. <br /> <br /> (back to the tavern). An arrogant, arrogant tavern-girl: I have tried Heavy Watchers, Jenny Craig, Southern Buk, and since last year I have still increased the size of a bear costume. <br /> <br /> Tree crown: HAHAHA. So much the better to fry this curious cop, my dear. <br /> <br /> Big breasted girl: completely. <br /> <br /> Basket: It was the last drop that broke the basket's back! Take it, wench! (Removes her.) (Edward Basket mysteriously attacks from behind) Voluptuous tavern-tavern: EEEE! Get out of this! Leave the island and take me with you! Should I decide you or how? Give it up, I say! EEEE! Basket: Take it, wench! (Bravely kicks her in the face. Her eyes roll and she turns into a cartoon X.) Voluptuous girl: Snore ?? (On Nicolas Cage frying) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where Bug's cell phone rings in the middle of his scene with a bear suit, and then the call is interrupted. It's like a wireless ad: Help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha <br /> <br /> Kate Beehan: Do you remember when I made the bullets that I knocked out of the Basketball pistol? He looked so surprised. You have to be careful with your stuff, Nick. Hahaha And your choice of movies. <br /> <br /> All: The drone must die! Trash: (screaming) Oh, yes, bitch? Well, frying me will not help your damn dear! Ahhh. My legs! Honey, (honey, you know?), Put down the torch and get away from the basket. Honey! Smokey-bear says that do not play with matches. Hahaha What the??? Watch out for this hitter truck! Ahhh! Oh. Gosh, those memories of my experimenting with drugs in the seventies age! Where is my heroin? Uch. Uch. My watch is not fireproof. Uch. I think something bad must happen. Can you hear me now? I am ready for my end. Damn it! (Six months later) A voluptuous girl in a modern depraved attire: I told about this eponymous bag with a basket to take me with me. <br /> <br /> Innocent young drone: I like helping people. <br /> <br /> Voluptuous girl: Then get me out of my contract to continue! I think something bad must happen. EEEEE!
