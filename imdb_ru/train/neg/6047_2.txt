What made the French Connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Rousseau (Scheider). In this catastrophe, filmed by director Frankenheimer (who also brought us such precious stones as Deer Games and Dr. Moreau's Island), the film is dedicated to Doyle and his extraordinary obsession with the capture of Charnier (Rey). The fictional idea that New York police will allow Doyle to go to Marseille to find Charnier with the help of French local authorities sounds ridiculous. Correct me if I am mistaken, but Charnier did not miss the city with 65 pounds of pure taste !!! The street cost is 32 million, but yes, let's send Doyle to find this guy, after all, that was his pinch. You are welcome!!! The story was weak. The action was terrible (with the only exception of Hackman, who completely outplayed his role). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between the scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor, watch the down payment twice and skip this one.
