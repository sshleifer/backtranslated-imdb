I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I didn't waste money buying this one. On the cover of the video there is a scene from the 1975 film Capricorn One. The film begins with a few clips about rocket explosions, most of which are not related to manned flight. The Sibrel Smoking Gun is a short video clip of astronauts preparing a video program. He edits his voice over, instead of allowing us to listen to what the team should have said. It is curious that the video ends with the showing of the film “Zapruder”. His statements about radiation, protection, photography of stars and others make me believe that he is extremely ignorant or he has some type of ax to feud with NASA, astronauts or Americans in general. His science is bad, like this video.
