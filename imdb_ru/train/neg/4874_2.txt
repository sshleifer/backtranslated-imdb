It is a pity that neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy could say something worthwhile. this film is just soft. <br /> <br /> Children's film? Well, if you try to make them take a nap, then maybe. It's just 90 minutes of some horribly scant animation of an animal's lips to make funny jokes. And lip-synching makes Godzilla's old films look brilliantly made in comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy continues with depressed low-key delivery, which is painful for the experience. Apparently, he is trying to change his old manic personality, but why? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original 1967 version is lost in this rethinking, or whatever. The city wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad things. No, really. And Pluto Nash can chat with them. Things cling along with some stale jokes to a boring dull conclusion without surprises. <br /> <br /> Take the film '67. Or some old bear yoga cartoons.
