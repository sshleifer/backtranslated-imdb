The guys who ever even THINK about watching this film have already experienced unrest in their heads. This movie is NOTHING to Jack the Ripper (if you thought), this is another movie, I mean the E-Grade movie, which consists of a lot of excited teenagers in certain sex scenes, watched just before their spleens were splattered on neighboring tree It's not scary, funny or funny. If you really feel terrible without a plot, then watch "The Fever of the Cabin", at least the director did not fall asleep halfway, directing this shit. See only this, if you have absolutely nothing to do in life, and the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey crying on TV.
