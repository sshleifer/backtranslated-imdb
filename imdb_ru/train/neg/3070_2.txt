Oh, dear lord ... They turned what was a rather provocative film into an unfolding testosterone festival. <br /> <br /> The original version of this 1971 film was very vague about our hero, Kowalski. He was the man who tried to go from Denver to San Francisco to win the bet. Why was he willing to risk his life at the cost of a handful of top? We are not quite sure. <br /> <br /> We had a few memories that gave us the impression that he was an adrenaline addict, and probably all his life he had been trying to get to the vanishing point. You see off this point at a distance where the left and right shoulders of the road converge, and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free, and therefore does not harm anyone. We saw several times when accidents happened, when he stopped to make sure that the other driver was OK, even the policemen who were following him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his quest, he committed suicide. and not to be arrested and live in captivity. He died as he lived, running wide open. <br /> <br /> In the remake, Kovalsky has a whole story (including even the name). He is trying to get to the hospital where his wife suffers from complications. her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband and anxious future father. He comes to a decision to commit suicide, having heard that his wife died on delivery, but they even leave it in question when they assume that he might have jumped out of the car before she ran into bulldozers. They even gave up the role of a “super-soul”, a blind DJ (brilliantly depicted by Cleveon Little in the original) JASON FAMILY?!?!?!?! Give me a break.
