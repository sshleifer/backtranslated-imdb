I have to be completely honest, saying at first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, so I cannot give a complete opinion about the film until I see it completely. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid James and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), plan to make a fortune by stealing a batch of birth control pills from the Finisham maternity hospital. Matronâ€™s main character (Hattie Jacques) and Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hotry), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor) work here. Patients and their visitors are also nearby, including pregnant Mrs. Tidy (Joan Sims) and her nervous future husband, Mr. Tidy (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Maynard as Freddie and Wendy Richard from EastEnders as Miss Willing. This plan, by the way, does not work, by the way, because all employees are in the way. This is almost all that can be said about the film, until I see it again in full. Good!
