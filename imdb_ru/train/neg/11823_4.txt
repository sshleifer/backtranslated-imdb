SCHOOL DAYS TOM BROWN'S <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Young Tom at the end of the 19th century in England Brown (Alex Pettifer) goes to public school in Rugby, where he is experiencing reforms of a new radical director (Stephen Fry) and confronts the school bully, Flashman (Joseph Beatty). <br /> <br /> Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations is, first and foremost, the excellent version of Gordon Perry of 1951 - Thomas Hughes’s evergreen novel, a treatise from the beginning of the 21st century, courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Faroa (Where's the Heart TV series) and director By David Moore (SAGA FORSIT). He is quite pleasant and watchable, but at the same time quite balanced and boring, differing only in Fry's sincere performance, when the new director decided to destroy some of the school’s most dubious "traditions", as well as the appearance of a new star in 14-year-old Pettifer, a talented child with an easy charm and bright appearance, which should lead him to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is a typical British television feed, which is preferred by managers seeking to fill their schedules with a “prestigious” product, even as unremarkable as this one. The British edition of Radio Times called it "exquisitely strange" and raised an eyebrow in surprise: "All this pidorstvo and cruelty, but a beautiful, wicked villain, tormenting the lives of cute young guys."
