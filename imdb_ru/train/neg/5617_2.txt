This documentary is based on an incomplete examination of evidence in which Brian Flemming, perhaps intentionally, does not mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the earliest: his statements about the invalidity of Paul’s testimony of Jesus Christ ignore key facts such as: ** The existence of certain formulated beliefs in Paul’s epistles. These creeds suggest that most of the central statements about Jesus have already been formulated in statements of faith, possibly within a few years of the death and resurrection of Christ. ** The testimonies of early Christians cannot be simply dismissed. At that time there were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah, but only ONE remained: Jesus. What for? Because it would be ridiculous if someone really believed that Christ was the Messiah, and would have died for these beliefs, if he knew that he had not been raised. ** Even if the Gospels are more freely dated, we are still talking about stories about Jesus written in the times of other eyewitnesses who would point out inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> I say that the Flemming documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving work that puts forward various arguments and evidence that serve its anti-Christian view. Do not be fooled by a bad investigation.
