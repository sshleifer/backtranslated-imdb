This film is so bad that it simply defies reality. Shooting at best is material for elementary school, acting is pathetic, and the director should forever be prevented from making films in any form. So bad that even a comedy show, similar to the show dancers, can not even watch. The ONLY thing this DVD had for this was the cover. <br /> <br /> All that I can write to those of you who have not had the opportunity to witness this - please do yourself a well-deserved service in advance and do not waste your time or money on this work of garbage. If you want to watch a movie on comedic aspects, there are many others more worthy in this area than this trash.
