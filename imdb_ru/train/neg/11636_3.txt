I'm not going to waste my time writing an essay and wasting your time. However, I would like to say that all those who are concerned about this film are even funny. Jonnimakbest, you cannot play this card, and I mean the patriotic card of nationalism so that people do not watch this movie. This is a film that expresses its free will in this country (oh, yes, I played this card), although the director is German and deserves a pat on the wrist every time he reaches out to the camera, but the world is full of contradictions, and this is the same what have you heard before, for example, the GTA dispute. It's a comedy, laugh and be disgusted, not be disgusted all together, her dark humor, and obviously you don't have the heart to accept it, the past is past, yes, people remember those who were lost, but it was time to move on, It was !!! 7 !!! many years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Besides, I'm mad, and who needs a soul?
