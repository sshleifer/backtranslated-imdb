In any case, it should be the name. <br /> <br /> This film combines weapons, explosives and senseless killings to make one action movie failure. Let me express my opinion in a series of questions: answers like a deal. <br /> <br /> What happens in the film? People are dying. <br /> <br /> Is that so? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the plot about? What is the plot? <br /> <br /> What's the point in the film? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What do the characters look like? Extremely flawed and contradictory in relation to their personalities. <br /> <br /> What's good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some good Panavision cameras for filming. <br /> <br /> If you like constant murder and greed, watch the movie. If you happen to fight back from such low-quality "entertainment", then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To summarize, the storyline stinks, the characters are not worth their time, the storyline resists completely and nothing fits together. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: the actors, directors and those who helped make this film are definitely not “made”.
