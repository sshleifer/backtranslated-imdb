Imagine the worst parodies of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90-minute film. Now imagine that all the humor in these bad parodies is removed and replaced by folly. Now imagine that 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Got it? <br /> <br /> Ok, now go see the movie Underground Comedy. This vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing about UCM - the only worst movie I've ever seen. There were some cheap laughs ... very little. But it was unconvincing. Even if the goal of the film is to be unconvincing, it was too unconvincing to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don’t feel angry that I wasn’t wasting my time watching this film was from someone I know bought. He wasted his money. Vince Offer did not write or send anything else, and it is not surprising why.
