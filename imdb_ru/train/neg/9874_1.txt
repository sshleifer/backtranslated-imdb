A fabulous book about a fox and his family that does what foxes do. it is stealing from farms and killing loot. until a trio of farmers decides that they are fed up with this fox, and will try to solve the problem in various ways. They, of course, “get out of control” at every step, and while the trio is in camp at the fox hole, the family raids three farmers on the land. <br /> <br /> “Film” version The term film is very loose, it’s rather the terrible plastic of American robberies, especially films about the Oceans. They even have George Clooney in the role of Mr. Fox to add insult and completely miss the point of the story. Glory to them. They will make a lot of money and destroy another of Roald Dahl’s classic children's books.
