This bad remake of the classics of 1963 starts quite well, and then replaces the unknown with confusing and meaningless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most frightening moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying next to each other in double beds, listening in horror to the noise outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she hurts her. Then Nell looks at Theo, who is a few feet away, and realizes that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell is alone in bed, when suddenly she dives and slides along the floor. Only when she tells an invisible force to stop pulling her, do we understand what happened. And someone can explain what Nell’s last words mean: “It's about family. Is it always about family? ” <br /> <br /> The only feature that justifies itself is the performance of Lily Taylor, but even this cannot save the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones once again demonstrates that under her beautiful appearance there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly proposed her lesbian conviction. Zeta-Jones, however, must explain this, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend or girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Definitely the one that should be sent to the cemetery of meaningless remakes.
