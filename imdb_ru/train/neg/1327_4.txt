This terrible film combines all the Asian stereotypes that you can imagine in one disgusting package. Tricky money, treacherous Japanese businessmen send a stupid but sweet police officer Pat Morita to reveal the secrets of industry in Detroit. Here he runs into the heel of Jay Leno, who quickly calls the murder victim a Japanese and calls Morita Tojo. It's all down from there.
