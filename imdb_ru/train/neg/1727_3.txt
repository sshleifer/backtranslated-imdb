We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crash. We have a deadly dinosaur stopping movement with flippers. Well, let's call this movie “MONSTER LAKE CRATER”. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots named Arnie and Mitch to determine the final definition of "comic relief". We must also have a sheriff who actually does nothing in this film and whom no one listens to. Gosh, we went through half the movie and forgot to insert the bad guy! Don't worry, let's imagine some guy with a mustache, let him rob a store to show that he is a bad guy, then make him float somewhere on the lake, drive him through the forest and all this for the sole purpose - he will be in end up as a dinosaur snack. That should work. <br /> <br /> Complete, clumsy mess, this film. His logic will distort your mind to make you laugh. The first film featuring Dave Allen in the role of "supervisor." After that, he teamed up with Charles for several years until the mid-nineties, when Bend ran out of money to pay him, I think. The effects of dinosaurs are enchanting, and the whole movie is pretty darn funny and unintended. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> Good evil? Yes. Reasonable logic in the narrative should be sufficient reason to include it in the list. If not, Arnie and Mitch will achieve the goal. 3/10 and 8/10
