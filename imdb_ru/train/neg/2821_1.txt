I saw this film only once, and that was enough for me. There are very few plot stories in the film, and it seems that this is nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little else. I wanted to watch this movie because Zoe Trilling from the second “Night of the Demons” starred in it; and I wanted to see her play someone normal. Unfortunately, the Toba Hooper script is just beginning and not going anywhere, since Robert Englund dominates the film and chews on the scenery and the plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
