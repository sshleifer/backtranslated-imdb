If you enjoyed watching Mel Gibson at the Million Dollar Hotel, then you might like to watch Burt Reynolds in another movie, so bad that it would be impossible to distribute it. I can only testify on the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is better in quality, but the night movies and dark scenes are made so badly that everything seems red. At first, I thought my DVD players had gone bad. None If you insist on watching it, I recommend that you adjust the color on your TV until it turns black and white. If you do not, you can never go through the film. If you do this, it will just remind you that the bad students of the film are trying to revive the style of “Pulp Fiction”.
