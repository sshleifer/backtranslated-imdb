It really was so bad. Along with (fortunately!) The short-lived television series “The Dirty Dozen,” in which Ben Murphy starred and which was filmed at about the same time (also cheaply in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was embarrassed for the actors of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was wahhhhhh, too old and fat for this role (he was 70 when he made this garbage), and a reviewer who draws parallels with Telli Grek in this and John Wayne in Green Berets pretty much sums it up. > <br /> Other reviewers pointed to the many ridiculous cries contained in this crime against celluloid, so I will not repeat them here. But I will add that I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned the ridiculous looking tiny helmet that Savalas wears on his big swollen head. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised that this movie wreck has a rating of 4.7 here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, this is “1” right across the board. If you need a good example of why flogging a franchise to death is a really bad idea (especially over 20 years after the original) - look no further than “The Dirty Dozen is a Fatal Mission.” <br /> <br /> Awful - avoid !!!!
