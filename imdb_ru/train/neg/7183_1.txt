This is the worst adaptation of the classic story I've ever seen. They need not be modernized, and some things are really just sick. <br /> <br /> Songs rarely move around the plot. It seems they are added at random. The flying scene with Marley is meaningless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is not only one of the worst films I've ever seen, but also the worst musical I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is probably considered a classic because “Christmas Carol” is such a classic story. The fact that the original story was a classic does not mean that there is some cheap adaptation.
