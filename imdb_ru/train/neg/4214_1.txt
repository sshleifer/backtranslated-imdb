Having spent only a couple of hours watching this and for 80% of this time in complete bewilderment, I can give this garbage the “Turkey of the Year” award, no problem. To say that the plot was unbelievable is to downplay a little. Honestly, I'm lost for words to describe this complete deception. Not only did the characters completely and completely without any semblance of originality (this kind of thing was done much better in dozens of "serial killers"), but the action was terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope that you will return your money, for those who have been paid to do this, I hope that you will return your money. Believe me, there are many new releases that are much, much better. Go see.
