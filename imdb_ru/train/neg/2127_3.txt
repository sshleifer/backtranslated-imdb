What for? Because, for one reason, the film has never had a more adorable scene than Ann Margret singing "Bye Bye Birdie" at the opening. She repeats it again in the final (in a different mood!). Both are wonderful. Rent it and see. Even if that's all you see. You will agree, I am sure. <br /> <br /> Everything in the original was so excellent that it just didnâ€™t need alteration, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave meritorious performances, as well as Tyne and Chinna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version give "everything", but it's like trying to improve "Casablanca" - it is simply impossible! It is even annoying when you mentally compare these two things when you try to evaluate a remake, and it just fails, not the fault of the actors.
