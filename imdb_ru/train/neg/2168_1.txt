After reading the next review, I thought that this film would really be good. I really enjoy the "B" movies, but this cannot be classified as such. Photography is perhaps the only thing worthy of the movie. But editing left much to be desired. It was very changeable and staccato. The one who chose the music and the sound did a terrible job. The music was terrible, especially in the atmosphere or setting. If the game were better, they could make a movie. Unfortunately, I have seen better acting in porn movies. If you want to watch a movie about vampires "B", see "Blood Connections." You will be much more entertained.
