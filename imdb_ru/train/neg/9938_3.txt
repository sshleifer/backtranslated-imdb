The Marxist controversy of Jean Luc Godard is so close to watching a film that you probably will see from a world famous director. Bits of political theater, stunning and endless, alternate with the creation of "Sympathy for the Devil" with the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> The process of developing a song from Mick Jagger, playing a demo on an acoustic guitar, to the backing vocals recorded by the end is amazing, and this film should be rented to see the bits with the stones. Nearly half of the film is dedicated to this, so, thanks to the miracle of the stops of the chapters, you can skip all the strange political parodies and just watch how the Stones compose a song. <br /> <br /> When I did it on the laser disk I bravely tried to watch it all, but I do not understand how someone could go through it. I finally gave up and just missed the head of my path to the stone segments.
