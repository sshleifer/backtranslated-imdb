I caught it in a test view. All I can say is that ... what the hell? This film plays out about as smoothly as Mickey Mouse, who reads the Scarface script. This is strange, except for the slightest sense; and even if you leave your brain in the car, the film will still be so strange that it’s not even funny. <br /> <br /> The story tells how a crocodile hunter Steve Irwin is trying to “save” the crocodile, which contains a CIA probe. The CIA comes for Irvin to get their probe back, Irwin takes them for poachers and intends to “stop” them. <br /> <br /> This is almost the whole story; the rest is the excessive insight of the Australian culture (“Didja see dat?” and “Crikey!”) and strangely set sequences of actions. At some point, Irwin mounts an accelerating RV and fights knives with a CIA agent on top of it. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin's knife fights with the guy on top of the van. Let this be your guide for this ridiculously bad movie.
