Ben and Arthur CAN be 10 years old. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, watched and produced this film. Sam had to convey his idea to a good writer, director and leave the acting game to someone who could play. This is a good example of how one person controls all production. there was no one to tell him: "Sam, this is bad, very bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabel's play was the only good idea, but he could have been much better with a good director and better actors for work. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). acting and directing were so bad that this film was turned into a comedy. You just had to laugh and not in those places. <br /> <br /> A second good point .... that would be a great date. after the first two minutes, you will stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
