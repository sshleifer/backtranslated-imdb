First technical review. The script is so slow, it's really a 25-minute story, blown up to 1 hour 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. “Acting” is pathetic, they seem to have really brought schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from the idiots' board. As for the whole “point” of history, namely “the war is bad” (oh, this is a shock!), That really does not exist. Without the scene, "Let's shock them and get a good advertisement," no one will talk about this movie. This is so bad that it really bothers me to think about which things it is better to spend this money on. Believe me, I saw several bad films about the “new clothes of the emperor”, but I can only say one thing: they were well shot and well shot, and the camera swayed during two scenes in this! Read all other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
