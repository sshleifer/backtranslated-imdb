If you're the kind of person who can enjoy a really bad movie, then I highly recommend this one. If not, stay away. It's an amazing cheap movie, and sometimes you might wonder if it’s not just a joke that someone pulls you to. The most positive comment I can make about this is that the responsible people seem to understand that this was a super-low-budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of fun. <br /> <br /> Amateur as he gets. Their idea of ​​giant killer mushrooms is just guys covered in beige sheets with a bit of trash can lids on their heads. This obviously should not be taken seriously (to say the least), but even with this disclaimer you will find that you are shaking your head at the amazing levity of all of this. Or often laugh, like me.
