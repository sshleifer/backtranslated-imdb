Weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Fly and Mario Batali bring it down. <br /> <br /> Fly is the worst. Definitely one-trick ponies, I think they could make other American chefs come to the table as Iron chefs. The types of dishes that this duet comes up with really ... do not reflect the creative potential of the original Iron Chef series. I do not even think that Batali even went to the school of chefs. There are many great chefs in America, I just wonder why they do not appear in the Food Network. <br /> <br /> It would also help to have more regional ingredients and, possibly, co-owners who can cope with the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he is too frivolous for this role.
