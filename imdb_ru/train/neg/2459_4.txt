Obviously, I didn’t care about “Upcoming Events” (“Form of the Future”) as well as most viewers. This means that there is a high probability that you will like it more than me. In any case, it may be useful for you to hear the film described from a different point of view. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who has as much experience as a production director and even more as an art director. This is a screen adaptation of G. G. Wells from his own novel of the same name. In my opinion, it helps to demonstrate why a great writer does not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The film opens in 1940 in London's Everytown. War is brewing, and the inhabitants of each city are concerned that it can reach them. It does. And it turns into a perennial business, which basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies continue to leap ahead in time to show us the various scenes associated with the war and its aftermath. We see two pilots, one shot down, resigned to the consequences of their hostilities. We meet with the post-apocalyptic community, ruled by a potential commander. We meet a person from a growing futuristic society. We see technology changing. Finally, we approached the full realization of this futuristic society around 2036, where leaders discuss the merits of sending a man to the moon. <br /> <br /> This may sound potentially very exciting, but it just doesn't work like a movie. Constructively, the film is too episodic, and there is little that can dramatically connect. By the third segment, I completely lost interest in trying to track characters. I could barely make them out in the first pair of segments. There is a constant parade of new faces. We will not learn anything about any of them. <br /> <br /> It does not help that individual segments, with the exception of a pair, tend to be clumsily directed and edited. They also sometimes manipulate - it can almost begin to resemble a propaganda film. But perhaps contradictory, the segments are also a bit cold and emotionally dry. <br /> <br /> In fact, one long section looks more like a music video / promotional video. If you show footage of the construction of a futuristic city, with a large number of large technology, a large number of welding works and so on. At some point, the guy, like an astronaut, waving at the camera through some futuristic glass. The music for this section lies somewhere between the militaristic and bloated horror account. I cannot say that the “upcoming things” consist of fascinating material from the point of view of drama. <br /> <br /> But the general appeal in support of “Upcoming Things” is that this is a “film about ideas”. This may be true, but there are several problems with this, if you look at it this way. Firstly, it still does not make it work _ like a film_, that is, as a visual and auditory dramatic work, and secondly, there are too many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is that of war and what it does with civilizations. This is a good thing to make a movie. This also remarkably predicts the Second World War, since the “Things to come” script was written and filmed in 1935 (released in 1936). Wells has something interesting to say about the war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the ending seems to suggest that a new war will break out at any time. The overall message seems a bit pessimistic. Wells seems to show that war is just a part of human nature that cannot be removed, although this does not exclude "progress" - in fact, perhaps it contributes to progress, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> This will certainly be enough for one movie. However, there are still many ideas. The scene between the two pilots is one of the hottest scenes of the film. It deals with a complex dilemma. One pilot shot down another, but now comes to his aid. But the pilot, who was shot down, carried poisonous gas, which now flutters around the field. They cannot breathe gas without harm. A girl comes. They have only two gas masks. The pilot, who was shot down, offers his mask, because he says that he is still dying. What to do? The point is not that this scene itself could have been stretched to full-length, but ideas — a bizarre complex of help and attempts to hurt each other in the midst of war — are enough to create a film. <Br /> <br /> Another example. During scenes with the participation of a potential military leader, in a post-apocalyptic environment, there is a disgusting contagious disease around, called a “roaming disease.” It turns victims into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot the victims on the spot to prevent the disease. This material is treated as if it were an afterthought. This is a great idea and it deserves a film of its own. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wells presents the future society as contradictory socialist ideas. That was enough for your own movie. It is simply impossible to effectively cope with so many things in 100 minutes, especially when it should be the essence of the film instead of dramatic attraction. <br /> <br /> However, there are reasons to give “Things to come to” at least one viewing. If you are a science fiction fan, this is a historically important film. Given the origin of Menzies, the production and scenery is interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely outdated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was either anticipating or retrospectively humorous in his “predictions.” I especially liked the means of transportation to the moon, which was very reminiscent of George Meliez’s 1902 trip to the moon (aka Le Voyage dans la lune). Just do not expect too much from the upcoming events.
