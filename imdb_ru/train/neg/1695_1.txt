Well, when I watched the preview for this film, I thought it looked very scary, and was very excited to see it, like the band I was with. Now, living in America, especially during these elections, I see some very deceptive things, but I must say that these previews were at the top of the list. I donâ€™t understand how many people can get scared by this movie. I just noticed two real jumping scenes and jumped only one. The whole movie was extremely predictable, and perhaps he ruined some of the scenes for me. As for the sound effects that so many were afraid of, I thought they were funny at best. Oh and uh, the cat, where did it come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie was supposed to be a strange moan. How does it scare someone? I can make this noise easy. Do not misunderstand me. I always loved all those really bad, scary movies that you just laughed at, but I didn't even think that it had something that was just bad.
