In the Babylonian part of the mini-series, the narrator describes the tower builders as "descendants of Moses." <br /> <br /> It’s like saying that George Washington lived many centuries before Alexander the Great. <br /> Or that a light bulb was invented in front of the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the bow and arrow. <br /> <br /> Need I say more? <br /> <br /> The authors of the “Greatest Heroes of the Bible” should have at least paid more attention to the chronology of biblical people and events.
