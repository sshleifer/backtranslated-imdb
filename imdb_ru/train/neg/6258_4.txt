Writer-director Tony Picchirillo adapted his own play about a rectilinear man, recently widowed, who learned that in the past three weeks he has been infected with HIV; he hunts down the only homosexual partner he has ever had, leads him to the apartment and links him up, forcing the guy's blood test and promising bloody revenge if the results are positive. An intriguing idea sounds better on paper than played out. The captive of James Marsden is realistically cynical and snotty, but the actorâ€™s own artificial manners are confusing - it's like watching the Tom Cruise version on a road show. Scott Speedman has to work harder, fulfilling a more complex role, but his personality turn from the shy guy to the kidnapper is not convincing on the verge, and the conversations of these two men are also not convincing. Of course, the gay party-goer Marsden is not apathetic - for a moment he sympathizes with the plight of Speedman - but he does not react and does not behave like any homosexual in these circumstances. Similarly, the film is not an excuse, but it is a fraud, which is hampered by poor editing, poorly thought-out footage from the past, low-budget production and a big final, which renders a stupid claim and soapy melodrama. * 1/2 of ****
