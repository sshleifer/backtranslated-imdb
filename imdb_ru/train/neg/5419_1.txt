Why filmmakers always go against the work of the author? I mean, yes, things should be compressed for the interest of the viewer, but look at Ann from the Green Gables. They did a wonderful job of combining important events into one, which was simply amazing. I can't believe they decided to combine the three novels for Anna from Avonlea into such a terrible mess. Look at all that they missed by doing this. Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, windy poplars. , and Anna's college years, for the sake of all saint !!! Wouldn't it be nice to meet Priscilla and the rest of Redmond's gang? Kevin Sullivan had to shoot things one movie at a time, instead of mixing them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. This movie was good if you left it without novels !! But the excellent work of L. M. Montgomery cannot be denied. This film was disappointed to see the successful realization of Ann of Green Gables in life.
