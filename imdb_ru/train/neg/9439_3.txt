Twisting the endings can be really cool in a movie. This is especially interesting when the turn is right before our eyes, but we just do not pay attention. This type of twisting ends up making people think. Then we have turns like this movie. The twists and turns that no matter whether you are paying attention or not, you have no idea what will happen. When they show this random turn instead of shock, this is a somewhat overwhelmed reaction. This film begins as if it would be an interesting horror film, but after about 20 minutes it is nothing but a boring dialogue and a silly turn. <br /> <br /> Three young women are going to a concert, so they get lost while traveling through the woods and hit a tree trunk. They end up in the house of some old creepy lady who hates men, and their home daughter Marion (Laurel Munson) greets them. Strange things happen because these girls stay in this house for several days instead of trying to leave or return home, and uncertainty turns into a dull slasher. <br /> <br /> This film is too keen on its dialogue, and it is always between several characters. We have three main girls, a creepy girl and an old lady, and a conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. Worse, they can never say anything interesting. It is actually pretty crazy to sit through their conversations. We want to know what is going on, and instead they just talk, talk, and talk (nothing). <br /> <br /> There are many holes in the plots. The house in which these girls live when they get into a car accident, apparently three miles away ... wow, three miles! A walk of two hours or less will kill them. Why didn't they give the worker a lift with this house that was driving to the city? Did he have one local? Why do these girls never doubt care and just willingly stay, rarely even testing each other? Why did it have to have so many stupid turns? Maybe the answers are in a boring scenario. <br /> <br /> A five-character slasher movie is a bad idea. This is not exciting, not scary, and there is definitely an end, but, of course, stupid. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 79 minutes R for nudity and violence.
