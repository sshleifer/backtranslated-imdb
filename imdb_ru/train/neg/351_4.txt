1st viewed 02/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Deer-Arne Glimcher): Mystery / Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the very talented cast, this film is too predictable and simply underestimates its audience. Movie lovers are not stupid, and I hope that they will not fill certain pockets of stars over and over again, no matter what they are connected to. We think this film will be about something with Connery condemnation against the punishment of the capitol in the beginning, but it turns out to be nothing more than a standard thought up for the audience, running the mill, let's never end it stupid change of characters, as they are portrayed to us when it is necessary in the story, and we are ready for this thing to end before it ends. Yes, there is a good game here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburn and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role, but the story doesnâ€™t work almost from the very beginning to the very long-awaited end.
