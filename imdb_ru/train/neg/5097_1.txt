Contrary to most other commentators, I really hate this series. <br /> <br /> She starts to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I did not lose hope until the very last episode. In the end, I still did not understand what was going on about alien attacks (maybe I missed something, who knows?), And I realized that I had gone through 26 episodes consisting mainly of characters' own hatred, selfishness and self-pity. In fact, he switches between aliens / robots and these dark, dull, flashing scenes where one or more characters can simply say or shout “I hate myself / you / this” 10-12 times in a row. <Br /> <br /> I don’t see either Shinji or Asuka (the two main characters) showing growth or change. (In this regard, I cannot see other characters learning or growing too.) I wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life in the first episodes, and the feeling did not change during the latter. Shinji really has helpless helplessness that makes people angry, not merciful, and Asuka is so impassive that I wanted to break the TV screen every time she appears. Yes, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything and often say it very often. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I'm a big fan of anime and manga, and never before have I loved it so much. I read that the creator / author of the series wrote this while suffering from depression, and I can believe it; it made me upset to watch this. Is this the purpose of this series? I honestly ask. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? And if suffering from depression, why not just write a book or biography about it, instead of mixing it with aliens and furs? This story is about an alien war, as far as I can tell, will lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> Finally, since I am truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this confusion of dead-end plots, I can't help but wonder how many of them actually find it good, and how many say what they do, because they were told that this is so.
