As usual, I make a mad dash to watch films that I have not watched while waiting for Oscar. I was really looking forward to seeing this film, as it seemed to me by right. I can't for life understand why this film got the noise that it has. There is no story! A group of guys wandering around Iraq. One day they spread a bomb. Tomorrow, they themselves understand the countryside and begin to shoot a sniper. Do not wait here, they are back in Baghdad. There is no single story at all. The three main characters are so strongly characterized that they are simply caricatures. I mean, we have a cute baby who is afraid of dying. We have a seasoned military man who is practical and just wants to return safe and sound. And then we have a brave cowboy who doesn’t follow the rules but has a weakness for a premature little Iraqi boy trying to sell DVDs to soldiers. What do you think will happen ??? Well, do you think a cowboy soldier who doesn’t follow the rules will get hurt by a sweet child by his renegade manners ?? Why yes! Do you think that an Iraqi child who is weak when a cowboy soldier can be killed and make him go insane? Why yes! There is no history here. The script is young and predictable! The camera is shaking so that it looks "pretentious." And for all of you who think this is such a great military picture, rent a Full Metal Jacket, Deerhunter, or Platoon. Do not waste time and money on this boring movie!
