Oh man, this movie is bad. It flows terribly. The story of a rider who is in love with himself, and then has to promote a network of fast foods from chicken, and at the same time does not love himself. He is trying to withdraw from the contract, and he is followed by terrible, painfully unfunny jokes. Jim Nabors seems like he is sleepwalking, not acting. You will miss Bert's supporters such as House Deluxe and Jerry Reed when you watch this stinky. Loni Anderson's hair is completely frightening, proving that tons of hairspray didn't go out in the sixties. Or maybe it was a wig. By the way, Bert's wig in this film was not bad. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and Thug 2." Anyway, this movie is the worst car movie of Reynolds, ever, ever, right there with Cannonball 2. The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", which, fortunately, did not have a continuation), are excellent, funny movies. This is not true. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. You will crave a villain like Jackie Gleason, whom you hate fun. And keep in mind, this is not one of those fun movies you can rely on. It's lousy, clean and simple. Even the results at the end were tedious and boring, and, worst of all, unfunny. And at least I forget that Stroker Ace was one of the first heavy nails that sealed Bertâ€™s coffin before it was revived several years later in Boogie Nights, another film that, like Liberation, was years earlier shows that a person can act fairly well when he has a decent platform for this.
