This is your typical film "Priyadarshan" - a bunch of psychos performing stupid missions. His signature culmination - the entire cast of the film gets together and fights with each other in some insane moshpite for hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket at Malamaal Weekly, black money at Hera Pheri, “kodokoo” at Phir Hera Pheri, etc. And so on, the Director becomes ridiculously predictable. Do not get me wrong; No matter how trite and ridiculous his films are, I usually enjoy comedy. However, in most of his previous films there was indeed good humor (Honmam and Hera Feri deserve attention). Now the fun of his films is fading, as he uses the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushri Datta looks amazing. Rajpal Yadav is annoying, and Tussar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is fine, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
