Slaughter Highly a story about revenge by a nerd who was the victim of one of the coolest and most joking jokes in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, after a promising opening, the film went straight to hell. Very tiresome and unnecessary mess with mediocre blows and the last half hour, which sucked to a completely new level of slop. The guy who played the nerd actually committed suicide shortly after the movie was released. If you want to make a film, stop it after a prank and remember, choose life.
