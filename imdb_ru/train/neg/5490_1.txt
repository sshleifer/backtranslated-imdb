When I was a child, we were always nannies, and we always made a film or watched a movie in a movie theater. This is one of the films we watched. This is one of the silliest films I've ever seen, I think it might even be a Walt Disney Movie Pictures! The Martian falls to the ground, turns into a man, befriends a man and tries to do everything possible to return home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors, Christopher Lloyd's “Back to the Future” as the Martian, Jeff Martin, Dumble and Dumber Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hann in the roles of lizzy. But besides this is complete nonsense. Poor!
