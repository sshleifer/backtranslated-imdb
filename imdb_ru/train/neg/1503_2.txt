This is incredible! Fidani (he was also a spirit) was one of the cheapest directors in the world. This film stole Leone’s original title "Duck you sucker!" but tell the boring story of Agent Pinkerton against the killer of Testa di Ferro (incredible Gordon Mitchell, stuntman). Everything is poor and crazy in this pelicula, filmed in the expensive landscapes of Lazio. The story is bad and insane at the same time. Fidani was not able to and engineers at the same time. Some crazy illogical things happened in this story (for example, a discussion in the sheriff's house and the scandalous appearance of Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!?!? Yes, indeed, Butch Cassidy, who is portrayed as an idiot). “Awful Americans”, absurd compromises, illogical plot, bad game and the high-explosive appearance of one of the most prominent TV presenters in the history of Italian television Renzo Arbor. Oh, of course: Klaus Kinsky. Yes, it's great and terrible, but I am sure that he was in it only for the sake of money and for playing with iron horses) 2 out of 10, but ... DON'T MISS IT !!!!!
