The authors probably had no experience in the army and probably never looked into a history book, but I still give some cheap credit to this cheap war film for having looked so long at the role of black soldiers in World War II. br /> <br /> The action is convoluted and incredible - any battle episode! has the best production performance, but the composition is interesting. Seeing the New York giant Rosie Greer was worth what I paid for. The artistic direction — the fifth — men wear the form of the Korean War, and by the time the US Army reached Germany in 1944, the weather was pretty disgusting, not as sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled Northern California, The scenario never makes it clear why black support troops are used as combat soldiers. It is pleasant to note that some men carry Springfield rifles instead of M-1, with which second-rate troops would probably have been given out. <br /> <br /> This basic story idea (the racist southern officer commanding black troops)) should have been expanded into a large production budget then, and it was not too late to try it now. You have to take it for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort. <br /> <br /> I remember that I saw it some time ago and thought it was made in Italy, which makes more sense because there were black military troops operating in 1944 there.
