The black guy becomes a rich white guy, and the rich white guy seems to perceive hip-hop culture, and most of the â€œfun" moments of this film play on it. My problem is that it does not work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> Good, so no one expected Lance to grab such a body and suddenly act like Charles Wellington. It would be too much to ask. I will provide it. But at the same time, it goes too far in the other direction. I have to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and fully unfolding things, playing like he is a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people just * accept * him? What about Santi, who falls in love with him * like a rich white guy *, even if she doesn't care about his money or power? It is so unbelievable that it is not even funny. <br /> <br /> I just could not stop disbelief and could not finish the film. I added another star, because a couple of times I even laughed, even strongly. But I just couldn't do without the "white guy doing hip-hop", which was never well done in any movie I've ever seen that tries it. This was no exception.
