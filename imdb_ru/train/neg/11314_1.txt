This film is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad game, bad script, everything is bad. Comparing this mainly with two other films of the same genre and from about the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Grüner, 1993) are much better and seem stronger both in history and in directing, and yet it was Albert Pün who also led these two! The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, perhaps because of an environmental catastrophe or a nuclear war, and people live in medieval conditions. A special breed of robots (cyborgs) lives on human blood, and there is a story ... Cyborgs need a lot of people to fulfill the "prophecy", and people need someone to stop them. One girl, together with a robot (Chris Christopherson), created by the creator of cyborgs, was appointed by fate to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director tries in Hong Kong several stylish fighting scenes with the participants. fly high and jump far. The film fails miserably in this attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film for the sole reason that most people get the newest film "the worst in history." And I recommend Cyborg to fans of the genre, because I think this is a very underrated film with a rather high entertainment factor. And if you can't stand Van Damme, then look at the Nemesis. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
