George Brent is a reporter sent in for an interview with the heiress. She is supposedly the heir to the condition of a face cream. He interviews her on her yacht. They fall in love with each other in swimwear. <br /> <br /> It turns out (pretty early) that she is not an heiress. She participates in the advertising campaign of cold cream. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the ups and downs of their romance. <br /> <br /> Auxiliary cast helps little in its creation. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Although it is quite predictable, it is also quite interesting. This is far from her better. But, especially given her ambiguity in her work, this is also not one of her worst actions.
