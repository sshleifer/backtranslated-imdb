David Mamet’s film debut was proclaimed by many as a real film about a person’s thinking, a film that makes you ask questions to everyone and everything. I first saw him recently and could not understand what was so good about him. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a woman psychologist named Margaret, who is also popular with authors. Margaret was disappointed in her profession and inability to really help anyone. She is trying to fix it by helping to pay off her patient’s debt to a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, the only reason to watch this movie). She discovers that Mike is in fact a professional person of trust when she almost falls victim to a fraud, which he pulls right after meeting her. Intrigued, she returns to see him, and asks him to show her how the scammers work (she plans to use this as the subject of a new book on psychology). She then falls in love with him and accompanies him in a long fraud, which he and his partners have established. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to go into details, but at the end of the film it turns out that the events of the entire film were the carefully considered fraud of Mike and his minions to deceive Margaret from $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First, the big turn at the end was VERY predictable. Any scene in which the scammers acted became very apparent through the stage play and strange readings. Not only that, but also the audience (and the main character) know that they are dealing with scammers, is it really such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret herself was deceived? In addition, Margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who knows how to read people, but she allows herself to be deceived too easily - and keep in mind, she knows perfectly well that Mike is a fraud. <br /> <br /> Secondly, we are inclined to believe that Margaret was deceived from the very beginning, but in order for the fraudster to eventually work, she had to do a few things that the crooks could not predict what she would do. . First, she had to decide how to pay off her patient’s debt, which allowed her to meet with the scammers. If she had not done this, the whole conman would have failed. I just have to say that it is rather unreasonable to assume that the psychologist will undertake to repay the patient’s debt in gambling. Not only that, but what is the likelihood that the scammers will be in the right place that night when she decided to appear? Did they just show up at the bar every night, hoping that she would come and see them? Another thing that had to happen, which could not have been predicted, was that Margaret again had to see Mike and ask him to teach her the tricks of her profession. What are the chances of it? And yet all fraud is based on this premise. <br /> <br /> Another problem I encountered is related to the final. Margaret learns that she was deceived, and decides to take revenge on Mike. First, Mamet makes us believe that she is going to cheat, but it fails, and ultimately shoot her Mike in the baggage area of ​​the airport. Somehow, it looked like an awkward and inept way to finish a film about fraudsters doing their craft. Not only that, but she didn't even take the money that he stole from her. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film leaves you devastated and unsatisfied. And if you, like me, predicted in advance that Margaret would be deceived, you will find this revelation equally unsatisfactory.
