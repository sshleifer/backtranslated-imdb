What the F * @ # is I just looking? Stephen STOP !! You are welcome! This film is insatiably bad and stupid. In a bizarre escape from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (obviously) with the desire "they were a vampire" with super human strength. " OK? Oh, and their eyes blink inhumanly sideways? Blimey! However, even in this film, in order to suppress the ego of Sigalov, who need to “have the final blow” and “no one can hit me,” he is somehow stronger than they. However, all average people are broken around him. C'mon, I can understand a bully or a drug dealer, but these are people with human powers. Yes, and get it, Seagal goes through a short list of questions related to identity, because, obviously, he and his colleagues in the film think that he is Wolverine! My God ... And worse of all this! Yes, there is worse than that. He has a voice above even a changing voice in the middle of a sentence while we look at his face. They are clearly not like him, and I believe that this may be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always watch the movie until the very end. It's low all the time even for your direct Stephen videos. Awful Awful Awful Two thumbs down! Redemptive qualities? Well, I think so, I will be honest in this aspect. At least some of the special effects were fine, and I like the choice of wardrobe for actors and actresses. Women were all pretty attractive IMO. However, and I said, still, it does not compensate for the arrogant X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie movie, vampire here) rip off! The director, screenwriter, producer, ALL should be banned and expelled from the movie business. I think I feel that most people think of Blood Rayne (and almost all the other pictures of Uwe Boll) about this film. That's all my $ 1.00 for this movie. Look if you dare.
