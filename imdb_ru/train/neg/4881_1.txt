This is the most boring useless piece of shit that I spent an hour of my life. All I can say is thank God that it was just an hour. More than half of this “film” is footage from the original “Criminal Madness”. At least, I was able to see the highlights of this rare classic of exploitation, because for some reason, challenging reality, in my video store there is only “Criminally Insane II” (as well as “Fat Mad Ethel II”). But the rest of this movie is one of the worst home videos and backyard shootings you’ve ever seen. Why does my video store have this and not the original? Why do such things actually go to video stores? Why do people rent it, and not immediately write a copy, as soon as they see her horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, Why? <br /> <br /> If you don’t like to see annoying fruit eating a whole candy bar in a painfully slow scene, or when you notice that the fruit is hung from the railing of a ladder in an even slower scene, or the character gets several backstrokes ask) several times in the back, or monologues that kill brain cells, about giving poisonous tea to his wife, and then complaining that all these conversations made him freeze or mentally retarded eat fly soup or just want to see how Mad Fat Ethel Dance with a bloody knife in the garden does not see this movie. I repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Do not rent this movie. If at all possible, do not pass by the shelves in the video store, which has a copy of this film. You can still be saved, but now it is too late for me. ,,
