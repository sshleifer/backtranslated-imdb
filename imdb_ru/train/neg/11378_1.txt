The dude on MST3K should see this dog from the movie. Basically, this is a hacker actor in Hollywood who cannot perform at any acting shows. And he has a strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what makes this stupid actor? He dyes his hair blond and begins to act like a surfer dude from Los Angeles in the naive hope that it will give him acting roles. You will laugh at your head in many unintentionally funny scenes of this film. For example, when the girlfriend of an actor dude is broken with her heart, she cries and says: “How could you do this to me?” And why does she cry? Because he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer to get acting skills. This film has no meaning at all! The actor who played the role of governor on Benson is also involved in this, and he plays a stereotypical right-wing politician with a rather silly funny dialogue. This movie will hack you, believe me. You say me?!
