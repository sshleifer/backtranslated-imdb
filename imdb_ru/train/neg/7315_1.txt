Ok, let's get straight to the point. We have five recent college graduates (they must have specialized in F) going on a weekend trip. They run into someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to set him on fire. Nice group of people. Then some of them start to get sick - there must be something in the water in the cabin where they stayed. However, the neighbors are fine. Oh, well, when things start to get really bad, they lock one of their companions instead of getting help (try a neighbor by the way). Some locals don't like them. They drive one speed skating through the woods for many miles until the truck breaks down. Somehow, after ten minutes, he shows up in the cabin (how he could find him and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another brain surgeon in the cabin understands that something is wrong, so he hides in a cave to allow this blow to end. Then he decides the next day to return to the cabin, believing that it must be some kind of sanctuary. He is frivolous with the relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24-hour mistake). Unfortunately, he is met by not very friendly policemen. Another couple decides to have sex while the beetle, which feeds on flesh, does its miracle, and then the woman realizes that she needs to shave her legs (taking most of her sore skin with shaving cream). In any case, you get the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people with whom I would not like to be friends. I was rooting for meat, eating bacteria. Other characters were introduced, which were also somewhat funny, but completely unbelievable. Ninety minutes of a good life is wasted.
