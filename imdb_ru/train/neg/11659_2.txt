I * loved * the original Scary movie. I am a big fan of parodies - this is my favorite form of humor. Sometimes he is considered the most intelligent form of humor. The guys from Wayans seemed to understand this concept perfectly in the original film, and then temporarily forgot it when creating the sequel. I think that Wayans are a family of comedic geniuses. Alas, even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a promise. I liked the exorcist parody, especially the “come on, mom” gag. This is now material of Vai quality. But besides this, I can only think of two other cases when I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is tempted by the spirit in the middle of the night, then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he says: “It was just a call to booty!” It was pretty funny. 2) Parody "Save the last dance", where the character Cindy accidentally beats the girl, practicing her new movements. But even a short giggle cannot be compared with the loud laughter of the first Scary Movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is clean rubbish filled with cheap plugs. The jokes from the first film, which were subtle or implied, are amplified and exaggerated. For example, in The Terrible Movie I, several hints were made that Ray was gay. It was fun. But in “Horrible Movie II,” the whole penis-choking scene with Ray under the bed was stunning and incredibly unfunny. This is a sample of the entire film. Shock humor * by itself * does not go too far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I would not like to rate the film “Wayans” so low, I have to give it 2 out of 10.
