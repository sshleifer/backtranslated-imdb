Alan Rudolph - so-so director, without this special approach. For example, in the Secret Life of Dentists in the dental office there was one frame that could express all the relations between husband and wife. Rudolph squandered it. The camera is in the hallway, looking through the doorways of the two dental offices, and Dana and Dave are alone in their rooms. You will get an idea of ​​their desolation and isolation, but not by much. Lighting, colors, body language, facial expressions could be significantly improved. If I was in charge, I would spend the whole day, if it was necessary, to take the right picture. This is the beauty and power of the film: it can express so many whole lives in seconds. <br /> <br /> It would be possible to improve the picture with a baby who got up in a pool of vomiting. The child should have been more involved in the puddle, she had to stomp her feet and shuffle her legs, she had to bow her head to look at the puddle with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. He plays an uncommunicative person, true, but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in his voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies on voice-over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ego, played by Denis Leary.
