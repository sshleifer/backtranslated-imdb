Although it contains facts that are not widely reported, this is not entirely true. They took upon themselves greater freedom in rearranging events, excluding people and using sets that did not correspond to the facts of their life in the 30s. At various times, the gang had more than just Bonnie, Clyde and WD, and these people had as much in common with the facts as were included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go a lot earlier than one shootout, and actually got involved in the crime. Some of the events that were depicted in daylight did occur at night. Rana Bonnie was much more serious and never healed properly. It was so bad that someone had to carry it with her until she was healed, and even then she stiffened, so she went stiffly. Clyde also limped because, while in prison, he cut off his big toe. I know that I am not picky and it was a television film, but even without these factual mistakes in this “TRUE” story, the film moves too quickly from event to event and meets more like a few separate pictures of their life instead of being cohesive smooth plot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading a book or watching a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
