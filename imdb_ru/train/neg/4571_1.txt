What we know about how we sleep is a deceptive and casual look at the secrets of the universe. We are presented with a parade of obvious experts (none of whom have been named) who roam and pontify in a completely unscientific way. Their interviews are divided into the smallest segments and scattered around some bright cgi and banal mini-plots. <br /> <br /> Films remove topics from science, philosophy, theology and politics, uniting them, not caring about accuracy, and then somehow extracting several prosaic and ridiculous conclusions. We tend to believe that quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult question that filmmakers would like to point the finger at. <br /> <br /> This is riddled with errors and logical non-illogical conclusions. How did we start with quantum mechanics and end with this pseudoscientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying “two plus two equals four, so I can move objects with my mind”. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing original and almost nothing accurate. Any picky viewer will be annoyed by complex editing, intrusive and meaningless special effects and a general lack of content. Educated viewers will be upset to tears by the violence inflicted on science and any other subject that affects this film.
