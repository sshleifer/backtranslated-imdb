I just rented (yes! I paid the money to see!) This film. OH MY GOD. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another reviewer, Miss Colgrand, said, get out of the films, PLEASE! Please never do or do not appear in another movie! The lady has the charisma of cantaloupe. No, this is unfair to cantaloupe, which is probably more likely to do so. She does not know how to act; she is always self-disgusted (reminds me very much of my always nasty young brides from Europe). She is not charming; she is not beautiful There is no real story. And editing! There was nothing I could see! It's pretty bad when you watch a movie and, just to get through it, you press "forward" on the remote control, and still nothing happens! I mean! ..... I involuntarily kept shouting: "Cut! Cut!" What were they thinking about? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a film together and get money to make love on the screen! Pretty good deal for THEIR; pretty raw deal for the viewer! I think I'm going to throw up now ...
