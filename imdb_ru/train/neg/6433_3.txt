It's hard to find a film that talks about the still widespread mythology of Senator Joe McCarthy as the political king of the demons. Boyle (like Joe) gives a convincing but historically inaccurate depiction of a Senator from Wisconsin, a McCarthy caricature that many consider real. Meredith, as a cunning army attorney Joseph Welch, who outwitted McCarthy at the army hearings in 1954, is, as always, very good. <br /> <br /> In fact, McCarthy and Cohn were quite right in worrying about the terrible security situation. in the army, and the 1954 army hearings entangled in the smoke screen used by the army to divert the investigation from the security flaws that the committee was investigating, alleging that McCarthy and Cohn were trying to provide service to their staff member David Shine while on duty. <br /> <br /> The film is a self-satisfied agenda based on a controversy based on ubiquitous myths that have been accepted as truth with many people for decades - that the “red panic” was essentially fake and McCarthy, HUAC, etc. d. always fired at the wrong targets, being nothing more than a lie, destroying the careers of public hounds who trampled on the constitutional rights of striking innocent liberals who were accused of threatening the security of munists. <br /> <br /> People who know little about it still feel confident in repeating misinformation about McCarthy and the "red panic" on this day - the hagiography of Crawley Marrow is an example. Misinformation is common, no wonder people swallowed it. A recent episode of Budd Schulberg in the serious British newspaper The Guardian for the left wing said that Hollywood writer "called the names" McCarthy - perpetuating the lie that McCarthy "investigated" Hollywood as the head of HUAC - the truth is that McCarthy never even was a member of HUAC, and he had little interest in Hollywood-type politics — his investigations were limited almost exclusively to the weapons of the US government. <br /> <br /> Mythology that the “red panic” is unjustified At present, completely blown up by recently opened Soviet and American government documents, if something McCarthy and co-authors underestimated the scale of penetration of Soviet and fellow travelers to the US, but for decades public misinformation about this period will be difficult to correct. <br /> <br /> One day, maybe one truly brave Hollywood soul will make a film telling the truth about how many American men and women secretly assisted the mass murderer of Stalin and worked to impose their vicious system of government. Western world, I can accurately describe Joe McCarthy’s career, but I’m not holding my breath. Until then, we have this mythical, drunk deceitful scoundrel with popular imagination, so familiar in the media ... "Joe the Tail Shooter."
