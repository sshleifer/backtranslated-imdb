In this film, old Amitabh Bachchan again falls in love with a much younger woman. He meets her in his restaurant. The youngest woman, Taboo, flirts with him. He does not know what to do, and asks her. Her reaction to his invitation is rather strange. It was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> And it annoys me because of this whole movie. It was not so funny. The jokes and the script were terrible! The only jokes that I liked were about the waiterâ€™s teeth, but after a few times even that became boring. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a little girlfriend who is called sexy. It was a strange relationship! A little girl with an old woman's mind! It was scary! I know that someone may be tied to a child, but this person has adult conversations with this child. It made no sense. <br /> <br /> Father Taboo - Paresh Rawal. He has to deliver hard times to Amitabha, but we all know Paresha, he cannot do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit at the table, even that should have been funny. <br /> <br /> I only like movies that are really fun. I guess I'll never watch this movie again.
