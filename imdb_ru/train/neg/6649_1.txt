Well, anyone who could honestly say that this film was Great or even Good, or delirious, or knows the director, screenwriter and producers and is trying to increase the popularity of this film. I watched the movie because my friend was working on it, and it was awful. I am an actress and worked for a while in the industry on big films and even independent ones, and I was tired of this film to tears. The reason I'm so harsh is that this film is clearly different from Mice and Men, and they have to sue because this is such a terrible story robbery. In an industry where Hollywood seems to have creatively gone bankrupt ... for someone to take the classic book and the movie Mice and People and destroy it with a new spin, I am very worried. Actors, accents, dialogues and directing were amateur, and the writing was grim. I mean, if you are going to take a fresh look at an existing story, make sure that it is as good or better than the original to justify the new rotation. Did not like this movie at all.
