For a film with such a big promise, it was a disappointing, subtle plot, and the acting was terrible and incredible. There were more holes in the plot than in Swiss cheese, and this is the worst clich√© I've ever seen in a movie. The final scene would have ripped my heart out if the whole movie had not been so painful from the very beginning. I was numb! From the very first scene - one remained surprised if her sister tried to turn to her twin for help, or just scare her to death, which would be better for the audience and save us from two hours of the worst acting skills. seen today. It was horror in the full sense of the word.
