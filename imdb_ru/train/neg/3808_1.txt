A WARNING! In this review will be revealed the ending of the film “Scoop”. If you do not want to know how the film ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> “Scoop” is so bad that you thought “Annie Hall” is an accident. <br /> <br /> He gets one star because you see Hugh Jackman's bare chest. This is the only thing that "Scoop" does for this. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen’s perversion and his obsession with women young enough at the moment to be his granddaughter have undermined any ability to make films that he can do at any moment. <br /> <br /> The plot seems promising: the ghost, Ian McShane, directs a student with a fluffy head Scarlett Johansson to find out whether English Lord Hugh Jackman is the notorious Tarot Killer prostitute card. The wizard, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite a promising plot, the film lacks charm, humor or atmosphere. This is a surprisingly lead, amateur effort for someone who has shot at least one previous film, not to mention dozens. Perhaps Allen had a stroke that was not reported in the press. <br /> <br /> Much has been done due to the fact that, unlike his previous films, Woody Allen, now a Septoagarian, has finally allowed the young man to lead to get a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is constructed in such a way that the girl does not receive anyone. <br /> <br /> There is an early scene where Johansson, without any central role in the film, allows you to get drunk and seduced by a powerful senior director. “Seduced” is a euphemism for what is happening. This is such a moment that I have to go. It has nothing to do with the plot, and it makes Johansson cheaper in the eyes of the viewer. Why did Allen add this unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows that a powerful director - like Allen - has sex with a female lead. Allen gets his cake and eats it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. She does not know how to control the screen, except for the fact that she wears a tight top with a low neckline. She imitates Allen in several scenes, and it looks weird and sad. <br /> <br /> A scenario in which her character is depicted as a doll that cannot function without a ghost, or as an elderly person and less than an awe-inspiring wizard telling her what to do at every step does not help. <br /> <br /> She is about twice as old as Jackman, and she faces a very useless presence on the screen in their scenes together. <br /> <br /> A non-obsessed audience deserves the best in its heroines, and Jackman also deserves the best - a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and freedom of action, and an actress who can convey these qualities. <br /> <Hugh Jackman is also fooled by the script. Allen obviously cannot come to terms with the fact that Jackman is so stunningly handsome and young, and therefore he does not allow Jackman anything to say or do. Like Johansson, it is used only for its appearance. It's a shame, because, as Jackman has shown in any number of productions, from Oklahoma to X-Men, he CAN act. <br /> <br /> Here's a big plot twist - Jackman, suave, charming English lord, really a killer. So, although the film says it's all about allowing someone other than Allen to get a girlfriend, she gets no one. Jackman, the man she made love to, is the man who killed the prostitute. Wow, Woody. A good way to punish your heroine for being out of your reach. <br /> <br /> In passive aggressive contact, Allen also deprives his heroine of his own presence, killing his hero, the magician, leaving Scarlet Johansson all alone at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> One final note: in my show, not one of the spectators laughed during the film. Always a bad sign when a movie is advertised as a comedy.
