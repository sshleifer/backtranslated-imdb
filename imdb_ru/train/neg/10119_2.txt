The animation in this rethinking of "Peter and the Wolf" is excellent, but in the 29th minute the film causes a dream. They should have called it “Peter and the Snails,” because everything moves at the speed of the snail. I could not even watch the movie in one sitting - I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the committee on the nomination of Oscar observed only the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the category “Best Animated Short Film” (short film!), Voters will have to go through all this. I already feel sorry for them - and I have to predict that this film will in no way come close to victory.
