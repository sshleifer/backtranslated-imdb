Given his pedigree, this film should be much more pleasant than it is. Even with a terrific collection of eccentrics in the cast - which fan will not look forward to the film that unites Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The whole event takes place at a dull pace, shot and, most often, reckless. <br /> <br /> The gifts of Kim Novak were not essentially comical, as she confirmed in “Kiss me, stupid” James Stewart was a good comedian, as he skillfully demonstrated in films from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think he comes out of this mess better than anyone else. Except maybe a cat.
