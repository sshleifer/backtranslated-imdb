I think this director / writer wanted to say something. Let's see what it could be ... a. Frog storms will be terrible? b. Can I ask someone like Tom Cruise to say the word “C” many times and look like a bad Patrick Ratter? with. Drop my wife and make her say the word "F" every 2 seconds. That aside, I really liked the beginning and the storm of the frog. Everything else was inexorable, too long (underestimated), overly condescending failure. Glad many of you liked it! <br /> <br />
