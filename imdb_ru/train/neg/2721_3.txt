I'm a big fan of science fiction from the 50s, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept of the film was a natural medium for a classic small science fiction film, the director was too much hoping to carry the film. It is clear that he worked without money, because the entire film is loaded with a bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. I have never seen so much killing time in a movie. <br /> <br /> Probably, in the entire film “footage shot” is less than 60 seconds, and most of the rest are people who attract attention. in many poorly written, obsessive dialogues. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita S. together, but oh my God ... how could the actors think that someone in their right mind would believe them in their teens?
