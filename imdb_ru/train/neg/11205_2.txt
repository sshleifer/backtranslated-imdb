Yes, well, I definitely regretted having thrown my saturday night while watching this strange little but very long movie. Apparently, the main character did not steal two hours of my life. Here is the embodiment of the anti-hero in "No regrets." We have this jerk, so confused, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unattractive, that it was extremely difficult to overcome the pull of a promising son of an extremely beloved businessman, Jamine, unless it was: physical attraction. Otherwise, he claims it is love. But after watching, this sounds like the love of Charles Manson, because you are digging a beard. (Well, he is not so bad, but still he cannot boast of real characteristics.) I could never understand the reason for the endless stems of Jaemin Sumin. They never showed it, they just said that Jamin loves Sumin. Perhaps this is the culture that flew over my head: crazy / haunting = crazy love in Seoul. It should be so, because a little more than half of the film is one pursuit of the other, and the last part moves back and forth to such an extent that I thought it turns into a comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to appear. Well, so Sumin works two jobs while she goes to school, and while sheâ€™s good for someone who is trying to improve herself. But after he first felt the appeal of his pursuer, he quit his day job for the sake of some prostitution ring. What kind? Well, well, as mentioned earlier, obsession does not stop because of a job / career change, and if you add a bunch of other very evil characters, you will get one spoiled movie in which incredible events seem to happen without a build-up. The main film is not 100% terrible, but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.
