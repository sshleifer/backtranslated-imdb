I will say it again: this film was completely lame. Kids will love it, of course, but adults ... it’s doubtful. All of this was basically a rehash of the original, which was to be expected, since they largely explored the entire concept in the first film, but still, did they have to completely rephrase the entire movie? I mean, everything is redone from the Little Mermaid. The worst part of this is Morgana, the “crazy sister of Ursula”, who appears from nowhere and threatens Melody, which is funny because Triton is there with her magical trident. Why didn't Triton do anything about it? Because the plot required him to do nothing. I could go on, but I will not. All this is a shameless attempt to get more money from the Little Mermaid, and, obviously, they were thrown together, without thinking, because they knew that it would sell. In general, it is a terrible waste of time.
