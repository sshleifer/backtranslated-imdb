This is a rather small show about paranormal phenomena, although it seems that Art Bell and his colleagues have figured out how to make a career out of a relationship, of which Karl Kolchak is an example. Of course, there would be no “X-Files” if this show did not prepare the audience for this so well. Darren McGavin is not exactly a superhero type, but he is a believable (sufficient) guy to do heroic deeds. Check out his work on some of those old Alfred Hitchcock gifts. Here he is the main attraction, there seems to be no girlfriend or wife who is distracting. In fact, the show is not so much sexual attractiveness. Something that I also notice is that in fact the rhythm is not very tense. In this series a lot of humor. Sometimes just get to the climax. In this show there is a thread that goes down to the current MAD MEN show in terms of style. Not that David Chase wrote Mad Men, but the people who worked with him on The Soprano definitely imitated and inherited his serio-comic tone.
