Well, I bought this movie from Woolworth for my friend as a joke given to him on his birthday because there was a sexual insinuation on the cover. <br /> <br /> But we still decided to watch it. Just for fun. <br /> <br /> And sorry, but this is probably one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> It all started well, and we thought, "Well, that can really be good." But after about 10 minutes we were sadly mistaken. <br /> <br /> It all started with the fact that the “mysterious draftsman” turned out to be the most obvious character, Australian Scozer (I say that because he had an accent). who could not be identified), who acts, I would say, was terrible. <br /> <br /> Then it was all over, and by that time we all lost the desire to live. Paintball Final. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this storyline is that they didn’t actually win, but unfortunately, they won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know it has nothing to do with it, but the name that was given to the team was just awful. Critical damage. I mean, they could have chosen a more amazing name, for example, “The Destroyers of the Antichrist” or something like that. Or this is what the film should have been called anyway.
