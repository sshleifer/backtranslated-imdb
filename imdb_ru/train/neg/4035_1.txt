I hate being the one who rains in the parade (even a little like this one), but from the very first scene, you could say that this film was going to be absolute shit. This is really a shame, as I really like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was intrigued by how they would mix in the film together, but, to my horror, they didn't even have a scene together !! I think I need to repeat it - the two main actors (who stand side by side on the posters and DVD covers) did not have one scene together !!!! They did not talk to each other and never appeared on the screen at the same time. Roughly summarizes this bad movie reason. False advertising. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every character in the film was unrealistic and inhuman. The scenarios were contrived, the plot was shitty, the jokes were subtle, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played poor Tim from the office), no one was cute, and, worst of all, some characters were so annoying that it almost made me disconnect, because I could no longer watch or listen to them. <br /> <br /> This low cost git was a grand failure. Even Danny Dyer could not bring a little bit of humor and charm to it, but he blessed, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Someone might rate this film as “ten stars”, taller than me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on .... I won't even give out some of the great ten stars, since ten stars mean that the movie was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which means that it was almost completely horrible. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you like, but if you have seen a lot of movies and watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably look like mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
