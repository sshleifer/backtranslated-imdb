Michael Keaton has never really been a good actor; in the films of Tim Burton Batman, he always falls into the shadow of his great villains. Here he plays the role of a widowed husband who collects radio frequencies, which seem to be dead people who are trying to make contact with the living ... <br /> <br /> Well, it must be a pretty shocking thriller, but it really misses about every place that shocks you. Because there are too many things that end up inexplicable, undetected and uninteresting. So where is the shocking excitement when it all becomes so bad a movie that is made in the first place that WHITE NOISE makes a fool of itself? Really bad and terrifying edited, this film is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton is trying to return the thriller, but in the end loses the goal more than ever.
