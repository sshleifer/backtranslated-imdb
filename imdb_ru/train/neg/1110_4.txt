One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this film, and I decided that it was pretty lame. It was right after Hopalong (Chris Libbert) fell on his horse from a tree to reunite with a good guy squad. I was rather puzzled by the whole trick of Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20, which did not lead to anything at all. Obviously, the name Coppola in the credits could not do anything to guarantee success here, even if there were several of them on the list. <br /> <br /> If you get to the end of the movie, you will probably find yourself asking yourself the same questions as me. What exactly was crocheted with gloves? What happened to the rodeo scenario? Who was the Stranger to represent? Why did they make this film? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but my energy was exhausted. Listen, in 1950 a western called “Shooter” already appeared, in which a guy named Gregory Peck plays the role of the main character. Watching it, you feel as good as watching it, you feel bad. This I can recommend.
