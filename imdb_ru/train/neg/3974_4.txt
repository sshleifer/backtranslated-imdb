I agree with everything that Calamine said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it's time for girls to move on to the best roles. I would like to see their progress very much, as they were a very inspiring couple, growing up, and I would like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their career as well as their personal life. Therefore, producers, please give girls a chance to develop something that deviates a little from the tangent, push them into a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talents in many aspects. This commented film is not so bad, but, as I have already seen in their films, their films remain the same as in a typical plot and typography. When Rome is good for the younger generation, adults who were children when twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes, and therefore I think we adults would like to see them make films of different types. perhaps those that are like the sixth sense, the hour, chocolate, this kind of cinema - not to mention having only serious films for them, also humorous, yes, but rather watch them in different roles compared to that they played in their later films like this and new york Kaya minute. (Note: I'm from Australia, so sorry for your weird spelling, like recognizing with s instead of z)
