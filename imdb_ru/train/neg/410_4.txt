Unfortunately, one of the best attempts in the field of special effects, made so far, was completely meaningless, because it was next to an awkward, stupid and equally meaningless plot and inadequate clichéd scenario. “Hollow Man” is a rather useless movie. <br /> <br /> Practically everything that was shown here was done to death — the characters, the idea and the sequence of actions (especially the elevator shaft!) —with the only really intriguing film element — are impressive special effects. However, this is still the same special effect that was done over and over again, and by the end of the film, which was made to death. Before looking at Hollow Man, I hoped that the Invisible Man theme, which in itself is hardly original, would become the basis of something newer and more interesting. This is not true. Soon the film turns into a very familiar bloodbath and a lot of ineffective history - a bunch of clichés accumulate so quickly that it is almost impressive. <br /> <br /> On top of that, Kevin Bacon is doing a pretty useless job, and his supporting team is barely trying its best. Good points could be Jerry Goldsmith's passable score (but not the competition for his best efforts), quite an interesting use of thermal imaging and special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects elevate the Hollow Man's merit by one notch. <br /> <br /> 4/10
