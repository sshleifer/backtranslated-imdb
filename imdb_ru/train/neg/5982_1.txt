I am very sorry to say this, but "Thunderbirds" do not even make a loud sound, let alone thunder. At one point, I seriously thought about getting out of the cinema, and remained in the desperate hope that the film could improve. I had to be disappointed, it did not improve, it worsened, if at all possible. If I went to see the movie with the thought that it would be “fake”, I would still be disappointed. They had a great opportunity to make a great movie franchise here, they completely missed this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed when names are attached to this film, and Jonathan Freyks is well, what I can say, he should be embarrassed and ashamed not too far from the truth. I saw this film in the preview, I waited to see it with great impatience, grew up in the sixties with original shows. To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. The last thing I say about the film was that the puppets on the television show were a little more wooden than the actors in the film.
