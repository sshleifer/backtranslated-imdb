Yes, this is one of these films, so horrible, so tasteless, so banal that you can't stop laughing. I watched comedies, good comedies and laughed less than my wife, and I laughed at this movie. Other comments give the idea quite well. Characters are so unpleasant that you cheer on rats, effects are so bad that you wonder whose art class in elementary school was in charge, acting skills — about acting skills — to talk about weary dialogue and awkward pauses. <br /> But rat, yes, big rat. Why we did not see the rat to the end, it surprised me. Often the “big” is not shown until the end, because the budget is limited, and the good effects take so much money. I suppose, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end, because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a running guy dressed as a marmot with third world dentistry. <br /> <br /> The most elevated part of the entire film is the elevator scene. Finding out that the rats do not withstand loud noise (migraines from bad behavior?), The main dude turns on the fire alarm to annoy the rats. If you ever wanted to see a couple of rat waltzes, while blood spurted out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. In fact, you should rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But no more than 99, ok?
