It is a bit strange that the story, which is located in that part of Oslo, where a very high percentage of local people come from Asia, DOES NOT EVEN SHOW ONE ASIAN OR AFRICAN person, even as an extra. This fact probably describes the Norwegian race relations in general. - But. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> Buddy depicts four young people living on a plain in Oslo. The main character is two young people who fail to direct their lives in any serious way, and one can say that the film can be about indecision and avoiding responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. The narrative plays typical teenage dreams and fantasies and role models. Completely cliché. Although the story is a bit funny, the acting is good, and being a “young man”, you can identify with the “crazy” situations of the characters and difficult love relationships, I do not consider this story or the characters very believable. For polishing and not enough depth. In this film, all the classic tricks, pleasant to the audience, are used to create an entertainment film with the same intellectual depth as Friends (yes, on TV). <br /> <br /> Finally, did the Norwegian film find its individuality?: audience please, in the famous American style. <br /> <br /> How about watching Tillsammans Lucas Moodysson (Together).
