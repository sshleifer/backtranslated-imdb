This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was a kind of remake, but again, not really. I was very disappointed, given the tools that Tim Burton has. He had great makeup and CGI, and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than 6 million dollars ? Gosh no. So in this respect the film failed. <br /> <br /> At least in the original film, the scene of the statue of liberty was shocking, but there was nothing shocking in this movie, not even the final scene, because you could have seen it. is coming. And by the way, if you think about it, and I thought, you can understand how the final can end. I just wish I had the time I wasted thinking about it. <br /> <br /> This film would be brilliant and fun if it remained within the framework of the first film and took the part â€œUnder the Monkey Planet." it really had to be bigger than Mark Mark, because he is not good enough to take care of the film himself, so I would put three guys) that he would land on what they thought would be another planet, meet people (not Germans), a city driven by monkeys that are hunted will make friends with some good monkeys will find that they are mle, finding some ruined ruins, eventually running into crazy mutant people living under the ground, war broke out between mutant people and monkeys, and then ... well, let your imagination run dry . <br /> <br /> But I want to say that there could be much more in this film. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy a good thing. See what he did with the Batman series. He is a rotten director, despite what people think. He is fashionable, so he should be good, thinks. Sorry, but not. If someone else made this film, it would have turned out much better and would have been much more pleasant.
