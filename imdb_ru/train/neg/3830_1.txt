I don't know why I spend time watching this wasted film. If you stick to it for long enough in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion ?? good, bad or surprising ?? not. It finally fails after a hard, formal, predictable dialogue and action. The scenes in the room are so sharply lit that you think that if the camera is reduced one millimeter further, you will see the light of the clique. The costumes, hairstyles and decorations are starched, pressed and flawless. Are ordinary people supposed to live like this in the beginning of the 20th century in Arizona? Comparing other reviews with Sam Peking Pach is an insult to Peking Pah: at least this director has included his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. Burning men are the unreasonable explosions of wooden imitations of bad guys with well-groomed nails. BUT?!? I can believe that Heston thought he might have done something worthwhile with this film. (He can grab the gun with cold fingers.) But Coburn? I never guess why he signed up for this parody. Want to watch a film about the end of the West, how we knew it, about the end of the West, how we knew it? See SHOOTIST or UNGORGIVEN again. LAST HARD MEN is a mockery of the obituary in relation to the West.
