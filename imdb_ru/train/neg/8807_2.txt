I chose Dead Creatures because I thought it was a zombie movie, something like 28 days or so ... but not really. This is not even a horror movie. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who seem to be infected with a strange virus that causes it to eat human flesh in order to survive. <br /> <br /> This story creates a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> A VERY BAD FILM. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 2 10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - ------------- ---
