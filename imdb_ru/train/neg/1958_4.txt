Where to start This film began as something like the cry of “Waterfall of Darkness”. An old, mutilated woman who lives in the forest gives children gifts for their teeth. Sounds familiar? Then it changes. In Darkness Falls, the tooth fairy killed you only if you saw her. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why do they need a rocker, his hippie girlfriend or Bubbas and their sister? I think the film would have been nice without them. It seems that the producers sat down and decided that they needed to add extra people to the film so that the tooth fairy had people to kill. Although nice to see a pretty blonde who is not portrayed as a soap head for a change. You can rent it, but I would not advise buying it.
