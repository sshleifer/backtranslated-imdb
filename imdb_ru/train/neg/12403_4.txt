ANDY HARDY MEETS THE DEBUTANT (1940) is the ninth (9th) film of the series, and it shows the direction in which he inevitably headed. The characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were going to be in front and in the center. The rest of the cast was also about to break the clock and collect their checks. The series would have approached this occasion again and would have had its moments, but a fatal decline would come. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone throughout the entire series would continue to portray the character of JUDGE HARDY with sympathy. The rest of the cast would be professional, although they were given less and less work. Mickey Rooney, on the other hand, will continue his character, as if there was no learning curve. Andy's reaction to any situation was naive and incredible. Even after he returned to World War II as a veteran of World War II in Andy Hardy’s “Laughter in Love” (1946), his reaction to any “teapot storm” was the same, young. <br /> <br /> In this film, this is clearly shown, ANDY finds himself in several unbelievable situations that would be resolved with a simple explanation. This screen recorder was known as the “idiot plot”. A tool for stretching a poorly written script. Perhaps it was not the fault of Mickey Rooney, as the director and writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz supervised too much, and a more firm hand was needed to control Rooney's excesses. To see our review of the entire series, go to YOU ​​ONLY YOUNG (1937).
