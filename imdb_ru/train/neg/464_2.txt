This film is by no means ridiculous, it tries to be ridiculous with its lame humor, which is so dry and boring that the film is only 2 hours of torture. Throughout the film, I thought about one thing: “when will it end.” One thing you have to give them is that they have very few soft funny moments, so I also gave him 2 whole stars. This is unoriginal and uses almost all the old blonde jokes in the book, even those that were not funny the first time. In fact, this is a film embellishing blondes and recording the entire set of jokes about blondes. <br /> <br /> To summarize, we can say that this film is blond, humor has spoiled, you should not pay any amount, look, it's so bad.
