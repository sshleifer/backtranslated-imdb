I have never seen the original version of 1954 with Judy Garland, so I don’t have any means to compare. In addition, several years have passed, but I did not find this tale either exciting, or exciting with its romance. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical career moves in opposite directions. John Norman Howard - an exhausted frustrated rock star at sunset, starting a novel with a new, talented new singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. Its dramatic success only underlines its decline. <br /> <br /> Leading actors, Chris Christofferson and Barbra Streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry, nor the plot left a big trace for me. The film deserves attention for only one aspect, Streisand’s wonderful performance of the Oscar's Evergreen song. She has a really powerful and gorgeous voice.
