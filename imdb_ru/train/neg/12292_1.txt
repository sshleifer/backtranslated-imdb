We brought this film as a joke for a friend and may have become our worst joke. The film is barely noticeable, and the acting is terrible. The worst child actor ever used, and Hasslehoff gives a low-quality performance. The plot is shameful, and in some moments we were so bored that we wondered what the hell was going on. It tries to be disgusting in some places, but just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> just awful
