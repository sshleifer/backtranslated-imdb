I just give it three, because it did what my friends did, and I hoped it would do: entertain. <br /> <br /> I wasnâ€™t so stupid as to put up with it, thinking it would be a movie about a zombie with Romero or Fulci, but I rented it for fun. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for fun or a movie that makes you shake your head embarrassed, do it. This is ideal for fans of Mystery Science Theater, but the only drawback is that it is so bad that it makes fun of itself. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's embarrassing to associate this with any other Hollywood title that we may know, because when a movie is terrible, it has its own genre.
