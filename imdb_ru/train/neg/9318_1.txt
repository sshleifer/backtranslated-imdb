This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I made the mistake of buying the film again, because the synapse on the back panel sounded cool, and the front cover also looked pretty cool (After buying this movie and the film Maliciousness, which I also looked at here, I learned the lesson). I love horror movies that happen in the forest, in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly happens in the forests of Texas, but was probably shot in the backyard of the director. Production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely the worst. The story had nothing to do with what was said on the back cover. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and another “mother’s-popular” store that buys used DVDs, and none of them would have taken it. That's how awful this poor miserable excuse is for a movie. I have already seen some bad films (for example, “Troll 2”), but this is definitely. I did not think that the film was worse than Troll 2. Boy I was wrong! Do not buy this movie if someone does not give it to you for free, but even if you don’t get stuck with it, if you don’t throw it away, that’s what I’m going to do !!!!
