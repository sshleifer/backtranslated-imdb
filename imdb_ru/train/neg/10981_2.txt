Or listen, for that matter. Even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the worst gay movie I have seen (this applies to Billy), but itâ€™s very close to the base of the trunk. <br /> <br /> This thing drags and drags and drags. The point is not that the plot is meaningless - in the hands of a good writer this could work. This, of course, could be much more interesting. There is not a single point of the plot that you cannot see ten miles down the road. The dialogue is flat. Anecdotes are old. To add insult to injury, it is full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film convinced me that the situation or the relations of the two main characters were possible, and all the more real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact there is no evidence why the presenters love each other. We were just told that they were in love. It is difficult to understand when they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. Do they like the same book? Yes? <br /> <br /> The game is not really bad, but the pace is painfully slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch is slow, but without the quality of Jarmusch. Actually, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch films, avoid this.
