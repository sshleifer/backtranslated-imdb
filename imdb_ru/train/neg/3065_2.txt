I believe that this film represents the time in which it was made to the same extent as the original. What is really sad is that, at a deeper level, the name “Point of Convergence” of the original is so ironic. I am sure that this was not intended in this way, but the original was shot in 1970, and released in 1971. THIS “CARE POINT” was the end of an era that almost ended in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this remake, all countercultural elements were removed, and more computers were provided in an attempt to reach a wider audience, presumably. “Disinfection for your protection” <br /> <br /> Inserting scenes from the American Indians was useless, and the idea of ​​a “noble goal” of the trip was subtraction by addition. I'm glad I looked at it, however, it made me appreciate the original much more. The original cult classic and gold. This remake is terrible.
