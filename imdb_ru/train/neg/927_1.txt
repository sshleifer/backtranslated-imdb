I mean, in fact, like Charles Band, the head of Full Moon, could have released a stinky ball, such as DEMONICUS. I mean, he should never get the green light from the beginning. The story repeats, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story on Tyranus, except that he is a bad dude. Then they are a screenwriter or director due to a bad ending. Right, bad end, Demonic rebel. The last survivor escapes from the deadly cave, then the picture of Chimera comes to life, I would add that it is cheap and drove it out. Then, when she goes home ala FUNHOUSE. The statue, which was destroyed many centuries ago, appears without any reason to just fall on top of it. I mean, it does not make sense. What the hell was Charles thinking, who had allowed him to create this bunch of vomiting, with four different film companies who so needed a movie? They might ask me if I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. THANKS TO TURKEY.
