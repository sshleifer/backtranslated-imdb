Reviews of this film were warm at best, while the expectations were incredibly high: a big budget, tons of popular faces, a rather funny idea and the main actress everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Allegedly Tremblay's supposedly humorous journey in the fantasy world does not allow to entertain his audience (I have not heard a single laugh throughout the entire presentation), passing a thin page of the plot and one-dimensional characters without a single spark of the magic that she desired. The 90-minute film here is barren with clumsy leadership, and some good actors do everything they can to become professionals in the film, which, of course, may not seem like such a good idea on the set, not to mention paper. "L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay" is a collage of comic sketches linked together by a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
