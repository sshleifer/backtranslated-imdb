The nightmares of a woman harbor her fear of being buried alive. The cheating husband wants her dead, and decides to use her phobia, sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement. Of course, the queen of horror films B-Brinke Stevens turns into a hideous ghostly creature. The only reason to see this amateur trash movie is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes of Brinke’s bloody riot are pretty funny to watch. The headless head is really terrible. It is better to look at the Scalp or the Alien Dead again. Of course, I do not expect great fun from Fred Olena Ray, but “Ghost Fear” is too boring to be fun.
