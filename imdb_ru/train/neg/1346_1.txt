Dear friends and family, <br /> <br /> I think that if one teenager wants to become biblical with another, then this is their eternal damnation - just remember children, “birth control” does not mean “oral sex”, I do not care what the student says honor. On the other hand, even if the help of the senator quotes himself as a “little romantic guy,” he still beats only the schoolgirl. If she was my sister, I would eat this guy's patella. <br /> <br /> In addition, I learned that the Mongols do not kiss the same way as the French, and that baseball players by the name of Zoo love delicate underwear. <br /> <br /> I think that I would almost prefer to watch Richie Rich again than to suffer from the humiliation of this slip, slap, slop. Thanks and good night.
