This fake journey never compares to the wit and madness of the great adventure that these guys embarked on in their first film. This release is trying to deviate from its prequel to collect new blood from a joke, but it takes a wrong turn and travels are neither interesting nor funny. <br /> <br /> At the show, the guys performing at a rock concert (and many people watch on “free television” - since when does this happen?) Of course, the scriptwriter could do something more creative; See how all the random elements of the first film were neatly connected with each other by combining them into a scientific presentation. Not in this film, which pretty much put an end to the Bill and Ted franchises. The joke is over. <br /> <br /> The Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix for any reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is poorly done and has no sparks for comedy or audience involvement. The impression of the ZZ Top, for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
