I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only one worthy of being in this movie. But even in this case, do not watch this movie. Despite the fact that he is good as the main villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I wasn’t worried about the characters (except for the little boy), and, in fact, I didn’t care if the lovers crossed the stars would be together or die. generally care about each other. I read a lot of “classic” novels after watching movies, and this movie made me not even want to read a book. The story seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try to correct the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Dawn. The actress who played Lorna was also in Feeling and Sensitivity, and in that she was much better. Watch Sharp, Horatio Hornblower, A & E show great films about such novels as Pride and Prejudice. Or a mini-series like The Forsyte Saga. Check them out, don't mess with Lorna Dawn.
