I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. This is a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously, this film is a living proof that the formula works. If it is not broken, it does not need to be fixed. Street but vulnerable heroine, seasoned ex-police master of martial arts with a heart of gold and a serial killer with "problems". Pure magic.
