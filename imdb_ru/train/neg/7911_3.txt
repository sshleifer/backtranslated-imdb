It was not noticeable enough to be truly awful, it was just incredibly lame. The story was not half bad, but the execution was just awful. <br /> <br /> To begin with, she moved too fast for us to be emotionally involved in what is happening. It was just bad. The dialogue was so completely not sparkling, just plain and boring. <br /> <br /> And the heroes, all-consuming screams, made Deadpool boring. How the hell do you make Deadpool boring? He was not even funny. He was not crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a pair of swords that he didn’t even know how to use. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And since when has he had telekeniz, forcing cards to simply fly and fly, or super power to jump hundreds of feet into the air? And what the hell happened to all the silly movements of the helicopter? I mean, we know that they are mutants, but they still exist in the field of physics. A round fighting staff is not a helicopter blade, you cannot fly, rotating super fast. What Gambit couldn't do anyway. Neither Deadpool, especially when it is used as a substitute for real combat choreography. <br /> <br /> And this film is proof that wired work should only be used by battle coordinators who know what they are doing and know better than using it in everyone. Single. shot. as a substitute for real combat choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical Marvel comic book fighters (Logan, Creed, and Wilson), as well as some of the worst martial choreographies I've ever seen in recent film memories. As if the stunt coordinator just shrugged and left it all to the special effects guys. <br /> <br /> And then you had a break, with all these mutants who did nothing. Even the mutants who, as shown in their cells, possessed abilities (it's nice to see how the nod of mercury), did everything when they left. Only Emma, ​​really lame for this film, Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> And since when was Logan so beautiful? And stupid: "The bullet will take his memory." Don't you think that Xavier and X-Men would notice big frightening holes in his adamantine skull when they x-rayed at X1? I was sorry for the man Lieb Shrieber, he actually led a good saber-tooth, given the script. He made one of the simpler supervillains Marvel feel real. But he could not save the film from his own epic lameness. Seriously, it was the level of "Daredevil" sucks. Decent story, good actors, absolutely awful performance.
