The long list of high-profile names in this film (including the omnipresent John Mills) did not amaze me so much that I could not judge a film by its actual merits. These are FULLY stereotypes, caricatures and standard scenes, from the humble hero of aces to the loud mouth of the flyer. The music track was such that at some point, about an hour before the end, I thought that the film was over: a loud, growing crescendo, a grand flourishing and end, then silence, but then the film continued! I have not found any real storyline, unsystematic writing, but exquisitely compressed uniforms and pretty Gene Simmons (work in front of the nose) with animating little rubbish. I can not say that in this picture there are some ingredients that make the film gorgeous. I found it maudlin, mawkish and minor.
