This film is so stupid that it just goes around the corner and becomes funny. In fact, I wanted to watch “Darkness Falls” and thought it was a movie. Boy, what a mistake! I moved as much as I could, and yet I could not get rid of the boring moments. I just envy people who have been paid to play or work on this film. In fact, they were given money for this shit. Isn't that amazing? I mean that in this film a person is killed and cut into a crusher into small bloody pieces, and after a few minutes, the mother and the child calmly talk at the table when nothing happens and drink coffee. You are welcome! Come on! Who gives money for such shit movies? Oh, and the tooth fairy was lame. Not at all scary and it was obvious that this is a bored stunt man with poorly made makeup.
