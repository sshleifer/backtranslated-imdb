My kids watch the show every day. This is a great program for young children. However, they need to stop showing replays, do some more topical shows, and get rid of YELLOW TEETH Rooney and Didi. Mo is the only Doodle bop with clean white pearl teeth, and kids notice these things and ask if they ever brush their teeth? Will the show ever get to the United States, and if so, where can we find its schedule? And one more thing, if we can add. Mou, you need to stop hiding so much. Sometimes when you appear out of nowhere, you scare younger children, and what about pulling the rope? What does it mean? another then get wet all the time. They have to add new things to their show instead of the same ole of the same ole. Children lose interest in this.
