Of course, NOMAD has some of the best riding scenes, sword games and stunning landscape cinematography that you are likely to see, but this is not what makes a movie good. It helps, but the story must shine through these things. And that's where the nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The story is unnatural, which gives the feeling that it was composed simply to create a “cool” film that “looks” great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place (and this is obvious with names such as Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to draw us into a culture such as the Yugars and the Cossacks, they damn better use actors / actresses who look the same. <br /> <br /> Warring tribes, prophecy, fraternal love and respect, The love interest that separates our “heroes” affects everyone, but with so little influence and time on the screen that most viewers will throw them aside favor the next sequence of battles, the next scene of a horse’s action or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that during the filming of Nomad significant changes were made, in particular, in the director and cinematographer. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Uli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laussen. In one respect, Laussen seems to see better, as his visions of lands made the final cut, which we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, switching to Bodrov as a director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I see here, the focus is on battles, not on people, which I feel comes from the eyes of Bodrov, and not because of Passer. This parody. <br /> <br /> The most shameful aspect is that it could be a really fantastic film, with an emphasis on character and action. Unfortunately, the management apparently decided to act, and chose a cheap (intellectually speaking) solution. <br /> <br /> Although I cannot give this film a positive rating, it is worth looking just for an amazing cinematic work. But that's all.
