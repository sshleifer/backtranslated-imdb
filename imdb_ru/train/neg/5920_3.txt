Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> Unusual setting for an American film about wartime, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> An unusual object, four sisters and their relationship with American soldiers, from one, on which the illegitimate child was born, the dead son of a senator, another living with seven Marines (one at a time) before he was killed New Zealander prisoner of war returning husband. <br /> <br /> Unusually, Paul Newman is so poor at his unforgettable role in the role of Rocky Graziano in the brilliant film “Someone Loves Me There”. <br /> <br /> Unusually for two beautiful Stars, Joan Fontaine and Gene Simmons leave so little of themselves in the film. /> <br /> Unusually, I can work to write a review of such a bad movie, skip it!
