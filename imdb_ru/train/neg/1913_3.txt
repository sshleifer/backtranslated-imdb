“Welcome to Collinwood” is a kind of disaster. Given the people involved, this should have been several times better. <br /> <br /> If you are at least to some extent attached to the belief that everything will be better, it will probably make you cry. This is one of those films that had the potential, but were deprived of this potential due to the terrible scenario and bad game, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary character George Clooney and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfus, but about whom I care so little that I don't even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The film’s only saving grace is the weird vocabulary it introduces. I thought about it again and again, watching as more criminal capers. This is the only reason I gave film 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily offensive and extremely unattractive. They are in a state of constant excruciating stress, and they are all so annoying that I noted their obstacles. They shout at each other and swear foolishly. The dialogue is, at best, tasteless and offensively stupid at its low points. <br /> <br /> I think Steven "Traffic" Soderbergerakarabadlablahbla and George Clooney are to blame for this. They should be tried for war crimes if someone actually remembers this nonsense long enough to take care.
