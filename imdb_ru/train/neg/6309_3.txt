This film had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and screenwriter of this film failed miserably and created a dull, boring movie film that made me feel that I was back in the eighth grade of Mr. Hartford in social studies - back in 67 year. <br /> <br /> What a waste someone, please, take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it. <br /> <br /> Every time the scene had potential, all that remained was a few cliches in combination with black. and white frames, which they probably received from the Story Channel to show the action. Shame on you <br /> <br /> Ossi Davis was the only bright light in this boring festival. The other game was incredibly boring — it fit the film well, and the one who played the captain set a new low standard for on-line delivery. <br /> <br /> However, if you are ready to accept all of the many flaws in this film and don’t care about being delighted or entertained, but want to learn about USS Mason, it’s worth a look.
