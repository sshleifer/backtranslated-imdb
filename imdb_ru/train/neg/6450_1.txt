Well, this film is amazingly awful. I was sorry for the actors involved in this project, because I am sure that they did not write their own lines. Which were sometimes delivered with a touch of sarcasm, which made me think that they do not take this film seriously, and no one can watch this disgusting slasher monster. Watching this “Unknown Being”, I could not help but think that there is not much budget or a competent writer in a team. But, if you watch it for the sake of laughter, you will be happy, the film will be shamelessly mock yourself, because I don’t see how someone can look at it and be proud of putting it right on the DVD. The film "Fight into the Light."
