A weaker entry in the TV series "Bulldog Drummond" with John Howard in the role. The usual funny banter and pranks, but not a great plot. Barrymore is tasked by the inspector, changing his disguise to follow Drummond, Algy and Tenney in pursuit of a wild goose (mostly in circles; perhaps the budget was denser than usual) to save poor Phillies who are held captive by people who want lure drummond to his doom. For those who keep score, in this, Drummond plans to ask the Phillies to marry him, and Algy is worried that he will miss the child's baptism. It's funny to see how Algy and Tenney dress up like fishermen to merge into The Angler's Rest, but little is raised above stupidity.
