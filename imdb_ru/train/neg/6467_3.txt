I still can not believe this movie. There are so many incredible things in them that it’s hard to believe that someone wanted to do this. <br /> <br /> History is a joke, but in the sense of ridiculous, but no longer similar to history in general. How can a farce comedy be mixed with a train robbery, a prison film, city conspiracies, sex jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> In addition to the horrific direction, the most prominent actors. I watched this movie and thought: “Is this really Marlon Brando? No, this can not be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) This cannot be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for everyone. (In the end). No, no, no, it can not be Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. Then it was all over, and I was nervous. Very many good, outstanding, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, stupid, terrible movie. I rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in it. They could not get so much money. <br /> <br /> Only an incredible stupid idiotic movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)
