In the name of Pinter, each knee will bow, especially after his speech about the award of the Nobel Prize in literature, which brought nothing more than the sixth form of anti-Americanism, which was canned by numbers, regurgitated. But it is even worse; it is not only a demonstration of lack of talent, an excellent example of how to avoid trouble with your ten-year reputation, but also the slaughter of an excellent figure. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical denomination, and it is easy to see how its central plot will work better on the stage than on the screen, but it still worked terribly well. This is part of Michael Kane's vanity, but let's face it, Kane is not Olivier. Not only could he not fill Larry's shoes, he could not even fill his bathroom slippers. In the end, a properly named Kane is clearly the average actor, whose only real recommendation, like many British actors, is their longevity in business. He was a good Harry Palmer, he played great in “Get Carter”, but that's a lot, mate! Give it a very wide space and stick to the excellent original. This is more polpintera.
