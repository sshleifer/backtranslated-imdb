I have never been a big fan of Mormon films. Being a Mormon, I always felt that humor was too exclusive for the LDS community and made us seem a bunch of obsessed. I was hoping it would be a breath of fresh air, the movie of Hailstorm, which I could finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I figured Since he had talents on the B-list, such as Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), this should be at least a little funny. And besides, church basketball has matured with a lot of funny jokes and the like. But I have to say that throughout the entire film, it seemed that no one knew what they were doing. Every joke was unsuccessful, and every opportunity for a really funny gag was ignored. The dialogue was smooth and the film received the worst character development I have ever seen. Each character, except Wilson, was less than one-dimensional. It’s hard to believe that after nine rewrites the film was still as stunning as the train wreck I witnessed. I cannot express in words the rage that I felt as I experienced it. My friends and I were extras in the final game scene, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, Utah. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I must say that I avoided all contact with him after the show. He waited at the door, seemingly ready for feedback. I could not bring myself to tell him that his film not only tore off the good one and a half hours of my life, but also left an unpleasant, painful scar that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> I had several special problems: there was a small love story plot between the janitor and the plump pianist, but these two characters appeared from nowhere and it was impossible to take care of them, so my friends and I were constantly interested why they should have taken care of these two lame, uninteresting characters. From time to time there were many plots, each of which promised the public a chance to laugh, but each came and went in clouds of smoke, ending before you began to take care. That was pretty much what the whole movie felt. <br /> <br /> This film was a big disappointment, and I feel bad for everyone who expects the first REAL fun Mormon film. True, the jokes in this are not too exceptional for Mormons. On the other hand, it’s hard to say that it was a joke and that there was a loud sensation in my ears. <br /> <br /> Please do NOT watch this movie. Keep in mind the fantasy that this movie is funny. Rid yourself of the frustration I have experienced
