Perhaps, being a former Muscovite and possessing an elastic sense of humor, I can not throw this film into the Arthouse / Shit Festival trashcan. This is not the best movie of 2005, nor is it complete nonsense. He just has a lot of problems. I also sincerely doubt that this film was banned due to any “ideological fears”, or “conservative taboos”, or for any other reason that this film can be called “bold” and “uncompromising” abroad. He was banned because the censors knew that 99% of Russian movie goers would find this offensive because of the bad taste shown during the filming and editing of this boring movie. <br /> <br /> So we have a strong start shot. Beautiful sound design, great room, filled with meaning and symbolism. The use and placement of characters will always be the greatest strengths of the film (not that the number 4 is a complex visual problem). Over the next 40 minutes we will have an equally strong installation. Funny and well-written bar conversation between 3 (main?) Characters, and we feel pathos towards these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and the like. Then the film starts to slow down. We begin to think about what lies ahead. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pretty boring, to put it simply. Of course, the guy in the village is pulling hearts, and there are some funny moments. Good sound, of course. But the pleasure of this film, not to mention the plot, was seriously affected by career problems. And this lack of reward for sitting behind all the (beautifully filmed) disgusting sufferings and gloom is what ultimately makes people angry at “offensive” things (personally, the main scene of insults is bordering on being sweet miserably drunkards can appear miserably. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a fascinating film, where Russians are wasting for a long time (the whole film), see “Peculiarities of the National Hunt”. Much more useful post-Soviet things. So yes, 4 out of 10 by 4 is good and symbolic for my post-mediocre film.
