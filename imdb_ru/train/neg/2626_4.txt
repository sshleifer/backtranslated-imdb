I saw this film a few years ago in the Fast Forward group film festival tradition, where we were going to rent a few B-films and vote for those who chose the worst. <br /> <br /> On the night when we watched this, he was recognized as the best because of the similarity of the plot and funny costumes. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, a silly, kitsch film that needs to be watched with the full understanding that you are watching low-cost down. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... this film will leave its mark on you. <br /> <br /> I had enough of the impression that I was really trying to get my file a copy for several years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you are going to watch bad movies. It's fun, and I remember vigorous music ...
