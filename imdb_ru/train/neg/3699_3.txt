<br /> <br /> One would expect that a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role would be funny. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire film, and it was not even during the final comedy scene (which you can also expect the funniest). This is the one that you can watch when it comes to TV, do not spend money on his rent.
