I could not believe how stupid and pointless it was. In principle, the film has nothing to laugh at, there are hardly any scenes that might interest you in the rest of the film. This film pulled huge stars with it, but they were all wasted, in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must have taken several acting lessons a few years after this film, before he played in The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple and modest. Fortunately, I received this film for a very low price, because it is not a film that needs to be remembered for any valid reason. I will not write anything about the history of the film, but, as you should know, it must be the most famous hitchhiker in America because of her huge thumb. I would give this movie 2/10. Before I watched this film, I was wondering why this film received only 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. Very disappointing movie. Do not buy it, even if you see it for less than $ 5.
