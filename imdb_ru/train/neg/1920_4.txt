I'm not saying that Twisters Night was terrible, but it was far from great. Mediocre at best. It seems to me that every time one type of film comes out, the second one should be about the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Vulcan and Dante's Peak) “Twister Night” is actually just a Twister, except for the worst and with ordinary special effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the actors who starred in it, even if they weren't great, it was the film itself, the direction, the special effects, the whole storyline was too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes hit the city, and mostly a movie about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage. <br /> <br /> I really do not know why it seems that the duplicate films about disasters released almost synchronously with each other, but this one would be better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
