this film was as fun as his cat with his mother and son, who have sex, they are also afraid of little cats. they are set on fire by them. does an alien cat kill a guy by stabbing him in the back with a corncob? they are bulletproof. invisible. and that “no.” The star of the film, Clovis, is the cat of the police, Chlodvig leads the police to find the alien, and after the mother kills the police, Chlodvig kills the mother, eating her head, then she lights up. This movie sucks. more fun than it was scary, not even scary. The girl hits the alien on the head with a camera, he knocks him out. Then she goes and hugs her. Then she grabs her and starts to rape. Again Chlodwig comes to the rescue
