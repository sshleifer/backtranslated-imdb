There is something to appreciate: impressive locations and flight sequences; historical costumes, props and decorations; and literate writing and acting skills. However, to enjoy the drama, we need at least one director who demonstrates some qualities that we can love or delight. In this bunch of crazy snobs, we found only one character who is generally cute ?? the unfortunate soldier in the fleeting peripheral role of his helpless victim. From the reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of step, but we did not find their evil schoolgirl's behavior funny or interesting. Even the dog is disgusting. We added a towel after two of the six episodes, so you should discard these observations accordingly, but what I could find in this mini-series did not give us reason to expect a transformation or redemption of the character.
