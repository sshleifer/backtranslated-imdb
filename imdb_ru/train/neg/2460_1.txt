I really wanted this movie to be liked, but it never gave me a chance. In fact, it was Spinal Tap with a hip-hop theme, but it fails miserably. It seems that it was written and used by schoolchildren for a school project, and this is also a level that humor seems to be aimed at. There is no subtlety in it, and, what is most terrible for ridicule, it never feels like a documentary. And although in the first place these lines are not ridiculous, an attempt to deliver from a dead center would help - of course, everything would be better than a shrill replay to which we are exposed. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who love “comedies” in the spirit of “Big Mom's House” or “Norbit”; People who think that words like “butt” are inherently hysterical. Other people should stay away and not waste their time.
