A very budgetary procedural police film about killer detectives trying to uncover the murder of a woman whose body ends up in a stolen car in Central Park, and the only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although it was released by RKO, it looks like an independent production that the studio chose to distribute. The cast and film crew, with some exceptions - among them the young and uncredited Jack Lord, the director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - consist of completely unknown, and it shows. The performances universally do not meet the standards and will not pass the test in the educational film for high school, the direction is inconstant and unstable, and, as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry between the leading actors. However, despite the many shortcomings of the film, there are a few good points. Shooting in New York and the ultra-low budget of the film give it a unique authenticity, very much like the picture of the superb “Naked City”, decent shooting in a dark basement and some investigative procedures are smart. However, it is worth looking at the seaside areas of New York in the early 1950s, and lovers of old cars will be delighted to see legions of cars from the 30s and 40s on the streets. <Br /> <br />
