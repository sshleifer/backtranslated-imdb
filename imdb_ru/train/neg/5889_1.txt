First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. From the tedious emotional films of the 70s and 80s, films from this place really began to contain a little humor. Imagine .. Actual comedies were made! The films actually began to become fascinating and funny, in contrast to the long, dark, depressive and boring. <br /> <br /> In the 90s and 00s, some really great films were shot by the “new generation” of directors. Film by movie was praised by critics and played a lot of money. This has become the norm! <br /> <br /> United then appeared ... <br /> <br /> * LITTLE SPOILERS * It's just not funny. Never. Never But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we are accustomed to funny Norwegian films. Especially with such an cast with a few really funny comedians. But .. They do not say and do not do anything funny! Where is the humor? Show me the humor! Is that the awkward clerk played by Harald Eyya? Does it replay the completely ridiculously unreal football coach? Are these comments by Arne Scheye? The film is just not funny! <br /> <br /> But this is not my main rant about United. This is precisely predictability. (And it is here that I am afraid that the Norwegian comedies are stumped, as I have seen in many other films.) All the time, you just know that this will end well. All the characters are exactly as presented at the beginning of the film, and everyone gets exactly what they deserve at the end. Absolutely no room for surprises! <br /> <br /> In general, I can say that after watching this movie I had a bad feeling. It was one movie that made me realize that we probably need new blood in the Norwegian film industry ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
