The novelty of Jay Leno's clear four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formal inconsistent caper of police partners. In COLLISION COURSE, a pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen prototype of a turbocharger (think a car lover Leno played a hand on the plot?). The two presenters are trying their best, they really do, but Leno is not an actor, and the Morita routine is aging in a hurry from under the water. The film carries a bit of the silly appeal of the 80s, but its worthy moments are becoming increasingly scarce, as it fills its long 100-minute work time. Fans of Leno's great comedic talents will feel depressed; everyone else will be just bored.
