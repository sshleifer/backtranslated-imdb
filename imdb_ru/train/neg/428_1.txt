Wow, a film about the politics of New York, apparently written by someone who has never stepped into New York. You know that there is a problem when at one moment you expect the rolls to take effect and the film will continue for another half hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous, and the storyline varies between boring and ridiculous. Horrible movie
