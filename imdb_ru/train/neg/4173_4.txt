Man I have to say, when I saw the trailer, I was excited. Futuristic soldiers taking on the bad ass vampires led by the genre of the vet Michael Ironside .... In space. I mean, I didnâ€™t expect high art, but it looked like a potential movie classic. It was, without a doubt, a television pilot, reprinted after some time in a feature film, after it was not filmed. Well, I'll start with a few good moments in the movies, the action was suitable for a movie with a smaller budget, and the CGI and places used were bearable. As for the bad, first, Michael Ironside was in this barley, and his performance here ... well, it was stupid, not in a good way. But, as I said, he was not there anyway, so I cannot blame him. One thing that was really stupid was a band like PETA for Vampires, no, I'm not joking, this is the stupidest, most incredible thing I've seen lately, and they are being taken seriously. Also, this film commits one of the main sins of the B-film, teasing the scene of lesbians and does not deliver. Most of all that sinks in this film, in fact, nothing happens. Since he was supposed to be a pilot, the script is practically non-existent and does not have a regular ending. Even the main villains only come to an end. If ever a movie was needed to raise the factor of Sleaze and blood, this is Vampire Wars. In conclusion, I will say that the main team on the spacecraft were all very capable actors and could easily leave behind this mess and move on to more significant and better things. They simply have nothing to work here.
