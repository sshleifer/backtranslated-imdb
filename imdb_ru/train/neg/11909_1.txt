I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time: Dark Light. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film - Lilith was the first wife of Adam, and she was considered imperfect and expelled from the Garden of Eden, because she considered herself Adam. equal and refused to obey him. See, I took these words straight from the script. Then the film continues, and although she is the heroine of the film, the only time when she becomes acceptable is when she does what men tell her! She finishes the film under the control of The Faith - the entire male group! <br /> <br /> In addition, the script was predictable, and the effects were terrible. In addition to the obvious hatred of women, which is usually much thinner in a modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight.
