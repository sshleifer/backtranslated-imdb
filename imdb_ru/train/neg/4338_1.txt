really terrible ... the lead actor did everything well ... the film, the plot, etc., were completely crappy and inaccurate, it could have been a continuation of well ... everything that had little or no relation to Carlitos' Path. .. and should be avoided, like the plague, by the lovers of Carlito ... there is no mention of Gail, in fact he ends up with some other bird, does not mention Klienfelt, does not mention how he was caught, does not mention how he ended up in prison . ... they tried to make it look like the original with flashbacks in the beginning ... but, to be honest, while evaluating it, I was looking for a zero mark ... unfortunately, I had to rate it higher ... <br /> <br / > This is a terrible attempt to make money on what was one of the best films of the 90s ... in general, it was about 6 pounds sterling, and 2 hours of my life was wasted ... on all the "action" in it, it it was really boring slowly and predictably ... again, so that Carltio's Way fans could avoid this fiasco ...
