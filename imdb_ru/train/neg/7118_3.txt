I could not say whether Screaming Skull tried to be Hitchcock’s robber or Edgar Allen Poe’s modernized tribute. Nowadays, someone would cut him a little and present him as one of those television anthological episodes from the old Tales from the Dark Side ... but only after extensive correspondence. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that there seems to be a good, unpleasant little story trying to get out of the wreckage of this film, and the actors obviously do their best, both with their talent and with the material. with whom they have to work. But the director simply did not know how to set or act out dramatic scenes; special effects simply did not work; the script telegraphed its emaciated plot points so clearly that the bivalve could see them approaching; and the soundtrack continued to play German music "oompah band" when it was supposed to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they tried very hard. But this is of interest only as historical material. I suppose that someone very young, who did not see much anxiety or horror, could receive a Screaming Skull charge, but one who is young probably will not get much of the subtext or plot motivation. (“Mom, why is this nice man trying to scare a pervert cat?”)
