The first thing I noticed in this film, of course, was an unnecessary amount of nudity. This is not melting nudity or anything else, but a lot of things were not needed. Annik Borel plays an agitated woman, believing that her ghost families tell her that her ancestor, who terribly resembles her, was a werewolf and believes that their fate is doomed to the same thing. Which in fact I found quite interesting. Initially, The Wolfman was conceived as a completely psychological film, but Universal added a real Wolfman, which you should never have seen for a dollar or two. I find this concept of someone not very interesting werewolf. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we know that she is not a werewolf from the very beginning, so there is no thrill here, and they are trying to make the film as it really was. scenario. They also fail by adding one or two parts of the film, citing the fact that this is reality. At first I was excited to read the description of the film. But I gradually realized that it was a cover so that they could show the main characters ’breasts as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annick Borel is either a decent actor who plays an excellent psychotic role, or a really bad actor who plays a psychotic role. Since Dannile’s character has no brains and he’s just a psycho who runs madly, snarling and clicking like a wolf, little skill is required to play. She has moments when her performance breaks through at a terrible moment, but quickly collapses due to poor camera performance and light. The idea is excellent, but terribly executed throughout the entire film. 3/10
