I am acting A.S.L. The student was forced to watch this film in class, and what I understood was this blatant prejudice in the film. The film is clearly leaning towards the P.O.V. "total deaf perception" they are not average. In addition, the film does not mention and does not take into account other situations that are also discussed in this topic. I.E. Deaf People who were born hearing and later became deaf Is it right or wrong in this case? The film is biased and almost the entire opinion of the deaf with a capital "D". Not that this is bad, but in order for it to be a real documentary, you need to try to be a little unbiased.
