Despite the acclaim on the cover of the DVD version I borrowed, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is much more realistic than other war films of that period to portray the dirt, boredom and frustration of grunts, but, unfortunately, it leaves this, thinking that this is ALL for this film. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. The point is not that a good war movie should have a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best films of World War II, Twelve Hours High, has very little action. But this compensates for the crackling dialogue and psychological stress. The exception to the "History of GI. Joe is a short battle segment (called the "besieged city" on DVD) that takes place in Italy. Admittedly, this is one of the most dynamic and compelling battle scenes of any military film. But alas, the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight. Another shutdown is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is supposed to be Romeo, but goes crazy with a pervert. On the contrary, the sergeant. Varnitsky is a sympathetic, albeit flawed person. As he says to Captain Walker (Mitchum), preparing for the next patrol: "Every step forward is a step closer ... to the house." But this last step ?? one patrol too much ?? driving him crazy. It is a pity that the rest of the film does not do justice to some other subtle touches. As for the image of Meredith Pyle ... it's practically in a coma.
