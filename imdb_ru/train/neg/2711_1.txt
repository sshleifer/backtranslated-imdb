Even if you could give up the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s (well, Katie did not join the Manson family, and no one died in Altamont), this film was still incredibly awful. I got the impression that the “writers” simply locked themselves in the room and watched “Forrest Gump”, “The Wonders of the Year” and the films of Oliver Stone of the 60s again and again and called it a study. A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "dizziness." He was right.
