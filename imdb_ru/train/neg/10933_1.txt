Drop all the stereotypes and distortions you heard about half-devout Mormons, and you will see that they all played a major role in this ridiculous excuse for the film. Finally, Kurt Haleâ€™s condition has changed (thank God), and I hope it will take a long time before we see any of his features in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was amateur (I think they used a video camera for some of the basketball scenes). The plot was soft and very funny. You really don't understand why someone did something. As if I had sand in my eyes, and I had a 300-pound lady on my face, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give a negative rating to this film was that the scale would not allow me.
