This movie is terrible. I was really looking forward to it, because I thought that Lantana was great. <br /> <br /> The following review may contain * spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First of all, good things: it looks great, some performances in okay Bad stuff is all the rest. <br /> <br /> The story, as you may know, about some guys who catch fish and discover the body, with the turn that they find it on Friday, but continue to fish and finally report it in Sunday when they return. on mobile (mobile phones). However, the film takes its time (boy it takes time) to get to this central event. <br /> <br /> From the ensemble of characters (about a dozen), neither is similar to the other (that is, I think they are consistent, because they are all unpleasant). I was extremely disappointed with the inability to adequately explain how the characters are connected, and only at the end of the film I could dimly build a family tree. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to come up with a film that is relentlessly gloomy for us, which is a failure in the structure of the story, because the character’s life before fishing seems just as bad as after. Once you set the bar so high, it is difficult to climb - except for those who commit suicide. <br /> <br /> There are stupid mistakes in logic. The killer dumps the body into the lake, and then he somehow drifts a few miles upstream into the mountains. Fishermen go out on Sunday morning, but for some reason, Byrne returns home late at night after his wife went to bed. Then the first thing next morning, the police would knock on the door so that he would go down to the station. Um, have they heard about the phone? Downstairs at the station, the media knows the whole story, less than 24 hours after they reported the corpse? <br /> <br /> In this story, there is a total lack of debate, which the guys probably had after they found the corpse. This is a mystery - everyone asks them "how could you do this?" and the audience asks the same question. (The argument about what to do with the body is the key scene in “Liberation”). I know exactly what I will do in their situation. Someone must go to the car, drive up to the mobile test site, call the police, wait, and they will send them back to the place. If others are waiting in the camp and fishing, who cares? <br /> <br /> Much of this seems false. The only thing that sounded believable was that, since the girl was black, the local aborigines jumped at the actions of the fishermen as racists - “they wouldn’t do that if it were a white girl”. <br /> <br /> Everywhere there is a curious indifference to who could kill a girl (I think that the subject is mentioned once), and there is no mystery, as the audience sees the killer in the debut scene. /> <br /> Therefore, I sit there at the same time boring and confused when a turnaround takes place - not in the plot, but in the subject. Suddenly we are talking about the quiet dignity of the dead Aborigines, leading to the ridiculous ending of some incoherent information about black and white reconciliation. BUT? <br /> <br /> This is an Australian film "in all its glory", according to The Age.
