... and by no means as pure, logical and understandable as on this miserable amount of tired Hollywood stamps. <br /> <br /> I’m 27 years old and I’ve spent 16 years struggling with delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character in the film, I succeeded mainly due to logic: because I kept thinking again and again to keep the illusion away from reality and to know what is really happening and what is not. In the end, I was really successful with drugs, by the way, but I certainly avoided madness, because I knew that before I took the drugs, there was a difference between what was real and what was not. <br /> <br /> So, I feel free to tell you that this film is a total fraud. He not only deceives the story of the protagonist (who was not faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but basically he shows a comforting, tamed look at schizophrenia - which is completely overlooked. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a mental structure, not a disease. The schizophrenic is * not * a “normal person with a disease”, but one who from the very beginning perceives and feels things differently than most people: for him things like time, space and the personality of people are not solid things. He feels that he can be bent, he can change, he can mutate, and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, the schizophrenic has a rich, very creative inner world that “normal” people do not expect — but he is trapped in it, because he cannot communicate with most people, and his world becomes poorer and poorer until he ends in an empty, deceptive impasse. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is depicted in this ridiculous “cure” tearing movie tears. It must be scary scary. People, besides the main character, must seem strange, strange and absurd, as, for example, in Lynch's Eraser. There must be * really * impressive, strange, crude hallucinations, because that is schizophrenia. This is not about * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean watch "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read PK Dick "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik" SHOULD watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or play "Alice American McGee's" on the PC and you can have a vague idea of ​​what It's like, Don't watch the movie “Feel good” of the month with banal situations, crossed out characters and visual effects and silly tricks. “The Cell” is the most accurate film about the mind of a schizophrenic, his visions and his internal sequence — it is cruel, strange, tangled and very, very scary. <br /> <br /> Again schizophrenia is not about the details, it is not an elegant, tamed trick. He jumps on your face and does not let go of you: the walls are crumbling, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel that you are leaving back in time, you are not sure that you are what you think you are, everything feels. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, it is much more than what is depicted in this soapy tune
