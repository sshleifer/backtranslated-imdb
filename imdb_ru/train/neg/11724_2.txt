I once used the name Wesley Snipes as a clue to watch a movie in which he appears. So now my method of recommending the Snipe Method film failed for the first time. Through. I had to come here first to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed of his vain efforts to be wasted in the “Contractor”. <br /> <br /> One of my worst fears about the film came to a bitter result. I was afraid that the wobbly, vague, pseudo-documented, "thoughtless" style of directing and editing (first introduced to my attention by the director Paul Greengrass "Bloody Sunday") could spread to other films. The disgusting style of Greengass was then brought to disgustingly new heights in the last two films of the Bourne trilogy. My fear came true. In my opinion, these films are made really bad with the help of these causative methods that mistakenly take blurred movements as “reinforcing action”. But Bourne Franchise, as a loving Greengrass calls its cash cow, clearly convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessionally in a quest for quick, big money. <br /> <br /> Read my mouth, you Hollywood types. The action should be clearly photographed and presented, and not just hints of bad, lazy cinematic methods. <br /> <br /> And the Contractor goes so far as to imitate the Bourne Ultimatum in insanely repetitive sound bites. In the hope that their young (obviously appreciated) audience will not be able to feel them. For example, if I hear once again how the police radio crackles Yank-Romeo, I’ll just scream. Most likely, I will not hear any more: I will never look at the Contractor again. <br /> <br /> I recommend to those of you who have not yet seen the “Contractor”: just be satisfied with the peace of mind that this flaw gives your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I feel like lowering it to 1.
