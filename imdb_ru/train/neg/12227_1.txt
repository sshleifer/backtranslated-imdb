It may be the worst movie ever made, and perhaps worth seeing just for this reason. Streisand is incredibly incredible as a young woman posing as a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is painful, with the image of Barbara, emitting the sounds of the faintest chatter ever filmed. And do not even get me to the plot. In fact, you will get more laughter from this film than from many comedies, because itâ€™s awful awful. Streisand's rampant ego, thinking that she could somehow raise this bitch to the heights of Oscar, led to this catastrophe. I am sure that the writer, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this film and never forgave Streisand. I can't blame him. This movie is like a two-hour slowdown in a car accident when the Sound of Music soundtrack is played backwards on an old player. This is really so bad. I am amazed that someone from Streisand liked this film at the level he hoped for.
