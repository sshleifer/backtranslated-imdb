In this film, tons of beautiful women. But, alas, in this film there are no naked people. Grrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Um. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then what the hell are the main characters driving the Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this film was released in stereoscopic 3D. And this is the most disgusting effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure that someone could not cope with this work, but there was no 3D, just double vision. I did not have the same problem with other 3D films of this company, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Of course, 3D sucks in them too, but with them I see the appearance of a 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is a big ball out of nothing. <br /> <br /> And whoever it is of a woman who played the daughter of a lady who eats ears, yum! I would like to see more of her. In the cinema too. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
