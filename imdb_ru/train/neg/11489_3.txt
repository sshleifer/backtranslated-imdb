In the US, very few films about Rome were made that were not made in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. Hollywood epics about swords and sandals mainly have a Christian theme, making it difficult to penetrate earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and faced some resistance in Hollywood because Jesus was not in it). /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the times of Caesar and Christ, but was also established when Rome was the only city among many on the Italian peninsula and had just ousted the hated king. Tarquin and formed the Republic. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical film; it is peplum, and although production values ​​do not reach the limit, the effect and characteristics are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue looked like in Italian, but with wooden English dubbing it is very polite. At first I laughed a little at it. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many films of this genre, having missed most of the films about Hercules of the 60s. This is somewhat funny, but with the continuation of the film it becomes somewhat boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: if I had watched this film when I was ten years old, I would love It. At this age, I went for anything with the Romans and sword fighting. So at least this film brought back some childhood memories.
