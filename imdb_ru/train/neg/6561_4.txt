The initial sequence is supposed to show how the Legion arrives in Paris on November 13, 1918. Troops are dropped from the train - in the form in which the French army, including the Legion, went to war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the war movie you are about to see will be a turkey. (By 1915, the French army realized that it was impossible to enter the war in red pants and dark blue coats. The capital's French troops were brought into the "blue horizon", and the colonial troops in khaki.) the remake at least got the shape more or less correct. In fact, itâ€™s very bad when directors make these kind of mistakes, when they do their best to make things right.
