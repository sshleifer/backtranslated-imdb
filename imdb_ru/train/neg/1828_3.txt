Two days ago, I watched Envy on a DVD at a friendâ€™s house. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but she completely fails. I watched it with five friends, and no one laughed at the whole movie. Jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT funny in any way ... the plotline is crap and they never answer the question ... WHERE DOES SH * T? Of course, the answer to this question is NO ONE CARE. This film lacks any comedic value, and as some other users have said, the only thing that makes it almost worth seeing is Christopher Walken in the role of Jay Man. None of the characters are designed, the plots are so thin that they are almost transparent - and this song should be funny throughout the entire movie ??
