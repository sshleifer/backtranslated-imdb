A VERY boring, obvious, tedious plagiarism of an exorcist with a red-eyed Doberman is the degree of special effects in this cheap mini-game. Richard Crenna is as alive as a chewing toy. Very 70s dress and music only add to the torture. I must put you to sleep almost as quickly as the “Corpse Disappears” or “Blue Hand”. Virtually nothing. MooCow says what a stinky dog ​​that is! : = 8P
