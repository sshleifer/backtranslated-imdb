I really liked Margaret Atwood's novel The Robber's Bride, and I was very happy to see that there was a version of the film. A woman exposes a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his boyfriend, a former journalist, tries to clear his name by checking out the dead woman's crazy girlfriends. Fortunately, the script of the film corrects Miss Atwood's awkward conspiracies, focusing on the stories of these two men, victims of intriguing women ... <br /> <br /> Heh. Well, you understand me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I’m almost sure that they are completely made for the film, I will remove the dusty cover of my hardcover copy. Apparently, the three main characters in the novel are not enough to tear down the film. Zenia’s manipulations are uninteresting if we don’t see that they happen to a man and the life of a person is ruined. Rose, Haris and Tony tell their stories to the man. Because it does not matter if a man does not hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them being pushed aside for men's history. I usually do not watch feminist views on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as it is. If I had not read the book, I would have enjoyed the movie much more. So, if you like a cop and a former cop, and you want to know more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy the juicy prose and characteristics, thinly layered on the plot. This is the same plot: the film dug it up, stroked it and sprayed it with a man. This is like the revenge of Zenia Margaret Atwood.
