I know I’ve already added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I’m not some kind of old fog from the Baby Boom generation that grew up on a flickering b / w image of Phil Silvers , Jackie Gleason, etc. <br /> <br /> Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born, but I had the pleasure of discovering that Phil Silver Bilko was kindly provided by BBC2. I wonder if I will enjoy the parody of Steve Martin, if I hadn’t seen or heard about Phil Silvers - I don’t know - maybe I would. <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers who consider this film worth 10 'admit that they did not see the original. I can only convince you to spend 21 minutes of my life watching one episode. If after watching the original film “Ernie”, “Colonel Hall”, “Ritzig and Emma”, “Duane Doberman”, “Henshaw”, “Dino”, “Flashman”, “Zimmerman”, “Mallin and others”) still think that the Steve Martin film is above “2” - I can take you a pint ....
