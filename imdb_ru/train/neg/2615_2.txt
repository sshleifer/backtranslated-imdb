I do not know why, but for some sore reason, I think that since I was at the height of the Disney sequel, I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmatia. The first film, which was a remake of the Disney cartoon with Glenn Close in the lead role in the role of Cruella de Ville, seemed like a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these films do not work is that 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more attractive to both children and adults. It wasn't really fun, because adults run around trying to act like cartoons, not just people, I understand that they are trying to make sure the children like it, but it's funny to see how these actors behave in film. And the story of 102 Dalmations is actually not so good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Ville has been in prison for some time, but everything changes when she is shown that she now loves animals and is a pleasant person. But her reputation is now spoiled as a navel puppy, but she buys shelter for men and suddenly becomes loved by everyone, and it looks like she has changed. But when she sees the Dalmatians of her probation officer, she goes crazy and starts to see spots, and she loses it. She returned to take revenge on the puppies, and is still determined to get exactly the clothes of Dalmatia, which she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is such an amazing actress, very underestimated, but she starred in Cruella de Ville, she is good, but let's face it, this movie made a funny villain a stupid thing. In addition, no matter how cute the puppies are, it just works more for animation, it sounds silly, but it’s not so believable without a cartoon and their characters. I would not recommend 102 Dalmations, this is normal, but if you agree that the first film was just a waste of time, it’s the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
