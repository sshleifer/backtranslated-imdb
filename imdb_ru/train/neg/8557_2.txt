I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its frankness ?? pubic haircut and masturbation, especially from presenter / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show truth in everyday "personal" events. Unfortunately, the film falls under the Brown Rabbit sphere, although with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it reflects the "Rabbit", in which nothing happens, or too many cinematographic frames focused (or genuinely not focused) on absolutely nothing ?? legs, arms, or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can understand why this film was released and why people shoot: real sex scenes from life and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. Besides that, it was a waste of time. We quickly learn about a couple of roommates, consisting of men and women, in which a man has obvious feelings for a woman who treats him as just a friend, constantly having sex with her ex-boyfriend. In addition, we are subject to the everyday events of their boring life: she works for her parents; he is working on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For all this to work, the dialogue must be interesting and valid. None of them work, and it's as boring as watching someone ride for an hour, that is, the Brown Rabbit. The only outstanding actor is Kate Winterich, and even she plays a dubious role. (The extra DVD with her in front of the microphone is really worth watching / listening to.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Svanberg, because he reveals all this and is not afraid to expose himself or his habits, but overall the film falls flat He has narrations that do not fit into the scenes, too many boring everyday events and inconclusive acting that you are surprised, besides the soft porn factor, why you rented it.
