This is a terrible movie. All three stories are bracketed by the hypnotist-psychiatrist, which is not necessary, and all the stories are bad. The first concerns wild wolves and some woman, there are things that have no meaning, but hypnotism compensates for this. The second, with bad Bill Paxton as a crazy roommate, should not be seen by anyone. The latter, unfortunately, the best one is almost incomprehensible, which, I think, makes it better than other garbage.
