First of all, I have to say that I liked the book Animal Farm. I read it with my ninth grade and it was great. We also decided that watching a movie would be useful. The film was very disappointing for me. The film excludes some characters and misses many highlights of the book. He misses a lot and explains nothing in detail. If someone watched this movie without first reading the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this film for me was the final. The end of the book was the strongest, and in the film they changed it! It was supposed that they were pigs and people in the alliance and something like “melting” together, but instead the film gave the impression that animals are going to rebel against pigs. To summarize, I do not think that this film captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.
