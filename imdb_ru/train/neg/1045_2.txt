Victor Vargas's upbringing fails in what he tries most: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality in this movie. Characters and situations seem completely artificial and fake. <br /> <br /> Reason? Bad Direction Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett read somewhere that the lack of coverage of his film would give him a genuine feeling. Wrong! It only gives him a bad feeling. Similarly, the shaking of the camera does not create a documentary style for your film; it simply causes a headache in the viewer and distracts from what is on the screen, rather than reinforcing it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what’s on the screen is so painfully fake, as if Mr. Sollett had written his script for the sole purpose of trying to show the “hip” to his friends in the Sundance and show how “sharp " producer. <br /> <br /> Overall, the only lasting impression this film leaves you is that the poor director is Mr. Sollett. Next time, how about taking a few writing and directing classes?
