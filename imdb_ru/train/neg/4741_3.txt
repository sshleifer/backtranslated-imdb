Wendy Wu: The Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong plot, but it is spoiled by dark movie details. I am a younger teenager and I didnâ€™t really like this movie. I thought the consequences were terrible, but they might seem interesting to young children. The matrix of the movements spoiled the action, you know that it was absolutely fake. Then there was Yen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and a return to his homeland, in which Wendy sought to win. It all ends, as in a typical good movie, when Wendy and her Buddhist monk's cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever). So, Wendy learns a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I am ready for the next DCOM.
