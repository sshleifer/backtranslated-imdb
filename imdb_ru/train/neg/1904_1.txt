=== minor spoilers === <br /> <br /> I, like many others, are a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging in the front, and the trailer approaching MI: 2, the expectations grew. Production by Jerry Bruckheimer. Big cars. Nick Cage and Fresh from Oscar - Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? Lot. <br /> <br /> The script is neither amusing (which he tries very hard), nor exciting. You add a black man who constantly jokes about himself and racist jokes! do you have a comedy I do not think so. Excitement completely off-screen. First of all (and this is probably said many times), there are no sympathetic characters, so who cares who will be killed? If you can understand that the psyche will kill Brother Nick, if he doesn’t steal 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) walks Nick through the streets again. Is it excitement? Don't think. Then comes the best bit - the romance between Nick and Angelina. She actually looks bored when she says all those stupid lines to Nick. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' “Do you see anyone?” “What went wrong?” and so on. <br /> <br /> Then there is only one hope: the car is chasing. They are disappointing, to say the least, because the trailer looked as if they were full, and there is only one. Very long, entangled in the annoying restless movement of the camera. I did have problems with this. <br /> <br /> Is this an action movie? thriller? romantic comedy? - no need to decide, just avoid this terrible mess. I will give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel that I am generous.
