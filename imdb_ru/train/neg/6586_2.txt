If you value a renaissance in Asian horror, do not worry about Gavi. The film hardly deserves mention along with the work of the A-list, such as Ringu, The Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even with such good material as The Eye or Inner Senses). These films are full of subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters and a clearly non-Western look at what scares. Gavi is strung on the remaining limbs and organs of everything that has caused lousy in American horror for the last twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> The film is trying to mix the Asian ghost story and the Hollywood slasher, but it doesn't fit well. One aesthetics must strangle the other; guess what? Not having his own story to tell the filmmakers that they are pillaging the Ring for the plot with the evil child, but the situation is hopeless. Cliches, shitty characters, silly conspiracies, dull ghost, ho-hum.
