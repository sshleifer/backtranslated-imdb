We are not in a fairy tale about a naked emperor. We can recognize the truth about what we see, without being stupid, recognize that this show in many aspects is simply incomprehensible and that it is clear that most of it was created from pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> <Well, obviously, many people like such things. I do not. I prefer well thought out and scheduled shows. And I also confess that the show is very serious for my taste and boring ... these are stories about love and drugs ... There are so many exciting soaps with a lot of waiting (for example, Dallas), but Twin Peaks can't catch my attention. I donâ€™t care about these people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
