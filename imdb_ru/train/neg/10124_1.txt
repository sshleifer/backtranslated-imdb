in this series there is no waiting! When one episode ends, the acting is so bad, the effects are so bad, and the script is so terrible that the last thing you think about is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, actually, the last thing on your mind is to watch the next episode! This show is so boring that I can't understand how it came out, let alone to be released on DVD! Obviously, the effects do not correspond to the modern movies of Batman, but even the script is terrible. I'm not quite sure that the rambling chatter about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that, because it's too awful to follow. Look at the version of the 60s, or the version of the 90s, or even Batman, just something over this version!
