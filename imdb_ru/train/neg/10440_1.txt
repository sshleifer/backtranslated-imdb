If you are not between the ages of 10 and 14 (with the exception of the R rating), there are very few things that you like. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Kohner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson with a sense of humor, and Julianne Margulis is as good as she can see her surroundings, but unfortunately, that's all. Bad plot. Bad game. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are grim. Since the whole situation is a strange and terrible joke, significant individual embedded situations are equally terrible. If we look at parts of action, then in some films there are incredible sequences of actions that make you dizzy, and there are those that make you moan. This film only contains the latest look. That leaves little left. I'm so glad I didn't pay for it. <br /> <br /> Despite some sort of hype, I can read and think, so when I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I was a little worried about entering them. But, like a train wreck, you can't just look away. And even without expectations they let me down. Bad. Not even "so bad, it's good" stuff. I am very tolerant of bad movies, but this makes Oscar worthy of the “Six-String Samurai” (which I liked). <br /> <br /> No, this piece of CGI garbage is in the same company as Battlefield Land, Little Man and Gigli. The way it is currently rated at 7.2 confuses me completely. Brainwashing or somehow putting together a voting system is all that I can consider answers. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that I witnessed a train crash tonight. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
