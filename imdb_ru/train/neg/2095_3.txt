Battlestar Gallactica was so gorgeous because she had a dense writing, great appearance, great actors and interesting stories ... And yes, hot men and women ran in uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just a lazy Lazy letter. Actors smoke storm to give them a "character." Sequences in the open air, which destroy the feeling that you are somewhere else (yes, this is a Ford Focus sitting in the background). Lots and lots of teenage fear. Many revolving nude women (but in the background. I'm sure they will be cut out for this series), as well as the symbolic look of some men in towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker drew my attention at all. For an hour and a half, I still wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> So what exactly should get me back? Science fiction? This is terribly easy. Actors? In addition to the beautiful turn of Polly Walker, there are not so many interesting things here. The cast is not even "beauties", except, perhaps, Esai, although for the younger set he is quite old, since he is over 25 years old. <br /> <br /> I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and, unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict a very short series for this series, unless they sharpen their pencils in SciFi and start doing it more than OK on another planet.
