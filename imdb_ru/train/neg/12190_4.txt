One of the worst scorsese. Average thriller; The only thing that can be recommended is De Niro, playing psycho. The finale, as a rule, refers to this genre, i.e. Excessively, with another almost invincible, invulnerable for the pain of the villain. I did not like the original of the 60s, and this version did not greatly improve it. I have no idea why Scorsese spent his time on a remake. Again, considering how bad his recent films were (I mean his boring Buddhist film and all with his new favorite actress, blonde Di Caprio), this is not so bad compared to that. And considering that Spielberg wanted to do a remake ... it could be a lot worse.
