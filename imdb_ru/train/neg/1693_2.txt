My husband and I went to watch this movie, being lovers of horror films that we are. Two hours later, I found that I wanted to get my money and time. I was so disappointed. Teasers for this film basically contained the best moments of the film. There was nothing terrible in the film, except for a good timing for unexpected inputs, etc. I found that most of the “scary” parts are more comical than anything else. After watching other films based on Japanese writers, I must conclude that what is considered frightening in Japan is not that frightening here in the USA. My advice: if you're a fan of real horror movies, save yourself the pain by experiencing this movie. I can not say that I would recommend to rent it if you do not have a free rental.
