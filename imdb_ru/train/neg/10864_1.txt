The reason I was going to give this film a chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and, I hope, appreciate Indian cinema. Everything I've ever seen, there were a few old films about S. Ray. <br /> <br /> Looking through IMDb, I came across this, and, after reviewing the rating of 8.7, I came to the conclusion that this should be what opens the doors of the unknown. and bring artistic pleasure. Oh, how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this 8.7 rating is that the majority of the 970 voters were Indians, and Adam Sandlerâ€™s films were their only way out of the production of Bolliwood. <br /> <br /> With this rating, this movie would take 9th place on IMDb. List of 250 best films above Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I'm really not in the mood to review and criticize, because I just can not remember anything from this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindus who, like me, find this film as it is - just stupid, with an abundance of kitsch and stupid music.
