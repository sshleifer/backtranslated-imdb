For me, this is a little first time when I first became disillusioned with the Tim Burton film. POTA is not a bad movie (magnificent scenery, costumes and unusual magnificent performances), but any ready Hollywood director could make it. The move was very strange, the last third was spent waiting for the end of the film, alone and in the cast. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film. Come back Tim.
