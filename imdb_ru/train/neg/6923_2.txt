Absolutely terrible Mexican film, presumably based on Edgar Allan Poe’s short story about a journalist wanting to penetrate the shelter hidden in the forest to write a story about how it works, and so on. When our hero, Gaston, Given Dr. Maillard's grand show, the head of the asylum, we see all sorts of things that are supposed to be terrible, for example, people hang around for a long time in a dungeon, and comedy, such as our hero, who is joking by soldiers as he descends the stairs hanging over the building . Then there is one spectacle that could be one and the other: a man dressed like a hen, yes, it is like a hen that pecks the ground on chicken feed. The scene was supposed to be a comedic highlight of the film, but at least for me, it was the lowest point of the film, and it was really the most disgusting when you consider that adult men and women thought it might even be fun. Oh! This is indeed the true horror of Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And that brings me to this outstanding fact about the film, which is that most films that undergo multiple name changes usually have some serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have problems with distribution, while others, of which this one, have numerous name changes, so that someone may be unaware of buying the same garbage more than once. This is definitely bullshit. This is very little for this. The only performer worth paying attention to is Claudio Brooke, as the head of the asylum. He is one huge piece of ham, he maniacally laughs, gives orders, tosses with a sword in his hand and praises the chicken. I am so tired of hearing him speak of the “soothing system” as a way to treat the mentally ill. What a bunch of absurdities (Hey, such a film with a script like this one deserves this kind of word). You will not need much time to understand what is happening in the shelter, and it will not be more interesting. Cinematic chicken scratch!
