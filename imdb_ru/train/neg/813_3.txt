The biggest thing that fucking annoys me is that they say that Zues accepts DUTCH commands. But she speaks German with him. These two volumes are completely different, just the same as saying “well, that he accepts French teams” and start speaking Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi is more like a comedian, not a detective. The role simply does not suit him, even if she becomes a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotypical / predictable things. Typical comments or feedback. <br /> <br /> If you don’t look at these things, I think this is a good movie to watch if it is ever shown on TV. But I would not offer it for rent.
