The first half hour of this movie I liked. Watching the obvious romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was pleasant, and I wanted to see the inevitable between them. However, as soon as the action switched to Ingrid's fianc√©, everything fell apart completely. Instead of romance and charm, we see painfully parallel heroes who destroy the film appear. The boorish son of the groom and the military attache, who fought for the attention of the maid, looked silly - something like a plot from the old episode "The Boat of Love". As the charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give way to ease, I do not understand. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to repeat the success he achieved in the Rules of the Game, because the film is very similar as soon as the action turns into a manor (as in another film). I was not a big fan of the RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN made me appreciate the artistry and nuances of the original film.
