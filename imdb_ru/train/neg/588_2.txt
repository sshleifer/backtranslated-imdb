I’m forced to write a review of this IMAX feature to warn others to save you money. Virtually any episode of Desmond Morris's “The Human Animal” or David Suzuki’s “Nature of Things” could surpass the material presented. Not only can a director not use an incredible IMAX film from 65 to 70 mm and a giant presentation screen, everything on the screen is extremely impressive, given the availability of such programming mentioned earlier. Viewers are introduced to pregnant Heather, her husband Buster, as well as their niece and nephew. We watch them endlessly for more than forty minutes while they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive tract and learn about the natural reflexes of children's diving, do we really learn something more most elementary school graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the transatlantic Heather? Do we care? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see the IMAX function, I suggest a beautifully photographed “India: The Kingdom of the Tiger” or the technically exciting “Space Station 3D”. Trust me.
