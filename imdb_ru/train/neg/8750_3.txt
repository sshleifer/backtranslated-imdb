Aldolfo (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring director, lives in a broken apartment in New York and relies on his mother to help make rent. He has a wonderful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals), who may or may not be married, but who Aldolfo would like to star in his film. When Al suddenly gets a financial promise to finance his film from a stranger named Joe, he thinks heâ€™s done it. That is, until Joe takes Al on an adventure to steal Porsche for financial support. Will the film be shot before Aldolfo has no moral foundation? And will Angelica be the star in the film? This, according to the viewer, is a terrible movie. The script is terrible, with a plot that wanders involuntarily. Beals actually roars all of her lines, and Bushemi, though cute, is indescribable. There are a lot of unpleasant material and unpleasant characters. Finally, the production figures are also very bad, which makes the film all the time second. If you have time, a good idea is not to risk this movie. But, if you are a notorious glutton for punishment, go ahead and watch the damned thing. Beals looks beautiful in the end.
