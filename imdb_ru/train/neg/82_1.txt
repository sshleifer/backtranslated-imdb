This movie sucks. It really was a waste of my life. The game was fierce, the plot is absolutely implausible. In short, these people are “intimidated” by this pitiful “crazy killer”, but they cannot fight back. And this is after they take the raft, without equipment, and appear at the campsite, which is already assembled and completely filled with food, clothes and daughters' headphones. In addition, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they are stuck in the forest, but then each other’s daughter just appears, and they obviously never think they can just jump out of the forest like him to of them. As I said, this movie sucks. Complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend persuade you to watch it.
