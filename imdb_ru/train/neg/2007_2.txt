The cast is fine. The script is sometimes awkward, and it takes time to understand the essence of the film. I found myself looking forward to washing dishes. Bit Shekhana is a stupid statement about war. I guess we should have missed it ... we did. This is the house you just killed forty-five minutes. Shower part ... huh? What is it about? Literally, I have a client, "Well, you can use our shower." Yon Angles try their best. There were many forests that suddenly disappeared, because you can see through them, then they became deep and the animals died. In the end, it's a horrible movie of a boring scale.
