SCHIZOPHRENIAC: WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you put together a group of talentless people to make an “extreme” horror movie. Any acting game, producer, storyline, FX, etc ... go out of the window, trying to create "shock value." Don't get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of “shock” films, and the better, the nicer / prettier / nasty, but still nice to see SOME talents of SOMEONE participating in the film. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicles the life of Harry Rousseau, a drug addict who is ordered to kill from the dummy of his ventriloquist, Rubberneck. He kills prostitutes and other random people several times and screams how much he hates "whoo" (these are "whores" for those of you who don't speak New York ...) and how he wants to rape them ass There are some weak necrophilia scenes, very little blood and nudity to confuse things a little - but nothing that you have not seen in the best film ... <br /> <br /> The only redemptive thing I can find in this backward the movie is often (unintentionally?) funny screams from our main man, Harry. He constantly talks about wanting to kill everyone and do it in the ass, and after a while it really becomes quite comical. In fact, I am almost tempted to believe that there must be some kind of homo-erotic subtext in this film, with all the asses and the constant shots of Harry running with the dong. Honestly, this prankster in this film is more clumsy than a few chickens who show some T-and-A (and some completely frontal, for good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is a bit funny as a disposable watch, but I can only recommend it to those who want to say that they watched a movie called SIZIZHHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the name is definitely the best thing in this garbage ... Generous 3.5 / 10
