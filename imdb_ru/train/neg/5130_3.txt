Jane Garofalo was very unhappy with this film, calling it, among other things, anti-feminist. She also said in her radio show that she hates doing "romantic comedies" because she does not believe in them. I sincerely agree with Janeane here. This film is trivial at best. She tries her best, but overall it was just another boring, incredible “romantic comedy” that has no reason in the real world. While there are people who say “suspend your disbelief,” everyone gets tired of having to suspend it almost every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood. Jane's character, for some reason, is usually shot in shadow and darkness, which makes her unattractive, while Uma’s character is shot in lighter tones (which probably caused Jane’s displeasure and which she hates this movie). It really hurts the film if we want to buy the premise that Jane should be the best. As many have said here and in other comments, Jane is not ugly, but is actually quite beautiful. I have not read a single review where someone said that Uma looks better. Nevertheless, I believe that the character of Ben Chaplin will most likely remain with Uma, and not with Janine. Many men do not like really smart women (and many women do not like really smart men), and, unfortunately, Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And despite the director’s attempt to make Jane unattractive, she’s not working. In any case, its natural beauty is manifested. <br /> <br /> I think many Jenin fans who are obsessed with her love this film because they like to think of themselves as Ben Chaplin and actually win against Jane. Jenin is much harder than the character she plays here (real life is always more difficult than Hollywood can imagine), so take gentlemen into a cold shower. This is the role for which Janéan is best known, and it’s a shame, because it’s not really a very good movie.
