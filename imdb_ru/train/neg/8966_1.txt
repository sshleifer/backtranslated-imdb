The original “Cube” is a fantastic B-film, rich in paranoia, fleshy characteristics and excellent performances. It's creepy, mysterious and cool. And it is excellent, in itself, without a stupid continuation, like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third (!) film in the “Cube” series has been partially restored (most of the traps have unfortunately been reworked), partly an aberration. It takes a bold step to explain what a cube is — something that was never revealed in the first film — but since this is a modest explanation, I would prefer it to be kept secret. There are some potentially interesting references to a society that exists outside of a cube, but they never develop beyond allusions to some kind of political-religious totalitarian state. So, what a small social comment there seems to be flat and not focused. <br /> <br /> What works? In principle, nothing. The action is purely amateur time, the pace is slow (how much of this film consists of two nerds watching the screen?) And the effects of blood, although disgusting, are not convincing. In short, “Cube Zero” reminded me of a fan-made “Cube”, a sloppy and gentle clone of a good movie that definitely didn’t need to be continued.
