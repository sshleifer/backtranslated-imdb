I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I was looking forward to it. I was intrigued by the pre-advertising descriptions of the Enterprise, its styling diving and coarse technology compared to the Treks we are used to. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything so interesting this pilot. I found the plot confusing and confusing. <br /> <br /> I admit that I liked the character development — the images of people as “teenagers” who were ready to outgrow their pants were interesting. <br /> <br /> And this Vulcan kid had one incredible stand. <br /> <br /> But I do not think that this series will hook me. <br /> 3/10
