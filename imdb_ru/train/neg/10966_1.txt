A friend of mine once told me that an independent art-house film was shown in the cinema when, after closing the film, the audience was so furious that they had to tear up the seats of the cinema. Of course, my imagination dried out, trying to conjure up the content of such a work. Well, now my imagination can be reassured. <br /> <br /> I am a longtime fan of Andrei Tarkovsky and an ardent admirer of his works. I met many people who thought that Tarkovsky’s films were slow and inert. Opinion about what they are, I found that this does not apply to the wonderful works of the late director, which are filled with meaning, beautiful writings and complex philosophical questions. Hearing that Alexander Sokurov called Tarkovsky's heir, I was excited to watch his films. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a trip in the open air through the fields (Stalker), this film has nothing to do with what Tarkovsky has. made. It seems to have no meaning, even on a completely meaningless level. This supposedly "brilliantly severe" cinematography is devoid of any compositional crafts. There is no balance, no proportions, and the exposure meter seems to be discharged from batteries in frosty snow. The main character is so incompetent and indecisive that it makes one wonder if his father could have been alive if he had made a decision earlier. <br /> <br /> I also don’t mind that the plots or storylines that progress to a few non-linear fashion. But there is not even a story. It is necessary to enter this movie with a shaved head, if you need to get out of it, without earning anything and not losing it, since pulling out the hair would be the only possible response to a pace that could make Tarkosky’s sculpture look as if Jerry Bruckheimer shot the short film Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I do not rule out that this may be one of the ugly moments of Sokurov ("Solaris Tarkovsky"), but I conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky's heirs on this film - it would be called Paris Hilton the successor of Aristotle. C'mon guys, don't be afraid to say it. No amount of impressive words can magically bring this celluloid corpse back to life. I do not claim that I fully understand Russian culture and, perhaps, I do not have Russian values, but I immediately perceived Tarkovsky’s work as something magical, a treasure and a gift for the audience. <br /> <br /> If it wasn’t like Sokurov’s name on it, and on air, say, Saturday Night Live, I’m almost sure that no one would “read” all this great analysis into this wet noodles.
