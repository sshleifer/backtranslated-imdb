The plot and characters are ridiculous and hardly qualified as a “plot” and “character”. The biggest problem is that everything is dark, out of focus and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the entire film with fog does not help. On the other hand, all this is completely strange and filled with sex and violence. The discrepancies are quite interesting, one of the main characters says that he has no friends, but for minutes the screen clings to the new guy, and on his side is a whole flock of women. Although he does demonstrate his antisocial tendencies by accidentally inserting an arrow into a poor man who just does his job! Images of blood or blood flow more attention than characters, but what do you want from Fulci? Maybe it ruined his career, but in reality it was not much sillier than Zombies. It is worth renting if you like bloody Italian films or desperately need a sword and witchcraft or something strange. How do you sleep when someone sucks in a hole 2 feet from your head and screams for help?
