"Hello to all! I have an idea, we found this thing in the shape of an egg from space, so why don't we defrost it and open it? "" Yes, I know that it would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and she could would be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to the Earth, and could potentially destroy the human race, but hey, I want to know what's in it. ” "And nobody tells NASA, they can take it away from us." "Wow, this thing gives off vibes!" “Yes, really strong on contact, so don't touch it, but you can still cut it.” "Hi, handsome, check my notch." (Later this afternoon); "DO NOT OPEN"!!!!! Oh, we need to run to the lab and tell them not to open, because we don’t have telephones, radios or intercoms, even if we have other equipment worth a billion dollars. "I have never seen such organic technologies!" "Yes, let me take this stick and stab it." “I’m leaving here, I don’t care, if I kill the remaining 6 billion people on Earth, no one will kill me!” “Look! These are friendly aliens from the "Abyss"! They want us to go with them. ” END
