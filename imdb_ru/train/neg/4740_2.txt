I am so offended by this film that it’s not even funny ... And I thought that "Mulan" was incredible! No matter how low my expectations from Disney, I never thought that they would do something so stereotypical, but at the same time not so. There is no respect for any true Chinese culture, only for the Hollywood tradition of casual martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that they tried to turn Wendy into an ordinary teenage girl ... But, fortunately, the most normal teenage girls - especially Asian teenage girls - are much less obsessed with such petty aspects of life. And from a cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are passionate about popularity and fashion, but they are quite rare. And even those who are still pretty decent scientists. Maybe another stereotype, but pretty true. Because it is the way Chinese parents work. This is how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hateful relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This only intensifies my frustration with American films. Asian culture is not about meditation and fuzzy, nature-oriented phrases that sound wise. We do not always mysteriously smile and do not all know some kind of martial arts. We are PEOPLE, and I would appreciate it if someone wrote the Asian part, which does not depict us as a sad caricature.
