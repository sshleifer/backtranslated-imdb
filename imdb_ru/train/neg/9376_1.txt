while watching this movie I got sick. I grew up with Pippi and every time I enjoyed it a lot. when my wife came to sweden, she looked at the old men and laughed very well. but this American version should be renamed and never shown again. it's terrible from start to finish. how can they do so badly. well, I think someone blames the translation, ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Peppy. Let this film never be shown again and never be broadcast. record a movie and save the kids. If you want to watch Peppy, watch the original movie and laugh. WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON, I'm sorry, Tami Erin, you will never become Pippi ... Oh yes ... when you read the explanations of the "spoilers", "spoil" the surprise and take away from the viewer the tension and pleasure from the film. "Well, I think the director is in favor of this ... you watch this film at your own peril and risk .. it's really a waste of time ...
