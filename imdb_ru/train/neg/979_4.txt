Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone says that Star Wars and Star Trek are the best science fiction movies to start with, which is good, but the truth is the TERMINATOR, and this film GREEN GREEN is a much better choice than these series. SOYLENT is probably the biggest mystery of science fiction. This remains one of the biggest, but at the same time the most forgotten films, but the effect of his production is becoming more and more real every day. Charlton Heston over-dramatizes his role, but it works. Edward J. Robinson, in his last role, derives the maximum benefit from SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else, and his last scenes are touching. <br /> <br /> This is Manhattan in 2022, the world is crowded and the food is an incredible state (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A major manager of the Soilent company was killed, and a police detective Thorn was involved in this case. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's secret is not a mystery if you explore the film. SOYLENT is a pleasure to watch, but the whole script is a joke. It is as cheap as all production. The script and the excessive drama of the actors made the film, but at the same time they were completely funny. Everyone seems to be a jerk, and no one knows the rules, especially policeman Thorn, who likes to just waltz into peopleâ€™s apartments, shamelessly roam around and steal everything he wants. Character interactions keep your attention on the film, but you still understand that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. Nice thing, if you have time, but don't wait for anything else.
