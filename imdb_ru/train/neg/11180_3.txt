The only thing that is good about People I Know is that it serves as an excellent example of films in which Al Pacino should be avoided. The first big obstacle I encountered was how Pacino tried to depict a Georgian accent; at times he was weak and unattractive, while in other segments he seemed too exaggerated. The dialogue and interaction of the characters were terrible, and the plot was weak. The supporting cast did an extremely careless job of maintaining interest in the film, and for an hour I still did not see any signs of a strong conspiracy. In general, the story is a real boring story, and I had to slap my face several times in order not to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> This film will surely tire you too ... avoid at all costs.
