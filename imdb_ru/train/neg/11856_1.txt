I just saw this film last night at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, and it seriously makes me wonder if people really show films at the festival before they choose. The film was just terrible - I say that without hyperbole or hidden motives - it was terrible. Matthew Modinâ€™s days as a leading man have passed. Gina Gershon wore an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a strange little cameo - she should be ashamed of herself too. The script was terrible, and we were given absolutely no reason to take care of the characters. I very much doubt that this will be accepted, but then again, people in Hollywood, as we know, sometimes make mistakes. I really think Kettle of Fish is a serious contender for the worst film I've ever seen.
