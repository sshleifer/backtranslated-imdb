I first saw it when it was selected as an offer from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman, and I thought it might be interesting. In addition, I am a fan of the works of Max Fleisher, and it began with the appearance of his cartoon of the 30s. With both of them, I thought it would support my interest. I was wrong. Only a few minutes passed, and I pressed the fast forward button. I ran it in about 15 minutes and thought that was all. <br /> <br /> After that I read some other reviews and decided that I didn’t give him enough chances. I recorded it again and watched it to the end. 75 minutes of my life I will not return. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that there are no more bad reviews. Personally, I think this is because it is difficult to reach a minimum of comments in 10 lines. How many ways to say it's a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film suggests that it was made by several children of primary school age who are ready to insult the world and who think that they can with their breasts, profanity and jokes. Characters are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is not convincing, in fact, scrambling a melody, making its way through A - E, hitting the obvious profanity with the letter "F", and then having no idea where to go. Traveling through the intestines to the expected landing does not work the first time, not to mention the following. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the entire film is what you expect from someone who is trying to “leave South Park” Stone and Parker, without being able to determine what is funny and what is not. It can be fun if you are high. Otherwise it is not.
