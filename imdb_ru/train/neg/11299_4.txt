The mummy’s grave begins with a review of events in the Mummy Hand, and then advances the story several years ahead across the ocean to the United States of America, where the current high priest and mummy Haris intend to wreak havoc and avenge those who broke the tomb in the past. <br /> <br /> Although I absolutely loved “The Mummy” with Boris Karloff as the mummy of Imhotep, and loved “Mother's hand” with Tom Tyler as Haris (which is a direct prequel to this film), I was not like "Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> It is made in the same style as the previous film, and has a somewhat similar plot, albeit in a new setting. Lon Cheney, Jr. is fine, like Haris, but he doesn't really stand out. And I guess this is my main criticism of this film - that in fact nothing stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing really outstanding, so the viewer is left with a story about a rather soft mummy.
