This is a rather boring part concerning hacking, theft, etc. Codes of the Second World War. About what I expected from the actors MGM "B". <br /> <br /> One big warning. Gene Rogers, who played so sexy Dale Arden so cool in the first two Flash Gordon series, is just awful in this movie. Her character is extremely annoying. She absolutely never gives up with her replay. We must assume that in the midst of World War II, which would obviously be a top-secret code system, it would be allowed to just go in and out of any office of its choice, although it does not have official functions. From this point of view, I wish I had ever watched this movie. It changed my perception of Miss Rogers forever. Talented, she is very light. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is his ordinary person, which means that he is just adequate. <br /> <br />
