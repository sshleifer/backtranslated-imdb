As for spaghetti westerns, I would say that this person cannot die on the boring side of the genre. Not that the film was particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but he lacks the charisma on the screen needed to cope with this. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The direction does not inspire and offers very few moments that I have not seen before. Just nothing to worry too much about. <br /> <br /> The exception for the actors I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is the only bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, its screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for the movie “This Man Can't Die” is incorrect. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is a Melin character. I'm not sure how someone can take Rosalba Neri for a guy named John Bartha listed in IMDb credits for the movie.)
