There is nothing better than to observe how giant robots fight for desert wasteland, and Robot Wars really copes. Of course, the game is disgusting, the dialogue is not up to par, the characters are one-dimensional, but there are giant robots in it! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for this period. Of course, they are not as polished as modern standards, but they contain a minimum of computer graphics and instead use miniatures, so they are pretty old. His flaws are easily overlooked if the films do not have enough time, and he has a certain mocking humor in the details that make him very pleasant. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or trashy science fiction that is looking for a carefree hour of distraction.
