Without cause, effect (s) is usually impossible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remakes, this is not only possible, it is necessary. The ghost was given a computer processing by the courtesy of a 1st grade filmmaker who once showed a promise (Jan de Bon-Spid), but has since produced a whole bunch of budget junk (Twister, Speed ​​2). > <br /> Actors are superfluous in this type of film, and they seem to be aware of this. Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones behave as if they would like to be anywhere, but not in this film. Lily Taylor is trying to add something to the process, but whatever it is, is unknown, because the script seems that half of it is missing. Events happen, good and bad ghosts appear without any rhyme or reason, and then the story ends with the most unsatisfactory non-event that should complete the previous 90 minutes of madness. <br /> <br /> There really isn’t there I don’t even see the reason for this, since we all know that now everything can be displayed on the screen. Why not see the effects in the service of a good story, and not just for their own sake?
