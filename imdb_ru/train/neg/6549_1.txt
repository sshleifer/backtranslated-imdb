Not that I wanted to be angry, but this film really surprised me. During the whole movie, I was like ... hmm ... what is this movie about? I don't get any animation at all. Probably, this film is suitable only for those who belong to the 1980s. During the film a group of people came out. After the film, many people said: “That's it?” Honestly, I can’t believe that this film was awarded the prize for the best children's film. If you are thinking about watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you do not. You will regret it. I am not kidding. You will find that you simply spend time and money on going and seeing.
