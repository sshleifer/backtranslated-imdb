Not that I disliked children's films, but it was a tear man with few redeeming qualities. MJ Fox was the perfect voice for Stewart, and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie may be surprisingly funny, but he is not given a chance in this film. This sugar is sugar coated and is unlikely to appeal to anyone over 7 years old. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3/10
