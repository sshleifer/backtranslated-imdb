I just can not understand why so many fans of Godzilla think it is excellent, one of the best films of Godzilla in fact. This film is terrible, and one of the very few films about Godzir that I cannot watch again (the other is G. vs. Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is too picky to be on the Heisei series. who tried to turn the outdated Godzilla franchise into real action movies, revolving around ideas that seemed more relevant in 1974 than in 1991. It sounded ridiculous, especially with some objects, for example, the WW2 scene with Japanese soldiers praising the dying Godzillaur with a sad and serious tone, take the former commander who turned capitalist and his death, seriously seen in the film, which his fans somehow define as played for a laugh, like an idiotic prank with guilty non-logical fun, if so, than this is easily one of the most tasteless films I've seen, but I think that, most likely, it was just a talent that was lacking in kin matografistam, and it was a case of an action movie with an open face, which deteriorated. It got worse because the special effects are terrible beyond any comparison, from jetpacks to androids, to hockey sound effects radiated by everyone, itâ€™s impossible to take anything seriously, and yet the film expects you to have no shocks to the camera. . <br /> <br /> As in all the films of Godzilla, a meaningless novel, and this is no exception, although something can be said about the fact that this film is particularly meaningless and inexplicable. There is literally no reason for romance, it just happens, and there is life to make a commitment to 360 degrees. In addition, another terrible aspect of this film is the dialogue, both Japanese and English are terrible, awkward and, perhaps, an inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> The Tristar DVD exacerbates the problems, making everything look grainy, blurry, dull and just plain ugly, and so was the sound. I first saw the version for the Japanese region 2, and the differences between it and the day, and with original bright colors and textures that deserve attention, especially fights, can actually be observed. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Heisei Series is disappointing, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), there is little to be praised here, and Godzilla against King Hydora is an example of such a failure. This is not even close to deserve the reputation and fans that it receives. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
