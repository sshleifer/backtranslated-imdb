Zombie Rise is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty far off the list. When an expedition travels to Cambodia to discover the trick of creating zombies after World War I, one of the participants decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions. And he succeeds, at least at first glance. The love triangle complicates the story somewhat. <br /> <br /> It really was a tedious movie, with a terrible game, which made it difficult to determine who was a zombie and who was not. The dialogue was a little better, and the plot was incredible (not part of the zombies, but parts related to the “romance”). And although I am neither a student nor an expert in cinematography, cinematography does not seem to help the film either. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen some of the worst films, this is unlikely to please anyone. This is bad and NOT so bad that it is good.
