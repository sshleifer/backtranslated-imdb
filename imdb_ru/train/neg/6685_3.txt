Although the film takes place at Ivy League College, it was shot entirely in Northern Arizona, mostly at the University of Northern Arizona at Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I took part in the theater department there, and most of the extras The film theater staff then participate in the film. <br /> <br /> In this film there is a completely ridiculous scene (if you know your geography in Arizona) in which several actors ride bicycles from college to the creek. We, NAU, know that the campus and the indicated stream (in fact, Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles from each other, and although the way there all goes downhill, it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to ride a bike on the same road !
