Judging by some comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps dramatic or stupid, or simple, or comical, but essentially an action movie. what I was watching was not like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (although the prologue tries to make it difficult). Take three groups of interests: 1) government 2) rebels 3) group of murderers. <br /> <br /> Now subtract the first one (they never appear in the film). Then just let one of the killers, the princess, become a fraudster on a journey of revenge. Add in rebel love interest with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they never managed to turn it into a story or a movie. There is a feeling of emptiness between some random sequences of actions and some strange visual effects trying to be Sci-Fi with a small budget. A film is not a film, but a strange, rambling, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
