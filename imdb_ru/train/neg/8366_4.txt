"SherryBaby" is a rather painful and unpleasant melodrama, shot in Jersey. This is the story of a young mother who is out of jail in the dock on drug charges and struggles to stay clean, find a place in life, and especially to return the love of her little daughter that her brotherâ€™s family takes care of. The only reason why the film should be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career who fits very well with the role and carries the whole movie on her shoulders. However, this is not enough, because the storyline is too simplified and expected, and the emotional focus is on the wrong place - I kept asking myself all the time throughout the picture if I should regret the former and, perhaps, future drug addicts, mother, as the director and screenwriter wanted , or about an innocent child who is in the middle. Even the actions of Maggie Gyllenhaal could not convince me that I should not take care of the child anymore.
