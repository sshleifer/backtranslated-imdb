Americans have a focus on fruit flies, and if something does not happen within a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest very quickly. <br /> <br /> I learned a fascinating fact from this movie: someone has to paint high voltage poles and do it on schedule! And guess what, they really would like to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, when I was bored to watch commercials late at night, and I decided to watch this movie, I found the characters to be interesting and exciting. <br /> <br /> I just don’t watch TV so late at night, so I can’t recommend this movie unless watching paint is your idea for an exciting two hours. from your life.
