It was one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen. A college student has an epidemic of nightmares with wandering spirits in Alcatraz. Trying to release a mixture of “Nightmare on Elm Street” and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad music video from the 80s, this film is full of a bad game and an extremely slow story. Although, being such a bad and often ridiculous film (dig these mullets and terrible dialogue), it would be good material to fake for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't be fooled by the proud mention of the movie being the winner of the Silver Scroll award in 1987 Academy of Science Fiction, "Fanatasi" and "Horrors", or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil is involved in the film. This is a gigantic catastrophe, although it was followed by a small cult (see Other IMDb Comments for this film).
