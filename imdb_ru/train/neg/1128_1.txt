This film was one of the worst I've ever seen. Pure nonsense. The way someone could develop a connection with the heroine or sympathize with her is beyond my power. I felt that I was watching a case history of a schizoid person with borderline personality disorder. Just awful. <br /> <br /> In its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt at producing a “feature film” - except for the fact that I have not been able for a lifetime to find any art in it. . <br /> <br /> If this woman lived in today's world, she would be taken to a psychiatric hospital and given a couple of days of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. This or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a woman's bag. Why other characters in this film found something redemptive in her - and tried to help her in her desire to become an actress - this speaks more about their pathology than about any convincing characteristics she had that cost her that effort.
