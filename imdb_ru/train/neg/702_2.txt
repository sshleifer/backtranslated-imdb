Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light goes out quickly. If not she, then what else reason to look at it? five college students signed up to prepare the old hostel for the date of its demolition. Problems automatically arise when a strange homeless person searches, and the group lacks several people. Then the killer is free. I honestly wanted to say that I was going to enjoy it. It was fair, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga. The film is too slow and almost as quiet as the library. Most of the action is below average, and moments of “point of view” are old news. Famous composer Christopher Young from films such as Hellraiser and Capture won in a repetitive cue that was better made for a television movie. However, it seems higher than the film deserves. So, apart from Young and Zuniga, this one is scratching the bottom of the trunk.
