Well ... so I saw a lot of really weird / unusual movies on my day. Fear and loathing in Las Vegas come to mind when I think about it. Well, no more ... from now on, whenever someone asks me: "Hey, what is the most unusual film you've ever seen?" Slipstream is what I say! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film, it was obvious that this would be one of those “trip-cam” films. By this I mean such trifles as blinking images on the screen, rewinding and fast forwarding of words and scenes of people, mixing with color on the screen, constant flash forward and flashback ... then you have the game itself. People randomly become violent, shoot people / things, say the weirdest things that simply mean nothing, if they make sense at all. <br /> <br /> A film about a writer who begins to mix real life with the book he is writing If you are writing, and because there is no better way to explain this, you basically see this “journey” that he makes throughout the whole movie. The fact is that Johnny Depp went on a similar trip to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his trip was interesting, not painful! Honestly, it was very hard for me to even finish Slipstream. It hurt my brain a little. <br /> <br /> I see some movie lovers claiming that this film has certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique, but also add a sense of dementia ... blah blah blah. The fact is that this film hurts your brain when you watch it ... it does not make much sense, it requires all of your concentration from you to at least remotely try to understand what is happening, and even at the end, the only thing you may be glad that it's all over ... and you can say that you actually sat through it! So in conclusion, if you want to watch a movie in which you will say again and again “what the hell”, and out loud and in your head, continue to spend an hour and 30 minutes and check it. <Br /> <br /> Mr Hopkins, while I applaud you as an actor and approve of your directing choices ... please never shoot such a film again. Next time try something that relies more on great story-telling than on cameras, which usually cause a headache to the viewer.
