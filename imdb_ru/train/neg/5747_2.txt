I love films about zombies and I love amateur productions. And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with good reverence for the classic "Zombie" Fulci. <br /> <br /> So I sat back and waited for the impression. Well, some make-ups are great for such a budget-less film, and some actors (vampirelad and cook) really stand out, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a new Romero here, but in the whole film there is not a single sequence that would have at least a little bit of waiting or shock. The director, of course, knows how to arrange body ripping and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn something more. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2, Gore rhymes with boredom - that's not enough for me - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** of *****
