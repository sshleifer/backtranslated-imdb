I think it is possible that I have seen the worst films, but this is a real bastard! the plot is unremarkable, but this is not the worst. Direction is not close to what you expect from Andy Ching. he is capable of a good job, but he failed to rally this film. <br /> <br /> Angie Harmon, who played the lead role of a female reporter, realizing who was behind the assassination of the president, really killed the role. there was no chemistry with gooding, her behavior was flat and wooden, and the 5-inch spikes heels she wore throughout the film were absurd. this walk through harmony places it firmly at the end of the "b" list. <br /> <br /> what did Cuba Gooding think ??? He has a number of outstanding performances, but this was far below what we used to expect from him. <br /> <br /> Poor James Woods and Burt Reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor.
