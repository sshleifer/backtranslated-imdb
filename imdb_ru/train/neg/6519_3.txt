Filmed in a documentary style, but you can say that the participants trained. A recently-divorced amateur director (Miles Berkowitz) sees a chance to revive his personal life and simultaneously enter the film industry. He intends to make a documentary film about the search for love, removing twenty dates, including the consequences. The comedy is spotty at best; the rest is failure after failure. Also involved are Richard Arluk, Robert McKee and the alluring Elizabeth Wagner. Trying to convince the plausible Tia Carrere, she is told in a cameo role. This will be enough as a reference for how NOT to get a satisfactory date.
