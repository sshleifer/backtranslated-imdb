This is a very old and cheap film, a typical low-budget B-Western in many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star, and this film is very similar to the early John Wayne films, which were made for the "poor" studios. With both actors, their familiar style and persona were still not fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper is not at all like Cooper just a few years later (he, by the way, speaks faster in this early film). <br /> <br /> However, unlike the usual B-film about the era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you ever want to see a woman who has been married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lily Damita plays a major role in the love of a woman, and this is a very, very strange choice of actors, because she has a strong accent (she was French), and she wasn’t even close to being a “pretty movie star.” By the way, she was also married to director Michael Curtis. <br /> <br /> But for me the most memorable and bizarre aspect of the film seems to be the gay storyline - something like the MOUNTAIN GROWTH of the 1930s (and we thought it was a NEW idea). The character Gary Cooper was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can in most parts of the film to keep Cooper away from women. This misogyny doesn't necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues in the film that indicate that the filmmakers really tried to portray them as gay couples. In particular, near the end, when one of them is killed, the other shoots an arrow, and he dies long enough to crawl to the body of his fallen friend, and then falls - his arms are wrapped around him! It was pretty sharp for that time, and I think that makes this boring movie really exciting today! As for Cooper and the plot, the film is a little disappointing and can be missed. If you are not interested in Damita or homosexual shades, do yourself a favor and find the best western.
