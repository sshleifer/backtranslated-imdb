There was such a rush about the game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially right after the distribution or lack of distribution and 1 against 100. So, of course, everyone had to tune in to see that all this fuss was on the new game show. What a disappointment! As stoically and nasally, Ben Stein said: “Wow.” <br /> <br /> The only thing you liked about this show was the fact that you knew that everything would be over time. Sitting for an hour is like going to the dentist ... you see that you are looking at a watch at 10-minute intervals, and you find that only a minute has passed (but it seemed like an eternity) since you last looked at the watch . So why I just did not switch the channel? Well, probably for the same reason that most other people are not ... out of pure optimism. I mean, nobody really * wants * to think that a show with Bill Shatner could be VERY BAD. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought that this would be the car that will demonstrate the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint was that it was so dark on the set. Watching this left me depressed. You continued to want to take possession of a little excitement, but there was nothing you could get. There was not even enough light on the set to feel the energy of the audience (which you could not even see). <br /> <br /> Dear Network: People don’t watch game shows to cure their insomnia. ... they watch game shows to get excited and have a good time. Please do us a favor and lose it in the vault.
