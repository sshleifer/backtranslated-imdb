Uh ... this movie sucks. Lot. <br /> <br /> I read some other reviews. Apparently, many people think that everything that Woody Allen or his stars writes automatically benefits ... <br /> <br /> I watched several of his films in the vain hope that something was missing. But no, they just suck. Badly written trash. All characters are very stereotypical (not to mention pretty stupid). The plot ... I think it must be mysterious. Not sure about that. The character of Mr. Allen ... Woody Allen, in any other movie that you saw him. <br /> <br /> If youâ€™re a Woody Allen fan, watch this movie. If you are under 50, do not worry. (If you're a Woody Allen fan, and you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical. I don't know what to say.)
