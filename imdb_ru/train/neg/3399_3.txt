The birthday girl does not know who she wants to be - this is a comedy, a drama ... she just does not know. What could have been a very funny or touching film turns out to be in a no-manâ€™s country. The original premise is original enough to justify a scenario full of interesting scenarios, but it is unlikely that something will deliver and ultimately end. This is a real shame, if you look at the cast - it is very solid, but they have no chance to shine. Very disappointing.
