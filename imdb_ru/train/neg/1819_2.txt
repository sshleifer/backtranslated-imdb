I was looking for this film for one reason - Al Adamson. He is one of the worst directors of all time - right there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Shtekler and the pantheon of horror. However, I was a little disappointed because, although the film was really bad, it never reached the level of horror of some of his earlier films about shloki. Due to the fact that this film was not particularly interesting to watch us are bad movie buffs. <br /> <br /> Now I was cautious about watching this movie, as the name “Naughty Flight Attendants” makes the movie sound like a pornographic movie - something that I would not watch on IMDb. However, this film was sometimes shown this way, especially the first 10 minutes. But, you could say that the script has undergone many changes, since for most of the film there is no titling at all, and by the end of the film there is a plot that comes from the wrong place where it is cruel and, of course, NOT sexy. ! The result of all this is complete confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts is even good. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little, and it is not clear why they would put a 71-year-old boyfriend in some of the love scenes. Of course, for 71-year-old Mr. Livingstone, he looked pretty good - but he was still an old man, and no one would like to see how he dresses with a young nymphet! Then, when the last 20 minutes become very violent, Livingstone became a guy like Rambo! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> In general, there is little to recommend this sad film. It's not so bad and not sexy enough to take care of him, and the film turns out to be quite boring, even with such a crazy name as “Naughty Flight Attendants”.
