If you see this turkey in your television directory, AVOID IT AS THE PLAGUE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> A steaming pile of smelly dingo buds don't start to describe how bad this film is! There is only one amusing scene (memory eraser memory scene), but even it estimates only 0.001 on the laugometer (out of 1000). Whoever wrote this turkey should be deprived of the right to write another movie for life.
