This barely watched film was a bit of an ordeal. None of the segments is good, but at least the first one was slightly amusing, and the middle one was somewhat creative. The latter was just brutal, and after he sat in two weak comedic shorts, the third was really painful to watch. Even by the low standards of the film “National Lampoon,” this film seemed particularly dull and bleak.
