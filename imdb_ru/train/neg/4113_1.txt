I have to finish watching the movie as soon as I start, no matter how bad it is. This film was painful to sit. The “sparkling” bullets, the reporter with movements similar to “ninjas”, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and seem to only hit innocent bystanders, the predictable outcome and all the bad actions were just terrible. Like a girl who finds a reporter in her friends' apartment and goes from “what the hell are you doing here (holding a bat)” to “hey, you're cute, you want @ # $%! ??? ”in about 1.2 seconds .... Just bad .... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and play with your children (or dog)!
