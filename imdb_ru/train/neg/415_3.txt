Provide Paul with “sex in the brain” of Verhoeven so that he will come up with a meaningless, slovenly and youthful version of the story of “THE INVISIBLE MAN”. If he made a film about Pokemon, I’m sure he would turn it into some kind of massive orgy. I don’t mind sex or even meanness (see my other reviews) on the film, but honestly, it’s obvious that the director has an unequivocal thinking and he couldn’t see interesting aspects of the invisible person’s storyline than the strange effects that she accompanies. It's a shame, because it would be nice if the film did not spend so much time with Kevin Bacon's invisible women. <br /> <br /> The cast of the actors is doing everything possible with a monotonous stupid script, but I was bad because of some of them, including William Devane, who is completely useless here. <br /> <br /> But then what could I have expected from the director SHOWGIRLS, which, by the way, is much more interesting than this damned and bad film.
