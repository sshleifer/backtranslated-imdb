The special effects of this film, especially for its time, are ridiculous and used in such an overpriced way that you cannot deny their terrible existence. <br /> <br /> The term “terrible replay” is redefined in the actor’s work. at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff simply redefine "bad." <br /> <br /> *** spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The charm in this film can be found in two things: first, this is the great cast of Karl "Lurch" Streikken as a mysterious psychic - a ghost that can feel, where and when people will die, and always near. <br /> <br /> Second - According to original findings, the SF-Western combination is obviously original, albeit terrible, but other finds are more original, such as the militant Zach Stone, who can feel the pain of the people he shoots although his actions here do not justify themselves). <br /> <br /> Overal ... do not watch this movie, unless you like this stupid Karel Streikken like any self-respecting Dutchman.
