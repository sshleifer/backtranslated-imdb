This film is “exciting,” but in many ways similar to a car accident. It is difficult to look away. In general, this film is nothing but an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and a vain, biased experiment in this. The filmmakers are manipulative and do not seem to have problems with the lowest denominator. The way money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intermediate steps in which the filmmakers force Ted to participate (the meeting with the so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any significant attempts to communicate with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the director’s posters and additionally use Ted’s situation. Worst of all, the filmmakers no longer follow Ted after 6 months; and seems to be completely detached from the subject for which they had so closely followed a few months ago. If they cared, they would have found the best "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, they should have allowed him to spend the money without any intervention. This film is at best a donkey trick, not a documentary. It’s sad to think how many $ 100,000 could change the life of a homeless person if they were in the right hands.
