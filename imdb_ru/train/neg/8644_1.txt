This is a complete deception ... <br /> <br /> This film is clearly filmed in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the scene of the chase - Indian cars; Everything written in Hindi is the language used in India. Directions pass through the typical streets of Jaipur. The palace is also located in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers in their (about the film) DVD Bonus, it seems, say they risked their lives by filming in and around Kabul. Almost all of their militants shot in India. The scene where they see a band singing around a fire is so fake that they didnâ€™t even think about changing it to a Afghani folk song. They just recorded a rajasthani folk song. How do I know this, because I traveled a lot in this area. They are just on the cart to sort out the matter. I challenge the filmmakers to deny it.
