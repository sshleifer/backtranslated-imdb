Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career when it seemed that he was just moving forward. He appeared at a party with his friends in the cinema and brought home a big salary. He didnâ€™t seem to care that the product he represented was pure crap. <br /> <br /> No film personified it as Stroker Ace, which makes the Cannonball Run look like the classic and Cannonball. Run II "looks watchable. With the exception of a few racing scenes, there is absolutely NOTHING to see here. Even beautiful Loni Anderson does it so badly as a silly blonde, it is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If the thought of Bert talking with Jim Nabors and dressing like a chicken, it sounds ridiculous, then this is your movie, otherwise select almost any other comedy from the movie and it won't be worse.
