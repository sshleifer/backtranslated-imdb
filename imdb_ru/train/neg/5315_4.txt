A count imprisoned on death row manages to hijack the space shuttle and escape into the forests of America, where he, along with some new friend found, is trying to escape from the Alienator, a cyborg murder machine committed a year later. Fred Olena Ray's best career film, Hollywood Chainsaws, this film can not but cause disappointment, as low-budget as the previous film, but not as fun as I am. None of the actors really stood out for me. The film is good for a non-picky viewer on a rainy Saturday afternoon, but that’s almost all that it’s good for. <br /> <br /> My rating: D + <br /> <Where I saw this: Showtime Thriller
