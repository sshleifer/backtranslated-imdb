As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can stand up to ANY movie that can be imposed on me, but there is absolutely no reason for that. <br /> <br /> Appreciated “Super Action” in the “Blockbuster Video” section and gave a scary “Limited View Sticker” I guess these are the only methods that a filmmaker (GA!) Robert Napton could use to get though would be 4.50 from one unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Robert Napton! Shame on you for exploiting these poor Mexican actors whom you probably promised to hope to succeed in American cinema. You are a shame! <br /> <br /> In this film there is not a single moment in which you can find even the slightest action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they have a rave in the field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't that an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always day? Why did it take half a movie to show something ... and more importantly, why did we watch another movie? <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
