You should know that I am one of those people who watch even the worst films to the very end, often out of pure painful curiosity. I even watched the Leprechaun to the end, before giving in to the temptation to tear my eyes out and stomp them. You should also know that this film was in my VCR for less than half an hour, before I madly jumped on the “Stop” button and rushed back to the rental point to maximize the distance between me and him.
