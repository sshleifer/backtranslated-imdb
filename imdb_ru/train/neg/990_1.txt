Do not waste your time or money on this film. My roommate rented it because she thought it was another film called “Descent” (a film about some travelers who ended up in a cave). So, we decided to look anyway, thinking that everything is not so bad. It was. I can not believe that this film was actually shot and presented to the public. It was so terrible that it was almost like an accident scene when you want to look away, but you just can't create yourself. I honestly feel emotionally hurt. He has gone from a budget film to a sex-low, in which a college girl gets attacked by a boy she has been dating all of the porn movie. And really not very good. I moved from hating a female rapist and almost felt bad for him. Nearly. In general, a terrible film, which for some reason received a rating of NC-17. Do not waste your money. And don't let your kids watch this.
