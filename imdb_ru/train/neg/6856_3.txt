This film begins promisingly from an early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against the marriage of Gary Cooper to his daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, playing the shameless gold digger, loudly complains to Cooper about his seeming poverty at the hands of his family - including his daughter Anita Louise. I'm a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (in my opinion) a Hollywood treasure, Cooper is a legend, and Louise is a very sweet, versatile and undervalued actress who is rarely found in the lead role. I also have nothing against Theresa Wright, and, although she is not endowed with a large scale, she usually gives heart-rending performances. <br /> <br /> With a promising opening, the story slides down to the very end. I didn’t find anything funny in burning the house of potential criminals of Cooper. The butler in such a fastidious, non-smoking family would never have blithely leave, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or, as an alternative, he would certainly have given him some means of getting rid of his unsuitable cigarette. Moreover, no sensible people would allow themselves to be left with a lit cigarette, without asking for any means of recycling it. And finally, no one in their right mind puts a cigarette in a handkerchief or shoves it in their pocket! This whole sequence only made Cooper seem stupid and awkward. This is a bad trick - poorly thought out and shot in such a way that causes ridicule, not laughter. <br /> <br /> Cooper's compulsory medical examination is equally contrived. No one allows himself to undergo a full medical examination without notifying him of the goal and without giving consent. What Cooper did was too far from reality to be funny - this is absurd! Stealing children from hospitals is a serious offense, and there’s nothing to laugh about either. Finally, scenes of Cooper's overly choosy, neurotic attention to feeding and the weight of his child may have struck nerves with several people who were worried about their own newborns. But to me they just seem tedious and slow. In these scenes, the departments of wardrobe and props were out of control, although, paradoxically, the writer fell asleep. <br /> <br /> There is simply no humor in the script. They just miss all the cylinders. Laughter does not last a mile a minute, but rather like an easy year. The only time when the film shows energy or humor, is when Frank Morgan is filmed on camera. <br /> <br /> A scene that is completely useless is when the love interests of Cooper and their fathers meet in the same hotel. room together Probably somewhere in this mine there is a rich humor, but none of this has been learned. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of two very pretty girls will get hurt. As expected, this is the character of Anita Louise, who was thrown into her future wedding night! Although this is not on camera, this is her fate, and this is not particularly funny - even in the end. She didn’t do anything in this film to make me sympathize (unlike Gail Patrick, say, in My Beloved Wife). Therefore, I was expecting (perhaps “hoping” is the best word in the context of the film!) So that Anita Louise also enjoys a happy ending. The fact that such a good character is essentially destroyed at the end of the film really undermines the “happy ending” effect for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen, for a witty dialogue. This is typical of films of that era ... And it never delivered. Frank Morgan's good performance in a slightly different role is completely in vain.
