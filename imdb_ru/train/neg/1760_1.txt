This film makes a few mistakes. several American actors in Spain and Spanish speaking English actors. English “Spanish” is fine, but the way acting acts makes it all pretty annoying. the dialogue throughout the script is very weak; Perhaps it was a Spanish script, but it is translated incorrectly, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that they are famous Spanish actors, translated into English, they can be good, but not on this flop. You will understand the film in the first 5 minutes, that's how sorry it is. then the rest is just bad. a lot of waste of time, a lot of unnecessary sites. Oh, I mentioned that one of the Baldwin in this.
