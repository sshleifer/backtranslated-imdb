I think I have seen the worst films, so I put 3, but it's hard to remember what they could be !! Maybe Xtro (nasty and boring) or maybe Creep (just boring), but it's hard to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say this is “Under Siege” for a poor man, with Jean Claude Van Damme as an even poorer person. The only peculiarity of the ransom is to see Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after the paratroopers. Yes, it was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging by this site, he was stuck in the hell of television films .... Casper, be more discriminating .... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Aaaaaa, I just turned over, and on a half-decent movie called “Criminal Law” ...... now I am starting to get offended in the last 1.5 hours !!!
