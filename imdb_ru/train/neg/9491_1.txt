This film forces you to truly appreciate the invention of the fast-forward button on the remote control. This exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. At this time, Hamilton is relatively easy to take pictures with a soft focus. However, what was difficult for me to understand was that although Anya Shute was about 19 years old when she was shot, the girls are portrayed much younger than they really are. This whole thing with Lolita, especially due to the fact that an elderly man participates in it, causes me some concern. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area so that she looks even younger than she is. C'mon, sex is a good past tense between adults. Another thing that seemed strange to me was that neither Bitt nor Shute had a nude scene in the film, well, at least, not the most suitable one.
