I was not at all a fan of the hostelâ€™s bloody hit of 2005, and most of these mean ass are just as bad or worse, but Live Feed managed to entertain me for about the first 30 minutes. I started with a lot of sex and sloppy settings, followed by some good death scenes, in which a Chinese organized crime squad and a 7-foot butcher in leather aprons ... What knocked me out of the movie was the hard hero of the gun and the anger of saving The next day ... I would call this film mediocre, at best, since the premises, mainly with the participation of disgusting young people, cut porn in a seedy theater, doubling as a shelter for the mafia, turn to me. If only the torture was long enough to be fully effective, then my rating would be very different. Unfortunately, most of the horror is gathered in one scene, and the rest of the film ends with a revenge type scenario. So, in essence, this is just a low-cost robber "Hostel" with the redemptive use of free sex, almost constant in the first half of the film ... In general, I would say, do not worry about it.
