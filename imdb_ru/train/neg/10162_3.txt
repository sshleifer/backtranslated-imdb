This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real: “These are people in the Ohio Valley!” I’m from this area, and it seemed to me that the film “How people in California think about us!” and worked there with a minimum wage. We laughed a lot, we contacted and rested with people of our age; young people went out together at night. Older people had little free time after work because they took care of their families. This area is beautiful in the summer and not at all darker than the winter rain than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Aside from indulgence “if you live in an industrial home, you must be depressed,” there were no elements in history. charm, mystery or even a sense of fear. <br /> <br /> Martha’s temper was the worst. It is doubtful that someone who was so depressed belonged to the church, but if she did, she probably would have become friends there. I read reviews that seem to suggest that Martha was jealous of Rose, because Rose was "younger, more beautiful and slimmer," but if so, then it is not shown. All we actually see is that Martha learns not to love Rose for reasons that are applicable just as if the three friends were the same age and sex. We see that Martha felt deprived during her smoking sessions, left out of the cycle, when social plans are drawn up, used, but not evaluated, and, finally, disrespectful and offensive. <br /> <br /> Another thing: should we suspect Kyle of the murder, because he once had several panic attacks? You are welcome. This raises stigma against mental illness to a new level.
