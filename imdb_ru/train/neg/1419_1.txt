This is a terrible little film - and, unfortunately, the company that made this film made several others. In short, in essence, this is an idea with one joke, which was not funny from the very beginning and can also offend you. Of course, I was embarrassed to watch how small children (most of them were about two years old) jump and pretend to be adults - in this case it’s a dancing girl and a barfly. This is the type of humor that your children may make you laugh if they pretend to be adults, but I don’t see anyone WANTING to see it, especially when the very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a pretty tight outfit and acts like a vamp !! And then, other children behave like adults in some pretty adult situations. At that time, I am sure that they did not try to turn to pedophiles, but looking at it today, this is what immediately comes to mind! Because of this, this boring movie ALSO scared me, and I hope I never see him again !! Pretty weird and awful.
