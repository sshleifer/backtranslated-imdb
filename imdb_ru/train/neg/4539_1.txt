I have never seen anything as terrible as this film for quite some time. The film was a boring, long, long and terrible storyline. Special effects sucks like hell. This is like watching a movie in 1999. It is a complete waste of one and a half hours of my time. Matthew Settleâ€™s job was pretty bad. I saw him in a group of brothers playing a lieutenant. Spears, he was NOT so bad. In fact, not bad at all. But in this film his acting was not convincing enough, it was rather bad, and there was no chemistry between the rest of the team. Plus, his eyes seem empty, as if he does not feel it. It really surprised me because he was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> In any case, did not even bother to watch this movie. This is a big big waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, do something else besides watching this movie. Believe me, you will regret it!
