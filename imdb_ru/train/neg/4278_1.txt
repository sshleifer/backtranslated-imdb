I bought this film for money at the National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I feel that it was robbed. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if I have seen this movie worse than this one, Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of the film if I didn’t have such great respect for the subject, that is, for Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? Is this a musical biography? Yes, there are many intersperses of Foster melodies, and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers that smell more than the Mississippi Delta. I mean, did someone pay to write this nonsense? Secondly, the true story of Foster is fascinating. Why not even come to him? Thirdly, what did they get from the great Ray Middleton to make this film? Photos of him with little boys ?? With the communists? What a waste of great talent. <br /> <br /> So, Foster's friends, and the truth, and good fun, afraid ... be very, very, afraid.
