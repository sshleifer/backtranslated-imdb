... you know the rest. If you want a good movie about zombies, DO NOT RENT THIS FILM. If you need a documentary look at the "hood of life", you are also in the wrong place. If you are looking for a funny piece of film, this is a real winner! Acting as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is the officer who is investigating the trip. I can say that he made the voice for the 911 operator evenly. If I could hear the cardboard box talk, it would probably sound like this guy. Oh, yes, and the "zombies" made their best impression of the snake, which corresponds to their FANTASTIC action in general (note the sarcasm ... HOW IT DON'T WIN OSCAR FOR THE BEST MAKEUP) Quiroz ...... did not make any instructions . I felt like I was watching a play from an improvisational period (the period is more like the Los Angeles of the 1990s). However, the direction is distorted by the worst scenario that I think has ever graced the film. I have not heard such beautiful lines as the epic word, starting in the movie “F ** k!”, Since the Ice Grill, which was another “urban” thriller. This works, of course, only in combination with the epic soundtrack for hip-hop! All 3 or so songs about it! In general, what the hell did you expect from a movie called The Hood of the Living Dead? I made this film with the full intention of laughing at every scene, and the boy delivered it and MORE! I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a group of guys and laugh at a low-budget horror movie (yes, that's right ...) for the night. Unforgettable experience for sure!
