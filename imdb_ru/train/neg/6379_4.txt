With the film "Gainigers from space" how could you be mistaken? Just add some of the main stereotypes for the characters, use Village People as your main soundtrack providers and add tons of gay jokes. The plot is not important. It is a pity that in this film there is nothing of this, and every joke overlooks it. All the characters look the same, with the exception of the German geiniger, one or two jokes work, the rest do not work out. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh, and I was ready to laugh even more at the film. My expectations were high, apparently.
