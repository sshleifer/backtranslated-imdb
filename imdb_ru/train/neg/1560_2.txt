This film can not even be called bad, because, unfortunately, it is just terribly mediocre. Having no real wit or imagination, the subtle plot stretches to the absolute limit, and the “jokes” (which are predictable and worn out) unfold to such unjustified length that the boredom and yawn quickly overtake the viewer. Another note that marks the sad decline of John Waters, and a reminder that what “shocked” or amused us 30 years ago, now does not work quite that way. We have seen it all before, and it no longer breaks any taboos, because they evaporated long ago. Big miss.
