Well, how do you rate a movie like this? Does it even have a cinematic meaning? This is a film that is trying to get as close to being a snuff film as possible. Basically the whole movie is just a group of guys torturing a young girl. Not very attractive, and on top of that, not very realistic. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the film tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, the film is simply too unreal to make it work as intended. The slap and the stump are all soft and fake, as well as sound. They often just hit the floor, not the girl, obviously. Also the way the girl reacts to all the flour is pretty tame. I mean, if it were real, surely she would scream it out. This film has more moans than screams. <br /> <br /> The film is clearly low-budget, and this is a valiant attempt to achieve something shocking and realistic, as well as original and provocative, with very limited resources. I donâ€™t think that this film had a great influence at the time of the release, although he must have done something good, since after this six sequels were released. <br /> <br /> Fans of shock and Gore will most likely be disappointed with this film, although there are still a few fetishes of people who will enjoy this film. <br /> <br /> 4/10
