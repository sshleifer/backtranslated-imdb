This should be renamed "The Mysterious Case of Unscrupulous Directors, who misrepresented the movie" Snore without horror. This is one long, boring story of fraternal insecurity, a gag so transparent that even Flounder from Delta House could see through it. Jeff East, an actor at the stage of paying contributions, can be forgiven for taking any work he could get. What can not be said about Charles Martin Smith, who previously played for such cinematic heavyweights as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once appeared on a cassette, but fortunately, not on DVD. The garbage thus distorted belongs to this dump and nowhere else.
