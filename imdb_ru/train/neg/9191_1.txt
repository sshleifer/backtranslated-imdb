Well, I had to sit at the computer and record the review immediately after viewing this puddle of mucus. What for? Because I have to tell all of you how bad this film is. This is incredibly bad. Just to tell you how bad it is, I will offer this little detail about the film. During scenes of unrest, which usually consist of people shooting or kicking zombies, they cross scenes from a video game. Yes, you understood me correctly. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think that today it costs ten dollars to get to the cinema these days. And see corn shit like that? There is no story about which one could speak, and the film basically has nothing to offer, except for random boobs and really cheap murders. I am really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, I'm stunned. It's so bad that I can't even find the words. RATING: ZERO from *****.
