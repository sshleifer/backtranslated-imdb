I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can't understand why they bought the rights to this film. It's so boring that I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. In some places in the summary of the plot it is written "but that Satan does not know that he was stuck with annoying tourists." Well, it seems they did not disturb him in the film, only me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies, but it was just boring.
