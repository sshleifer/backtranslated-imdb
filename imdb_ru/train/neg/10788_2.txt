And I mean ultra light. In this film, four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that. <br /> <br /> There is nothing special to say about this bitch, except for this, although there are a couple of really good bits in it, most of them are not very funny. Nor does it work like a novel. How about a romantic comedy? Not in this life. Most of the dialogue is too complex to be sophisticated, much less amusing. <br /> <br /> What is truly embarrassing is that the premise is not at all bad. This film could have been a lot more, especially given the recent emphasis on some fake movie promotion techniques, complete with fake critics. The film reveals the unworked territory of the press - these are all paid trips for journalists who almost always write good reviews. But instead of investigating what was supposed to be a native joke, he devotes about three minutes to this territory and leaves in pursuit of an unconvincing film novel. <br /> <br /> Same thing with Catherine Zeta-Jones. the character is a ghostly, egocentric movie star. Zeta-Jones copes well with what she is given, but she is given practically nothing. This is all homogenized junk that looks very pale compared to some of the things we have heard about the stars over the years. <br /> <br /> In the end, itâ€™s hard to understand what Zeta-Jones did to Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign on this doomed ship that sinks like a replay of The Boat of Love. In fact, as the old joke goes, they had to forget the script and withdraw the deal. It would probably make a better story. So, come on, tell us the directors, what do you have on these stars that made them appear in this?
