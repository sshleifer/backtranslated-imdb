A boring movie about a boring city of the 50s. How can you think that this is a classic? The producer has largely completed his career by nudging his girlfriend, Sybil Shepard, in several films that far outweighed her acting skills. I think that this film gives an idea of ​​how bad the future films of Peter Bogdonovich will be. Career Sybil Shepard survived the dive after starring in several films shot by Peter Bogdonovich. Only in "Moonlighting" did her career begin to return. I thought the acting was a bad performance of the Graduate. I noticed that this film was not shown in the USA. The only place I watched was late at night in Europe.
