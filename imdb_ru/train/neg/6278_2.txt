You have to wonder how some films were ever made ... this one decided to skip the cause among many other things and just walked away from the topic. <br /> <br /> And yet you have some decent actors who are doing everything they can to bring their life into history. The blue tint throughout the film turns into “once again”, which in itself would be depressing, but here it is unnecessary. The idea that this is not a state of health, not a curse at home, not a gypsy or trinket, but simply that for no apparent reason begins to occur with our main character, and then with everyone else around her, it just turns out to be very similar how to take a swig of empty mugs. Some twins have superpowers, but others do not know or do not know about it? They seem to be as ignorant as we are. <br /> <br /> This is the poor man's plagiarism "Invasion of the body thieves" along with "The Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense" of Kiefer Sutherland. you seriously ruin these three together.
