Despite the fact that the animated film really missed everyone who is under 6 years old. <br /> <br /> As an adult who grew up in an area with wild horses and Native Americans, he felt that it was a combination of a PC, mixed with too many science fiction films made by people who had never lived in an area about which they filmed. Talk to those who lived on horseback; most treat their animals as family members, regardless of origin. Regardless of the background, we dealt with good and bad destroyers of wild horses. I had to explain that this was a real problem for us, compared with the views of cinematographers at children who were surprised to see how the computer shows a world different from what they really knew. <br /> <br /> This dream job comes off the normal Disney or fairy dream of cute talking animals burning the screen, was pleasant from the point of view of the older viewer. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you can end up answering questions.
