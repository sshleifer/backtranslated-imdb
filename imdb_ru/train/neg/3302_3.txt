Over the past few years, the Swedish militants have turned into something similar to American hardened militants, such as “Heat”, but with a small budget. This film follows the same recipes as Knoll Tolerance and Livvakterna. Nevertheless, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and complex film. <br /> <br /> The story was seen earlier, the dialogue seems to be artificial, and the acting is very bad, especially for the main actress. of the past, but at the same time it acts completely rationally. It doesn't work very well. <br /> <br /> The bluish style of the photo does not seem fresh anymore, and in this photo it is not even very good. Only very few scenes actually look good. In addition, it sounds rather strange, and it seems that after this a lot of real conversations are recorded. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this film is Stefan Sauk, although he does not create a convincing portrait of the SWAT Team Leader, has some really funny lines. In addition, the music is pretty good.
