I do not destroy anything when I tell you that in this film you see how a woman has sex with a goat. If this is your business, then your movie has already appeared. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband go to their sister, living away from home, in a family mansion in the forest. Her sister is a creepy lady, to say the least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love. On the side there is a group of unattractive characters who begin to accept all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak, and the characters are rather stupid. A woman is hanging around even after her husband begins to turn into a jerk and hang out with pagans, even continues to have sex with him. As far as exploitation is concerned, there is a lot of exposed flesh and a couple of strange connections, but there is nothing better than anywhere else. Yes, and the aforementioned goat sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most viewers do not reach the end. Fans of exploitation will survive this, but will remain, wanting more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
