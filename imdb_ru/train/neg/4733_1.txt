I can not believe that I really experienced all this. This movie has the worst role since Killjoy's. <br /> <br /> Here is a short plot plan: the film begins with Jojo and that other chick who sits on the beach and drops to a skinny blond. "handsome", which looks as if he had not been in the gym a single day in his life. Anyway, everyone knows him, and every chicken in the film wants him. Uh uh! Here is a competition! The stereotypical hot chick and her best friends who drive an ugly pink car. We soon find out that Jojo's mom settled for life in Australia, which means that Jojo will have to move and leave her best friend (oh no, I think I'll pay). There is a strong storm and fill their pool with dirty water. Somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool and comes face-to-face with, yes, you guessed it, a mermaid! This is where the “story” really takes off. In fact, they want the mermaid to fall in love with the “handsome” one. <br /> <br /> This film is about how to behave, it makes the 80s look like the top of Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all the possible clichés ... best friends, a "handsome" one everyone wants, a hot bad girl and her bitchy friends, a scary old man ... you call it, he's there. I took one for many people, watching this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice for you. Please do not watch this movie. Do not make me suffer in vain.
