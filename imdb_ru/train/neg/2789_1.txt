“Island of the Savages” (2003) is an inconclusive film. This is more like a home video shot with minimal lighting and terrible play. Not only was the storyline and script miserable. I do not know why this film was made. I have seen a lot of movies in my time, and the ones that I really hate are films that make me angry. It made my blood boil. The situations were abnormal at best. If I shot such a film, it would be a short film. In fact, because these "backs" would not be in the picture. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by D.V.D. I am an avid observer of a bad movie. But this film is almost invisible. I am not against films shot on D.V. but if you are going to make it so that the film is pleasant, and not some tired re-reading of excellent horror films (without a wrong turn). <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this at the box office, pass by. <br /> <br /> Films that really anger you get a machine gun 1.
