I really like slasher films, but this film is really terrible. The game is not convincing, the script is bad, and the atmosphere is absent. The plot is this: the deformed gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small American town. That's right - this is the plot. Very original, ah! “Night brings Charlie” is not even awful enough - if the movie is not scary, at least they should make it bloody. Avoid this cheap trash at all costs. If you want to see some good slasher films, see Crazy, Burning, Rogue, Before Dawn, or Gorgeous - just don’t waste your precious time with this useless piece of trash.
