Inner disappointment, causing a yawn, upset by the snails, tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington), who is under investigation because of his possible involvement in the case of missing money. When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a thief inspirer (Clive Owen) and his team, is the detective appointed to force the thief to surrender ?? his only chance is to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter an influential woman (Jodie Foster) with your own secrets and intentions that will be sent to pick up the item from the safe of the bank owner, which is kept in the bank, and you will have a real tripartite dilemma. Unfortunately, everything that you set up in the film, and in the end nothing will pay off. Denzel Washington is not very interested in inefficient and unpleasant egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is his competent colleagues Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster demonstrates the most amazing and high quality of the game, playing against the type as a ruthless, a kind of evil villain. Clive Owen is not given much to do except meditation and posture, but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting skills more than compensate for his insufficiently developed role. It is strange that so much talent is spent on this film, which has little or interesting influence. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking about when creating this film. However, the most difficult aspect of the “Inner Man” is how much unfounded praise he received. For the film, which seemed to have all the ideas of pre-season blockbusters, this film looks terribly flat.
