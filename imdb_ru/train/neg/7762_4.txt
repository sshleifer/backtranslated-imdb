Considering that John Doe clearly inspired the creator of Kyle XY, I expected his pilot to be quite interesting. However, I probably had too high expectations, because I was very disappointed with this. At first they turned the main character into a freak, who had the crazy idea to show their amazing knowledge to an audience in a public place. After this scene, I began to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse, since none of the other characters were properly represented. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story much less intriguing. I was also a little disappointed with the performance of Dominic Purcell, because I found that he did not make the believable John Dow. Another problem was the story of the police. It really was like deja vu, and it was not a pleasant feeling. This leads us to the worst problem in the bundle, the episodic format. I have already seen fillers following one after the other. <br /> <br /> In general, I was very disappointed with this and would not recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was, I now better understand why the show was canceled. In a sense, I got the impression that he did not reach his goal, developing characters to help the protagonist find his identity. This is sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The workmanship was also quite good, and the casting was correct. But I will never know if it’s better, probably not, because I don’t plan to watch the next episode.
