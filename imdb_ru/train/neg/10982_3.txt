The film had good acting qualities and good moments (although, obviously, a rather low budget), but a poor rating due to the poor development of the main premise. The main point of conflict between the two leaders does not look realistic at all. There are several scenes in which they disagree because of this, but there are no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together when they see the world in different ways, especially because Glenn’s employment is so entangled in this part of his life (and Adam is rather active with his own, that he supports it with time and money.) In addition, several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for what he is (apologizes to Adam for his past), while Adam, as shown, exalted and "traditional." “that the film proclaims in a“ good ”way after all. I don’t like it when they preach me like that. I attended a discussion session with the director after seeing the LTR, and he said he presented the conflict between them, because if he was in Glenn’s skin (and he said that in real life refers to Glenn’s opinion) that he could never meet someone with Adam’s views. Well, then, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in a film. In addition, the director said he shot it, his rvy film only after reading (Directing For Dummies.) The direction was not so bad, but not at the highest level. I've seen worse, but I rarely leave the movie feeling so disappointed.
