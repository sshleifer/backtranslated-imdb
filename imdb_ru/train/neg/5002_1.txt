How did such a horrible script get this cast? Funny, predictable and completely unbelievable, it is well-played and deftly directed, but the material is so bad that it is still considered one of the worst thrillers of all times that I have seen in recent years. Surprisingly bad, and not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the cast.
