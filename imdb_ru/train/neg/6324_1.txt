I spent eight years in movie theaters in the 80s and 90s. It was the worst movie I ever showed to the public. One thing that made it so bad was that it looked like trying to be a great, inspirational film. Even the great Gregory Peck could not save this disgusting piece of nonsense from being much less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis in an early role in a non-horror film clearly demonstrated that she had not yet learned to act (she is still trying, but it does not get much better). <br /> <br /> Sorry And here is the spoiler: international nuclear disarmament never happens just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball! Even the show on Nick and The Disney Channel is not stupid enough to try to make us believe it. <br /> <br /> You shouldnâ€™t waste time watching it on cable television. It is not worth the price of movie rentals; Your dollar is better spent on additional packaging of popcorn to go with another film that you have chosen (because it can only be better than this).
