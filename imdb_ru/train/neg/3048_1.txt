This is perhaps the most terrible Santa Claus show ever devoted to any medium, be it a book, a picture or a movie. Santa looks like a pervert looking down on children, and the perverse story about bringing Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan’s minions, Peach, does nothing better. It is ridiculous, to say the least, with bad consequences even for the 1959 standards. If a child watched this movie, he would have nightmares, and he would never want Santa to visit him. They will be traumatized for life. Imagine the kids in “Christmas Story” when they start screaming after being put on Santa's lap. This is how it will turn out if the child sees this movie.
