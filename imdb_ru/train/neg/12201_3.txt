The summary pretty much sums it all up. This is not nearly as good as the original. With a script written jointly by Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time, he also wrote "Aliens"). Much of the action was written by Cameron, and political aspects were by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was in better physical condition when he did this, and Rocky 4, and he really looks in great shape or exhausted. up to the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo begins in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who asks him to perform a special mission that can bring him presidential pardon. In the end, he agrees and goes to the briefing of Charles Napier, who plays in a Washington suit, trying to impersonate former former warriors to appease Rambo. <br /> <br /> The task is to find out if the missing prisoners of war are still alive in the camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen because the camp he was testing was somewhere where he himself had been a prisoner. He is told that this is not a rescue mission, and he is only there to take intelligence photos. <br /> <br /> After an unsuccessful attempt to parachute from an airplane, he loses most of his equipment, encounters contact (who turns out to be a pretty woman), and travels along the river with the pirates to the camp. <br /> <br /> He finds that there are still prisoners and saves one. When the three flee from half the Vietnamese army on their riverboat, they indulge in pirates, but Rambo kills them all, and they have to walk to the gathering point after their boat rammed and almost blew up Rambo on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is again betrayed and abandoned when Napier orders to withdraw the rescue helicopter. When Trautman returns to the base to scold him, it becomes clear that the survivors should not have been found. <br /> <br /> Stephen Berkoff appears as a Russian special forces colonel, and Rambo is tortured and, in the end, only runs away from the pursuit of Vietnamese troops and special forces. After killing many of them, Rambo finally steals a helicopter and saves most of the prisoners to return to their base. <br /> <br /> He resists the desire to kill Napier for leaving him, but destroying the Operations Center. <br /> <br /> A weak conspiracy and a very weak ending, when Rambo goes into the sunset as a free man.
