“Empty Point” is a good film that costs half price, or, if nothing else is worth the time, without thinking. There are the necessary explosions, Hammi and actresses, and lovely ladies. Pretty good cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and beautiful Tia Carrere. This cast plus a light touch make not a great movie, but a funny one on a scale from one to ten ..a 4
