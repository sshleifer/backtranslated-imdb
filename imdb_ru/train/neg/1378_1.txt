This is how bad 80s tv shows broke free and tried to become the soft core of porn. Oh my god, that was bad. The plots of each character had little value. The plot itself has nothing to talk about. I think something about a stalker. In the end he shoots himself? This is not entirely clear, but for some reason a volleyball game is involved here. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this film was because it was Casper Van Dien, and eventually they wanted to go back to the scenes with him that were barely noticeable. Thank God, I did not spend money on it, but I want to return this hour of my life.
