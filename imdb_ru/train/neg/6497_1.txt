In fact, I had high hopes for this film, so I took what was given to him with salt and hoped for the best. About 1/3 of the way from the film, which I just had to leave, is quite simple, the film is a confusion of things happening for no apparent reason, and they are all disconnected. I like films that make you think, but this film was just a collection of ideas that were never related. <br /> <br /> Don't think that this is David Lynch Esq. nowhere near this kingdom, except for some trippy visuals. To say that it is skillful to hide the fact that there is no obvious plot or story is simply a way or an excuse for why you spent 1.5 hours in the film. The game was good, but it could not save the lack of history. I agree with one comment published earlier ... “It’s as if someone is in the head of another person ... while he is taking drugs,” in other words, nothing makes sense.
