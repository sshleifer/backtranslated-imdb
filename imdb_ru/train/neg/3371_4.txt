A stunningly incredible and stupid cauldron that, at least, has some redeeming, clear photography, but itâ€™s too unbelievable to cause a lot of stress. I was hoping that Stanvik would not return on time, because, in fact, she was burdened with a wet, in many respects, husband, and she also had an idiot child ... why did NOT he run away with Meeker? But the question remains grumbling ... of which tree was this pier support made, if its rotten piece did not slip off? Stanwyk, always a flawless professional, does his best with the material, but he is worn out.
