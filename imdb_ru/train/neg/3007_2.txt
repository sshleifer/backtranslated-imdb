Well, in an endless search of horror, we will come across this film, which, for some reason, was recently re-released on DVD. The transfer is terrible and the quality just sucks. I don't think this is due to a bad remaster or something else, I just think the film is badly made. <br /> <br /> Obviously, he was filmed in an abandoned school with a budget that, no doubt, was spent on cheap beer and without talent, Slaughter High begins slowly and does not pick up the pace in about an hour. First, we see “nerd” when a group chooses it ... I really don’t even know who they were supposed to be ... athletes? The leader, with his extreme nail, is so ugly that he should have definitely been cast as a nerd. In addition, there is a "big guy" and a couple of stupid losers and chicks, which should be "hot", but it is not. It is a mystery why this group discards its own people, but I believe that the viewer should assume that these are “cool kids” choosing in a double. The choice of actors is terrible, since most high school students play thirty-something. As other reviewers have noted, the actors (if you can call them that) are a group of Britons whose accents slip many times throughout this shit. It remains to assume that this group of “children” was the only pupils in this school, since their “reunion” is only they in the school, which, as it is now shown, is abandoned, it is only them. <br /> <br /> The killings are inconclusive, the blood is not large, and the script is similar to Scooby Doo with real people; such lines as: "This place makes my skin crawl ..." and "Someone, give me a beer" - these are the main points ... This is simply not good. Skip this, unless you are in vain with friends and do not want to laugh at this unsuccessful attempt slasher. If you want to see the good, take the Bava Blood Bay, made 14 years earlier, and damn better. If you want to see a good bad slasher, see "Before Dawn" or "Burning." 2 out of 10, children.
