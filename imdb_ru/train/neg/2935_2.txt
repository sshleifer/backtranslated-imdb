(Rating: 21 from The Film Snob.) (For more information about our rating system, see our blog “What to see next?”). <br /> <br /> Here is a movie in which you will scratch yourself. an attempt to earn relief from screen boredom. <br /> <br /> You won’t break your hands, don’t roll your eyes or sigh in popcorn. No, really. For a film with such an "average" fit only a scratch on your own face. <br /> <br /> When you start to scratch your face - how you should start! - start from the bottom. You will need your upper part with comfortable tear ducts intact for the third act of "True Tearing," which can put you on your knees if you haven't cleared the whole theater by then. <br /> <br /> In the season when Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms are becoming the new Gold Standard for Leadership and Foreign Diplomacy, the film, this boring image, will be perceived as a thing that everyone can create. * Watching * is, however, a much more dangerous event. <br /> <br /> Here is our story ... <br /> <br /> Sidney Young, the London publisher of a famous fourth-level entertainment magazine, is about to see his magazine collapse. He needs a miracle, and he gets a phone call from New York, USA. <br /> <br /> Sharp magazine publisher Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says: “Come work for me!” When his own employees take out the fax machine from their apartment / office in the background, say “yes” not is no difficulty. <br /> <br /> Soon, Sydney works in all of New York. wrong things. His interview is that they ask Broadway music directors if they are (1) Jewish and (2) gay. <br /> <br /> He kills Sophie Maes's dog, the hottest movie star in the industry, when she leaves her at the magazine office during a business breakfast. <br /> <br /> This is a bad luck place for everyone, because, among other things, Sidney imagines that he is in love with Mace before he wakes up from Dunst's character. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, he completely pushes Alison Olsen away (Winsome played the confusion screenwriter (Kristen Dunst), a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the journal * and * The Big Apple. (Of course, we were in the cinema earlier, and therefore we know how this relationship ends. That's why we need intact tear channels for the third act of the movie.) <br /> <br /> The problem with The Thing is that the script just never turns into jelly, except for one set of the lacrimal canal, in which True Love prevails. <br /> <br /> Hard Publisher the ing must be the son of a bitch who also wants to just quit all the work, but the script never unfolds firmly on one or the other side of this dichotomy, and Bridges remains to spin and roll in the wind. <br /> <br /> Alison Olsen must despise Syd Yang, but whenever he approaches her (as he does all the time), she tries to engage him in conversation, instead of trying to interfere with his existence. <br /> <br /> The comedy of early scenes is built around a piglet, killing an expensive hotel room, and then take the elevator down to urinate on expensive celebrity high heels for a cocktail party. <br /> <br /> Hot starlet Mace admits that she is attracted to Young because he is "wounded." "However, the character never shows us why he was injured. This is another result of the mortally injured movie script. <br /> <br /> After a few hours and fifty minutes, this thing feels longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow. It's boring, not funny, not redeemable, and not even rentable.
