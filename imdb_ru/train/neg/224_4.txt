Worst of all, Crush is not that he acted rather badly, or that the plot is practically absent, and even not so bad that camera work could be better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part. In this film there are some absolutely brilliant moments that make you hope that this is not all. <br /> <br /> But in the end, too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and cheap tear scenes from more than 40 women who cry, hug and talk about children and marriage, then by all means do not miss. <br /> <br /> I myself am not exactly excited to see the things listed above in the film, and as a result I had a rather awful time. A few perfectly brilliant jokes can't make up for the rest of it. <br /> <br /> Verdict: 4/10. Guilty of losing my time. <br /> <br />
