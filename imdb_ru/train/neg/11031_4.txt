It is interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original in the film, and although the plot was well presented, all the main characters were a bit superficial, and you didn't worry about anyone. bad) photography leaves much to be desired, but I believe that a lot of people who are just making a budget film can hardly be expected. It is unfair to view the film and compare it with other high-budget films. But, alas, this is what needs to be done. In itself, this is not very good. And compared to others, this is still not very good. But it is not without his positive moments! I liked the plot. It was built quite nicely and well built at the end. Sometimes in really dark scenes he also managed to create an eerie feeling. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the film was not impressed. Characters are virtually non-existent, and we do not care about them. Any one of them may die, but from the very beginning you can pinpoint the final “survivor”.
