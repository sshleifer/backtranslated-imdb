It's hard to believe that the movie “Jet Li”, filled with “action,” can be so boring, but it was transcendental trash. The plot is a mixture of other Hong Kong films. Martial arts are all special effects, not human talent. <br /> <br /> This is a comic story about a group of superhuman soldiers who need to be killed because they are mentally unbalanced, one of their number (Lee) who keeps an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds life as a pacifist librarian. The rescued killers return to Austin Powers' quality plot to take over the world, and Lee loses his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was duplicated, and this may have underlined the joy of the subtle plot and comic of 25 cents of special effects. But I suspect that even 8-year-old children watching ninjas might find it underage and empty.
