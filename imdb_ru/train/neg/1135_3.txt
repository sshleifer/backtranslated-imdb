I didn’t read the biography of Lincoln, so perhaps it was an exact image ...... <br /> <br /> Or maybe it’s because I’m used to similarly alienating and unrealistic images of worship that are unnatural deify Lincoln as a brilliant, noble and savior of our country ...... <br /> <br /> But why should they shoot a film depicting Lincoln as a jester? While Henry Fonda made the excellent Lincoln, his depiction of him as “shoo, I'm just a simple guy,” looked a little offensive. <br /> <br /> [Of course, it was all Bush Jr. campaigns to make us think that he is an “ordinary guy”, so we would not care that he is a rich and privileged moron - but this is a completely different story.] <br /> <br /> Not just a film to show Lincoln as his kind of simple (almost simple) guy, the film says that Lincoln got into the law by accident, and he was not even interested in the law - only with the falsely simplified idea of ​​the law on rights and injustices. In the film, he is not a very good lawyer (he is idle with his feet on the table and making fun of witnesses), and the result is mainly determined by chance / luck. <br /> <br /> In addition, partly because it was funded by Republicans (in response to some of the plays sponsored by the released democrats), and partly because it was only a sense of time, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative . <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this movie!
