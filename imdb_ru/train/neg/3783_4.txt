It was not the most meaningless animated film in the entire history, but, of course, it cannot be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animations and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later called the first-person Matt Damon, and his journey across the borders of the Old West. Basically, he is born free among all other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to use as a saddle horse, he manages to drop all those who try to ride him. However, when he escapes from his cell with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), they are both friends, oh, and he obviously has something for the little horse's female horse. In the end, after several more escapes pursued by the Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men and making the last big leap across the gorge, Little Creek releases the Spirit, and he also releases his female horse, and they run the house to their village and comrades horses Also starring Chopper Burnet as a sergeant. Adams, Jeff Lebo as Murphy / Railwayman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagl as Bill and Matthew Levine as Joe. I expected to see the horses performing in this film, but it looks like it looks more like Dumbo, and the songs of Brian Adams are not the most attractive, but this is not a horrible movie. He was nominated for an Oscar for best animation function, and was nominated for Golden Globe for the best song for Brian Adams “Here I Am”. Good!
