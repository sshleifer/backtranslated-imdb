When I say “Doctor Who,” you can conjure up an image of Tom Baker, or John Pertwee, or perhaps Peter Davison. When I say “James Bond,” you will almost certainly conjure up the image of Sean Connery, while a small group of people might think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. But when I say “Sergeant Bilko,” absolutely everyone will think about Phil Silvers. Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond, the role belongs exclusively to one actor. And this is a problem with this version of the film, which you would constantly like to see on the old black and white show. In fact, the idea of ​​making the film BILKO without Silvers in the leading role is close to sacrifice.
