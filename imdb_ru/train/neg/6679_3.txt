Manoj Agraval after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this film. <br /> <br /> The film has Govinda in roles 8-9, as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later he also has a disguise. <br /> <br /> In short, he is a useless detective posted in the case of his friend, to get evidence against his wife, whose photos he loses at the airport, flirting with Rani. <br /> <br /> He disguises as sagargi on the plane and again as a girl. The funny thing is, how easy and in a short time does he do it? <br /> <br /> Then he disguises himself as a French singer and enters the television to get evidence, lol, and then as a Maharashtrianets (yes, inside the television itself) <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has the same erroneous identities and ends on a predictable note. There are some funny scenes, for example, when Govinda is beaten up by an African, and also many other parts <br /> <br /> Director Manoj Agraval is fine Music is fine <br /> <br /> Govinda again proves that he is alone of the most watchable actors. He is, as usual, a fan. Despite the fact that he performed such roles even before he fit into all the cavils and roles, here and again, although many well-promoted 6-7 roles do not really fit into the film, Rani looks fat, goes well with Govinda , and she is nothing special and continued to perform such roles. Among the rest, Nirmal Pandey, as usual, Johnny Lever is too loud sometimes and funny in 1 role and annoying, as the elder Tinnu Anand is fine Satish Kaushik is cheerful, Pare≈° is fine Tanaaz is fine
