How do you spell a washed-up fat Italian who struggles with martial art without needing heart medicines? In this film, we see Stephen Seagal at his lowest level of achievement - since his career began, a steady decline in his career, not indulgence, has occurred. In this film, it seems that most of his workouts were to order Alfredo fettuccine at his restaurant every day. <br /> <br /> In this film, he is fat, slow and very old, he is hardly a martial arts hero, more like a clown with a laughing stock. <br /> <br /> Stephen Seagal has time to retire - this film has about 2 hours of reasons. <br /> <br /> Story: a fat Italian guy with a great reputation after the force learns that a criminal group can play with drugs developed by the military to create the final warrior response. This pretense, though miserable and ridiculous, provides an opportunity for some of the main fight scenes, which include explosions through walls like comics. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this movie sucks and Stephen Seagal is a complete joke? Yeah. I did.
