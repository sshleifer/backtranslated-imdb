Pierre Paolo Pasolini, or Pi-Pi-Pi, as I prefer to call him (because of his love of showing male genitalia), is perhaps the most overvalued European Marxist director - and they are thick on the ground. The way someone can see "art" in this dirty, cheap mix for sex, I can not afford. Some of the “stories” here could come straight from the soft core porn, and I’m not even so much referring to nudity, but simplistic and banal, often meaningless stories. Anyone who liked this relatively watchable, but stupid oddity, should really sink their teeth into the TV series from the 70s German film “Der Schulmaedchenreport”, because this is exactly what “Decameron” looks to me. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is careless on almost all levels, from beginning to end: <br /> <br /> 1. Editing. Example: at 1 o'clock: 15 minutes: 45 seconds there is a chase scene that is clearly placed in the wrong place. It was supposed to be posted in about a minute, but I believe that Pasolini must have hired anxious editors who have little time for the “small details” of filmmaking. Pee-pee fans will probably stand up to this, saying that he was put in there intentionally — which I doubt very much. In addition, even if it were true, it would be even worse, because this story does not win anything, complicating its following. (This is not exactly Eraserhead or one of the films about Tarantino's broken form ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Playing the actors. Wei is sloppy. Triple Pee fans (all 8 of them) proudly state that 3P-O uses “real people instead of actors”. (Are the actors not people? Or are they Martians? Of course, many IQ actors are below average, but does that mean that we should treat them with contempt ...?) Other directors used amateurs and excelled (for example, Alan Parker or De Niro), so why are PPP lovers so terrible in his films? The answer is terrible again. Pasolini is careless in everything, and this includes trying to pull out as much as possible from his toothless lovers. He is a lazy director, IMperfectionist, if you like. I suppose against Kubrick ... Pee pee pee during casting was to find as many toothless old men as possible (and young people he likes). In the world of Pasolini there is a simple formula: no teeth + strange face = realism. It's good that they are toothless, but at least try to get at least a few decent performances from these inexperienced neo-Thespians, otherwise you are an amateur yourself — amateur director, in the case of Pasolini. The fact that 3P-0 was not capable of this feat, or he did not care, does not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he didn’t even notice the terrible game?) <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. Synchronization If 3P-0 felt that microphones were too much trouble when shooting a movie, then he had to at least make a concerted effort in post-production, that is, to make all these actors of the ass express their cues in the studio so that we, the viewers, I did not have to watch the mouths move while an elusive dialogue pops up in another part of the film. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of concept. We have about a dozen stories that are not related to each other. Some of them are anti-church (more on this later), and some are just sex-thread, that is, cheap male (sometimes gay) fantasies created to pamper yourself and nothing more. Stories and characters are not fun (if at all) at the intellectual level, but at the lowest level. 10-year-olds may laugh here ... And there is nothing wrong with that, but do not call it sublime intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of paragraph 4, there is also no logic in the order of the stories. Needless to say. A pee pee pee could arrange an order in any other way, and we would have the exact same film. It also means that you can freely start from the middle and then go back to the beginning, and so on. D. The Decameron is like a bowl of spaghetti like this: when you start to eat it, you can start with any thread you want. no difference at all. <br /> <br /> 6. The senselessness of the resolutions of the stories. Most of the stories end in a cheap gag / joke, that is, some damned dumb pointe right out of porn comics, while some stories don't even have a conclusion: they just end. Finito. At best, these stories are watchable half anecdotes, there is hardly a deeper meaning - if you do not find the "deep" meaning in porn. Of course, there is nothing easier than to search and find "meaning" where it does not exist. Thus, even any hardcore porn movie can be philosophized / pondered endlessly. It's fun and easy. Try it, oh, you are 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> Regarding the beating of the church ... Some viewers are delighted with his attacks on Catholicism and the like. In principle, this is all well and good, after all, I am an atheist myself, but what these people ignore is the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It's like a pot calling a kettle black. Marxist, criticizing the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does his nerve come from? In addition, Pasolini was not an atheist, so his powerful and self-satisfied position is not justified. After all, Marxists are believers: they simply replaced the conventional god with the idea of ​​utopia, which is just another supernatural fantasy with the desired thinking. Therefore, I can not be delighted with the anti-religious tricks PPS. <br /> <br /> This anthology of Sofomorsky improvisation ends with Pasolini quite pretentiously saying: “I wonder ... Why create a work of art when it's nice to just dream It?” In fact, he did not call this little stupid film art, If he was - a poor deceived person - then I have to wonder why he didn’t leave it in a dream and didn’t make all those bad films ... <br /> <br /> I want to read my modified subtitles Movies Bergman?
