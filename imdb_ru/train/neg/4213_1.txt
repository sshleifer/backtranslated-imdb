Wow, I'm a big fan of the era of Henry VIII / Tudor and, well, it was ... interesting. The only one I watched was Catherine of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I have seen a bad game before, but it has reached new heights. When did the actress who played Catherine cry? she screams and screams, and I must admit that I have been repeated many times ... many, many times .... funny, funny. The only person who showed even a bit of frivolous talent was the actress playing Anne Boleyn (although I can be prejudiced, although I have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was really a breathtaking woman, read her, it's worth it! Besides, I have a lot I read about the Tudor era, and I think the characters were not very clearly depicted, they were all very stereotypical. See this film only if you are ready to see a very important period of time, and important lives of those who participate in it, turn were ridiculed.
