I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in the sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw this, I listened to the original Broadway record, and I really enjoyed it! But when I saw this, I was like, what the hell ?! There are no many songs from the musical in this movie because they cry out loud! Who decided to do it all ?! <br /> <br /> I'm a really big fan of Gene Kelly, but this film is probably the worst musical he has ever done! The film was more like a Hollywood set than a beautiful highlands of Scotland. And who the hell decided to cut out all the Meg songs from the movie ?! <br /> <br /> I bet that when they saw this film, Lerner and Lowe probably wondered: “Who in the world decided to do this with our masterpiece?” Well, they had the right to say that if they did, they were probably insane because Hollywood turned their great musical into this rather empty film. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kelly, playing with songs and actors, you auditioned with flying flowers, but you are in a film that lacks a lot of text. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want a good movie based on the musical of Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not true! <br /> <br /> 3/10
