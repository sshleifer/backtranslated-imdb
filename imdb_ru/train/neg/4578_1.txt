Another cult is striking again. This is not a spoiler, because the REAL ending comes after you examine the people who brought this too long, pseudoscientific commercial ... Ramtha School of Education. <br /> <br /> When you need any religion / philosophy to hide behind a screen similar to OZ, I leave. Thanks Ramte, I looked at a borrowed copy of this film on the recommendation of a "friend" ... to spend precious resources on this New-Age lobotomizer, it would be tragic. I can only hope that they “truly believe that they can walk on water” enough to accept this guide to a “logical” conclusion ... in other words; walk, drown ... or shut up :-) Like a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" of its entertainment value, especially for creating the most unattractive character in film history (the roommate of the photographer ... eeeeeek!), if you need watch this movie, borrow it from one of the brainwashed people who recommended it.
