I was very excited about this movie when I first saw the preview. I usually see a preview of this product and immediately buy a movie. Something told me ... you know, look first. I'm glad I did. With this role, Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me. In the second Pirates movie, when it came out, I went to watch it. All I saw was Domino Harvey, and I hated her more for it. I think it was due to her hair and short hair for Domino. <br /> <br /> Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know, or anyway. I do not know who she was in real life or who she was in this film. I did not care about her character, and even the fact that Cyrus was partially naked was not worth it to make a film. The direction was definitely not enough. The letter was trite and superficial. Editing was awful. I do not mind style as badly as abusing it. There is a place for this. Good examples of instability, MTV style, colorful editing (not sure what is the official name) - this is Fight Club; just off my head. Even the enemy of the state had a partially similar editing style in parts. It was used with taste and was not used as a crutch. I mean, this is the guy who shot Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please give me time. <br /> <br /> I understand that many people liked this film. I guess the idea that you either love the movie completely, or just hate it, is a fair assessment. Honestly, I hate it.
