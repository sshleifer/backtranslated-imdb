I gave this film a very good chance, and he betrayed me. This is nothing more than a black and white excuse for rolling hell out of an audience, even when the egoist Bogdanavich (who did better with TARGETS) gets “great performances” from a ton of radio amateurs in his debuts. Many sexy cliches for teenagers come out of this film, such as “Teacher’s Wife”, “Impotence”, “Ugly Prostitute” (which is very awkwardly shot and stops things, and not that everything actually happens somewhere). <br /> <br /> I suppose this film should be funny because of all the sexual nonsense, for me it was just annoying. I seriously had a lot more fun with cleaning my nails than I watched this mess.
