For the big thinkers among us, “The Intruder” is an insanely incoherent cinema from France, which the so-called “artistic cinema” gives notoriety. The story of a bitter old bald spot, Louis Treborore (Michel Suborus), who is looking for a heart transplant in Tahiti, but other than that, I have no idea who the people in the film were or why they did it. they did. Without any consistent storyline that can be boasted, the film loses us early, although I’m quite ready to admit that there might be a SOME one who will really get some deep message from this film. <br /> <br /> This tangled, snaily drama lasts a full two hours and five minutes - although I seriously doubt that anyone with any kind of life will still roam the final captions.
