Unfortunately, this film "54" was a pathetic attempt at the real story of "Studio 54". The only thing that was good in the film was “Mike Myers”, which was a pleasure to watch. Neve Camppell, although its role was small, unfortunately bad. The bottom line is that in this film the actors lacked a good performance, except one, and that the transformation of the real story was a desperate attempt at a good script.
