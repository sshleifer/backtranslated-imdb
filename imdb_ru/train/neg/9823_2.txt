There is an interesting discussion in this film. Is being a moral person good enough, or do you need something more? <br /> <br /> The film preaches that without God's guidance it is not enough to be a morally good person. At the beginning of the film there is a line: "We can look at a person who is morally good, but both know that he will go to hell." <br /> <br /> Although I am not a Christian, the discussions about this throughout the film were exciting, but not in the way the film intended. I left the film with a stronger feeling that morally good * is enough *. The arguments and discussions presented were highly biased, so much so that they crushed themselves with the weight of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when it is in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. As the hero George Carlin said in Dogma: “Pick them up while they are young.” <br /> <br /> The basic premise is also very interesting. A biblical scholar from the 1890s tries to publish a book that says morality without God is normal if morality makes sense. You only tell the child not to steal? Or do you tell him not to steal, because God tells you not to do this? (I don’t have to say that the child doesn’t steal, because how would he feel if his marble was stolen?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wants his school to recommend him: to help sell the book ( to spread the world). However, this requires unanimous agreement, and one of the scientists opposes it. At the beginning of the film, he raises a very interesting discussion about morality for the sake of morality against the argument of God's word. To prove his point of view, he creates a time machine (included in the film solely to make the plot work, and I like it), and sends Carlisle in 2002 to see where moral education without God will lead us. /> <br /> As it should be obvious, he has his own opinion, and he changes from what he sees, and by the time of his return has changed (since he really comes back, this is not a spoiler, this is the Bible) the film finally) . <br /> <br /> As for the film as the film itself, it is rather slow and rather poorly shot. Something that * was * not needed in this film is that there are two "bad guys" in it who want to try to find out who Carlyle is, even if he has not offended anyone, committed a crime or something else . What is wrong with the film showing Carlisle’s opinion, showing his view of this “sinful world” and returning it from a new point of view? <br /> <br /> In addition, there are several moments in the film that confirm to me that I am happy that I am not a Christian, or at least one who says: "This is God or nothing." Three at the end of the movie rather excited me ... firstly, when two "bad guys" are chasing Carlisle right before jumping, Carlisle does his * only * really despicable act ... he pretends like his jump in time is the coming of Jesus, and makes it so that the “bad guys” (who, by the way, are also Christians, oddly enough) think that they just missed the rapture. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after Carlisle’s return, he finds a boy in whom he scolded at the beginning of the film about what he didn’t steal (but not to mention God, the child held the balls and ran away) and tells him about this time when stealing is wrong, because God commands him. As in the above quote by Karlin, scaring children with religion is nonsense in my book. <br /> <br /> And finally, the epilogue. Another scare tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far they can go into the future, and he says that he does not know ... Epilogue shows that he is trying to turn the Bible into the distant future (starts in 2100), and it fails ... it continues to decrease for years to 10, and trying again, and gradually, it is around 2030 or so. Throughout the film, Karlis mentions that he felt the end of the world, because the world was full of sin and the loss of the name of God ... intimidation tactics have been used for thousands of years ... you might think in these Enlightened times, the church would also be enlightened . <br /> <br /> I'm glad I watched this movie. Although earlier I was quite sure that morally good was enough, now I know for sure. It is worth seeing if you are not a Christian to confirm how happy you are that you are not as ignorant as the people in this film.
