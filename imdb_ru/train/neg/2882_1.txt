This film is the biggest smoldering bunch you know, having grown up in Wichita, Kansas, I know that 90% of the film was fake. Besides the names of some of the victims, nothing else was right. The film looks as if it was shot using his father's video camera. It contained footage that I thought was taken from another movie, as well as footage from the slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for fun, but because of a bad game, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and a very boring and short finale. It was a struggle to watch it to the end. I recommend you not to spend money on this film, otherwise you will apologize. crunch
