A poorly written script without nice characters. As for comedy, I forgot to laugh. We are talking about two vain friends who cheat to make women lie with them in the same bed (without sex scenes), and another friend (who is half-wizardly strange), who sometimes also cheats, but is mostly considered a guy who masturbates. 3 friends meet and fall in love with the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without any romance. 3 guys stop being friends, because they meet separately with her. She deceived them from their friendship because they deceived women. - bad movie
