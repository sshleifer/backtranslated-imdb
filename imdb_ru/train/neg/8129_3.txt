I don’t know sometimes ... you try and try to be charitable towards all B-Z class films, but from time to time a particular film just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. “People of Bats” (which I saw under the title “He Lives at Night”) is just such a film. You can not watch it without thinking that it really should be an episode in the "Night Gallery", and not one of the best. <br /> <br /> The film is somehow connected to a doctor who is bitten by a bat and therefore begins to turn into a werewolf who drinks human blood. (Actually, you would think that if he had turned into a real bat, he would have eaten mosquitoes for a bucket of gallons, but since this is a cheap, horrible horror film, blood is the word.) Despite the fact that he he has grand epileptic seizures, and almost every night he has blackout attacks, his friend and fellow doctor, Dr. Usa Aspen-Extreme, insists that he has just an “allergic reaction” to rabies vaccinations. Meanwhile, the most disgusting and stereotypical district sheriff in the world suspects that Doc is responsible for the brutal murder and bloodshed of several local girls (and one guilt). In addition, the doctor's wife decides that denial is a river in Egypt, and alternately protects him and distracts him to madness. <br /> <br /> Not so bad that acting is bad - you can say that the actors make choices on a professional level and try to bring some juice and life into the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff, (Okay, this quite bad, but bad in a classic, wooden, professional style). It's just that everything connected with acting skills, the way the scenes go, the costumes, the dialogues, the scripts and the storyline in general, put you in a dead end and make you want, well, to slap all the participants. <br /> <br /> I think the film had an external chance to become a creepy, disturbing little cult favorite, BUT: <br /> <br /> 1) The director had to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced actor, with a chair for now Pataki did not agree to the ACT, and not just to the Dennis Weaver Channel. <br /> <br /> 2) He also needed to find a script that would have a little more meaning in relation to the whole scenario “A man who bites a bat, which then turns into a bat.” <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed an actor who played the doctor to find a slightly more physically believable part of the stage business for his “episodes”, instead of resorting to the “Man has an attack” page from Little Gold Book Cliche Acting Mannerism. <br /> <br /> 4) He needed to remake the whole character of the “wife”, make her smarter, less piercing and more observant. <br /> <br /> I would never watch this movie voluntarily, except with the help of Mike and Bots. This is bad, but it is not bad in a stupid, humorous or interesting way. Still better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld."
