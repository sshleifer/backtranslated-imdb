It would seem (like me) that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese the film should be, at least, decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) created some of the funniest comedy works of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, obviously, I was greatly mistaken - this is one of the worst films I've ever had on my own. ever seen. It amazes me how one joke after another can be so unfunny. It was painful for me to watch these talented actors perform one of the most positively settling scenarios that I had to face. Based solely on high-profile names, I remained encouraging for a long time throughout the entire film, but he constantly did not give any entertainment. <br /> <br /> Usually, both in films and in life, I try to stay away from prejudiced comments and broad generalizations. But with this film it's hard not to break free. I can count on one hand, perhaps even two or three fingers, the main Hollywood productions that have left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy it - I really did. But The Out of of Towners eventually fails. If you really want a pastime, just take the money and watch it spin as you flush it down the toilet. Just please don't watch this movie.
