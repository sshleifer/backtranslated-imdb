It was another big screen for the American television show of the sixties. This is pretty funny, but there was a lot to be said. A sensible Martian lands on Earth and meets not very bright people, in his opinion. <br /> <br /> The usual stupid reaction is attacking a man, Bridges, eventually connecting him and helping him return home. On the way, he also gets a girlfriend, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a good walk for pleasant Hollywood stars that I havenâ€™t seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Pleasant enough to pass some free time if you have nothing better to see.
