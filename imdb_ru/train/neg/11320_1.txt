someone had to make the payment for the car ... it is really terrible ... makes the cyborg Jean Claude look like it was blown away ... this is the time I would like to sue to return ... luckily, it caused a strong sleepiness ... from which I fell asleep. How can actors of this caliber create this dog? I would prefer to spend time watching the algae grow on the same side as the aquarium than try this completely awful mix of several genres. Now I use the DVD as a stand on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at Walmart is too much to spend on this movie ... if you really need it, wait until they throw it away, after they have carried it in their inventory for several years, and are disappointed that they will not sell. br /> <br /> Please, for the love of God, let this film die from darkness.
