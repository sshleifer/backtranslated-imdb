This film is actually worse than most films through which I have ever suffered, and I have experienced a lot. Absolute nonsense. He has a terrible, forced dialogue; meaningless plot development; really drawn scenes of “creepy images” that look more like a high school correction project than a horror movie; 5/10 at best attractive women; long, boring sex scenes involving women (forget that you know about virgins, especially with one-sided artificial breasts); muttered, it is difficult to understand the speech of some characters; and they actually used masks from Killer Klowns from Outer Space during the masturbation scene, which should be a saving grace, because this film was pretty funny, but it wasn’t. Veden Fell is the worst bad guy in cinema history. <br /> <br /> Absolutely miss this one.
