Maybe they use their entire budget, paying porn stars or what?!? <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music, and editing in general were so bad, you might think that some 12-year-olds want a movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was good, considering the script ... the "innocent virgin" played its role very well. <br /> <br /> Mutants look very cool, and it really would be a really cool movie with a right brain behind the wheel ... but unfortunately for all participants, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Turning left was made better than in this film, and these guys don't even have no money !!! Well, that I did not shoot the film myself!
