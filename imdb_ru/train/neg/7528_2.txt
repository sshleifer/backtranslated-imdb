This is even worse than in the original game of death. The confused, incoherent storyline leads to the fact that "Billy Lo" falls from the helicopter to the ground below, killing him, and we have to follow his younger brother Bobby Lo. Thus, we are not only starting to follow some clone of Bruce Lee, the film kills it and makes us follow another thirty minutes of history. The main reason to watch it is when Bobby Law is fighting a lion, which is obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also a villain who is usually pretty cool, but his screen time is much shorter. They mostly watched this and the original game of death, because they are part of the box set of Bruce Lee. Not surprisingly, they are included in Lee's finished work. No one would have bought them otherwise.
