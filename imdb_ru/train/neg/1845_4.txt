Loss of Control is another suggestion in the erotic thriller genre that can be regarded as reading a fantastic world of cinema. They usually include a detour to murderous intent, interspersed with copious undressing. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this imaginary world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reid) suffers from a writer's bloc. Accidentally (or is it?) She meets a man (Doug Jeffrey), who engages in more and more risky sex with her. The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim stubbornly refuses to stop the case. Her agent Alex (Annelise Scott) thinks it will do wonders for her book sales. As in most films of this type, the outcome comes to an end, but some things do not add up. I have seen enough films of this kind to think without change, but I like them. They are so unpretentious. <br /> <br /> The performance of the actors varies. Doug Jeffrey wears the film as a psychopath / sociopath you don’t want to cross. Kira Reed looks good, but can not convince as a woman is in danger. Clay Greenbush as a PR also did not convince. <br /> <br /> Finally, a caution regarding the DVD in question. Both the lid and the disc have an R-rating and a 93-minute operation time, but the operating time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why sex scenes seem to be truncated, and why Jennifer Ludlow’s performance ends when she begins. 4 stars.
