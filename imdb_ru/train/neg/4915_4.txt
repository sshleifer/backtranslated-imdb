One of the previous reviewers wrote that there seems to be no middle ground for opinions on Love Story; one loved it or hated it. But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions on a scale from 1 to 10. For me, this film was rated 4. There are several beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland turns into a fabulous job as Oliver's father. But the film didn’t do a particularly convincing job of telling its story, and the story wasn’t so unique as to guarantee multiple views, at least not for me. I may be a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid films with Ryan O'Neill - I still have not seen Barry Lyndon - because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. The only exception is “What happened, Doc?”, In which his straightforward performance is the perfect confirmation for the main character Barbra Streisand, the dumb ball - and, not by chance, he takes a picture in Love Story for good measure! McGraw and O'Neill, as a rule, rob their roles, not take them off. <br /> <br /> This film marks the start of one beautiful career: this was the first Tommy Lee Jones film.
