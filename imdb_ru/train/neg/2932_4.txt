Not that he didn't care, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I were, there is a high probability that we would fall out if he continued to make scale, similar to this one. The problem is that he found a successful formula in the form of an awkward, ordinary guy next door in “The Show of the Dead”, “Run, Fat Man, Run,” and so on. But he is starting to dwindle. Here his character has no noticeable qualities, he is rude and disgusting, and thinks that he is funny, if honestly not. When he was transported to New York from London (and I believe this link is intended for viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he was equally out of place with his new colleagues. However, is it not surprising that, among his merry Japanese, he hires a transvestite stripper to get revenge on his boss at an editorial meeting. However, in some way, Kirsten Dunst begins to warm him, although he did nothing good. Yes, and because he is a shallow man, he falls in love with Megan Fox at first sight, perhaps because her character is as shallow as his. All this makes the predictable conclusion of the film, although I do not see a single viewer expressing how this reflects their life. The shame is that on paper this act of acting is supposedly worth seeing. Pegg, however, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to be just making moves without creating chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fox doesn’t stretch at all. One huge plus is Miriam Margolis, as the New York mistress Pegg - now, if she was on the screen longer .....
