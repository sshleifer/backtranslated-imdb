Devil Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies are divided into two categories of those with a similar plot (Gee, which is one lucky pizza) and those who are not (Anal dilettantes 36). The Devil's experiment falls completely into the latter category. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, the horror porn hardcore version. Almost completely plot less than 43-minute wait for a shot of money. Filmed in 1985, it consists of three relatively indescribable Japanese boys who torture one rather unattractive Japanese girl. Torture varies from banal (striking it 50 times, kicking it a hundred), stupid (tying it to an office chair and turning it around), fear factor (bath of sheep larvae and guts) and, finally, a money shot, (Well done eyeball piercing). <br /> <br /> That's all, no conspiracy, no motive, just shots from the tree of the Blair witch and torture. The girl looks bored and, with the exception of screams: “Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition” during the scene with the office chair, I was bored. With a dazed look, he stared at the screen in anticipation of a shot. Just like hardcore porn.
