Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What more can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to control. Maybe she should get back to acting ... if you think sheâ€™s a bad actress. Who will invest in the production of something so bad? I like antichrist films, and usually I laugh well and weirdly scare, but this is just Bad Bad Bad. The game of the stars was worse than in the soap opera. Special effects, if you can call them that, where it's funny. I would not be surprised if you play scenes in slow motion, you will see pipes from which blood shoots. We had to turn off the drive only after 30 minutes. These so-called film originals must be destroyed, all discs and tapes must be destroyed, and all people involved in making the film must return the money to the people who rented the film. Then these people should never be allowed to play, shoot or make anything other than their own home movies.
