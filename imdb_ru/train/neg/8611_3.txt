When Rodney Dangerfield is in shock, he is cheerful. In "My 5 wives," he is not in shock. The time for one-liners has expired, but they are the best thing for the film. The five women who play wives do not add up to one actress between them. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is rather weak; There are a few jokes about having multiple wives, but the situation has nothing to do with something else in the film. Most of the movie could have been played the same way, even if the character Rodney had only one wife, so the premise seems more like an old man’s fantasy than a key part of the comedy. Another old man’s fantasy: we have to admit that Rodney’s character is a sports skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to be calling in his role to do a favor to a friend, and the rest of the name the actors just need to desperately need a job. <br /> <br /> A strange hint of political correctness in the film does not really do anything for the film. For those who like their films politically correct, humor, not related to PC, is still present, and the seeming apologies for it have not yet reached the goal. For those who hate watching movies, tending to political correctness, add-ons for PCs are just annoying digressions. <br /> <br /> This should be the softest R-rated film I've ever seen. There are some funny jokes, and the scenes in the bedroom would make a shocking tv 40 years ago, but that's all. Maybe it was topless (just kidding). <br /> <br /> On the DVD there are interviews where the actors seem to find the depth and importance in this film and in their roles. I kept wondering if they were serious or joking. They seem serious, but I kept thinking: “They must be joking!” There is also a kind of disclaimer, suggesting that since the film never mentions Mormons or the Church of Latter-day Saints, for some reason this is not about them. Never mind that the film has a polygamous religion in Utah and is mentioned to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, “My 5 Wives” was a disappointment. I was hoping for Rodney, but the best thing I can say about the film is that Rodney looked pretty good for the guy who was pushing 80 at the time.
