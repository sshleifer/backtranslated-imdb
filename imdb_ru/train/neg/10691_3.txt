I argued with myself whether to rent it or not. I am always afraid to rent something that I have never heard of (I donâ€™t remember it being in cinemas). Great cast ... that's what tipped the scales. After 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching it. The first few minutes look fun, but incredible. After that, it only gets worse. The authors of this film could explore some future projects if they want to make their films a little better. Or they could just try to write something a little believable. I give him 3 .... 1 for writing (just because there are words) and 2 for the fact that he was able to get so many good actors to agree to act in this film, despite the fact that he has to read the script. Oh my god, this movie sucks.
