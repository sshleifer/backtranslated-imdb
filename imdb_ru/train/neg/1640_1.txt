This film lacked ... everything: history, acting, surprise, ingenuity and soul. Fifteen minutes later I was looking at the screen, saying: â€œHow could all these guys get together and consider themselves friends (even without a girl)? Fifteen minutes later, I prayed for Amanda Pete as much as possible. When a bad movie quietly raises its ugly head, pleasant consolations are pleasant consolations. But it was a bit! Cheating on all fronts!
