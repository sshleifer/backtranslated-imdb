Simply put, it should not have been done. This is predictable and cliché. The screen chemistry that made the first “My Girl” so exciting is not found here anywhere, and the actions in general are nonsense and coercion. The letter also leaves much to be desired, some of the “memorable” lines, such as “hiding the barbaric custom,” are shocking. Where "My Girlfriend" provoked a sincere feeling of sadness and some really funny moments, like many other sequels, "My Girl 2" tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails. Maybe I am very hard at work on this film because of how good the first film is, but, to be honest, it offends the quality of the original with the delicacy that this article serves. Of course, this should be close to the “Son of the Mask,” as one of the worst sequels of all time. In both cases, the old adage rings true; "If it is not broken, do not repair it."
