Del - "You're the silliest, smartest, clever man I've ever met." <br /> <br /> Calvin: “I had a brain, but they re-recorded it.” <br /> <I think that the most blatant in this meanness of Azimov’s work, I think, is how the character Susan Calvin was depicted. In the books, she was actually one of the first strong heroes to think about a problem. Here she is just an unhappy girl waiting to be saved by Will Smith. <br /> <br /> There are references to Asimov's laws on robotics, but they are an afterthought for CGI and fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is cute like most of his films, but, frankly, the story is not so good. You will understand it long before these ingenious characters do.
