The world may have ended. Unfortunately, this film has been preserved as another indication of Canadaâ€™s inability to make films that go beyond what is possible. Maybe this is because all of our really good people (Norman Javison, Martin Short, and others.) Go to Hollywood. In fact, this is too bad that Short was not filmed in this terribly pretentious and banal film. He could give him some confidence. The Canadian government should be aware - and this film is a great example - that putting money in a trough does not lead to a good movie. If people collecting these public funds had to compete, they could be forced to come up with something worthwhile. As such, they caused another ridiculous embarrassment.
