The conspiracy, which failed and smelled of irreconcilable differences of opinion, was condemning chaos, on the one hand, against abortion, and, on the other, the destroyer of the demon's seed. The horror was omitted and replaced by a general dull effect, it may well have been terrible, but instead showed a bad dose of beliefs that mocked each other to death, despite the name itself. Being a fan of “Masters of Horror” from the very beginning, this ridiculous turn of the plot with its disgusting images fell apart, like a thin old rocking chair after it sat down. I see this episode as a combination from the very beginning, never really removing anything except to complete it to appreciate its value and relief when it finally came to “The End” ..
