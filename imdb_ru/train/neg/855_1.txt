Not the best movie that can be watched these days. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and expected it to be very good. But this film has disappointed me. The sound and surroundings were good, but there was no story here. There was not a single moment of fright. I expected it to be a horror movie, but there was no horror movie in it. The only scene where I was frightened was during the change of chapter showing “Wednesday”. There are many fragments in the film. Most things remained unexplained, and nothing would connect it with anything. The story does not tell us about women or other scenes that show. Maybe a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
