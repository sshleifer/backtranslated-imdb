This is one of the most difficult productions. The general consensus has always been that, although Princess Margaret may have been spoiled and spoiled and may have enjoyed an excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest side of the production, the actress could not understand it. It also turned out that the production budget could not be extended to the hairdresser - from the very beginning, the hair on the character of Princess Margaret had a constant bird's nest in a messy look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush. The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh seems to be preparing for his role, watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles, and was a farce. <br /> <br /> The staging was flawless, clich√©, embarrassing pile of garbage. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
