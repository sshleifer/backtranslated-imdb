Ok, now let's see. What was funny in the first movie? I know people with funny accents, people falling into the water, stupid boat crashes and funny comments between two teams. In this film, they twisted the accent part to the maximum, nothing good. A number of people fall into the water for unknown reasons, nothing good. Botskras, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried, but could not. In addition, there are also personalities in this film that they follow. This film should be about what happens on the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that between the fun parts is too far away and the film sponsors are exploited to the maximum. Not good. In general, I give him four out of ten, because there are some funny parts in it.
