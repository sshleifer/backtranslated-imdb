I was expecting a bit of something from K-911, I mean, it really looked like a cute movie I could get into. I have always loved comedy movies with dogs. But it looks like it was supposed to be a James film, not Jerry Lee. The plot was rather lame, and the two love interests really did not have chemistry from the very beginning. Not to mention the fact that James seems to have had a full sexist look in the film, despite the fact that the author did not go in that direction. James just really tagged me more than half the film. The dogs were real stars, and it's pretty sad that they lit up the actors. <br /> <br /> So, I'm glad that not only I agree with IMDb that it was a rather stupid movie. But, I hope, James will understand that his brother Jim was talented, no offense, but not everyone can be their star brother. Don't you want Ashlee Simpson to use the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
