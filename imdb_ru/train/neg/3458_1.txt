Usually I am not motivated to write reviews. But this film was so painfully painful that I feel I should. I cringed at the horribly predictable plot, the lame game, and laughed at moments that were supposed to be tense. Indeed, most of the viewers looked rather bored and talkative even in the “most intense” moment of the film. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only execution of any merit in the tortured production. Even the "turn" in the end was not. I heard that the film did not take itself seriously; but in the film I did not find any evidence of this. <br /> <br /> The cut should have been left on the floor of the cutting room. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
