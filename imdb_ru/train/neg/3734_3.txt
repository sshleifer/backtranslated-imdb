Truly incomprehensible mess. Most of the things in the film look more or less like 1987, but then futuristic things appear, such as the ray of a police pistol. And this car! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. The only really noticeable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but since there were no actors there, I donâ€™t know who it was. This one is worth missing. Rating: F
