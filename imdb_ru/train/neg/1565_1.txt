The film uses an ultramodern title for an unfortunate story. Kill Kill would be nice. The film includes taboo scenes to force the viewer to return to their chairs. Scenes are unnecessary and changeable. The movie is something that a beginner screenwriter might have conjured up. Just a waste of cinematic details and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this film when itâ€™s not worth 10 lines of my time, but I must insist that people know to avoid nonsense. If people expect you to choose a good movie for a movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not harm it by exposing yourself to this dirt.
