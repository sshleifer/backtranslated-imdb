It really does not blues justice. It all starts badly with images from the Voyager probe and the Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone was blind at all), clearly telling from space (?) And telling us the stories of various blues musicians. No matter how trite it may be visually the most interesting part of this documentary. After this, the only thing that can be seen is the actors who incompetently perform classical melodies, shot in fake black and white tones of the 20s with such characters as Beck and Shemekia Copland, who then rape the same songs. This is a good device to show us why the old blues greats were really so wonderful, but that doesnâ€™t mean they could be viewed. There is hardly anything here that could justify making a film, not a radio show. No one should be forced to see these poorly made renovations. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the blues. Avoid at all costs.
