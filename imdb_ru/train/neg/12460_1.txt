We surrendered at the moment when the fingernails of George Clooney were removed from the character. We were not squeamish - after spending an hour of this fuss, we just knew what it was like. To say that this film was an incomprehensible, boring, pretentious delusion is to overestimate it! How did people manage to get through this tangled, slow, depressing corner of the film, not to mention nominating him for an Oscar? Clooney looked as bad as we felt while watching him. What was he thinking about? Oh .. and what happened to these subtitles? - did we just have a stupid DVD or was the original film made like this - were the offers left hanging in the air? The film was complex enough to follow without it. I feel sorry for the actors who obviously did their best with the available material.
