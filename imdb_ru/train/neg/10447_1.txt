I decided to watch this movie because it got a good rating here on IMDb. But many people either have very bad taste, or someone corrects the bill. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was a real disappointment. The film is as stupid and contrived, as the name suggests. In fact, there is no reason to give a brief summary of the plot, but like this: it seemed that someone was thinking: â€œWouldn't it be great to make a film where there were snakes on the plane? the reason will go crazy and start biting and all that?!? "That's all! The plot is thin and unoriginal. Snakes are bad CGIs (but it makes sense to cut corners in a film that no one in their right mind would recommend to anyone!). The acting is bad, and all people are incredible stereo type. <br /> <br /> To sum up: this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
