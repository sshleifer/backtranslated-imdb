This is one of the worst horror films that I have ever seen ... Unfortunately, I am a horror film lover and will shoot all horror films at the box office, if they are not intended for television. When looking at the box it is written that blood rating is R and a little tongue ... where was the blood? It was their good death scene, where did you really see blood? I might not notice this if there was some kind of short nudity or good dialogue. In this flimsy film there was not a single remotely witty or funny line. Sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid, but it was just sad.
