I saw this in an art cinema that also featured The Last Days and some of Charlie Chaplinâ€™s films. Based on the quality of other functions, I decided to give Immortel a chance. I almost got out of this movie, and I like science fiction! The story unfolds in a futuristic New York filled with Blade Runner-style sky advertisements and some similar cloning / synthetic people debates. Unfortunately, the script was not concise enough for a time and 45-minute film. In this world there are three groups: people, artificial people and the Egyptian gods. It seems that artificial people prevail and control the policies of the city. People are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu and supplemented by a deteriorated appearance, leaving a smooth cap on the pyramid. Isn't the floating futuristic pyramid not in perfect condition?) The pyramid lies above the city and no one on earth understands that it is and why it is there. I will not bore you with the so-called plot, but there are a lot of unnecessary bleeding and a lot of rough scenes. The film, as I said, seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner and perhaps also The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film, thanks were due to UK, France and Italy. The film is FRENCH but uses British actors who do not speak French. Therefore, it is obvious that their French dialogue was duplicated. This is a distraction, and I also thought that switching between real people and animation was rather distracting. It does not help that the animation is bad - no better than a video game. Skip this.
