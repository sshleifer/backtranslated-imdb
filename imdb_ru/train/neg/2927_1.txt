Somewhere there must be a list of all the worst gay films of all time. For those who have too long pictures from cameras sitting and looking thoughtfully into space, or from those who are unbearably long focused on cat cats eating spaghetti. This picture of motion sickness is a story about a boy and a boy who live, love, swim and get stuck in the grottoes, one of them has a depressed mother, and the other has no mother, they talk, walk, swim, have sex and get drunk, and then parted, and someone goes to the hospital for eight days, and then comes out, and there is a lot of rewind ahead and back, and there are long, thoughtful shots when one of them looks into space or just sits and does nothing. I think this is some kind of useless technique of making a film, or maybe the film is so bad that he has to fill it with long, wasted frames, because otherwise, if they had to rely on the plot or story, the film would take about 14 minutes. Don't get me wrong, this is about the 30th gay film that I watched in the last 6 months, and some of them (most of them) were very formulaic, predictable and boring, but this is really a terrible waste of time. time. The best so far was "Beautiful Thing". So, I looked at it, and after the very first introductory frame, which lingered and lingered, I thought, “Oh, no, it will be a creative sinful mage” But I gave him a chance and watched it, and then, when it ended, I threw DVD in the trash. Sorry, I did not like it, and if you liked it, sorry if I offended.
