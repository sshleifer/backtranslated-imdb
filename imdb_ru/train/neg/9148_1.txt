I looked at the bottom 100 Imdbs, because I thought that id had never seen anything as bad as Plan 9 from space or the remake of Roller Ball, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur defeated both. <br /> <br /> Of the countless films I have seen, this is the worst film number one I've ever seen. Bad direction, bad characters, terrible play of actors, horrible story. There is a reason that no one except Sam ever says anything positive about this film. Sam was a terrible annoying actor, but his direction was so bad that he could just overthrow Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The director should be ashamed of his work, unfortunately, I have to give him at least 1 star, but it deserves - to be continued stars.
