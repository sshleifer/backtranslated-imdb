This film represents quite a lot of characters and their relationship in the first half hour or so. None of them cause interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping that everything would get better, and ended up left without end, but for this there was no reward. <br /> <br /> If you want to get a quick overview, look elsewhere. For me, action is not worth telling. Not that the story was so bad, I think you could say that I had some problems with the script - that is. I thought it smelled. A look at the credits will show you that the composition is quite strong here, but to no avail. Most of the old professionals in this film do a good job; of the actors I haven't seen much before, I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. This is about all that I can find good to say about this picture.
