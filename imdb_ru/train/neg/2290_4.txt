The ultimate goal of Big Brother, so that we know what to think before we think it, has been achieved. Is it some kind of miracle or ominous joke that people put on mental straight jackets of their own accord, twist themselves into twisted shapes and grin like monkeys? Movies, art no longer risk the unknown, but are abandoned conclusions devoid of life. <br /> <br /> “The Infamous Betty Page” is a random story suitable for a course in feminism at a freshman college. His lesson is sketchy, rectangular and linear: “See how society is objectified, exploited, abused, and then thrown into a pile of rubbish by a society dominated by men.” <br /> <br /> Betty Page, allegedly, was a “pin-up queen of the 1950s,” who was hit by millions of men. (All reviewers repeat this phrase, “the pin-up queen of the 1950s,” like a monkey choir.) Her story as an American sex bomb is familiar: Southern, abused by her father, raped, etc. In this film, she is naive, innocent, unaware of the prudent interests she serves, and shamelessly benefits. Despite the fact that she believes in Jesus, she likes to frolic naked in front of a camera lens - only healthy girls, sex slaves in the neighborhood, are supposedly fantasizing. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of the writer-director Mary Harron Ex-punk, who was educated at Oxford (do you smell the rot of privileges and “fashion”, like me?): “I feel that without feminism I would I did not do this ... I do not make feminist films in the sense that I do not do anything ideological. But I find that women get my films better. ” What a cozy clique. <br /> <br /> The film simply tells the story of human life, its plot and purpose were lauded and committed in advance of the film. Miss Page has a boyfriend, but we are almost not shown anything about their relationship. In fact, there is no intimate or detailed relationship in the film. <br /> <br /> You cannot ignore its self-satisfied simplicity. In New York, where Miss Page struggles to fit into the masculine world and pacify him, allowing herself to be tied to the cords of slavery and tightly laced in black leather shoes and S & M bodices, the film is black and white. But in Miami, where she goes to get away from it all, happily takes off her clothes and is photographed by a “liberated” woman, the film turns into color. <br /> <br /> How damn not Harron "Making feminist films" doesn't "do anything ideological." Ideology has become so internalized, so imagined, so programmed that it is almost invisible. Big Brother must be smiling.
