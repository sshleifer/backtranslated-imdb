The first episode set the bar quite high, I thought. William Hurt starred in the role of an assassin hired under a contract to kill a toy maker. We are given very little information about his character or about who pays him for the murder; indeed, the episode is characterized by the absence of dialogue at all. Returning to his modernist penthouse, he is delivered a package with toy soldiers, this makes him smile, but he rejects him and goes about his business. But hellish night awaits him, the soldiers are alive and are going to wage war, drive jeeps, shoot machine guns and bazookas and even fly helicopters! The special effects are good for the TV show, and it becomes quite tense as he evades the apartment, using his wits to survive, sometimes gaining the upper hand, and sometimes not. I will not spoil the final, but suffice it to say that it was a cunning little turn. It gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the rest of the episodes were rubbish, and by the fourth I lost interest. Stephen King's adaptations are always mixed, and they are no exception.
