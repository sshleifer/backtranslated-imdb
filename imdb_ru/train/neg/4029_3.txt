The idea of ​​the story “The Lost Story” is not bad at all, but, unfortunately, the story gets a little boring in the middle, and excessive use of video materials, as well as bad special effects, put this film down to par. /> <br /> The film begins with a rocket aimed at Earth. In a panic, because it is going to hit the Earth, the Soviets manage to reject the object. However, this is not necessarily good, since this seemingly unmanned aerial vehicle has a steam trail that destroys everything in its path, and the ship is now in a low orbit above the planet. In other words, with each pass a death lane follows, which could potentially kill us all !! So, it's up to the good US scientists (led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia) who will formulate and plan to save us - and especially save New York, which is on its flight path! Unfortunately, they cannot save Ottawa (I have never been there, so I cannot say whether it is a big loss or not), but thanks to good old American know-how, they can ultimately destroy this harbinger of destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the plot idea is quite good and quite original. But so many old clips of fighter planes and guys equipped with radar sights become obsolete, and it looked like a retreat. In general, a worthy, but barely inspired film that extreme fans of the genre might like - everyone else, watch it at your own risk.
