Actually, I love Christopher Lee, but it was not in his other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The film does not match its premise. It's not so scary, it's too melodramatic, and that is draaaaaags. Every time I thought, “Oh, HERE comes the good part,” the good part never came. <br /> <br /> Evil are not entirely convincing. Most of the other characters also lacked depth. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I were in the right mood, I could enjoy some MSTie-features at the expense of this movie, but ... Nahhhh ... It doesn't seem to be worth the effort. It was not really very good, it was not really very bad, it was just mediocre.
