this film was terrible. I thought with all what decent actors would be better. don't waste your time. Eva Longoria Parker was terrible. she must stick to desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes an actor B. The mess he made in the film, I could never be your woman, was the epitome of what I say. and the lake bell, she was cute, but definitely needed a few more acting lessons. watch the heavens with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a little better. or any other ghost movie. You will be grateful for not wasting your precious time. Ps i love you too well from the afterlife romance! It's time to start watching movies rated above 7 out of 10 and listen to people who have already seen it.
