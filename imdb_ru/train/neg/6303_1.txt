I had high hopes for this film. I found the room interesting. I was stuck with it, although I found an acting game, other than Helena Bonham Carter, unremarkable. I continued to hope that the time spent would pay off, but in the end I remained wondering why they bother to do that at all. Perhaps in the version of George Orwell there is a message that is worth transmitting. If this film achieved something, it inspired me to read Orwellâ€™s classics. I find it hard to believe that his story can be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the director's message says: "Worldly life is worth living," then they succeeded. I would recommend this film to anyone; 101 minutes of my life wasted.
