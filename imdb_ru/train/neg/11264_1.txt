I have not decided yet whether this will replace Anaconda as "The worst film I have ever seen." <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore sophisticated accents, low production performance and terrible cinematography, this film will do absolutely nothing for this. I went to see her only after I read the book, and I wanted to see how they would work out a complex plot in a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is no. Characters appear with little or no explanation of who they are, and then continue to play no important role in the story. Even the main characters act without a reason, so when the film reaches its climax, you don’t care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can agree that sometimes books have to be rewritten to fit into films and that it may be unfair to judge this film by the book from which it was adapted. But after my friends and I left the cinema, I had to spend most of the way home, explaining what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> They even change the true meaning of the title of the book “Rancid Aluminum” by squeezing it into yet another meaningless voice, just so that the film can have a cool title. <br /> <br /> This is a mess in the movie from start to finish.
