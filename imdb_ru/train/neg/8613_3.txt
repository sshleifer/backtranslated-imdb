I almost cried from watching this movie. Not from laughter, but from memories of the great film Rodney Dangerfield. Candyshack was his first and stole the film, Easy Money showed it at his best, and Back To School is definitely the classic masterpiece of the 80s. Then there were the ladybugs, and it was then that it began to manifest. Poor Rodney is aging (“Meeting with Wally Sparks” was a small step forward compared to the ladybirds, but said little). <br /> <br /> In “My 5 Wives,” Rodney plays Monte (the name he needs to love, since that is how he was called in Easy Money) of a rich (not always) guy who loves women and gets married like nothing. Well, now he inherited a huge piece of land, and since the land was ruled by the Amish, he inherited 5 wives. That sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is ALL. The script is so poor that Rodney seems to be talking about his one-sidedness to the camera, and all third-party characters have nothing to do. The film looks as if it was filmed on video with some really bad stunt episodes that are obviously not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he can't wait to say F (which he should do, because the movie has an R rating but plays like it was PG), and Jerry Stiller has a good 2-minute cameo . Don't get me wrong, sometimes I laughed at some Rodney jokes, but the poor man is too old and too slow. We can see his jokes coming from miles. And the film becomes too PC, which, thanks to the terrible 1990s, 70s and 80s, Rodney just doesn't work anymore.
