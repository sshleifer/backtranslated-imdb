Please, for the love of God, do not look at it. Now, having said this, I know that you think it cannot be so bad, is it? If everyone says as badly as they say, I have to watch it! Do not do that! It is like looking at a terrible accident involving small children and a gasoline tanker! You will be injured for life ... the image will never leave you! I could only watch for half an hour before I got sick. Acting is the worst thing I've ever seen, and I saw Barbwire !!! If you risk tearing your eyes out and making this film ... don't say that I didn't warn you! The cover and storyline is a trap! Zombies? Satire? Sean of the dead was great! This film should be the same .... right? NOT !! Letter = directing crap = acting rubbish = there was no acting skills. Still not convinced? Then forever your soul will suffer !!!
