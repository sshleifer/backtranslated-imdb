This film was exactly what I was expecting when I first read the casting. I probably could have written a more exciting plot, itâ€™s a pity that they left him a bunch of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was certainly a good skier, but he had to thank God (and us too) for not having to rely on his acting skills to earn a living. He can't play, he can't talk, he can't even move very well on the mainland without skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde, that's all. She was clearly not chosen for her amazing competence in dramatic roles, but most likely for her beautiful legs. However, I have to admit that she could be Tomby's acting teacher, because he is even a worse actor than she is, and this is funny, especially considering that she is not Italian. I laughed all the time, watched this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it made me laugh, loud, very loud.
