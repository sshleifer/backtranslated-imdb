Based on the ex-girlfriend and self-interest novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip commentator Sheila Graham wrote this dirty story. Gregory Peck behaves in shameless excesses like a strong alcoholic who gets drunk or damned; unlike the gentle and gentle talk of a real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on the Fitzgerald era of Hollywood writing, at the end of his life, the honored author actually lived a quiet life and effectively fought his alcoholism at a time when A.A. was not yet widely known. Fitzgerald was not too proud that he was reworking his stories about gangsters in order to support both his wife (in a psychiatric hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a used Chevrolet, his life was 180 degrees different from the one in this movie. <br /> <br /> Virtually every 20th Century Fox film, directed by Daryl F. Zanuka, and Virtually every film shot by Henry King, was a work of excellence. Favorite infidel was an exception.
