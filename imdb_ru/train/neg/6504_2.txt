Why did I spend 1.5 hours of my life on it? Why was this film ever made? Why do I even comment on this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said that this film requires patience to watch it, and it was not for everyone. I can not understand for whom this film. maybe after someone dropped the acid, ANYWHERE, WHERE, I could watch it and make some sense. It is incoherent, it is not experimental, it is simply and simply rubbish. The film does not follow the storyline, just when you think you have something, well ... no. <br /> <br /> I think the finale brought certainty to the film (without a pun), the viewer caught a glimpse of what could be happening. I don't think I put a spoiler here, not that it matters. This film is another one to be missed in the world of cinema.
