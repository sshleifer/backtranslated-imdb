This is really a new minimum of entertainment. Despite the fact that there are much worse films. <br /> <br /> In the Gangster / Drug genre, it’s hard to have a convincing storyline (in this film, I don’t mean, for example, Sebastian’s motives can’t be more contrived and worn-out cliches.) Then you will also need to establish a relationship between characters that would be believable (this movie is not.) <br /> <br /> Of course, Tristan is suspended from his family, but why is it again? what's the matter with his father when he should ask permission to go out at his age? An interesting picture, although to ask about the absence and necessity of rebellious behavior of children in the upper class family. But this film does not go in that direction. Even if it were possible, judging by the occasional back flashes. Is he already not in trouble, why is he doing it again? <br /> <br /> So, there are several interesting questions for a serious socially critical drama (but again, this film is simply not due to the fact that it focuses on “cool” production methods and special effects, but does not the characters are a moment for reflection and, above all, for moving the story along the path they want, and not paying attention to the story breathing and evolving naturally.) <br /> <br /> She wants to be a drama for not glorify substance abuse and violence (it would be politically incorrect but nowadays, isn’t it?), but on the other hand, it’s nothing more than a cheap action movie (as there are so many) with a medium set of actors and Vinnie Jones, who fails to completely destroy what’s left of his reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> In general, I ... just ... can't recommend it. <br /> 1 for Winnie and 2 for editing.
