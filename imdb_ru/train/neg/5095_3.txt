That evening I sat in this film, forcing myself to stick with it, although I never cared about any characters or what happened to them, because the two main characters, Gerard Philippe and Michel Morgan, were the main movie stars of their era, and I wanted to see them in “something else,” which certainly was. They both gave great performances, but with unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the whole film is about a small battered town in Mexico, where almost equally unpleasant characters live (the doctor, of course, is the main exception), What Michel Morgan ever sees in Philip to fall in love with it is never explained. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly based on the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that if Sartre’s work resembled this film, it must be a very mediocre attempt to imitate Camus’s masterful novel “Plague”, which tells about the plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> A good, but uninteresting film.
