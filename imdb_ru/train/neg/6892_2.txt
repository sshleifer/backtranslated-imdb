Oh my God. It was a really big mess that simply could not help it. Jeffrey (John Heder) is a 29-year-old man still living with his mom (Diane Keaton) and not going anywhere. Until his mother meets a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels), whom she can marry. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie if Heder hadnâ€™t played it. Jeffrey was so annoying from the very beginning there was no chance of loving him, and it would only get worse and worse. In the end, we should like him, but there was no reason, because he did not change from the selfish brute he was at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not even look like trying and is in terrible shape after 2007, because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where is their mother and son supposed to be? The only salvation is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, although they are also not very interested. In addition to a few small smiles, this film really does not deserve to be called a comedy simply because it has nothing to laugh at! If you're in the mood for the recent Diane Keaton movie, watch Mad Money or Smother, which is much better than this terrible effort.
