I grew up (b. 1965), watching and loving Thunderbirds. All my schoolmates watched. We played Thunderbirds before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Counting from 5 became an art form. I took my children to watch a movie in the hope that they would see what I loved as a child. How much disappointing. The only event was a live topic. Not that this compares to the original Thunderbirds account. Fortunately, on an early Saturday morning, one channel still plays replays of the series created by Jerry Anderson and his wife. Jonata Freyks should be given a directorâ€™s chair, his version was completely hopeless. Film waste Absolute trash. A CGI remake may be acceptable, but replacing the puppets with Homo sapiens subsp. Sapiens was a huge mistake of judgment.
