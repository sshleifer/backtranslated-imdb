I saw this film originally in the theater when I was 10. Even at this age, “humor” was slightly offensive to my teenage intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the past whenever I saw Ed Begley Jr. or Jeff Goldblum, I would cringe and begin to feel very awkward and even a little sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this film today, I was not sure why I felt this. Obviously, I blocked my memory of this film, but my negative feelings towards two of the criminals remained. Apparently, I forgot that I saw this film, but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that were stolen, and not the creators of this inhuman work. <br /> <br /> I was not brave enough to try to look him like an adult. I believe that as part of the healing process, which I probably should consider to counter this childhood fear, so that I can * really * leave it behind. Some regressive therapy and / or hypnosis may also not be a bad idea.
