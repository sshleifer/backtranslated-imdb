Of course, one of the funniest films by Eddie Murphy is nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, three hundred year old dragons and The Chosen. <br /> <br /> Murphy is the “Chosen One” in question, and as the Opening Song, he assumes that he is “the best man in the world.” A seeker of lost and missing children, a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) is approaching him, telling him that he is the “Chosen One” and that his destiny is to find and save the “Golden Child”. For if the child died, compassion would die with him, since he is the carrier of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all this focal trash doesn’t destroy it for you now, it will most likely start a movie once. Suffice it to say that the plot is disgusting and destroys the entire movie. Intended to become another means for the selfish brand of humor Murphy (comedy is not so good for you), the film fails on many levels. Even Charles Dans, like the wicked Sardo Numspa, can do little to try. Very stupid and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
