I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought it was too long in the first place. Secondly, the things I saw in the film were too unnatural to even have, as I thought, a comedy-like film, like everyone else. There is nothing funny in the film: the groom beats his girlfriend, beats him up. The film was too long - say that you want to fall asleep, and you want to know when it will end, when you wake up and continue playing! Some of the things at the reunion were too many to capture — like a singing lady — I felt I was almost watching a spiritual song here! Come on Perry, you can do it better!
