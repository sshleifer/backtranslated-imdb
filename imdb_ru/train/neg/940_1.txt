Okay, guys, we know why we are watching a movie like Invisible Maniac (just look at the cover, dude!). T and A are everywhere (with a much larger T than A). But ... shouldn't there be a story that could go with her? <br /> <br /> “Come on,” I hear you say, “It's just girls undressing! Who needs a story?” ?! "<br /> <br /> Well, if it was called Naked Maniacs, I wouldn’t have a problem. But since these guys write from Invisible Man, they need to tell a little about what's going on around , you know, so that your mind is busy. <br /> <br /> However, all they can collect is how the Mad Doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when he hacks, uses it to spy on naked women, and ultimately kills a lot of teenagers. And when you see how crazy teenagers look like he’s going, you will be grateful. <br / > <br /> One star for T and A, but for fans of skin, you have too much blood, so keep caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, this is Savannah.
