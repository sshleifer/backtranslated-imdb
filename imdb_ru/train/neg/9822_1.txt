There were moments during the film, I would like to be beaten to death. The only reason I survived the whole movie was because I could not believe how bad it really was, and I thought it should get better. It really was a horror movie. I was horrified that I wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that I would never return. The remaining two hours I spent in mourning for the loss. Please recommend this movie to anyone you want to torture, and tell them that the suspense will kill them.
