it became a cult film for Chinese students, although I did not watch it until it was broadcast on channel 4, UK. <br /> <br /> Full of cunning hypocrisy, the plot is mediocre and unreal; The “spirit” he wants to convey is how independent artists “resist the commercialization of the music industry”, maintain their “purity of the artistic soul” and not “sell themselves for dirty money”. it is really frivolous and superficial; The diologist is mostly pathetic. acting poorly ScenenPlay is full of artistic skill. This is a fantastic movie for kids and everything. <br /> <br />
