It’s just not enough. There are some fun spots, but not quite enough. I was very disappointed because I like silly movies. I expected it to be a hidden gem. DID NOT HAVE. It was a hidden turd. <br /> <br /> All the while I watched it, I thought, “God, I could do better, and I'm an idiot.” Do not believe a few good reviews. I was consumed by them. No way I was laughing at loudly. Maybe it was funny or in 1987, but, hell, today it did not work. This film had a promise, it just did not help. Perhaps if they rewrote it a few more times. I can't blame the actors. They were not the best, but they simply had nothing to work with. This film failed due to a worn letter. FULLY Frustrated.
