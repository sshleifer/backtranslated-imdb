It looks like one of those films that we think should appeal, but I didn't. He seemed to be trying too hard to be "fancy." All flash, no content. He has some beautiful scenes, and itâ€™s nice to watch any of them, but tying them all together, and it becomes a difficult task to just sit out. I rented it because of the vivid reviews on the video card and the fact that I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit pretentious and at times boring.
