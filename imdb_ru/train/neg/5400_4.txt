This is just a full-fledged blood festival based on the story of Stephen King. Two tabloid reporters, one experienced (Miguel Ferrer) and one not very experienced (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that the serial killer (Michael H. Moss) can really be a vampire. It is strange, but strange that this modern bloodsucker does not break through naturally, but with the help of the black Cessna, he searches for his victims. The blood actually becomes terrible when the film approaches its wacky final. Keep in mind that Mr. King has nothing to do with this movie. I admit it's a little scary in the tiny hours of the night.
