I must say, I usually like horror movies, which I have never seen ... however, this one was just pathetic for my bloody taste. I was used to creepy, painful views ... but this particular film was unfortunate. The action was terrible (still banal (not pun intended), the lines were pretty). And a continuation of this, the Scarecrow Killer was even worse! Yes, probably, when he just came out, there was a huge delight, and people liked it. But when films like The Ring and The Exorcist Emily Rose come out, such films make films like The Scarecrow childish. If you want the film to just pass the time, select this one! The special effects are so gentle. But, seeing that it was a low budget movie, I can see where it will happen. It will remind you of the movie "Children of Corn." Independent rock movies .... most of the time. So if you want to see how a scarecrow kills people with the help of corn cobs, or later, when it is attacked by 2 stuffed animals, then these films will be for you.
