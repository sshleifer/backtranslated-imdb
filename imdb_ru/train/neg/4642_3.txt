I saw Attic Rachel, thinking that I was in for a pleasant, intuitive ride. However, this should not be. Visceral, yes, but pleasant? That would be big, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I gave her the “3” is that Gunnar Hansen appears (very briefly) as one of the reprehensible characters in the film. How they lured Mr. Hansen to this ... work, I will never know. The idea of ​​the plot is interesting, but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian, and the action is mediocre. The only thing worse is the special effects. YIKES !!! I have seen the best effects in the elementary school game. Come on, Mr. Wu, it's time to change careers ... I heard they hire Mila in the diner! There are very few well-made Inde films coming out of Michigan ... and Attic Rachel is not one of them.
