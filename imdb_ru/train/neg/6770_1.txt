I went to see this movie from my 17 years. daughter. I insisted that we go to the matinee, not because I'm tense, but just feel that I have. In the spirit of NASCAR this is a sponsor’s dream. So much blatant advertising, it almost qualifies as informational advertising, if not the so-called acting game. Continuing the tradition, the Herbie franchise continues its stupid storylines, the car is just a “vehicle” (without a pun) for this movie ball. Herbie's earlier batches (albeit cheesy) were produced in more serious times, which made their assimilation a little easier. Miss Lohan, the reigning queen of Disney's drama, has few acting skills. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon were involved in such a project. Only a snack bar, there was a big robbery!
