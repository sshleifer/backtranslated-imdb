I really hate this backward show, it sucks! a great time, and personally I think it is insulting to a fabulous look (if you believe in fairies, that is); I mean, people who invented such nonsense should check their heads, eh? and there is also a lot of madness (an evil school teacher who, I think, becomes really old), as well as stupidity (the parents of the boy and the godfather of the fairies) in this show are two things that I insulted and hated around the world . <br /> <br /> Overall, I say that this show is so awful and should not be seen with curious eyes on ALL (this will make them bleed to death)!
