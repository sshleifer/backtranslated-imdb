In the first 20 minutes, the writer and director hacked every possible cliche. There was a NTSB chief investigator with a tortured family life; a politically tortured NTSB board member who plays [I can kill ANY TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of the accident victim; and an agonizing, sloppy lawyer stalking an ambulance. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still has no idea about the fragility of aircraft. The crashed plane was 737, and he basically sat on the ground like a hippopotamus, who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the aircraft was intact, and there were no wings or engines in the debris field. Most people should have gone in the light of how many people survived on the plane that was destroyed in Iowa after it lost hydraulics. Most of this TV plane was not even burned. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of a scene in “Air Force One”, where 747 falls into the water and then jumps, as if it was made of inch-thick steel. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad that it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, who accepts me more, commented on technical flaws. What struck me was how this POS could be made. Do the producers of these things become so accustomed to cliches that they cannot even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: "Yes, I want to spend a million dollars to make it a reality." I would like me to be the next guy appointment. I have a title for a wonderful bridge in New York that I would sell cheap.
