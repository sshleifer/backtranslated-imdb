This film should be number one on the 100th place. The game is so terrible that when my son and I watched him, we almost got sick. And the story is worse. I could go on and talk about how bad it is, but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to the Frankbob review, because I see that no one had bothered to do so. Don't waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. Thank God, we saw it on TV, so we didn't spend anything on it. If we, I would be forced to write the people responsible for this abomination, and would be forced to give up the execution in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed watching Carrie Fisher play. But I am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film. Do not spoil your opinion about Carrie by viewing it.
