It has to be the most creepy, most perverted holiday film I've ever blinked about, and that says something. I know that Mexicans have strange ideas about religion that mix ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their Day of the Dead is not as bad as their view of Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So ... Santa is not some funny fat drunk in a red suit (look at these pink cheeks sometime!). Rather, he is a skinny pedophile sociopath living in Heaven (or in heaven, depending on one), with a bunch of children working harder than those who work in Katy Lee Gifford sweat stores. They sing very cute traditional songs of their homeland, dressing in such stereotypical clothes, that I was surprised that there was not a single black-faced African American boy singing “Mommy”. This Santa is a pervert "Peeping Tom" who watches and listens to everything that everyone does, with his "eyes in the sky." Therefore, he can say who was naughty or cute (I would argue against those who are naughty). <br /> <br /> There is no Mrs. Klaus, there are no elves (why does he need elves? when does he have child labor?) and deer are mechanical clockwork toys! This floating strange show hovers on a cloud, supposedly supported by its silver lining. <br /> <br /> Santa's nemesis is ... Devil ?! What is it, Santa, our Lord and Savior? Weird. In any case, Satan sends one of his minions, a piercing devil named Peach, to try to spoil Christmas. Let me tell you straight: are the forces of pure evil trying to destroy a completely commercial and greed-driven holiday? Seems redundant, right? <br /> <br /> Pitch is completely ineffective. He tries to persuade some children to be bad, but he has no luck. I was greatly impressed by the plot of the holy little girl Lupe, whose family is very poor. All she wants is a doll for Christmas, but her parents cannot afford to buy it (they spent all their money on the cardboard from which they built their house). So Pitch tries to convince her to steal the doll. In fact, this is the only way a poor thing could get a doll, because being holy and praying to God and holy Santa doesn't really work. But Lupe resists temptation and tells Peach to stay with you, and therefore receives a reward for giving him such a creepy doll that you just know that it is sister Chucky. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Pythus manages to get Santa. stuck in a tree (uh-uh) where he saved Merlin! Merlin? You must be joking! Since when do mythical druid figures appear in Christmas tales or have anything to do with the Christian religion? And doesn't God condemn magic? They would have burned Merlin at the stake several hundred years ago, without asking him to come to the aid of one of God's Aspects (or, I believe, Santa must go against Satan). Is this movie one long HUH? from beginning to end, and it will make you wonder if this drunken egg you drank was not pointed or something like that. That was probably because this film is similar to one long giant DT.
