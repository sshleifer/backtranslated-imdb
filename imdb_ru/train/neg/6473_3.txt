In childhood, the first installment (“The Little Mermaid”) was my favorite movie. It was filled with wonderful characters, songs and a fun family movie. About a week later I saw this film for the first time. I believe that this film was like most of the sequels and did not surpass their original. I think I feel it, perhaps because I had high expectations, and I grew up. However, this is not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It starts when Ariel has just given birth to the beautiful baby Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by the Morgans (sisters of Eurselas), so they build a large wall around their house, which lies on the sea. When Melody grows up, she begins to wonder outside the walls, where she is forbidden to go. The trouble grows when Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to give any film, so you need to watch it to find out. I liked the fact that the voices are the same and sing beautifully again. I think this is a good family movie, although in general!
