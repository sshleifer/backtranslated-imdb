I really hoped to see an adaptation of such a classic story as the “Arabian Nights”. Instead, I was disappointed in the film, which could not hold my attention from the very beginning, although I tried to watch it twice !! <br /> <br /> It was a reward for the fact that Karadin was in this film, but that meant little, because the actors lacked sympathy. For something a bit like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras, it’s much better for action, comic moments and total enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Well, Son of the Dragon has many possible fans, but if you are looking for something that you can marvel at in terms of martial arts and storyline, you will not get it. If you just want the children to settle on a Sunday afternoon, then maybe this is for you along with 3 ninjas.
