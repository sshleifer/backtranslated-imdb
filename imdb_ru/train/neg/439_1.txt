It’s simply the monstrous theft of the infinitely better “Murder She Wrote,” it’s simply amazing that this poorly-written trash lasted for eight years. I am sure that most people who watched this uninteresting shit were over sixty and seventy, and they just tuned in because they had nothing to do, or simply remembered his star from the old show Dick Van Dyke. Van Dyke, who had a decent career only in the 1960s, never (by his own admission) was never an actor at all, and he was already too old to play the doctor when the series began in 1993. It looks absolutely ancient, as a result of many years of smoking and drinking. His untalented real son Barry, the wooden actor who rarely participated in everything that did not affect his father, plays his son on the show.
