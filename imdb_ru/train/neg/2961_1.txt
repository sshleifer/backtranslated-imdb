I looked after a family of three young children for the night, and their mother gave it to me to show that they had just grabbed him at Wal-Mart earlier this week. While watching all three children are physically ill. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they all took from school, but in fact it could be this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How anyone can produce this caliber of garbage is beyond me. Fortunately, I turned off the movie when I noticed that the children are not responding and behave strangely. For all parents, I strongly advise you not to let small children watch this movie.
