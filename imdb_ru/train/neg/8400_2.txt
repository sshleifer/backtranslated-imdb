Even the most ardent fan of puppets may not like the film, (I am one of them) puppets simply do not give any material for work. This is really a shame, because it is the only feature film puppets made with Curley, and this one effort is ridiculously painful when it could have great potential. Horrible music numbers don't help either. In the short film, which they made with the same title, more laughter.
