This version was moving a little slowly for my taste, and I suppose I have problems with this game from the very beginning. But first, the film is a typical television version of the film, which means that it does not have the talent of the original version of the film with William Holden. What they could not afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the film before 1966? So you could tell your little sister about the protests against the Vietnam War? Why not 1963 and not tell her about the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> With regard to casting, some fall into some blunders. Jay O. Sanders chose the right notes for his character, especially in his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, is missing lots of notes. He is believable as a former BMOC athlete, but he does not have the coarse sensuality of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looked a bit like a gorilla, so that all the women in the city would be offended by him (sorry for the pun). Gretchen Mall was beautiful, but she seemed too wise for the character she played. She did not project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters. But again, Holden was ten years old. Bonnie Bedelia was fairly easy to forget, since the mother and Mary Steenbergen seemed unable to decide whether she was playing Blanche du Bois or Catherine from Taming of the Shrew. <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Inge, I have always felt that such stories about a young woman, who prefer practicality to passion, always need an epilogue. The Twilight Zone, I suppose, suggests a likely epilogue with the epic episode of Spur of the Moment, where young Diane Hyland was chased by the bitter elder Diane Hyland, because the younger Diane Highland ran out with a guy like Hal Carter.
