The original film (dated 19 ??) showed no "monster", it is simply OFFERED scary "things". <br /> <br /> This version, however, shows all aspects of a “sick thinking ghost,” including unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> The “mystery” presented in the original film was the scariest part: someone simply did not know what caused the strange things that happened. Showing the face of the "old man", this Mr. completely disappeared. Worse: the special effects (crying wooden faces of children) are ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, too dramatic to be as scary as the original.
