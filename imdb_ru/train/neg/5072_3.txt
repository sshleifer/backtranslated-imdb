At some point, the assistant doctor calls himself Igor. <br /> <br /> Working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers can be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this film does not spend enough time learning the background. Most of the time on the screen is divided between a girlfriendâ€™s home quarrel in a coma and the pursuit of a donor killer. He tries to be a sci-fi / drama / thriller, but cannot cope with any of the three. <br /> <br /> In this remake of Frankenstein, everything that made the original good was missed. No one calls the doctor insane and does not even threaten to kick him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening one eye, and the amazing computer that does this is not even shown. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when it starts to go wrong, the reaction is weak. <br /> <br /> Any doubt who the murderer can be is destroyed when he gradually shows him in the same room with all the possible suspects. Finding a killer is as easy as opening one file and interviewing one person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco, as the situation is overloaded and undervalued. The initial sequence underlines the fact that this happens in the SF, the cable car plays a significant role, the hosts live in Victorian style on the top of the hill, Pier 39 appears, and the final standoff takes place in Golden Gate Park. More precisely, along the ten-foot side of the cliff in the park - enough to keep the bridge in the picture. After the obvious landscapes are rounded, no further attempts are made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> Here is the only saving grace. Keir Dullea shows a good range and shoots a pair of truly emotional scenes. Suzanne Love portrays recovering from a coma well. Tony Curtis gets only a few lines and twice as many evil guys look at most of Frankenzina, explained by his assistant. The little blond child also beats up pretty well. <br /> <br /> I also gave him one extra star for the scene where my husband is driving south from the bridge, he turns on a U-turn on an unrelated parking lot. and then he instantly returns to the bridge leading north. It takes a lot of something - courage, ignorance, time - to try to slip it to the viewer during one car chase.
