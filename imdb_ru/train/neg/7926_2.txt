The original classic of exploitation - although far from being pleasant on almost any level, relating to some guys who turn cats into monsters that feed on human flesh, because the cat food they do to people is redone with the addition of fiction elements. Cats cannot get enough, and when the spoiled food ends, the cats turn to their owners. Poorly collected at almost every level, this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that was actually used to play in movie theaters in the early 1970s, updated by alien races of cats and dogs fighting for supremacy. Directed by Ted Mikel is a hacker, but he is such a nice person (I usually like the guy because of his smile calling interviews and commentary tracks) that you can largely excuse the garbage that he mostly received. Mickels wanted to make films, and he did not care how they turned out while he was producing something. More power to him, but I would like him not to subordinate us to his home movies.
