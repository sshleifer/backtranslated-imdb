I have to tell you right away, of course, I am not an authority on Bollywood films and have only seen a few. However, if you have never seen, do not start with this! I really liked the ones I saw before, but I just could not bear it. I also have to tell you in advance that I could not finish this film - it was so annoying. So why is it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. In the film there is a character named Rambha. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - that I would never have believed that this was possible. He is # @ ^! # Annoying !! He spoke in falsetto, and I think it should have been a comic relief. Instead, he simply annoyed me and wanted him to die ... slowly! His voice, his manners and his opposition - he seemed not to shut up and dominated every scene he was in - and he had to die! <br /> <br /> 2. Heroes had an amazing ability to confidently dodge AK-47 bullets. I'm not kidding - there was a scene when several unarmed guys fought with a small army of guys with these machine guns !! And again and again they avoided taking one bullet And beat the hooligans !!! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" worldly !! <br /> <br /> 3. The film was damn loud, with your face and intense - it actually made my brain bleed !! As if the movie was made by people influenced by meta! Crazy camera angles, intense music and action, action, action ... this film is clearly intended for those who can not make a movie with a plot and wants almost 100% of the action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters, their actions and motives made no sense ... in general! <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're the most ardent Bollywood fan, you can stand this film, but I can understand why it is on the infamous IMDb Bottom 100 list. !!
