I liked Boyleâ€™s performance, but this is the only positive thing I can say. Everything was overzealous to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke as if you were expecting your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he pretended to be a tortured policeman with a stone heart or an evil villain. The creaky voices for the frame seemed to me amateurish. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and find the best music. And what about all this police torture in 1984? It was completely redundant and had nothing to do with the real events of history. In fact, Cox added a lot of things that he seemed to think were really cool, but he had nothing to do with this story. This is a big disappointment, because one of the things that make Borges stories so good is his minimalism - they are closely related, without unnecessary details. This film is just the opposite. I stopped watching the scene where Lonnrot was asking the guy from Yidische Zaitung or so. I spent $ 4 on rent, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and, I hope, save others from making the same mistake.
