Most of the scenes should be cropped. There are many scenes that should have been cut off. For example, a scene in which hunters mention “I have spiders on my penis,” “I like a penis,” playing in a dirty scene or a scene in a bar, where the main work of professional dinokrok hunters is a snake charmer. <br /> <How about other horribly disjointed scenes involving a woman, Diana, who wants to lose her virginity with a guy who walks, as if he wears women's panties three sizes smaller. While they were making love, did they not realize that they were dealing with a little boy who would soon run away and lose his head? Why did they do in the living room? I mean, his head really turned over. What about the beach scene, very reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene on Grant Lake. All these strange scenes can be easily renamed and announced as a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here, in my local cinema, the cinemas advertised Dinokrok for many months, and I am glad that I didn’t watch it because I later learned that it was only shown for 1 or 2 days, before it was canceled. The film was very bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the previews. It shows the foot of Dinocroc, like a child in green pajamas and slippers with claws, who walks up and down like a 2-year-old child. It could easily be referred to as the geniuses of a baby. <br /> <br /> If someone from the filmmakers wants to know what should not be done, this is a real classic trash. For example, Diana's boyfriend, who walks as if he has had syphilis, makes us think that the poor woman sees this guy, who looks drunk before he drinks a beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? The man in shorts looked more interesting than the whole movie about Dinocroc. His game was so bad that he makes a much better replacement for Mr. Bean. MOVE OVER Rowan Atkinson, here is a man with the best comedic talent in a sci-fi horror movie. Perhaps the worst casting in the history of Hollywood.
