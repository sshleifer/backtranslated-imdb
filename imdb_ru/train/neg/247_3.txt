Last night was 9:30 pm in the trailer of my friend, and we were so excited to watch South Park (new episode). The fact is that in my country, South Park goes on the air at 10:30 pm, and we decided to kill time by watching the broadcast of the “Father of Pride” show. To begin with, I watch only episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it to be pointless and rude, so I thought, “Damn it, I have a soccer game tomorrow early, so I have to stop watching silly cartoons.” But yesterday I tried to give Father Pride a second chance. I find that it is a complete robber of the Simpsons, replacing only yellow human characters with lions. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I wonder why he received a TV-14 rating. I find the Simpsons much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity on this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons are also much more brutal (Halloween specials) and rough. I also heard that the creator of the series also shot "Shrek 2", well, I have news for him: "Shrek 2" was much better, and I think that he remained too much in the family theme. However, I must admit that the Father of Pride really made me smile (even burst out laughing) three or four times. <br /> <br /> In general, I am not against the Father of Pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. I saw the Simpsons better. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
