In the glorious days of the 90s (may the soul keep God), you can turn on the great Central Comedy at any time of the day and see the greatest comedy show in the history of Saturday Night Live. It was a great show, whether it was the original players Not-Ready-for-Primetime or the second golden age of SNL with great people - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then everything went to hell, I first met MadTV about a year and a half ago, and I think I passed out from shock. How could a show so terribly prevail for so long? There are so many terrible flaws. I suppose I will start by writing. The letter is, for the most part, terrible. This is nothing more than kindergarten humor. The cast, for the most part, talentless. There are several sketches that I liked, for example, Miss Swan and Stewart, and there are several talents on the show, such as the gorgeous Alex Borstein. Phil Lamarr is a talented actor, just not a comedian. Although there are a few rare moments haha, they are not enough to atone for this endless series of terrible trivia populated by dumb idiots. I miss this.
