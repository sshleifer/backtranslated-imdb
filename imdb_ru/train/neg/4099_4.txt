Malva gets into the ear of Teenage Ape. When she wakes up, she is much hotter (the roles that Debbie Rochon played in this sequel), and craves revenge on those who have done her wrong. Since the subtitle and decoration of the box imply that this is really the take-off of Kill Bill, but this is Chris Siver’s film, this wild incompetent satire (and I use this last term extremely loosely) is better than in the first film, but In truth, I was so incredibly drunk when I saw the previous film that I can’t even hope to compare them at the moment. But I must have enjoyed it since I bought a sequel (look when I'm drunk, I like it, because of the lack of a better word, full and wacky movies) There are some loud laughing moments (very few), but I remember Bonejack is funnier though. Well, at least a little over an hour, it is very fast for what it costs. <br /> <br /> My rating: D + <br /> <br /> Additional features of the DVD: audio commentary by director Chris Siver, actress Debbie Rochon and the gang LbP; Siver's second commentary; 31 minutes Making Featurette; 6-minute tribute to Lloyd Kaufman low-budget paintings; Fake 2-minute syrup ads; photo gallery; Promo trailer; and trailers for: Mulva, Quest for the Egg Salad, Fiilthy McNasty 1, 2 and 3; "Wild Man", "Costumer", "Midnight Skater", "Summer of Demons" and "Splashes of Unrestrained Struggle"
