For a fan of the movie, White Noise was a complete disappointment, since for the cinematographer the cinema was pretty good, well lit, good cinematography, a reasonable direction. But like the film, it seemed as predictable as all the other “so-called” horror films that recently flooded the market. Despite the fact that the “cold factor” was actually present in it, the very concept of E.V.O (phenomena of the electronic voice) did not seem plausible. This film did not explain the causes of certain events, but continued them. The acting was far from stunning, and the main character showed no emotions, like many recent thrillers / horror movies. <br /> <br /> Definitely, I will not buy a movie on DVD and would not recommend anyone to rush to watch it,
