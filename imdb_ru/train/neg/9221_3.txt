Everything you need to know about this film takes place in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack reflecting the end of the 60s, and all but a couple of his characters are unlikely. Once you receive this message, you can also switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> Davisâ€™s protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then, by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world - instead of living in a fantasy film, of which he is supposed to be the director, - he does this by pushing her aside and connecting with the actress he has idealized. without any reasons. The couple laughs, and a thoughtful artistic guide is the only things worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as documentary evidence of the fall of Jason Schwartzman from Mount Rushmore. In Rashmore, the annoying rudeness of Schwartzman needed to be overcome, but here it is the only quality of his character. Schwartzman's family connection clearly pushed him to this role; here we hope that his choice will improve.
