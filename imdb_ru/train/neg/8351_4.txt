Even on average, even by the standards of the Monogram, this riddle (a remake of the Sphinx) has a strange plot that does not have much effect - you will see it in about ten minutes. The two main characters from the very beginning have a pleasant dialogue, but John Hamilton is hopelessly boring, because the villain (well played by Lionel Atville created the role) and Warren Heimer's irritable blow is rather annoying. Nevertheless, it is worth looking at the five-minute speech of the incomparable Mantan Morland as Nicodemus the janitor, who becomes a better defender during a cheerful performance in the courtroom. You must hand this to Bill "One-Take" Bodin; he was not a big director, but he always beat the ordinary programmer with some kind of stupid vaudeville.
