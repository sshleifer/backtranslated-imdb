I bought it (it was only 3 dollars, ok?) Called the "Gray Question". I was intrigued by the novelty of meeting with Sheriff Rosco in a role not from DukesOfHazzard. As other observers have warned, this is a rather boring story about a top-secret government experiment that was unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are many suitable shots, especially at home with a pool in front of it. Some characters and interiors are so unattractive that, I think, the filmmakers worried that we could forget who is who, so they continue to give us advice, first showing the outside of the building. This is actually pretty funny. After a while, a snapshot in the pool reminds the TV channel's identification logo, reminding us that we are watching "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I also liked the two fights with names. At some point, an angry test subject scoffs at someone who is in charge of it, calling it “Scientific devil!”. This is just a very inappropriate insult. A few scenes later, another topic lets off steam, mumbling about this “scientific brand!”. It seemed to me very awkward. <br /> <br /> Someday this movie will disappear forever. After another ten years, it will probably be impossible to find any copies of it. Almost as never was. <br /> <br />
