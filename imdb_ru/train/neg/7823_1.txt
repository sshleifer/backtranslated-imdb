This film was extremely poorly thought out from all sides, except for the technological. I stood and watched everyone leave the theater, their faces dried up, as if their life sparkled before their eyes — their eyes wandered over the neighbor, wondering if they were just them. I mean, how a movie can really be bad. Nobody admits this, this is a classic case of "The Emperor does not wear clothes." “Who am I to question the movie with the guy who stops the jet airliner?” But the fact remains, every member of the audience thinks about what I'm writing right now. I actually plagiarized their faces. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Lois is awakened only by force, she does not even drink a cup of coffee with Superman in glasses, which does not stop jet liners. It can not be a look in his eyes at the depths of his soul or something like that. In the old Supermen she had some level of connection with him, he was not number one priority, obviously, but this reinforced her character because she was “torn”. I bet Henry Kissinger would even win this Lois to Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now officially Kryptonite does with Superman what food at McDonalds does with Aug. person. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" He loses his earthly dad and then finds his real super dad, the story fascinates every step of the way. He is a man, he treats people and feels love for people, he treats high school students, he treats people who feel differently. He is concerned. Superman Returns, Superman seems to relate only to Supermen, and it seems that he is just “doing work” when he saves people. <br /> <br /> There is something in Clark that Lois loves, she is really inwardly in love with him, but she may not admit it, and when he enters the picture as Superman, it throws a bend in love on the rocks. Without Superman, she would have fallen in love with Clark (at least that is what the film indicates, whether it was intention or not). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and a SUPERMAN; Clark for Lois is like a heap of horses. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN DOUBLE I just looked again. As a child, I “thought” that I liked this action, but now I know that it was the HISTORY that held me back then, watching this again and again. I think if I saw Superman Returns as a child, I would hate him too. <br /> <br /> There are so many hearts, souls and superpowers in this film that it is sick. Superman abandons his strength for love, as the world story continues, and meanwhile, FUNNY, Lex Luther has something fantastic in his sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THIRD Now between Superman and Lana there is a three-way love story and Clark, only humanity wins, and Clark's inner nature wins Superman's power, because when his SUPERMOral nature is gone, and he is Superman (who doing human things with her superpowers), she sees that this is not the power of Superman, in which she is in love, this is not a SUPERPOWERFUL person, but a SUPERMORTAL person she loves - and who is really SUPER. And when she tells Clark that she “prefers” him to Superman, he is delighted, he again established a human connection. He wants to be accepted for who he is, and not just for his ability to bend steel. THIS IS A STYLE OF PERSONNEL THAT HAPPENS FROM SUPERMAN RETURNS. <br /> <br /> Clark super sneezes to help the child strike - humanity again. Plus, it's an interesting use of super power. He doesn't just use brute force. <br /> <br /> He crushes coal into a diamond for his woman, because she had to sell her, love is the only thing that forces him to use his strength except for salvation. <br /> <br /> It seems nothing is at stake in Superman Returns. Even in Superman Three, we see the damage caused by the plot of the world domination of Nemesis ... we see the suffering, we see how it affects Priora, others and people in the middle of it ... there is no damage, especially. emotional from Lex's conspiracy to sink the US. We see a crystal ball thrown into space. Superman had to show ingenuity in the first three Supermen, in order to stop the conspiracy against him, he could not simply “gain access” to his superpowers. In the first, he had to stop two rockets flying in different directions, and then break his universal mandate and erase the story in order to save Lois's life ... (this was THIRTY YEARS AGO !! ") In the second, he had to outwit three guys that he was already more POWERFUL, but in combination with the genius of Lex and the immoral tactics of the villains, defeating Superman was not enough, he had to fight one another and outwit them ... In Superman III again his superpowers were not enough to win ... He had to outwit the computer, which he calculated everything he saw. He could not use direct aggression on a computer, because he counted it in advance, so he had to use benign acid, which would be fatal for a computer only after the computer reacted to the aggression, and discovered this acid earlier, when he could not simply use his superpowers to HIT fire because it was a chemical fire, so he had to use his super brain - he could not carry water, so he froze the lake threw it in the fire .. Now Superman Returns, he just throws island in outer space, as the night the pace for UPS. He does not need to figure out anything, he simply uses his "superpower". And the brilliance of Lex Luther was shown on the premeditation level of a drug addict who had just run out of junk. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that he threw this island into outer space after being hit with a brick from the brickonite right in the bloodstream And on the island itself there were drops of kryptonite on his face, but he just looked away and a nose, as if it was not Gray Poupon whom he was looking at.
