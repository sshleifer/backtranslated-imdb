You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), their manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this group) makes the same mistake by putting S Club (another of my favorite bands) into their own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, John Lee, Bradley McIntosh, Joe O'Mira, Hannah Spearritt, and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Mostly they ask their boss for a break, they continue, and while they see themselves there on TV! Three of them change places, and vice versa, half discover that they are clones made by greedy scientists, and the other half just get in trouble. Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. There may be more plot in this film than in the movie Spice Girls, but apart from the songs “Bring it all back,” “Don't stop,” and “The dream never came true,” this is not an extra reason to see this movie. Soon after the band broke up forever. Adequate!
