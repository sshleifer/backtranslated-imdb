If you like to watch what was supposed to start as a two-hour film in the form of unrelated flashes of stealth, you will like this film. Otherwise, you just wonder how they could make such a film out of something so simple to transfer to the big screen as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In the preview for the film, many scenes were shown that were not in the film, but in the film; some scenes simply do not make sense. Although the film is a little less than an hour and a half, I can only remember one really memorable moment - before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
