This is the worst movie I've seen in many years! The mockery begins and continues in the same way. I think when something happens in this film, and the acting is even worse. The ending raises a bit and saves the film from total failure. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry, Tim Burton Batman was good, but this sucks.
