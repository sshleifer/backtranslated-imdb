I liked this show! I think it was nothing wrong with that! Only that Spidey beats no one, but only because the show does not suck! Some people just think that this show is bad because of this. The story was wonderful and it was fun when other heroes appeared, such as X-Men, Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Bad Sandbox never to appear, but I like it! Best Spidey show ever !! My favorite episodes: 1. Turning point 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobgoblin 4. Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are a few episodes that were really very bad, for example: Rocket Racer and The Spot which was awkward to watch. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. First, Morbius sucks plasma instead of blood, and I don't like vampires. And it annoys me that he was almost the main villain in the second season. Of course, I have to mention Hydro Man! He was terrible! I rather see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey as Spiderman! <br /> <br /> But I think everything that was bad!
