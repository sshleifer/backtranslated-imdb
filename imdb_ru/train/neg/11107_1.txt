It was a terrible movie. There was no storyline at all. To top it off, when they could not explain blood and blood (the only good part) ... they threw a few aliens! I hate it when the directors (or something else) run out of ideas, and then blame the aliens! Watch this movie if you want. But do not say that I did not warn you. Two things: how could Vinnie say “welcome” when he didn't have a language? It is a pity that Mr. Jones did not have a more important role. The second thing that bothered me was why the boils of Winnie Jones showed us, and he cut them off and put them in blue liquid, then they no longer play a role. Why not? I do not like it when they show me something, and it has nothing to do with the plot. In short. Bad story I would not waste my time - I wish I had watched the Mirrors.
