I think Stuart Bliss is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The scene was terrible, and the plot was ridiculous. I understand the fact that the protagonist's wife, who left him, provoked a mental disorder, but it became so stupid and boring that after a while I could care less about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film continued. over and over again the same ideas without anything new or surprising to add to the plot. All this with the Geiger counter became too much some time after Stewart began to open his wall to see what was behind it, after the counter indicated that there was something there. <br /> <br /> Then there were repetitive scenes with the Flyer, and entangled where he meets himself. <br /> <br /> I should have known that this film was a failure when I didnâ€™t recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie appears, read the book! You will be better.
