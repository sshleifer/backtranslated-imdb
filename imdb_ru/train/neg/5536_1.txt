Zombie rebellion does not have redemptive traits. I am tired of people claiming that this is not so bad, and that the effects must have been more useful in 1936. I suspect that this is not the case: not that IQ has increased dramatically over the past 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably as bored because of this garbage as the average viewer today. What for? Just try to watch the first scenes and count the pauses between the events taking place, the terrible choice of when to cut to close-up, the editing of slapdash, which seems to include an additional two seconds for each shot to clarify the time. Pay attention to the completely unnecessary dialogue: "I'm going to make tea / go out / read my book now." "You?" "Yes I." This exchange occurs several times. Usually I would like this, being a HUGE fan of bad movies, but watch how sluggish actors mumble their banal and tedious lines, and all the desire to laugh at the film gradually fades away. This disinterested, all-consuming waste of time is much worse than energetic, creative insane, such as Plan Nine from space or Santa Claus conquers the Martians. Those who claim to be “better” than these more interesting films have an idea of ​​entertainment in the opposite direction. This film is not bad in the sense that your jaw dropped in surprise: it is bad in the sense that your eyes are slowly closing from boredom. Which is much worse.
