Personally, although I can really appreciate really good movies, I also have a strange ability to enjoy to some degree even the dirtiest garbage. You know, those times when you just want to sit and watch some awful action movie that kills time. This is the only film that I remember, actually closing in the middle, and Iâ€™m absolutely not going to return to finish it. The plot was so far-fetched and predictable that I said what the next scene would be (and I am usually not very good at it). The actors were terrible, I saw how best to play in high school plays. Even the scenes were bad, the flow was wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is like a parody that has forgotten the funny.
