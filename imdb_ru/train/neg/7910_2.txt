I saw most of “My Bollywood Bride” today at the IAAC Film Festival in New York, and I had to leave the theater because of the feeling of nausea in me. I have seen Bollywood films, and I have seen the satires of Bollywood films. This film could not decide what he would like to be, so in the end he became a joke on himself. <br /> <br /> It seems that it was freely copied from such films as “The Bride and Prejudice” and “The Bollywood Call”, and that sloppy, lazy work in this. How can we stop Bollywood from its determination to stick to excessively overloaded scripts? Is there no one who could display millions of real, exciting stories that probably exist and are happening on earth of a billion people? An overly smart driver, a cow in the street, unreasonable scenes from abroad, meaningless scenes from the streets of Mumbai are all here. All possible cliches about India were honestly included. So disgustingly predictable. ugh !!! Acting performances are weak in all directions, with the exception of Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. I wonder why she chose such a project?
