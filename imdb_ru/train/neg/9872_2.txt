It is hard to believe that the film from this book can surpass its horror! The plot is so contrived and incredible. starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to save her from pain! Then we have a conspiracy of at least six, and possibly more people (including the clergy) involved in all crimes. Then we have a wife who, it would seem, during the whole trip on the ferry goes from being relatively happy to a very short hit on the tracks. A very unpleasant and cool mother, supported, supported and supported by a politically correct group of friends! The relocation from the island off the coast of South Carolina did not help history, although it may have helped the directors' budget. The very beautiful buildings supposedly containing the monastery did not seem to be a logical fit for an island small enough to require a golf cart and such a small ferry. Kim Basinger, whom I really love, is very painful in this film, and her hairstyle certainly belongs in another decade. Besides, there is simply no chemistry between her and any of the men's groups. I totally disliked the book from which it was taken, but really read it all. The film, to which I continued to surf, had to go out whenever this saccharine music became too much. If you don't like the incredible story, the wooden game, the distorted mix of religious / mythological / allegory, my advice is to skip this one. Oh, and maybe a little critic of the carp, but didn't the caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery.
