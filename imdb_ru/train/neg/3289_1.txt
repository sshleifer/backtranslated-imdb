I will tell you what happened, some people with money thought that it would be nice to spoil one of the best shows that were on television. We really needed to redo the big screen? Did they ask the fans? I wonder what all the fans would feel if they did a remake of the Rocky Horror Picture Show with actors like Ashton Crutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southland, took all the music and made it a drama. Do you think they would like it? This film does not have the same feeling as the original. Of course, the original was sometimes a bit trivial, but Bo and Luke were always good, they had problems, because they were always in trouble, and their main goal was to help the people who passed through the city. None of this mattered to the people who made this film; they may never even have seen the original show in its entirety. My big question is what will they destroy next?
