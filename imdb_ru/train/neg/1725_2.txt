- The film begins with a meteor falling into a lake. Unbeknownst to the locals, the dinosaur egg is also located at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. As you may have guessed, hatches for eggs produce a dinosaur that terrorizes the community. <br /> <br /> - What a complete trash. It’s not that I object to a clay dinosaur that stops moving, but everything else in the film bothers me. The game is terrible. The dialogue is completely ridiculous. Comic relief is not comic at all. Logic does not exist. Any similarity between the "scientists" in this film and a real scientist is purely by chance. I could talk forever about the bad aspects of this film, but you get the idea. I feel it is pretty safe to call this disaster “MST3K Worthy”.
