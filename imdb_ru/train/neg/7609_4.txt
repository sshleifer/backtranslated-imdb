Being a big fan of Korman's horror films, I expected a little more from his western than I received. Well, I was entertained, everything is in order. I laughed almost as much as Mel Brooks's “Shining Saddles” looked. <br /> <br /> Look at the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west. You can kill time by counting them if something boring happens. And the horses, it seems, also have gears, given the pursuit of accelerated motion. See also the rotating bar halls of the queen of the traditional saloon in the wild west, performing a performance reminiscent of a certain fashionable dance of the 1920s, here decades before the invention of style. I hope that the salon around them will not collapse. <br /> <br /> In the center of all this chaos, the main actors are doing a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all right. Special praise for the fact that they did everything possible with the material, which, it seems, was mainly taken from "Johnny Guitar", but not quite impressive. But there’s nothing wrong with that ridiculous western. Just like a really bad old horror movie, it can fail in one case, but in any case it can bring joy. This is one of the reasons why I like the work of Corman, and therefore I dare to recommend you to watch this film, if you have such an opportunity.
