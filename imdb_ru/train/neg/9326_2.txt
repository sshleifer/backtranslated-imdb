Me and a group of friends are making horrible videos to laugh at them, believe me, this led to terrible money spent, as well as good laughter. S.I.C.K. This is one of the best horror films, but funny, which we shot. The plot is crowded, the whole carry friends into the forest and never return, the thing is very old. The worst part of the movie looks like you are visiting a local butcher shop, except that it is a little dirtier and with blood on a dough that looks like meat. And if someone has ever been afraid of this film, he must remain on the Cartoon Network until the end of his life, it is a pity. The good side of the film is that the two girls in it are quite hot, one is better than the other, and you see them both naked during the movie. Another good aspect is that this film is sometimes so bad that you will laugh until you cry. I don’t like to watch a terrible game or rent these horrible videos at the box office, I don’t find it funny, but seeing how much effort these people put into it and still go so bad, it's fun and worth renting. If you are not too mature to laugh at someone else's failures, I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> If you rented / bought it to laugh about it, I would give 8.5.
