Yes, people are racist. People are even racists in college. This is a good moment, and the problem of racism has been repeatedly addressed in countless films. What distinguishes Higher Education from the package is that it solves the problem of racism in the most stupid and predictable way, oh, yes, this is also in college. <br /> <br /> This film is devoted to this problem of racism, as Frankenstein solves most problems, he repeatedly hits you in the head in a cruel and sluggish way. Most of the characters are cartoons, one-dimensional, caricatures (feminist lesbians, evil black men) that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of challenging stereotypes, this film is overpopulated by them. Evil dark-skinned men feel betrayed, feminists hate men, etc. (One feminist even holds a sign that says “Dead men do not rape.” Do you see what I mean?) If someone seems to be running alone or a rapist, he will probably behave exactly as you would expect. The changes that the heroes undergo seem obvious to everyone except the people in the film. A big turn in the plot depends on whether violent neo-Nazis behave like violent neo-Nazis. I guess you just need to look to find out what's going on. <br /> <br /> Another problem I encountered in this film is that it must be “tough” and “tough”, but they make the Nazis the bad guys. I agree that the Nazis are evil, but this is my point of view. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; we will not discover new ways here. The Nazis were portrayed as villains from the 1930s. The film does not challenge any points of view and does not make bold statements. It simply concerns questions about which we all know, awkwardly, after school in a special manner. Being anti-rape, fighting racism, and an anti-fascist not quite taking a tough stance on a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Higher education is predictable, cartoonish, and the word is stupid. Avoid at all costs.
