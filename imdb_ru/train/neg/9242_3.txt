What a fantastic premise: a film about Berlin airlift. Everything should be. Tragedy. Exciting. Partnership. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and cool US pilots. love and tears. What we have is a movie without all of the above. Heino Ferch is trying to impersonate John Wayne or so, but fails miserably. It acts so wooden that at any moment it can break. He is trying to play a tough guy, and not be a tough guy! Why does Bettina Zimmerman's character fall in love with him? Because they threw stones at the lake? Because he brings her coal bricks? SFX is very, very well made. Too much though. Hundreds or so of airplanes over Berlin look like a squadron of fighter-formers, and not like organized air transport ?? as it really was. Interestingly, the White House, the Kremlin and the office of General Lucius D. Klein seem to be one dark and dusty complex. Pay attention to the same curtains, hanging deep in the windows, as if a protective screen from radioactive fallout. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. GLUE looks like a small, insecure, insecure general who trusts his noble idea of ​​airlift. He was quite the opposite. Thus, you combine all these individual errors, and the result is a film in which there is no passion, no uncertainty, or historical accuracy. Sadly, did it start so promising ??
