I loved Adriann Curry before this show. I thought she was great at Top Model and was very happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems to be a great guy. But this show just made me sick! I am so angry with both of them for what happened on this show. I do not care that they were of different ages, I know that age can not stand between love. But Adrianna, you have been together for only seven months. I was not at all surprised that he did not offer. And I do not see the attractiveness of forcing someone to marry you before he is ready. If this is so, then why not just ENJOY each otherâ€™s company and not love each other, and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and a chain is completely unnecessary, it is clear that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, shame on you for breaking and still proposing to her! You survived two unsuccessful marriages, how could you rush to the other just because she broke? I hope the relationship continues, but I really feel that the marriage was hasty and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons for entering into marriage from within the marriage.
