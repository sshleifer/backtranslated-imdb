DR. SEUSS 'LIKE CHRISTMAS CHRISTMAS STYLE / (2000) ** (out of four) <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a festive film that will inspire you to seasonal moods and continue the traditional classic fable of Dr. Seuss, I do not see Dr. Seuss "how the Grinch stole Christmas. "If you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any pleasure from this film. It contains a lot of colors, creative design, creative design of scenery and costumes, joyful load sounds, and characters are made so that they look like the real inhabitants of the fictional village of Willville. Unfortunately, the positive elements of the film end there; the rest of the performance is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to giggle on the screen, grinning devilishly, all the time I'm through an overly broad script that has nothing in common. <br /> <br /> Many people will learn the story of how Grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I won’t waste my time writing a detailed synopsis for you to read However, I will say that the story of the film is made in three main actions: the development of the grinch and the setting, the festival in Vivilla and the vision of Dr. Seuss about how the one who takes Christmas from Christmas. There are many familiar names in the credits here, but no familiar faces. As in Battlefield Earth, I just don’t understand why producers hire expensive actors only to protect their identity with unrecognizable cosmetics and costumes. Despite this, there is Molly Shannon from SNL as Betty Lou, wife of Bill Irwin, later playing Lou Lou, father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor, the Mayor of Wilville, Anthony Hopkins, gives his voice to the narrator of the film, and Christina Baransky is Grinch’s lonely lost lover. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are trying to add originality to the story, adding unnecessary scenes and paying too much attention to little Cindy Lou. The screenplay of Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just seems to go all over the landscape of the film; There is practically no director Ron Howard, and the script is predictable, too extensive and far-fetched. The only character who has been given any differences is the Grinch himself, all the other characters are plot puppets, shapeless and uninteresting. And the dialogue is too zealous and too banal to be nothing but pathetic. Example - Grinch: Oh, manliness Who! <br /> <br /> Redemption factors of the film take the side of the gifted director Michael Korenblit, costume designer Rita Raik and an extensive make-up department. “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” is a very beautiful production. The scenes and atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and inventive; as if spectators are visiting the world, as in a dream. Wilville's people are smeared with cosmetics, to such an extent that we cannot tell an actor who speaks lines without humor. Dazzling, I really can't do justice to the speeches, because they are too attentive, because an expensive technical department takes their place. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is one of the actors I can talk about. His performance is something that almost destroys the film itself. He is too selfish, like the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical, to allow the story to become recognizable as Seuss's work. Surprisingly, although there are some funny moments because of a few ingenious, ingenious episodes, there is no laughter due to the foolish stupidity of Jim Carrey. It looks like the film was written specifically for Carrie to replay his role. This factor only leads the film to a wild, but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas." <br /> <br /> After this film, historians should check out the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss, may have turned over in his grave. <br /> <br />
