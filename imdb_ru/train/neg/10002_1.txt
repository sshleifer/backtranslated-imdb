Sorry everyone, I know that it must be a “feature film”, but wow, they had to hand out weapons to the show so that people could beat their brains and not watch. Although the scene design and photographic direction were excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The lack of a sound track was cruel. These frames were too long. How long can you watch two people just sitting and talking? Especially when in a dialogue two people complain. I really had a hard time getting through this movie. The performances were excellent, but how much of this dark, dark, not inspiring material can you take? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise it was the robbery of Bergman. And I'm not a fan of it either. I think that anyone who says that he enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of it is, well, lying.
