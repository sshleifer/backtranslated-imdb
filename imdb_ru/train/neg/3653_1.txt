I can't help it, but I like movies that should be scary and just plain bad. I personally listed it in my top 10 worst films right below the creatures of the abyss! Watch this movie and laugh, just donâ€™t expect to see any academic awards for acting. More chance to understand the film itself. Honestly, although I have seen much worse than that. Plus, some kind of maniac traveling through the desert, destroying the same people who have just died, it is incredible that this should be original. I think this is one of those love or hate films. You can make a decision, yes, it's terrible, but it somehow pushes away, which is why I love it
