If I had made this project, I would have provided more material, stopped at road signs, so that people knew where they were, and lingered in places to look at the landscape. To make such a film, you need from 60 to 90 minutes.

See how Railway / Canadian National Cinematography Council starring Buster Keaton (one of his latest films) in this comic film Buster Keaton hits the railway line in Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia.
