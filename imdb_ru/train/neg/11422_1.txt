I saw it in the theater when it came out, and only yesterday I saw it again by cable. This allowed me to get to know again how disgusting this film is. A whole bunch of characters are self-priming narcissistic whims. Worst of all, he reinforces all the negative stereotypes about a 20-year date, even if he is called upon to glorify people who are "in existence." The good guys finish last, the jerky guys have a great understanding, the lame guys are the best. The girls are all boyish toy lovers. It can be seen that only one character (“Wendy”) does something remotely useful to society, and she refuses her long-preserved virginity in a one-time overnight stay with a scum in a magnificently filmed scene, which we should consider romantically. In fact, this is the Hollywood concept of young America: insightful, detached, slutty, vain.
