The problem with The Killer Elite is that just by looking for this movie and spending time watching it, you put more effort than many of its director, especially director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> With this film, the already volatile Peckipa was going through bad weather. According to at least one biographer, it was here that he became acquainted with cocaine. Add to this his drink, and it is no wonder that everything fell apart. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the idea of ​​the film is good, and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Loken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duval) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move fast, live well and seem like best friends - then something happens that destroys their fraternity. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, they blow up a building - why we are not exactly told for the course in terms of the dark motivation of this film. But the bottom line is that these guys offend people, and they don't care - the anti-heroes are in many ways similar to the “Wild Bunch of Pekingpa” not so long ago. The introductory title tells us that they work for ComTeg, and then adds to the cheek with an obvious language: “The idea that the CIA can use such an organization for any purpose is, of course, ridiculous.” This is a pretty smart way to let viewers know that all bets have been canceled. <br /> <br /> Add to this the traditionally strong reserve of Peckinpah, including Burt Young, Gig Young and the usual Peckinpah of Bo Hopkins in the role of a plum. crazy who can't miss the opportunity to be shot for $ 500 a day, and you only want the writers, including the famous Sterling Sillipant, to try something more with history than to turn it into a platform for lazy liners and bad scum . Attempting to introduce a dose of liberal social commentary is inappropriate. “You're so busy doing dirty work that you can't say who the bad guys are,” someone says to Loken, as if he or we needed it. pointed out. <br /> <br /> The Pekingpa direction’s awkward direction and slow pace are still worse. Before our first battle scene, we have 40 minutes, a completely chaotic collection of random shots, where a group of people can be seen at San Francisco airport, which we have not even met, their battle intersects with the conversation in the office suite. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, the actors had a battle with the fleet of the Victory ships, the ninjas rushed out into the street to be shot, and Kaana was thrown away. one liner that cuts any hint of real expectation. “Lay me down from seven to five, I'll take a little guy,” he said before the samurai's most climatic duel between two ninja warriors from China, who, as we all know, is a ninja country. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but, oddly enough, militants do not come to break things.) <br /> <br /> Kaan is much better in small scenes, for example, when one of Lokken, recovered from some unpleasant injuries , says one of his bosses, played by the sleek Arthur Hill, that he was a “Humpty-dumped” organization. Kaan refuses to stay, and his recovery scenes, although killing the impulse for the film, show a wonderful action from him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a supportive nurse. Kaan was one of the best actors of the 1970s, and his laconic play with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins, and both young people gives Killer Elite a real opportunity for observation. <br /> <br /> But you don’t watch Killer Elite think about it. You watch it, thinking about the movie that went away.
