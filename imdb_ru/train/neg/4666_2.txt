This film is about a Japanese woman who is obsessed with skin calligraphy. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely freaky. I do not see any "sensual" or "erotic" shades. The plot transforms the ancient art form into fetishistic pornography. In addition, the scenes shot in Hong Kong certainly portray poor areas of Hong Kong, such as the downtown airport, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I continue to think that the Book of Pillows is an insult to Japanese culture and the environment of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> “The Book of Pillows” is a perverted but boring movie. Seriously stay away from this.
