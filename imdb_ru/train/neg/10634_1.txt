Writer / director Bart Sibrel bases his work here on a film bank that he says was mistakenly sent to him by NASA. He says that this shows that astronauts forge television footage of their trip to the moon using camera tricks. The astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time, and the field editors gathered these raw frames in just a few seconds of the finished film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrell’s research is so unconvincing that he doesn’t realize his Behind the Scenes footage is indeed largely taken from a 30-minute live broadcast (also on this reel) that millions have seen, and not hidden in NASA repositories as he implies. And we have to wonder why Sibrel leads his own conspiratorial narrative to the astronauts' audio recordings in frames, because when he heard the words of the astronauts in his own words, it clearly indicates that the astronauts were just checking the camera and not pretending. Finally, everyone can see the raw shots for themselves without buying a hacked version of Sibrella. (He shows you more about the Zapruder film about the murder of John F. Kennedy than about his "smoking gun.") Sibrel thinks he is the only one who has seen this. What is more indicative is the clips from this raw material that Sibrel chose NOT to use, for example, those that clearly show how the properly distant Earth is eclipsed by window frames, etc., Destroying his statement that Transparencies were placed in the windows of the spacecraft to create the illusion of a distant Earth. <br /> <br /> As in most films of this type, Sibrel relies on understatement, inept assumptions, misleading comments and selective quotes to manipulate the viewer to accept a conclusion for which there is not the slightest evidence.
