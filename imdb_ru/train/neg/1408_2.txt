I did not expect much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a miracle." It turns out that this film is ten times worse than "Life ...". I got the impression that the director / screenwriter is just joking with the audience: “Let me see how much emptiness you (the audience) can stand.” Dialogues are empty, ... the script is minimalistic. In a few moments the photo is really good. Few sarcastic lines are half-funny, but during this “comedy” it is difficult to laugh sincerely. I laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie to the end. If you can rise above the fiasco of this director, ... you will find a good game of several legends (Miki Manoylovich, Aleksandar Birchek) and a very good performance by the son of the emir Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In short: too bad for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should be shot in the best films. Instead, he decides to make this low-budget theatrical film “only for me”, with an arrogant attitude towards world trends and negligence towards his old fans.
