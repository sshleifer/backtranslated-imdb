What an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concessions to "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or enhanced sound. <br /> <br /> Facial expressions are usually covered with a thick beard, and Spanish is a strange monotonous gloss that sounds the same, whether in the midst of a battle or I talk around a fire. <br /> <br /> I considered these films (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, and not something that could be entertained. It is rather long and sometimes dull. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that, given the absence of any development of the plot, I do not think it is very informative. <br /> <br /> It’s also difficult to perceive any story from the film’s dialogue — it would be nice to read the story a little so that you could understand the context of what is happening, because for some reason the director didn’t find it necessary to tell the audience why Che Group moved so the same as they are - as a result, it seems that groups without any reason run through the woods and shoot at them. <br /> <br /> I would love to give this film more stars for somehow provoking more sympathy for me and developing the depth of character, but somehow all the characters were still unfamiliar to me at the end. The stars he receives are designed for realism and show the difficulties of the guerrilla war.
