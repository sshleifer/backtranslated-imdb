OK - I LOVE this film ... I will be grateful for this film - one for making me such a ruthless horror fanatic. I could never watch this movie alone. I also heard a lot of stories about the influence that he had in his original release in cinemas on his viewers. Incredible masterpiece .... Horrible, psychological things scare me. Oh bless their hearts, whoever made this terrific movie. I like it. I thought the whole movie was worthy and interesting. This movie is SO scary - this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life! Not what happens in the film, and the idea of ​​the film is not enough scary, but what always turned me on is Brendan's incredible play. Best horror movie ever. Nothing could be so scary again. View Halloween in the most evil.
