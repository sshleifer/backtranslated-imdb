Perhaps this is not the worst film Peter Sellers has ever made (I think Laurel is going to The Prisoner of Zenda), but he is by far the most depressing. Sellers, especially without make-up, like Neyland Smith, seem to have just undergone chemotherapy. Being Fu Manchu, he looks a little better and spends most of the film (with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where electric currents are shaking him) on the verge of destruction under the weight of all this makeup. Supporting players also look tired and bewildered, and Sid Cezer’s presence is offensive even without his constant references to “Chinx!” for that matter, a non-Asian star is like one!) The film seems surprisingly cheap, with a thick photo and a gray set - even the number of Elvis with a crash at the end looks truncated. Only stunning Helen Mirren and a tall, thin, nervous guy, wetted his pants, add a spark of life to this sad cause. In general, this film provides an eerie premonition of the great comedian's death and even more eerie documentation of his death.
