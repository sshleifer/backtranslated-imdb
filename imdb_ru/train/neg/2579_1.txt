I have to say that I was a big fan of the series. The first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's a shame, because it was a great series, and it only gets worse. I know they are made for DVD movies, but some effort would be good. <br /> <br /> No laughter, just a couple of good one-on-a-side who will smile. There are pretty naked and very hot chicks. But neither sexuality nor jokes really work. <br /> <br /> To add to everything that this is also a RACIST film or a racist film that can be made without asking to be called a racist. I am NOT one of those people who believe that everything should be politically correct. But the image of minorities is very insulting. <br /> <br /> I would not waste time on this garbage. Look at previous versions, they will make you laugh is not sick.
