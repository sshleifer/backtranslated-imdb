As a poker enthusiast, I was looking forward to seeing this movie - especially since Scotty Newgen was in it. <br /> <br /> In fact, the short episodes of Scotty Newgens in this film are all he has to do. <Br /> <br /> Characters are unlikely and annoying, the soundtrack is terrible, and the plot, well, no, it does not. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my head ached and I found that I was reading the barcode number on the DVD box in twenty minutes I THAT was boring. In fact, it is embarrassing that NÃ¼gen starred in this film, otherwise I would not have wasted $ 16 to buy it on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take it from me - AVOID like 7 2 outfits !!! Dire. :(
