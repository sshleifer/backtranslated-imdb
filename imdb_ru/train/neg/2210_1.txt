It was a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> Each of them tried to be serious, and it made this movie so funny. I mean, come on the shark's head on the human body. This can be even funnier. Good work, fiction, go on comedy movies. I never thought that films could become more retarded. If they continue in the same vein, they will have to rename the sci-fi channel into sci-fi comedy channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for 4 of the next science fiction blockbuster movie. <br /> <br /> I'll be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a box of beer or a bottle of liquor, and I'll be ready to laugh again at this !!!
