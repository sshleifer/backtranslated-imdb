This is the worst movie I've ever seen. All participants should be confused. Each. Ice-T is pathetic, the dialogue is absolutely terrible, and the hoki does not begin to describe the actions of each actor in this film. The plot is largely dependent on Executive Decision, but compared to Air Rage, Executive Decision is material awarded by the Academy. I was never so disappointed when I watched the movie. Air Rage should be burned so that its ashes are trapped in storage so as not to see daylight anymore. Anyone who has seen this should take a shower and wash a terrible film from them. The best part of this film probably comes from the end, when loans rolled. It was just the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T must adhere to law and order, while other people in this film must resign early or commit suicide. In any case, they should never try to act in films again.
