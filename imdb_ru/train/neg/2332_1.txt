What was the purpose of this film? I believe that several actors, their producers and directors had to make a big reward for their inaction. Even my favorite actor Bruce Dern could not keep my interest in this boring film. Brain former ex-boxer falls with a strange woman and her relatives. He begins as a man for a woman, and eventually beats the man and is drawn into the abduction scheme. It was so confusing that I could not even write decent criticism. If you see this, my sweet, make sure it is already dark and you can go to sleep.
