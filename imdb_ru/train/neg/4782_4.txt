1 watched 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Deer-Robert Ellis Miller): an emotional Christmas fluff that isn't really specific enough to explain how a real story based on facts actually happened about a person who was mistakenly put in prison trying to get a job for his family to make Christmas happen for them. Then three children in the family run away from home on the way to Washington, DC to enlist the support of the then United States President Herbert Hoover. This track contains some side stories, such as their positive encounters with the tramp and the puppeteer, which makes this story similar to the Disney film “Animals on the Run” and does not quite fit here. In the end, there are no details about how the president helped the family, and this, in my opinion, is another shortcoming of the film. The film eventually brings tears, but it takes too long to get to that. The film was not supposed to be an original television film (according to IMDb), but does it have obvious attenuations that make it look that way ?? therefore, I am not sure that their information is accurate. In general, this is a simple film (which could be more complex) with a happy Christmas story, but ingratiatingly played and without much content.
