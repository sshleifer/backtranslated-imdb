The second Renaissance, part 1, let's show how the cars first rebelled against the people. It all starts with the one case where the machines declare that they also have the right to life, while people claim that the robot is what they own and therefore can do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Although this is an interesting premise, since then the story becomes really stupid with (violent!) Disorders between robots and humanity. For some reason, this doesn't seem right, as another reviewer points out, it's all too clever. <br /> <br /> Animatrix stories that remain close to the core of the matrix (Osiris in particular) work better. As for the second part of the Renaissance, I would say that it is too cruel and stupid. 4/10.
