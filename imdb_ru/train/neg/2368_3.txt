Well, this is stupid, they say that they are not making another Nightmare movie, that this is the “last” movie ... And what are they doing? They continue to do another, not that the next one (part 7) is BAD, but why they play with us. Anyway, this film had no meaning, it was very boring, the characters were very one-dimensional, Freddie was another prankster that is very stupid for such a good series. The plot is very, very bad, and it is even worse than part 2 and 5. I did not get the film, this is a stupid story in the 3rd, meaningless! I would say. I hated this film so much that I still remember all the parts I didn’t like, basically it was the whole movie. This is SO different from the prequels, he tries and tries, but this one tried the most and got hit in the face. Again, there were some death scenes, although they were different, they sucked a lot of time. How could they go that far? Did they not see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5? However, they do it? All about money, DO NOT SEE THIS BAD PRODUCT FOR A NIGHT SERIES. <br /> <br /> I got a night out on Elm Six (6) 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD POINTS OF FILM: Potential with a plot. <br /> <br /> BAD POINTS OF FILM: Awful acting game / no deaths / Too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
