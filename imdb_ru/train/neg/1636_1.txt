This film will be a hit among those who love sofomorian, thoughtless, outspoken bragging about sexual exploits and F ... in almost every sentence. Like a good storyline? How comedy? Like romance or other human values? Stay away from whipped. It was so bad that I left in about half an hour. I saw how two children slipped, it seemed that there were about 10 - very bad - it deserves an X.
