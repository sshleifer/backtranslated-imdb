Don't get me wrong, I want marijuana to be legalized just like the next guy. I'm distracted now. The letter, however, was unreal. PTA's mom who deals with drugs, but adamant that her drugs fall into the hands of a minor. Give me a break. The complacency of the very cute character Mary Louise Parkers was an insult to my mind. The characters were not at all pretty. Basically, the plot lines have not gone away. I understand that this is the only television land. Hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker should be a great mom, and I have to believe in it .... WHY? It just seemed to me that I was preaching a spectacle smelling like seed. It is like saying that you can deceive your wife, but with someone who has come of age. OK, not exactly the same thing, but I think you people understood my point. I believe that it will save children - this is great for the election campaign, but she does not hold water in the cable comedy series about the suburban mother, as a local potter.
