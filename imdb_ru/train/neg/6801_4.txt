First, I wonâ€™t tell you WHY I rented this film because I'm still confused ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage is very similar to any movie I saw when the plane was hijacked. There is, of course, one important person on the plane, and the hijacker is seeking revenge. Sadly, some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other films. Do we become so unoriginal so quickly? <br /> <br /> Although it is Ice-T (who for some unknown reason makes painful attempts to ACT, while he is not busy putting a "c" in front of the rap) who is Glorified on the cover, the film actually shoots the not so amazing Kim Oju in the role of flight attendants, who "surprisingly" APPOINTED five hijackers, who, of course, return to pursue them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I was able to recognize was Steve Hytner, better known as Kenny Banya from Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> I can't forget to leave my favorite part of the film when the hijacker used EMPTY PLASTIC to blow the lock on the door ... BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> The script is cruel, It got to the point that I could say something that, in my opinion, would make a stupid comment, and that would be the next line in the film. <br /> <br /> With regard to special effects ... the only thing that is special In this film, I wasted electricity costs to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - the film REALLY went on the air. But due to non-star performances, the only rage in the film is the rage of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So if you have the mood to even choose a movie, simply because it is bad. Please save yourself, do not choose this.
