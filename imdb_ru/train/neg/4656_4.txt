Unremarkable and unforgettable remake of an old famous English film. Although it may be overly perceived as a complete disaster (and this is not so), it never creates tension and does not give its television origin. Richard Burton sleeps in his role, and Sophie Loren's private face (in this film) also shows little passion. (**)
