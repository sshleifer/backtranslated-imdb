This film is like real life, by which I mean - not much happens for 2 hours or so, and not so much the game plan or plot is confirmed by the often invisible actor (their invisibility is explained by “experimental” lighting, as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> Big bore. No wonder Altman is leading this - he is a very volatile performer (yes, we all loved Gosford Park, but did Pret A Porter someone? Kansas City? Dr. T. and Women? Aaargh), but the fact that Raw is the story of John Grisham, and the great cast that you feel during the seductive dark dream makes it truly a masterpiece of a bad movie. And no, it's not "so bad, it's good." <br /> <br /> This is just bad.
