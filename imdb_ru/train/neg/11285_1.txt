I read the book of James Hows. It was pretty neat, not very, but interesting enough. Without reading the book, I would not have had the slightest idea of ​​what was happening, and with this knowledge still was not enough. <br /> <br /> Literally every element of this film is terrible, unlike me. be able to describe. Half-digested fish could make a better movie with matches and Dayglo lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or since the movie made me feel so angry. The mattress continuations were closest, but even they never reached such a depth of completely rotten nauseous horror that this hold made. <br /> <br /> Since I spent 90 minutes of my life watching this plague on the human race, now I’m not even able to look at any book by James Howes, I’m not angry. This is the depth of hate for this piece of shit. No, this is unfair. Let me apologize to all feces for comparing you with the otherworldly evil of Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Simple and simple cancer in the world of cinema.
