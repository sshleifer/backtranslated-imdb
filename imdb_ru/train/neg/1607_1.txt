This “documentary” is proof that talent is being used for devious purposes. The fact that it is funded by the Venezuelan government deprives it of legitimacy in search of the truth about what really happened in those terrible April 2002 days in Venezuela that even we Venezuelans do not know for sure. /> <br /> There are ways of lying, and the directors of this material are lying with inaction and knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complicated for foreign viewers to easily understand, and they use it. For example, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * they show that Chávez’s supporters fired on an empty street (what the hell did they do that for?), To say that they didn’t kill anyone, but didn’t bother to show the images we all saw. Here the opposition demonstrators (and ) fall dead or injured on the other side of this "empty" street. They cannot explain why the political police helicopter was the only one who was allowed to fly over Caracas that day, and did nothing against the snipers on the roofs of the buildings next to the presidential palace, which would demonstrate their inefficiency. be a security measure to guard the president. A few days after the “coup”, the head of the military guard was asked in the National Assembly (our Congress) why they did not oppose snipers, and he said: “because they were not there to act against the president,” isn’t this a recognition? < br /> <br /> There is a lot more, the fact that the top military announced that Chavez resigned, and after 2 days he said that he had lied because "this is politics" And now this is the Minister of the Interior Administration Chavez. <br /> <br /> I would need a thousand words to explain all the lies depicted in this “documentary”, made with the intention of selling to the world the image of the good old Hugo Chávez, who rules the poor and the poor rich opposition that wants him at the price when the truth is that 60-70% of people reject his government, and this percentage includes the poor. <br /> <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see another version that they are doing. y group of Venezuelans showing at least 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda is back!
