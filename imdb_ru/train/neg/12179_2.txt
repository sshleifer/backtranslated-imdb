Do not even look at how this tasteless spoiler destroys everything about “Annie”. Characters seem almost dejected because of a poorly written storyline, and they experience a sense of poor quality to production. It was very clearly made for television, but if I found it on TV, I would just turn it over. The kids in the film do an excellent job with their work, but the adult actors are incredible, and so the film doesn’t really attract you. There were no music / dance numbers in this movie, because of which the original was brilliant and really took on the brilliance of Annie, whom we all love. Johnson, because Annie is annoying at times and acting too ... you can't convince yourself that she really is Annie. Differences in appearance of the character continued to annoy me throughout the film. Unfortunately, this sequel was a complete failure.
