Why would anyone make this piece of trash film? The first two Zombie Bloody Bath films were stupid enough, but for the worst of the trilogy (perhaps for all time) this cake was taken. Todd Sheets is still a director, but no longer a screenwriter, which is not a negative or a positive, considering that he is as inept as the guy who wrote it. Writing depends too much on the f-word, which is used 200 to 300 times for nausea. Acting is about the same as in the last two Bloodbath movies, so naturally, this is one of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look monstrous. The plot became too complicated for his own good, and about some kind of government experiment failed and zombies were created. Also presented are cryogenically frozen zombie mutants and schoolchildren who know how to travel in time, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the film, it goes in the outlets, which is strange, because this whole film is an outlet. Just look at it to laugh at it, because if you do it with a serious mind, you can kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes
