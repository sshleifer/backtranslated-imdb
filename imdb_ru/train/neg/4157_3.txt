The above seemed like a much more appropriate title when me and my subordinate suicides decided to watch this masterpiece of modern nonsense. <br /> <br /> Erotic, Dreadful, Suspended, Well thought out, this is all that can not be in this film. <br /> <br /> This incredibly funny, slow sound effects and poor dubbing complement this to make one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. And yet this film is not even trying to be funny, and this is one of the greatest achievements of cinema, it becomes a comedy, not even trying to have fun. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, an old guy who looks amazing how Santa Claus plows over the zombies and smashes vampires on the ground. It made me disbelieve the name of the film, if it was vampires against zombies, why didn't vampires and zombies fight? Well, okay, in addition, in this box there were more flaws than in the title. Such as this; In America, the virus penetrates, creating zombie-like creatures that behave like ordinary tourists. And yet there are only four zombies in the film. Another problem, besides the fact that one store is abandoned everywhere. Of course, you will see zombies roaming the forest or in the background. In fact, I think they just went around the forest again and again, because they didn’t have a big enough budget to shoot in a wider place, or the director didn’t want to waste his precious time shooting in different places. forest areas with which he had to be occupied, sitting in a trailer jerking to be concerned about such trivial questions. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had so much fun doing it that he didn’t have enough time to hire a sufficiently large cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight crew members to dress like different people and try not to behave discreetly, although I guess he changed his name and began to randomly knock on films: “Editing is not hard work, right?” The only reason this The “film” was in our bag, was that we somehow confused him with Freddie and Jason, it's strange how it all happens, isn’t it. And the only way to do it, though at night, was to put on gas masks and fasten them to our skulls in order to avoid the stench of this sickening mess. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, we laughed at the end, but I’m sure that everyone does it a lot when he lost his sanity ...................
