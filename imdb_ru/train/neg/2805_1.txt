This adaptation has a positive effect on the classics, which is loved by its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no idea about the various nuances of the character of Rochester. I have a feeling that he never even read a book, just walked on the set in his too-narrow trousers, and he was handed a resume with the inscription "Dodgy, scary, dark past." He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person, but as an ordinary grumbler who never smiles until he gets engaged, and at that moment he miraculously does not turn into pansies. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that caused this adaptation in me is mistrust, as well as sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, which certainly turns into a grave. GO AND READ BOOK. ROCHESTER PERSONALITY. AND WAY: THE SCENE OF LOVE "PASSIONAT" DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A HER FACE.
