The humor in the movie “Who's Your Dad” is so bad that I really closed my eyes in certain scenes. Sperm closeups aren't funny! No one thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so rude and to hide their nervousness, they laugh. Watching who your dad gave me is a nasty nervous feeling.
