It was the worst movie I've ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) could not act EVERYTHING! she had no emotions, it was all blah blah bla, as if she was reading from a boring textbook. The clever child and the child who loves food (names werenâ€™t worth remembering there) were so annoying that they drove me crazy. It was ever said that it was some kind of scientific thing or food. Pope Mollis did not show enough emotion about the missing daughter. Policeman and Pope Mollis said the same thing four times. it was just awful. Everything was repeated to many. Beatrice had something bad to happen to her because she was so mean. I just wasted a moment in my life watching this movie!
