MST 3000 should make this movie. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. First of all, you will learn that the shooter has no bank account and history since he left the army in 1993, and he pays for rent in cash. In hell, it would never be possible to let such a person be so close to the president, let alone work loudly. In addition, the head of security at POTHUS would not be so excited that he would start drinking in a haze if the president was shot. This movie sucks. I can not express the extreme that this film was. Every actor was terrible. Even a chick in the trailer park. I crap on this trash. What a waste of time.
