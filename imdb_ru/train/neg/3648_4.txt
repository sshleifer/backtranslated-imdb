A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Heyenga) goes to the doctor (James Karen) to try to conceive a child. It works, but Adams gradually realizes that something serious is wrong with the child ... <br /> <br /> A rather interesting idea thoroughly copes with the lousy scenario - the basic idea is in order, but it becomes loudly predictable for the end. I saw every "turn" approaching. The direction is bad - he doesn't seem to know how to shoot a simple scene. Production values ​​- being good - lousy. Very shabby. And the blood scenes are too unpleasant (I almost turned them off when a pregnant woman began to prick herself in the stomach) with lousy special effects. The film completely collapses at the end, when it becomes absolutely clear that they had no idea how to end this film. <br /> <br /> Some kind of good game makes it somewhat tolerable. Adams, Heyenga, and Karen do a good job with their roles and make me look, but that's about it. This film was barely released in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why. I give it 4.
