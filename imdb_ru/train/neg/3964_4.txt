Despite all the hype about this film, I did not think about what I ultimately thought. And although he is a little slow from time to time, the first 90% of the film is pretty good, with more than a few “old” scares that make him anxious and indecisive. I really thought cinematography was excellent in many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is at its climax. The ending of the film and the denouement is what looks like MILES APART from its body. The storyline completely collapses with an illogical conclusion, and the answer I was looking for the most - what really happened to Emma? - not clarified! The justification of negative energy was at best ridiculous, and in the end I felt very deceived. What could have been an excellent horror movie ended up following a terrible ending.
