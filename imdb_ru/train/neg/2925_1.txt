After reading a few good reviews, as well as hearing pleasant words of word of mouth, I decided to rent a Come Undone. I have to say that I was rather disappointed. This story was difficult to follow, because the film is a series of memories between the present and the recent past that are very poorly executed. The characters, despite all the efforts of the actors, are flat and uninteresting. Sex and nudity are more pronounced than they should be. I have never seen a movie where they seemed so unnecessary for the plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions for the storyline, which was not well explained from the start. In my opinion, a waste of time.
