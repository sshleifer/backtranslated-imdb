Four years after his directorial debut in the art house "Welcome To L.A." Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood - to become one of the guys. "Roadie" is a scandal for a fraternity boy, full of bar fights, horny harpies, Arta Karni in a wheelchair ... and a roll behind the wheel. Meat Loaf (playing Travis W. Redfish!) In fact, a rather enchanting presence on the screen, and perhaps in a smaller role (in the best film), he may indeed be ingratiated, but the Zalman King script is full of stereotypical cattle-humor and helpless Meatloaf is kept wide open and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams Jr. and Blondie all appear and everyone looks confused. They certainly should, “Rowdy” is one unsuccessful trip. NO STARS from ****
