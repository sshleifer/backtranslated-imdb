I just finished reading a book about Dillinger. This film was terribly inaccurate. As if they got a list of names and just made up everything. His robberies and escapes were well planned, right up to the second â€” when the time was up, they left, whether they had all the money or not. They had records of every road, where they turned off, and so on. D. Purvis never saw him in a restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his food after Dillinger left. Purvis did not even see Dillinger until that night when Dillinger was killed, only his photographs. The way his gang members died was fake. Dillinger never robbed the bank himself, as in this film. If I had never read a book, perhaps I would have liked the movie. The game was a bit excessive in places. The action was also exaggerated. If I think, I doubt that I would have liked it, even if I had not read the book.
