Seriously. I just finished my first viewing of “Demonika,” and the words failed me. <br /> <br /> I remember a time when I saw the name of Charles Band in a movie, and my heart was pounding. He was never Wes Craven or John Carpenter. He was a stronghold of hope for a little man. The guy whose films went to the video store instead of the multiplex, but they still swayed more than most fashionable junk, which we otherwise had to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> California's walking trail is painfully doubled for the Alps, and an abandoned railway tunnel is actually considered an “ancient cave.” I mean, they didn't even try to put this thing on with moss or take it off so that it could be assumed that it was something other than the old railway tunnel! Ugh! As the cover says, instead of a creepy demon-gladiator, we treat the dude in the latest clothing from Wal-Mart Halloween. There is a pretty cool looking corpse that sometimes comes to life to burp and lift fingers, but it doesn’t even learn to stand until the last five minutes. Why could he not be a villain? Instead, we have a brotherly boy Joe with a plastic sword. Oh. <br /> <br /> Charles Bend ... you should be ashamed that your name is associated with such a prank. I love movies that are so bad, they are good. Hell, I sometimes get pleasure from the fact that it is so bad, just bad. This one, however, is simply not available for observation. A great example of making money, not making a quality film.
