Extremely complex and monotonous. I am a smart guy, but it was too much for a tired brain. It would be helpful to get some first clues about who these people are and what they do. Probably better for the US market. Sam G.K. hinted that he himself does not supply him with an Oscar, and you can see why. <br /> <br /> However, the sand dunes are beautiful. Nail tension is nasty. Lawyers drunk dad is a mystery. Cricket is good to see. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to write the required ten lines on it, despite the fact that it lasts more than 2 hours. Thank god they cut it. Admittedly, we do not get to the pictures a lot, but the last film we saw, Follow the Line was 10 times better, and I donâ€™t really like Johnny Cash. My wife says that George still looks good with a beard and a few extra pounds, so what is ... is I almost there? <br /> <br /> How about now?
