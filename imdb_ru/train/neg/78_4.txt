The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with history ... This is what I would do in the first year at the film school. Very sad In addition, the story seemed to drag on for no apparent reason ... too many things were added that had nothing to do with the story that makes me feel that the creative team really didnâ€™t know what they were doing, or just that it should it was to be shorter ... that would be a blessing, not a crime. Since I just watched all the episodes up to this point in the last week ... I must say that this was the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with that.
