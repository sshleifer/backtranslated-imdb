The minds of film schools can drool whatever they want about the important (imaginary) meaning of this film, but it is simple: intellectual slobber. This film has creatively gone bankrupt, and some mistakenly take it for endless self-indulgence as substance. Yeah. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Godard was not a fan of the Stones. Too bad because it could be great. He captures the birth of this timeless song, and instead he prefers to cover the music with some guy reading The Real Detective magazine or something like that. <br /> <br /> Then there are endless frames of words that librarians of the 60s draw on human cars. And then there is a seemingly endless "interview" where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all really deep and intellectual questions. There's a dude in a purple suit reading more shit from a book that lasts only about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a landfill. <br /> <br /> It sounds almost intriguing? Well, it is not. <br /> <br /> But for unwashed hipster film schools who don't care about the lost opportunities for full access to the Stones bringing sympathy to the devil in the world, and would prefer to hear some English guy reads instead, looking at the covers of “Nudi Meg”, This film is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More precisely ... maybe Godard is just blowing.
