I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons did not try to create serious horror, or even an action movie, when they made Carnosaur 3. The film is completely stupid from beginning to end. Even humor in C3 is ridiculous, because it is bad. Definitely a high mark in the “So bad, it's good” genre. If you like the worst of the worst, this is for you.
