An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) stumbled upon an ancient 40-meter mummy, well-preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep it secret and call a Jewish translator to help figure out the history of this. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants who apparently existed in "those times." To save his son from the devastating flood, which was supposed to have killed everything, he mummified his son, burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to wake him up after years. In our present, fallen angels are still walking on the earth, and the mummy is resurrected, and a ritual is expected. Much of the film is slow, associated with a lot of biblical shit and a couple of parody air attacks. Mom looks decent, but it is not enough to show. It should have been more connected with it, but it sucked a lot, so ... oh. Do not worry
