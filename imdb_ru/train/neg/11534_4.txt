* WARNING * CONTAINS MANY SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Let me begin by saying that I greatly respect the incredible talent of Gillian Anderson as a diverse and diverse actress - which is why I cannot understand her reasons for agreeing to make this film as soon as she saw the script (or his absence ). <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film was, in my opinion, a great idea, and there were some really thought-provoking topics, but it ended up like this: a collapsed souffle. This illustrates why I hate 99% of British cinema. It seems too long, tedious, for the most part, and little happens after the first twenty minutes. When you think that he has a chance to gain some speed, it is disappointing when Paula Radcliffe ran a marathon. With a little creative leadership and a minimalist plot, not so much to keep the audience from falling asleep in their popcorn. As for the script, I can only assume that the writer was trying to save several trees, while the middle scene was reading something like “Alice: F *** OFF! (Adam looks. Adam runs into the forest) ”(Alice follows) Alice: ADAM! ADAM! "I suspect that word-for-word actors probably paid more than Kate Moss for her Virgin Mobile ad. The fact that there were a few lines did not have much variation with the frequent use of an f-word that Bridget would have been proud of Jones, Shazzoy. Before the main dirty event there are not so many main characters, so the audience lacks sympathy for the characters, except for the automatic response “Oh, this is terrible.” <br /> <br /> Alice is not one of those women who like courts She has a great job, dear London apartment with a place on the to die, but on the screen she looks vain, bitter and dissatisfied before her life turns out to be worse. After the attack, she exfoliates several layers, which somehow explains how she started like that, she grew up with a soldier in tough as old boots who thought that teaching her to shoot a pistol was the ultimate expression of love, so instead of following in his footsteps, she ran to the big city in search of something to make her feel that her life was worth it. Instead, she found a group of middle-class stereotypical Toffs who look down on those who are not rich enough to drive a Lexus and luxury that comes with an integrated security / entertainment system (for example, turning Mrs. Robinson into a sophisticated electrician Cockney ) Someone will give me a napkin. The only saving grace of this character is that it is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a lesser actress, she would have been unbearably one-dimensional, but Ms. Anderson did manage to invest several fleeting moments of humanity into this lifeless human being, especially when she sincerely apologizes for her road rage in a vain attempt to prevent the attackers from continuing the attack. <br /> <br /> I can't say that Adam felt much better too. Danny Dyer played it well, like Jack the Fish guy, but a good performance could not save him from the lack of a script, or from the complete absence of any background character. <br /> <br /> This film relied mainly on the shocking value, but time was chosen and it seemed too difficult from beginning to end. As for shock, the most shocking thing in this film is a shameless demonstration of how painfully thin Mrs. Anderson has become; it was almost as disturbing as the scenes of the brutal attack. On the other hand, only in a British film a gang of brutal sex offenders will take time to offer each other contraceptives before continuing to cheer on their partners - talk about how tight the upper lip has been brought to the extreme! If this is the film that the National Lottery donates money to, then I’m not surprised that fewer and fewer people choose to spend their pound every week. <br /> <br /> Saying that I hated this film, he deserved respect too much, I did not care about any characters to justify such strong emotions. I want these few hours of my life back, please!
