What a waste of time. The film begins as a clone of the series "Saw", but with even worse acting skills. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely terrible. The ending is ridiculous, and in the story there are no turns, plot surprises and just a bad ending. I liked some of the characters, and I hoped that at the end everything would be connected. This just does not happen. This is a complete "Wrestler", ending in nothing of good acting. I can not believe that I spent time watching this. This is not “fun,” as some people say. A masked guy kidnaps people who are connected and makes them understand it. The bond reached out, and he had to shoot the main actress first.
