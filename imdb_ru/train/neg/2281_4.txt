Think "stage play." It is worth seeing once the speeches of Lionel Atville and Dwight Fry. Compare Melvin Douglas in The Ghost Story with Melvin Douglas of this film. Are there free vampires in this "Bavarian" village, or is there a more natural, albeit equally ominous explanation? Dwight Fry - Herman, red herring, which played a particularly moronic role. It is interesting to look at his various facial expressions in what is actually a serial character. For a long time nothing happens, but then we discover that Dr. Atville, smoking a pipe, is a real killer. Too much “comic relief”, but this is the norm for this era. Fay Wray looks really good.
