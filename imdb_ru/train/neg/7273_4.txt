This early role for Barbara Shelley (in fact, her first in Britain after working in Italy) was made when she was 24 years old, and it is safe to say that she debuted in 1957 in "Cat Girl". While blondes and brunettes get the most attention (I will always cherish Yutte Stensgaard), a beautiful red-haired actress with a deep voice always exuded intelligence and vulnerability (one such example is the Village of the Damned ”of the 1960s the screen was much smaller than the husband of her character, George Sanders). She is the only reason why you can see this monotonous update “People-cats”, and she can see a great advantage in everything (it’s hard to say if her beauty has found the best showcase). Her character obviously sleeps in the nude, and we see her juicy bare back when she wakes up (also exposed 8 years later in 1965 in Rasputin the Mad Monk). The delightful dress that she wears for the most part of the film is a stunning strapless miracle (I don’t see what kept this dress, but I probably would have wanted it). Overall, the evidence that Barbara Shelley in a poorly written role that will win most actresses rises above her material and makes the film constantly watchable, a real test of stellar power, which she will soon discover in Hammer’s studio in Bray during the 1960s.
