This astounding waste of production money is cinematic proof that the rich and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From the (stupid) play by Tennessee Williams and director (dead hand) Joseph Losey with Taylor, Burton and Noel Trus starring - this project, shot in a spectacular mansion atop a mountain on a cliff in the Mediterranean, should have seemed a real fire, presented by Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and tedious that it is almost impossible to convince. Visually, the film is impressive, but it is the power of nature, which allowed to create the atmosphere and the fact that instead of the scenery used this house. The shrill tricks of a screaming Taylor, Burton's half-asleep wanderings, a crazy dialogue, Noel Trus laughs at himself, ridiculous stories and plot tricks and an absurd costume just annoy the viewer. BOOM is a shame, a waste of money and talent, and clear evidence that famous celebrities can be the same idiot as the rest of the plebeians of the planet. Not even fun. Just awful and insane shocking waste.
