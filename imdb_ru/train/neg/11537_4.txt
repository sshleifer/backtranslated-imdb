I have been following this movie for quite some time, so I could have expected too much. I think that Jillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are well aware of what they are doing, and it was interesting for me to see what Dan Reed could come up with, but unfortunately it just didn’t work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the fact that the film does not really understand what genre it belongs to and as such does not impress the elements of drama, horror and thriller, because instead of focusing on one of them and do it well, it's a little all profession and master none. <br /> <br /> The premise (as in most films about revenge) is simple: a couple meets and leaves, something bad happens and they take revenge, this is a simple formula and one that many directors have skillfully coped with for years. Unfortunately, in this case, Dan Reid thought: “It would be great to make one of those revenge films, which is a little deeper, showing a more humane side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail.” .. "Wrong! Some key elements are also missing, there is usually some kind of warning in this type of film. Do not do it or it may happen an element that adds tension, but there is nothing of the kind. It just happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens, and then everything ends. <br /> <br /> In this genre, there is a very tough competition and Dan Reed’s hats for trying, I have no problems with his directorial abilities, but in terms of writing ... i would say that after Blowing time he must stick to the formula for the type of film he makes, instead of trying to be too smart, and he will have a quality film on his Hand.
