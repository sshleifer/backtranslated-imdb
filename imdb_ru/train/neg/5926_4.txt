Another weak record in the third season: "Is there truth in beauty?" However, there is at least one key plot element that is very different and, as Spock would say, fascinating. The protagonist is an alien who needs to be carried in a black box, because his appearance is so terrible that it makes people crazy. It is a pity that the episode can not meet this incredible premise. Obviously, I think that ever "showing" an alien was a mistake, because its actual appearance in no way comes close to such a terrifying growth; all we get is a standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when a ship goes through a magnetic storm or something like that. In any case, the appearance of Kollos can at least endure Mr. Spock, and only if Spock has a special visor. (For a long time, I thought the alien called Carlos, which I find funny, but I get distracted.) Spock must talk to Kollos at some point so that the alien can control the Enterprise back to a safe place. This is achieved, but when Spock / Kollos returns to do away with the mind, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Oooh He goes mad, but eventually he recovers with the help of his assistant Kollos, a blind woman with extrasensory abilities. It may have been a really weird, great episode, but it’s not well directed and looks like another poorly performed show from the “Last Season” series.
