Before watching Dahmer, I thought that no movie could be worse than Freddie Ginger. I was wrong. Summing up, we can say that “Dahmer” is a story about a gay serial killer, in which there are practically no murders, and almost entirely consists of Dahmer’s meetings with gays before they were killed. There is no conspiracy, and it does not make sense to tell us something about “Dahmer”. All that you learn about Dahmer after watching this movie is that he liked having sex with men. Terrible game, terrible direction, terrible letter, terrible everything ... If you have to choose between watching Damer and vomiting a shell for three hours, continue vomiting .... it will be less painful .....
