There was no point in it, and it was so terrible ... I think there are a lot of such films in Hollywood ... you shouldn't have watched it. people cut or eat what I have to say ... it made me sick! Oh my God! The film is about people we do not know, but feed yourself to people! they have teeth blah blah blah ... isn't that familiar? I bet you saw it in another movie. The cast was so great, but I think the script was really terrible. and I have to say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely awesome ... he is so talented ... in fact, I said terrible, but I think it is because of the terrible scenes ... let me explain it. have you ever eaten a tongue but in the film one person did it! it was really terrible ... anyway, I think the film would have been so good without these horrible scenes of a cannibal or director ...
