The latest film about Tarzan with Johnny Weissmuller in the main role (looking amazingly aged a year after “Tarzan and the Hunter”) is bad, despite all the little things that can be added to make it look better. Obviously, RKO tried to say goodbye to Weissmüller, shooting beautiful landscapes in Mexico City, with the main star of this country (Andrea Palma) and multiple cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, and also invited prestigious composer Dmitry Temkin to make an account. Although it may cost less to shoot abroad, it looks more expensive than any other RKO film on the show, taking advantage of Acapulco’s beaches and real pyramids, such as Aquatani, and with impressive decor for all scenes related to the temple of the god Balu (especially the exterior built on steep cliffs.) Kurt Neumann was to remain a director, not Robert Flory, who gives him a very slow pace. Neumann did a great job with “Tarzan and the Amazons”, “Tarzan and the Leopard Woman” and “Tarzan and the Huntress” and ended his career as the head of the classic “Fly” one year before his death; while Flory became the television director, after a career of several great films. If Weissmuller looks tired, then the chimpanzee playing Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, a disgusting postman who sings horrible songs (with a Caribbean atmosphere, in a place that should be in Africa and shot in Mexico City! Dull and obviously doubtful taste, it was a sad farewell to Tarzan Weismüller.
