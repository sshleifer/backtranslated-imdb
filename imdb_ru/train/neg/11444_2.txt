SNL is pretty funny, but people who say it looks like watching a short SNL parody are a bit silly. This is NOTHING, like SNL, it's just a stupid piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like John Heder, but fails. Although John Heder is only fun in "Napoleon Dynamite," Andy goes out of his way, and people think he's funny. <br /> <br /> There were only funny people in the film - Danny McBride and Bill Heyder. The only part that was decently funny with Andy was part of the pool. <br /> <br /> They could have done a “Quiet Location” a lot better if they hadn’t done the fall scene with 3 crazy minutes. <Br /> <br /> The part in which he utters his H letters no longer works. They try to go with it for too long, and half the time it seems that Andy is laughing when he plays ... he is a terrible actor and does not deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a joke for ordinary people with the brain of a 10-year comedy level. That is about half of the United States.
