The premise of this film is so simple and obvious that only a Texas-rich millionaire with a high content of oil vapor and whiskey may have difficulty understanding this if someone screams through the notorious parking lot. Thus, the oil business is in collusion with the government (or Gummint, if you prefer), Gummint is in collusion with the Middle Eastern despots, and the CIA is a special purulent pool of double interrogations of sons (enter the word) to adhere to any line that meets on their way . The only people who have finished are good people, such as Mr. Clooney (“Bob”). Oh, and terrorism is the result of the poverty that globalization creates when evil transnational corporations are chasing the world in search of a tasty takeover or three. It really fits into the profiles of the perpetrators of 9/11 crimes. <br /> <br /> In Syria, this light fabric of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is stirred up in disgusting vermicels from plot lines that distort, turn and whirl around the gloomy surroundings of their own insignificance, until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion, what: <br /> <br /> 1. “director” (good joke) should never be around the camera again <br /> <br /> 2. people like Clooney and Hurt can know how to act but they don’t know exactly how to choose a script. <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to watch a film about corruption in big business and the state, watch the movie “Living Heart” by Claude Chabrol, which is insightful, funny and brilliantly played. <br /> <br /> Empty, burdened with fateful acne, stretched to eternally destructive length.
