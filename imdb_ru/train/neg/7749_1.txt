This film should never have been made. From poorly made animation to the beyond the bad game. I'm not sure at what point the people behind this film said, “Well, it looks good! Let's do it! ”I was delighted with how terrible this film was. At some point, which could well have been the MOST ARTISTIC, a computer sabertooth with a gold tooth falls from the roof, striking the idiot creator of cats in the mouth ... ooooooooooooo The film's villain was a paralyzed saber tooth killed a few minutes after its first appearance. Two others manage to kill a handful of people before they were burned and shot. In addition, there is an occasional victim in the jungle that scares me for one reason only. Will there be a second part? God, for the sake of people everywhere, I hope not. <br /> <br /> This film was pure rubbish. From Power Point Esquire credits to the end of the slideshow.
