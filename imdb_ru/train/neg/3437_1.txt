I saw this movie yesterday. I have to admit, it was not my cup of tea. Although it must be a horror movie of its kind. But when I watched it, I thought ... "This film makes no sense at all ..." Where did this guy in a dark coat come from? Where did these two guys go when they left the girls behind? Where did the shark come from? <br /> <br /> For some reason, all these elements in this film did not add up. It seemed to me that these directors spent so much time and money on a film that was so bad. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of good horror films in my time, but this is one of the most horrible horror films I've ever seen. At the end of the film, I told myself that I would not watch it anymore .. In this film, there is so much a papal show that I decided to give it a thumbs up! Count me on it! 0 out of 10!
