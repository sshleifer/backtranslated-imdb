I'm ohhhhhhhhh glad I didn't spend the money to go to the movies for this :-). This is nothing more than a collection of elements of several other classic titles, such as “The Thing”, “The Last Fantasy”, “The Abyss”, etc., concluded in a rather boring and meaningless scenario. I really can not understand what was the purpose of the creation of this film - there is nothing new in its plot, which, moreover, is meaningless. Moreover, there is nothing to watch - FX looks as if they were taken from a second-hand store, you usually saw them all in other films. But it is definitely a good lullaby.
