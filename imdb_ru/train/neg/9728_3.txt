Tobe Hooper made great films, so I was sure that it could not be BAD. I have not read a single review and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes it made me almost shout for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I rated it 3/10 because his 1990 horror film and a lot of interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the film, I thought something like "they just CANNOT add more things to this film ..." ... but they did. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this is a kind of Firestarter clone, but in fact it’s not. "T. It is based on this idea, but that is all. This is a combination of horror, comedy, strange things of religion / god, funny blood, simple effects, drama, terrible game, incredible scenarios ... and much more. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * The story is this: the government is trying to create a Primary weapon using nuclear energy or something else, and fails, during the process a child is born for 2 subjects. When a mother sings to her child after birth, both the husband and the wife are burned, and this is spontaneous combustion. The government buries all this and leaves this child alive among other people, and then ... after x years this child grew up and understands that he was born for some reason, and he may burn something with his brain. Then everything becomes incredibly dirty, nothing really explains anything and ... Well, when the government understands: “Well, now he can set this thing on fire,” they take him to a normal hospital, where there is some kind of nuclear poison, which they are going to use on this person, BECAUSE they can kill him, no, they can't shoot him no! ... and, I think, that's enough to say, I promise that there are 100 more strange things in this film. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want a good laugh, look at it. Gosh.
