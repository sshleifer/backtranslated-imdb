Do you like to get up? Then stay away from this ... <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the round, in fact, there are good comics, but if they don’t have any cute qualities, they’ll get a chance at the snowballs. Any controversial material and you're out! ... and I think it hurts me as much as the comedians who are rejected when I see who the crooked judges admit. <br /> <br /> 1 of my top 4 made it further than the preliminary ones. Half + finalists gave me 0 laughs. Some of them filmed their material elsewhere, with which the judges do not seem to have problems. <br /> <br /> This is more exciting than much of what is still on TV, but it’s incredibly difficult to watch without thinking. What could it be. <br /> <br /> If the producers changed the name of the contest to “Last Clown Standing”, all my criticism would have expired. Maybe an idea?
