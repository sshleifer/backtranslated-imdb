I may have seen worse films than this one, but I, if I have, I donâ€™t remember. Or perhaps blocked them. Who knows, if I had to undergo hypnotherapy, I could remember them, maybe with alien abduction in childhood or other injuries. If this were so, I would happily exchange these memories for those that I had when I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> We must pay tribute to the film: it caused an emotional response. I actually started to get angry at the scenes that faked other movies and TV shows that this parody spoils their association. I am terrified that I will not be able to watch films such as Dr. Strangelove again, until this film flashed through my mind.
