"A Town Called Hell" (also known as "The City Called the Bastard"), a British-Spanish co-production, was made on the heels of Clint Eastwood's success in the Italian trilogy "Man without a Name." The template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors, whose careers were largely in decline and voiced by their voices. This film is no exception, except for the fact that they used some British actors. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to sum up the story, but it says it all. The story begins with rebels or something else, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, who raid the church and kill everyone inside, including the priest. After a few years, let's fast forward to the thematic city, where Shaw's character is disguised as a priest. The mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a cruel leader who does not think about punishing justice with his gun. <br /> <br /> Throw Alvira, a grieving widow (Stella Stevens), who is looking for her husband, into the mix. killer. Add to this the fact that she rolls in a hearse that lies dead like in a coffin, because God knows why. After the mayor was assassinated by his minion La Bomba (Al Lettieri), a federal colonel (Landau) invades the city in search of a rebel leader (sorry, but the name eludes me). The colonel captures the city and begins to execute the citizens unconditionally to force them to reveal the identity of the leader. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they opened the film nearby, it’s hard to say from the dialogue that the characters Landau and Shaw know each other. The Blind (Fernando Rey) claims that he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does that .............................................. <br /> <br /> I’m sure the leaders regretted making this film. It's just terrible and deserves my terrible "1" rating. The show spends most of the film, fixing its brand on those who come in handy. Even Landau cannot save this film. Beautiful Miss Stevens is also completely wasted. I just filmed Pekingpa's Cable Hobby Ballad last year, and it seemed strange to me that it would appear in this film. Savalas made several such paintings (“Pancho Villa” and “Horror Express” come to mind) during the period preceding the Khojak. Michael Craig is also present somewhere as a character called Paco. <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey has appeared in many of these Westerns, although he will appear to play the villain in two films The French Connection. Al Lettieri also appeared with a role in The Godfather (1972) and switched to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975. <br /> <br /> In truth, the version I was watching lasted only 88 minutes. rather than the longer run time of 95 or 97 minutes specified in IMDb, however, I do not see where an additional 7 or 8 minutes will be of great importance. <br /> <br /> Avoid this.
