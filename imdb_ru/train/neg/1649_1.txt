Every Sunday, three buddies gather in the dining hall of New York to show off their sexual victories last night. Sometimes they are joined by a newly-married ex-comrade and a crest hunter, who hangs on them like a pulsing shell. They are shameless horny dogs / corn dogs, and Mia, who sees them on the hunt, decides that they need to be taught, damn it. Ergo, she will meet and throw - why not? All three! <br /> <br /> Sigh. What a wild idea. What a radical, naughty girl. Now women have the right to meet and sleep as much as they want. Like men! <br /> <br /> In “Whipped” there is only one ridiculous element, namely the fact that never, during detailed discussions amigo of their bodily functions and tantric talents of bed partners, which they spoil, other customers in the snack bar I turn around and say, "Dude, we are trying to eat here." Indeed, he-he-gag makes an elderly woman willingly weigh the beneficial sexual properties of some drinks. Big fat Kermit Frog "Sheesh" to this. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that a movie with a friend with a great atmosphere, a clever, cute heroine and three possible pairs should have such a detached final. <br /> <br /> PS - 30 "whip" sound effects for the screenwriter for using the phrase "Go, girl." He was tired in 2000 and is now tired. <br /> <br /> Save your time and watch replays "Sex and the City" ...
