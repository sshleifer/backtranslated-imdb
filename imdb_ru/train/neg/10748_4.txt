Nothing to say but wow! Did anyone actually sneak up on them in the open field? Well, it happens about 25 times in this film (obviously, the directors' favorite tactic is to scare). In one of the first scenes, the producer, speaking fast and acting in a hot shot, must ride in the back seat so that the operator can sit in front and shoot. Shortly after he arrives on the field, 5 participants appear, and although it is clear that no later than 2 pm, they are all convinced that the sun will go down at any moment. After about 30 minutes of useless rubbish, we have the privilege of remembering the story of a clown, in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie, look at the women's chest ... her ribs reached the neck, it was disgusting. Most horror films happen at night, but without a night vision camera, chaos is forced to occur during the day. The few night shots that made it in the film looked like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors' back yard. The film justified itself to some extent when a matrix appeared that looked like a clown shoot, which we rewound and watched again and again, laughing hysterically. <br /> <br /> Definitely make this movie if you have ever been connected In an open field. <br /> <br /> SIGNED, RESPONSE
