By providing a budget and time constraints for mass production, BATMAN and ROBIN, however, occupy a place at the bottom of any list of climbers, completely lacking the style, imagination and atmosphere of their predecessor in 1943, BATMAN. <br /> <br /> Producer Sam Katzman was known as “The King of Jokes”, and, like its director Spencer Bennett, seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than excitement. (Unfortunately, this team also released two TV shows about Superman, starring Kirk Alin, with their tasteless flying animation, canned music and boring support players.) At the beginning of each chapter, there is a taste for future things: completely meaningless names (Robin ). Saves Batman, "Batman vs. Wizard"), mechanical music is buzzing, and our two heroes stumble toward the camera, looking around, either in confusion, or have difficulty viewing through their cheap Halloween masks. Batman's hood, with its devilish horns and eagle's beak, fits so badly that a stuntman must adjust it during battle scenes. His "auxiliary belt" is a crumpled strip of fabric without compartments, from which he still manages to pull out a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments! <br /> <br /> In any case, the leading players are wrong. Robert Lowrie shows a little charm or an individual style, like Bruce Wayne, and doesn’t emphasize a particularly dynamic figure like Batman. He gives the impression that he would prefer to be somewhere, somewhere else! John Duncan, like Robin, struggles to cope with his limited dialogue. He is too old for this role, he was replaced by an even more mature stuntman. Outside the costume, Lowry and Duncan are just as exciting as tired businessmen strolling through a glass, without a single ounce of chemistry, evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 series. <br /> <br /> Although the series were not known for character development, earlier BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast. This one offers the band a passing movement, not that the filmmakers have great support. None of the hooligans stand out, and they are headed by one of the most boring villains, "The Wizard." (Great name!) In fact, they are headed by someone wearing a curtain, a scarf and a bag overhead, with a double voice that is desperately trying to sound ominous. “The main suspects” are an eccentric professor, the broadcaster is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Even recognized regulars comic books are superfluous. It’s hard to distinguish a lot of romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the dangers she faces, Vicki has almost no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is not too smart. Unlike the previous series, the butler Alfred is a simple man, whose most important feature is “The Residence of Mr. Wayne.” They are a support for a protracted, trick-filled, disjointed plot, additionally burdened with boring, repetitive music and amateur industrial design. The exterior of the Wayne Manor is reminiscent of a middle-class country house on any comedy series, the interiors of which are cheap roadside motels. Batcave is an office that is in desperate need of repair. (The costumes are stored in a filing cabinet!) <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the filmmakers could not make more efforts to create an exciting adventure. While having two TV shows on DVD is a plus for any serious Batfan, you shouldn’t be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box. They reflect more of the true mood of the comics than all the 15 chapters of "Batman and Robin" combined. <br /> <br /> Now the good news is not the 1997 version!
