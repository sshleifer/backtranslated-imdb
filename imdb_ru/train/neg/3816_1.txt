He has a very bad game. Bad storylines. Bad Characters You should never see this show if you see it on. TURN OFF. Or you will cringe within the next 30 minutes. It should never have been communicated. This is not great. You should never see this. NEVER EVER. So now, if you ever want to watch this show, please do not. Go to CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place or Nick for Drake & Josh. This is a much better family show. Believe me, I watched it before. And it's fair, and I honestly say the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of television. So do me a favor, and never watch this show.
