I have to say that the first time I watched this movie was about 6 years ago, and then I really liked it. I recently bought a DVD, and after a second preview I wondered why I liked it. The acting was terrible, and, as usual, we have stereotypical clans in their fake costumes. The game was terrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job, like Liam Neeson, but I don't know what Jessica Lange was thinking. <br /> <br /> The storyline was good, but the performance was just bad. I'm tired of seeing Scotland in films. Braveheart was even worse, although these films only save grace. But seriously, in those days people did not speak like that, why should all actors have Glasewegian accents? Just another movie to try to grasp the essence of the already tired and annoying stereotypes. I noticed that the only people here who say that this film is good are Americans, and frankly, I understand why they like it, I know that they are in love with men in Kilts. However, if you are thinking about buying a DVD, I would say spend your money on something else, such as the best film.
