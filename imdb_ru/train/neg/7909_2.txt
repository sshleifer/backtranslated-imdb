Incredible! <br /> <br /> This film received 7 out of 10 points. It has to be one of the worst films I've seen in recent years. Not only was the game incredibly bad, the storyline (if you can call it that) was just as bad. Of course, everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. What is not bad, if you can captivate the audience during the preparation for this moment. This, however, is not the case. There is no action, no expectation, not even a spark between the 2 leading actors. Unfortunately, it was a waste of my time and, of course, a waste of my money. <br /> <br /> and 2 just for trying
