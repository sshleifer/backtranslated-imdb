This makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This film is amazing how terrible it is. Turning off the DVD player was not enough action. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them. I will never return this time. Never. How can you create such a trite, boring and soulless movie? I could not think of how I could get tired. Writing such ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a shameful movie. What more can you say than repeat how terrible the game is. Please avoid.
