Good Death. Good Mask. Steep ax. Good looking girls .... But be careful !!! No conspiracies and little scares. Completely lower their standards. They tried to do "I know what you did last summer," but in the end they made a "Scream." But hey, what do people expect from a horror movie? The answers are completely different. Rent it if you want, but I’m sorry I’ve ever seen it.
