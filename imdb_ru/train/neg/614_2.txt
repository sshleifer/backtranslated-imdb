I am watching this on the sci-fi channel right now. It's so terrible, I can't stop watching this! I am a videographer, and this film makes me sad. I feel bad for everyone associated with this film. Part of the camera work is good. Most very doubtful. There are several decent actors in the film. It is a pity that they are surrounded by relatives of the director. This is the only way they could get the right to act in movies! The music was a little better than acting. If you take the time to look at it, I hope this is because there was absolutely no other option! The sequel (yes, the continuation) has already begun ... I think I will miss it! Jason
