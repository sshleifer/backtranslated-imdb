This is a low-budget parody of the spy genre. To help articulate your expectations, you should know that: (1) The game is wildly tough. The stars are having fun fulfilling their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures and silent stimulation. (2) The script consciously lacks continuity and credibility. The lines are often sharp and humorous, because they have absolutely nothing to do with the previous elements of the plot. (3) Frames often frame an imbalance, ridiculing excess genres. (4) Jeff Goldblum, with wide-open eyes, put on a complex and classically ridiculous dialogue in an advantageous sarcastic way. <br /> <br /> The film has a controlling mind, intentionally starting with a plot element stolen from the B-films of the film. 1930s: secret code with a structure that defies explanation of Karl Sagan. The supernatural action of the film is mainly used for the comic effect during the first 90 minutes. At the start of a run, Fay Grim Nedâ€™s son is so often told to leave that you cannot stop laughing, feeling sorry for the guy. Parker Posey's pleasant choreographic fall also helps set a humorous tone at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The slow pace of the film does not reinforce comedy or drama elements that appear later. The impact of the film as a drama is significantly reduced by the early comedy. In addition, it is difficult to be excessively associated with the characters and their fates, when the first parts of the film are so sarcastic. The musical accompaniment is intentionally harsh, and I found that this (and the viewing angles off-camera) are more annoying than jokes. <br /> <br /> An incredible game, an incredible and almost incomprehensible plot of conspiracies / confronts conspiracies, and the slow buildup will overwhelm many viewers. The film is too long and takes 158 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, fans who are susceptible to the sarcasm of the film may want to watch again ... using hidden subtitles to better understand the intelligent absurdity of the dialogue. The film was too slow for me, and sarcasm seemed tougher than carefree. But comedy may well satisfy your tastes. The film is worth watching for those who love independent films, fans of director Hal Harley or the devotees of Parker Posey (who has the most time to shoot).
