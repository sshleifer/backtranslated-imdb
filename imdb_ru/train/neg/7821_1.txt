Did the filmmakers even watch it before they released it? The script jumps from place to place without any special explanation. The beginning does not clarify whether this is a prequel or not. It starts from the beginning of Superman on Earth, and then goes to the point after the last movie - but does not really warn the viewer about it. VERY confusing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is depicted as a potential domestic pest, stalker, and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes for an interesting character. The ending is absolutely ridiculous. The superman who came to the hospital just made me want to kill him for myself. I'm seriously looking forward to a parody of SNL, where Superman appears on Mori Povich, and Mori says: “The results - in the case of a child, Superman, you are the father”. To sum it up - OK, acting by this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The film is mostly invisible.
