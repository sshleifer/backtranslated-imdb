This is a very sad movie. Indeed. Nothing happens in this movie. The script is bad !!! I think they just copied and pasted the first 15 pages into 90 pages. The producers must have thought, let's create a Hollywood film here in Belgium. They failed. Now in the third week, it only works in Antwerp and Brussels at 22.45, or so In the past, we had really good films in Belgium, such as Daens. Shades are a waste of your time. Maybe you could sneak into the theater after watching a real movie. If you saw Shades 10 minutes, you saw all this. It was announced to death on local radio and television. I hope this will disappear soon in Shades.
