I rated this movie as 1, as the plot is incredible, incredible. Judge for yourself. Keep in mind that the following will not only distribute the plot, but also ruin your appetite for watching a movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus created by a frustrated nerd sends code through television screens and computer monitors. When a code — in the form of light — enters the eye, it can access your body's “electrical system”. It causes the body's cells to excrete calcium. A few seconds after infection, the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin becomes white from calcium, after which he falls, and his hand and skull crack in a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very smart. When he discovers that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code using a manually operated Braille output device, the device receives a very high voltage, which causes severe burn wounds to the scalp of the expert. The virus also feels aggression against remote controls and ATM keyboards. Fortunately, this could be stopped by throwing outdated desktop PCs into a rack and electrocuted the nerd with their backs on a broken computer and in some spilled water. <br /> <br /> Oh dear ...
