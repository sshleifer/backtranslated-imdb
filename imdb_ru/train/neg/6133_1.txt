Kurt Thomas plays the role of Jonathan Cabot as a gymnast who prepares for a special game that includes a hunt for a group of ninjas, but these ninjas will have no chance, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! In general, Gymkata is a damn bad film, a brutal game, a horrible script and really incompetent direction make the quality below human standards, but this film is so terrible that it becomes really, really funny. I mean dialogue, such as "I know, I will sleep!" Or "Ha!, Your end!" only add to the false value, which Gymkata more than it receives. In addition, it is (wisely) the only film in which there is a hero, a gymnast who finds things to swing at the height of.
