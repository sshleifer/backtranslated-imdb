I saw my fair share of poorly thought-out endings and final movie turns, but I don’t remember a single film that committed a suicide outright, like this one. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly hoped that the great turn would “surprise” all of us ... and this happened, but perhaps not in the way the directors hoped. I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had something to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The film, until the last thirty minutes, was quite interesting, and I like how the story was unfolding and on the nature of the film as a whole. But as soon as the turn was revealed, the holes in the plot and the discrepancies became remarkable, the main motive of revenge was ill-conceived, and the methods that worked so neatly for Bobby Earl were ridiculously contrived. Worst of all, after the turn was discovered, the rest of the film became painfully predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave a terrific presentation, and Connery looks like Morgan Freeman in the sense that he never gives a bad idea, even if the film is not that good! In general, everything starts well, and the unfolding interests the viewer. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable dives in the history of cinema.
