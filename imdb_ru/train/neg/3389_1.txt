I saw the original “Pripevskaya Line” on Broadway, God knows how many times, and I felt passion, despair and joy from this living experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew that he would have to re-introduce the Chorus for the screen, but he could never figure out how to do it. If the person who invented the show is puzzled, this should answer your question. There are several shows that are simply made so that they can be seen live - with the audience. However, Richard Attenborough, fresh from the musical work of Gandhi and the dance with animals in Doctor Doolittle, ended up directing this film, which had almost no resemblance to the stage show. Terrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Great songs were discarded or transferred to other characters (which didn't make sense). Michael Douglas was mistakenly accepted. People who could not dance, tried to act, and there was a sexy woman “Landers” who could not sing, play or dance - I think she just finished being the wife of Gandhi. Jeffrey Hornadei’s dances look like nothing more than a slok from Flashdance that rejects and nothing works. I sat there, stunned by how something so exciting and emotional can be drained to zero. If you really like this show, and it returns to Broadway in 2006 - watch it, but don’t think that the long-running musical event that was “A Chorus Line” has anything to do with this film.
