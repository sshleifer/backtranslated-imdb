Another look at the horror. The differences in the styling of American and Russian films are interesting. However, from my American point of view, this film was not very good. The main character, Marie, performed by Anastasia Hille, was not a pleasant character, and it was difficult for me to communicate with her. She was unpleasant most of the time and embarrassed much of what was left little time. Also, too much time was spent bringing her to the top spot in the film. Then a long time passed before real tension arose. As soon as this happened, the volume seemed to be used as the main effect, which was more annoying than anything else. This concept was more original than most direct-viewing movies, and they did not use sex to make up for the subtle plot. In general, I would recommend it for rent, but not for theatergoers.
