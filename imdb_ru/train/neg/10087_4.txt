This is probably the first entry in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keith"; O'Learyâ€™s later films were played by much younger actors than Guy Kibby. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all of them played by famous characters) gather in the old house (on a rainy night). of course!) talk to a rich relative who falls into a coma. <br /> <br /> While they are waiting for his recovery, all sorts of mysterious events take place, including a couple of murders. <br /> Creepy movie; worth a look!
