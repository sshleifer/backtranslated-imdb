SciFi has recently been very unlucky in making quality films (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based on the great epic Beowulf, but he deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that television commercials would call him "some kind of crap film by Christopher Lambert." I did not expect it to be as accurate as a full-scale Hollywood production, but, nevertheless, I expected that “artistic integrity” would not interfere with the real story (even if it was changed a little to make the two-hour stream of storyboards pleasant) intervals). <br /> <br /> The director and producers had some idea of ​​what they were doing (were any studies done on this issue?). Obviously not, as can be judged by the massive horned helmets worn by Beowulf and his team (except for the mullet boy). Although one of the main problems I faced was the very look at Grendel: if Beowulf had to fight him, wasn't he sixteen feet tall and weighed 2 tons? Grendel's death segment also lacked in all respects? in my opinion, the one in the epic was actually better than the fictional garbage in the script; for example: Should Beowulf have his arm pulled out of Grendel's nest ?? do not cut off your forearm after it has been set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother - did they just join her with the dragon at the end of the epic, where he eventually dies when he gives up his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this film, because its connection with the epic is not, because it really is not (except for the names of the characters). The only way I could recommend this movie is if you liked the Druid film (directed by Jacques Dorfmann) ?? although I do not recommend watching either.
