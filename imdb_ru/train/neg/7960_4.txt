I rented it because the second segment injured me like a little kid. One day, early in the morning, I made my way down the stairs, started watching HBO, and The Raft (segment 2) terrorized me well. This time I still enjoyed the Raft, although I could not say whether it was for nostalgic reasons or it was a really good short one. The other two segments were completely trash. I can not believe that the manufacturer somewhere paid to make this garbage. Watching this, I only destroyed another childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad on my list of spoiled children's classics. 4/10
