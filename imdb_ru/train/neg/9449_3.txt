Dr. Seuss will probably get angry now if he is alive. Cat in the Hat proves how filmmaking can take a classic story and turn it into a senseless bunch of fool. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, a big mistake! Myers argues that he cannot play in this film. He behaves like a fashionable girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. With children in this film, everything is in order, somewhere between the dull and annoying lines. The story is similar to the original with a couple of tweaks and, like most movies based on other stories, never adapts to the original story! Lead Quinn's evil neighbor was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who never gets anywhere in life. This film is like a rejected comic from a newspaper, if you think about it. The film really looks tasteless! Of course, there are funny jokes for adults, for example, when a cat has cuts on its tail, and the censor leaves before you utter a naughty word, slightly funny. At the very least, Grinch spanked, and the film was really good! This film is a cartoon piece of snot with bright colors and a bad mediocre game. Was Mike Myers even in this movie? And one more thing, fish. What with this stupid fish! The first time you see him, he is a real fish. The next time you see him, he is all animated and talking. But it looks like an animated piece of rubber dough! This film is completely out of control. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I am surprised that he even had good jokes, such as a joke with a water park, it was good. So please, if you have a choice, watch Grinch instead of this mess.
