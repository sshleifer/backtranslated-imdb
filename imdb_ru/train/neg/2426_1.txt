Believe me, this is one of the frustrated films you want to avoid, and this is from one huge fan of Denzel Washington. It is frustrating that this is 1/3 of a GREAT movie. The first part of this film does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Chrisie and the girl he pays for protection. All trailers for this film mention that she was kidnapped. So I don’t give anything away when I say that after her abduction, the film turns into an almost unsightly mess. Whatever the director tried to achieve, all he succeeds in is literally nauseous of the audience. For the next half hour, quick, frantic, and intermittent cuts follow, and Chrisy hunts down criminals. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseous that all they do is remove you from the story. I’m sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting the story meant a change in the character of Chrisy and meant that another film would follow. Well, he was right. The film that followed was complete and unsatisfactory crap. The result is a depressing finale that destroys even the quality of the first forty minutes of the film.
