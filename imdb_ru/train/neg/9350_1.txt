This movie was terrible. The first half hour is very similar to ... well, sorry for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of "A Clockwork Orange." The first scene is almost copied from one of the first to Clockwork! Presumably, this was a tribute, according to the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the wall of the main character, but the word “robbery” is a more appropriate word. The cinema felt as if it had been torn out straight from the Kubrick classics, only filmed by the eyes of a new director. Blind director. Unfortunately, when he stops the massacre of Kubrick, the film gets worse. As another commentator said, the depth of this film is simply hidden in your throat. Arrogant, self-absorbed and, ultimately, meaningless nonsense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the delusions of the main characters would affect the nerve if there was some real character development in this film. I felt absolutely nothing about this guy. And I am an alcoholic, so I believe that if someone can feel something for him, it will be me. Horrible character development, dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is the title. For a film called “16 years of alcoholism”, alcoholism is hardly one of the factors in the film. Look at the first paragraph - it was such a slaughter of the orange clockwork that I can't handle it. A more appropriate name would be “16 years of violence” or, even better, “Clockwork Banana”. <br /> <br /> Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and still drink it, have a drink. Trust me.
