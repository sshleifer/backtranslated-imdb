Going into it, I was expecting something really good, but after it hurt me, I'm just happy to think that it is not. It's hard to think that for directors (HA!) It was a good movie. the stories, and I freely use the world, are incoherent and have any meaning. There are just stupid things that happen by chance. acting, if you can call it acting, is terrible, I saw how batter played toy advertising! I know that these are low-cost video-waste bins, but, nevertheless, not even the way they tried. Will, after thinking, I feel very sleepy and yet # yawws # do, I'm going to go to bed. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DRIVE, GO, READ AND DO NOT ANY AFTER LOOKING FOR CHILERS. OTHER SIDE EFFECTS MAY BE RADIATED BY ANY OR ALL METAL FUNCTIONS.
