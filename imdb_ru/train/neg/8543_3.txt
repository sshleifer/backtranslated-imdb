I admit, I had to rewind this badly transmitted DVD in about 30 minutes - nothing happened, and everyone had already described the “plot”. But someone mentioned the opening scene - he pierced a butcher's knife with a wig and pierced the grass in the front yard! I suppose the kid did it, but it was never explained. Truly trypichny discovery. <br /> <br /> I wish it was a better written or thought-out film, because what we have left, if it's pretty stupid, and a film that does not make sense is not a “smart” film, it's just poorly executed film. <br /> <br /> I would like to see the corrected version, and if there was any missing video, I would like to see if this helps. Otherwise, it's a weird little movie that is best to rewind!
