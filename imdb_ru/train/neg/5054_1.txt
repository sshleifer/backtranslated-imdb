We know that firefighters and rescuers are heroes: an idea that few will challenge. The friends and family of these and others who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center may well be touched by this insane film that has become a film. A nice, serious, though tongue-tied firefighter remembers that he may have lost colleagues, a stunned journalist who turns his fragments into praise. They ponder the results. He mumbles a little more, she makes up another speech, and so on. Etc. P. is boring.
