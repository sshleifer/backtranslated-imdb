What else can be said about this film, except for "Caution, the viewer." Christmas Evil should come with a warning label, like a cigarette, because it is harmful to my eyes and ears. I am rarely dissatisfied with the horror film "b", but this film cannot even frighten a five-year-old child a little. The sense of a mad madman who craves blood in a film is that he / she must seem almost godlike, as if nothing can stop their manic rage, but in this film the resident psychopath is stuck in a chimney in a pipe. A strange attempt to surprise your next victim and, of course, follow the popular legend of Santa Claus. This reminds the viewer that this person is by no means dangerous, because he is too stupid to be dangerous. In general, a complete waste of film.
