I rarely come across such a terrible, annoying and annoying movie. This is without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, though not tangled, but useless due to catchy editing. Why did Domino become such a harsh tough bitch? Because her golden fish died when she was a child, and this “traumatic” event left her emotionally backward and hating everyone. When dialogue is not trivial or banal, it is full of ludicrous lines, such as: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and all the rest." At some point, the bounty hunters in the backseat of their bus was tied to some guy with a tattooed number on his arm. Because of the confusing call on a mobile phone, instead of rolling up the sleeve and just reading the number, they are knocking his hand with a shotgun. In another moment, bounty hunters take a bomb to meet with the mafia and threaten to drop the bomb if the mafia does not let them go !? Obviously, not going to a meeting would be too easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is unconvincing and terribly mistaken. Mickey Rourke manages to save some confidence from this mess. <br /> <br /> I liked some of Tony Scott's previous films, “True Romance,” but all I could think about this nonsense was that it had to be made a complete idiot.
