I borrowed this film from the library, I think it can be amazing. How am I wrong? <br /> <br /> This is such a bad film that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is SO bad in the film, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She is a beautiful girl, but in this film she is not at all seductive, but I have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. This is so funny. <br /> <br /> And the dialogue of the film is so ambitious, and it lacks a humorous fact that makes it acceptable. <br /> <br /> Absolutely bad luck.
