It was all over with slashers around 88, so it's time for raw copies of those old movies. The brain is well made, the script reminded me of Videodrome, but then in a more audacious way, as mentioned earlier. Acting can go through this. But these are the effects that make you laugh, the so-called brain is really a turkey, and blood is never shown. The intro sequence is what makes this film worth seeing, the hallucinations are really well done and remind me of the Nightmare on Elm Street, remember that the phone is coming to life ... Somehow, as you continue to watch this movie, expecting what will happen next . This is visible to all freaks, because there is no blood in them, and, as said, there is no blood either, but for perverts there is nudity. I have seen films worse than this one, only it is a pity that they did not turn bloody ...
