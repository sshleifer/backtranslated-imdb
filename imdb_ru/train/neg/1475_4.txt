Most episodes in the first season are terrible. There is no comparison with the Twilight Zone or the Outer Limits, as their programs did have decent plot lines. Most of the “Amazing Stories” are pretty boring ... not surprising in no way ... rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I heard that the 2nd season of this series is much better ... also for some reason on DVD They cut out the parts of Ray Walston, which further reduce this collection. One cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Although most of the plot lines are very predictable, and the series could be better with turns and twists that made you think ...
