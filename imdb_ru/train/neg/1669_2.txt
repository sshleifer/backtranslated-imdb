Here we are: two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on Earth ... One of them is desperately trying to save lives, the other is an inhuman murder machine, determined to destroy a woman who gives birth to the savior of the entire race. . <br /> <br /> So, what can we call this killing machine? Looks like he's some kind of destroyer or destroyer ... sort of like a destroyer or something like that. What word am i looking for ... something that defines things? Hmmm .... <br /> <br /> In any case, the defender (who quickly removes the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker in favor of local clothes) first finds the young woman and permeates her future hero - to be. Angry, uh-uh ... the "fighter" kills some of the woolens and steals their weapons and clothes, then tries to find the woman, visiting her workplace and asking, threateningly looking into people's eyes and threateningly repeating her name. <br /> <br /> Then a desperate struggle for survival begins, as the seemingly immortal and irrepressible "fighter" pursues a couple throughout the countryside. At some point he may purchase boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in an exciting finale, he will try to crush them under the wheels of a huge, full tank truck. .. acid. Then the truck will crash. They will be saved ... but no! Then he will reappear, as strong as ever. He will kill a defender and pursues a girl at a meat processing plant, where in terrible condition he is pushed into a large piece of industrial grinding equipment and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I am extrapolating too much ... in the end, I stopped watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically soaked Sean Young, kissed her in a bar, and then said that baby will be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> Costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek: Next Generation! Shaun Young makes another great twist as an unemotional replicant, and careerist Steven Baldwin is also on board as fat boy Young. Not sure where it fits into the plot though ... maybe it's from another James Cameron movie?
