I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low-budget films, so this is not my problem with this. My problem with this is that I felt like I was watching my neighbor's home movies. It seemed like it was all about how the guy wrote the short story, grabbed the camera and started shooting. I understand how difficult it is to do it effectively, but when I pay for renting a film, I expect that I will have the feeling that I am watching some film of a professionally made film. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a huge resume, a great actor, and everything was fine in this movie. There were no other people in it. I understand how it should be fun and cheaper to use friends and relatives as actors, but this does not contribute to a convincing game. It seemed like he was shot, he tried to give many scenes a more interesting look, but when the script, plot and acting begin, this style is not needed, and distraction. <br /> <br /> Digital artifacts were also everywhere on the technical level. In the first scene of all these beautiful cars, when they slowly scanned them, they seemed to twitch a little bit back and forth. The problem is not in my viewing equipment (Benq PE-8700 diagonal 84 "), but somewhere in production. I have never seen such an artifact in a professionally made film. Then there was a sound. It sounded like they did not make any voice-over that It may be good, if only it did not sound like a track in this film, but as a built-in microphone on the camera.
