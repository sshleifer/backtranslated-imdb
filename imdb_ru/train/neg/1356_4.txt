First of all, I completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a “fraud”. Crispin Glover takes his film very seriously. He personally presented the film at a show that I saw in Chicago. He has worked on the film for many years, and he is the first in the intended trilogy. "What is it?" This is an attempt by Crispin Glover in a feature film in the spirit of those whom he idolizes from Duke, Lynch, etc. <br /> <br /> I heard a rumor about the movie years ago “Epic porn movie with everyone down the litho syndrome under the guidance of a crisp glover.” When he finally came out, I watched the trailer online and read the synopsis, and I was impatient on the lips. ... I went to Chicago to see it, and it was a big disappointment. If he pulled stupid shit, such as a grandmother who smoked a pot, and dancing dolls, he would have left much better, but only about 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> In other words, just watch the trailer, have fun and leave everything as it is. There are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases, but its lack of focus is disappointing.
