this film was covered with scandal for so long that it became a very popular subject ... resentment, mystery, etc. It had everything to be a great piece, but in the end it failed in all respects. This is a terribly bad comedy, a pitiful horror film, a sloppy erotic film. <br /> <br /> The two-disc DVD includes a magnificent booklet with photos, interviews, essays on bestiality, etc., as well as an extensive interview with a more than pretentious director. For those who have heard about it, but have never seen it, the package will seem fantastic until someone sees the movie. Disc 1 contains an edited film, poorly translated into English, but with good visual quality. Disc 2 contains the uncut passage in a terrible translation in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this beast? Kermit's frog hand puppet would be more effective and shocking.
