It follows the same path as most of the sequels. The first was great. The second one was average, and this film was full of bad games and some kind of stupid dialogue, as well as a large amount of suspension from disbelief, this film was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable, and I just couldn't bear that Henry Winkler. As a boss with such a dull eye, they could have done so much more. I really liked the first one. I would like them to go in the same spirit, and not by what they did here. <br /> <br /> There were too many inexplicable things that needed to be explained, at what period of time this happened and why, why, why, why the old phone in this room? <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, there is another telephone in work. <br /> <br /> Blah!
