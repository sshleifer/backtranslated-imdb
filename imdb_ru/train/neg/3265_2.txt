I have no idea which audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy of diseases. With Redd Fox in the lead role and enough plump outfits and polyester to cover the entire 1970s with a carpet, Norman plays like a picture with explosions in combination with any number of stupid comic episodes related to a misunderstanding of comics, not to mention an elongated camelon flowers! Based on the play of Sam Bobrik and Ron Clark, this story of a separated couple (Fox and Pearl Bailey) learns how hard their son is secretly gay - and lives with stuffing, a white homosexual galloping - sluggish enough - twisted jokes to disgrace anyone an early episode of "company of three". Bailey retains his dignity, and Fox's apparent confusion is good for a couple of chuckles, but the rest of the performers are humbled. * from ****
