Despite the rather bad reviews, did I just have to try this movie ?? after all, she is HK super-baby Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental beauties as a team of robbers. Of course it's worth checking out? Well, in a children's festival it's hard to beat Martial Angels. Top quality eye candy. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as ever, and from the rest of the girls Rosemary Vandebrook and Amanda Strang especially caught my attention. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, judging this film by other possible virtues Absolutely smelly! The story is weak, shoddy action and special effects frankly pathetic. Director Clarence Fock and producer Wong Jing gave us a photogenic cast and a little more. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you are going to watch this movie, then you had better watch Sex and Zen again!
