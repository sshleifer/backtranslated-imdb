From time to time a group of friends with a minimum budget, but with enthusiasm and talent creates a low-budget masterpiece that conquers the world of horrors. Raimi and Co. did it with the Sinister Dead, Jackson and friends did well with Bad Taste and Mayrik and Sanchez made a mint with Project Blair Witches. <br /> <br /> Directed by Todd Sheets and his buddies, however, are doomed to wallow forever in relative obscurity if the Zombie Bloodbath something passes. The lesson of how not to make cheap horror, this pitiful effort (about the plague of zombies eating the flesh, of course) serves as a reminder that, although many people today have access to a video camera, most should not take it as a signal to try your hand at making a feature film. <br /> <br /> It’s not that Sheets didn’t have an eye for a wonderful frame (some of his perspectives and movements are actually pretty pretty), but rather a) he has a lousy script b) he has a lousy actor composition and c) he does not understand that he has a lousy script and cast. This means that the final film is highly amateurish, and it is unlikely that anyone will watch it in full except the viewers of a film about zombies (like me) or members of the film crew (for example, those who gave positive comments to the film). <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at illegible beagles, and Sheets (who currently has an incredible 34 titles behind the director) is definitely trying his best to please buckets of offal and blood is shed upon every opportunity. But while these moments are undoubtedly nasty, they are not particularly convincing, and soon get pretty tiresome. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, this is a really bad film, almost without redemptive features. With the exception of two: <br /> <br /> First, it depicts the single greatest mullet in the history of the film, as talked about by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The magnificence of his barnet (combined with an attractive mustache) is the only reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are “pitiful invisible zombies” in it: corpses that eat meat, which trap unhappy victims. wander past before jumping off their hiding place to launch a weak attack, which hardly requires any effort to escape from. Best known for hiding behind the door for hours, waiting for someone to open it, “pitiful zombie tricks” also sometimes hide behind low walls or sit in churches, posing as members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Normally, a movie would have gotten bad for 1/10 for me, but in celebrating the smooth locks of Jerry Angell, I generously upgraded my rating to 2/10.
