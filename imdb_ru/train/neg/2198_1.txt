The scientist and his girlfriend are driving, when its excess causes a car accident. He escapes safe and sound, but she is beheaded. He saves her head, brings it to his house and keeps him alive (!!!!). Then he starts looking for patterns and strippers for the perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant watches his head, which starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathic) connection with a deformed monster that is stored in a closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, these are pretty stupid things, but I had a certain love for him. When I grew up in the late 1970s, the local TV channel showed this film about 20 times a year (without exaggeration). They always showed it on Saturday afternoons. Seeing it on TV was great then! Explicit blood and blood along with a terrible monster and dirty sexual exploitation - who cares if it was good? Seeing this now, I realize how lousy it really is. <br /> <br /> The game is absolutely terrible, there are no staged values, the script is rather stupid and (besides still quite disgusting blood) this is a boring thing, There is also a soft cat fight between two women and admittedly a great monster at the end. Also add to the ending that leaves tons of loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of a film about the exploitation of the 1960s. On the other hand, it is a complete rubbish. In any case, this is not a very good film, but it must be watched (only once) for horror and blood fans. <br /> <br /> Laughter in the head is pretty creepy. Pay attention to the end credits that incorrectly give the NAME (calling it “HEAD that will not die”)!
