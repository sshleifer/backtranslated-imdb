Last night my friends and I shot this film, and we had one of the loudest laughs lately. The film does not have to be funny, but it is just funny, and it lacks realism. First, Philip (I forgot his character’s name, and I don’t care) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the top security terminals. This is not only pitiful, but also reaches its peak, when its enormous efforts end in the search for such a terrible Lego room in which there are supercomputers. This is ridiculous. The tense mood that we have to experience is completely ruined by the children's room. The end, like everything else, is very, very foolish, especially when the bad guy's lawyer appears "just in time". In any case, this film is a good laugh. If you need something to laugh, be sure to look.
