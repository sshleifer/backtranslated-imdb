Let's see, here are the “highlights” of The Brain Machine: 15 shots from the pool and at home; 15 the creation of frames nondescript office building; 5 countdowns with a soft tech; 7 close-ups of the formidable guard; and a lot of technical chatter to show us that this is a high-tech experiment. <br /> <br /> Various authors have commented on the inconsistency between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date indicated on the 1977 DVD box. It is easy to explain. This dog just sat on a shelf without release for five years, until someone shook it off, thinking that it fits perfectly into a mood of distrust after the Watergate administration. Now, after watching The Brain Machine, I am only surprised that it was released at all!
