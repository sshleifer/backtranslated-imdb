This film is terrible. Not one quality for this film. You might think that the blood will be good, but bad. The effects are worse, and acting, if you can call it that, acting is the worst thing I've ever seen. This film was clearly videotaped, and its budget is probably around $ 500. If you want to watch a good movie about zombies, than watch “Dawn of the Dead” or “Day of the Dead”. If you want to see a good cheap shot on the video about the movie "Zombies", but better than watching Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is invisible and meaningless. You have been warned. I have nothing more to say about this stupid film.
