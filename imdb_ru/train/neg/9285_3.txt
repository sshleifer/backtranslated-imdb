Believing that I wanted to take a new film by Jet Li, in order to see some but unrestrained and brainless melee fights, I grabbed this title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in this film there are more gun battles (ala Chow Yun Fat), but nowhere is this better) than Jet Li and the acrobatic battles of the company. So it was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Crane fights were interesting and even funny, considering that it was completely unexpected for me in the movie Jet Li, more detail about Jackie Chan. <Br /> <br /> But alas, I would recommend the Fist of Legend, the masters of Tai Chi or even the Enforcer because of this frustration. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for the total number of films
