This film is based on the novel by John Fante. Can someone please say why? I see absolutely no reason why this beautiful book should be adapted in this way. If you want to create a romantic, melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farrell and Selma Hayek, how could you relate to Ask the Dust (novel)? “And if you want to turn this story into a film, then why do you do it in a romantic, melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farrell and Selma Hayek?” I do not understand. <br /> <br /> Adaptation of this story is made poorly, and if you read the book and you liked it, I am almost sure that you will not like what Town did to her, <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the film you may find a strange cast, bad game and cinematography that are a bit exaggerated. But you hope for the best. I really hoped for this movie. I really wanted it to be good. But it is only getting worse, and it is so simple: whether you read the novel by Fantes or not, this is not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production, combined with a bad acting, lack of structure and - of course - a lot of shots of Colin Farels' bare ass. <br /> <br /> I could complain much more about this film, but why waste my time. I saw this. Good. I had to see it, because I really like the book and I was curious. And I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 for Colin's sweet little whiskers at the end of the film. So cute ... If he wore it all the time, I would give 2/10.
