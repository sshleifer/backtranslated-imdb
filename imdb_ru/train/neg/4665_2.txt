I really wanted to like the Pillow Book. An intriguing story, interesting outlines of a character, Evan McGregor in a completely magnificent whole. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenway was so fascinated by the unique presentation of the film, and not in favor of the film. I will not even go into the terrible game of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> You are distracted by a story with 4 billion small windows and calligraphy that rolls along the bottom of the screen, displaying the text of the music being played. He seems to have lost sight of the presentation of the real story and the development of the plot, and he became entangled in foo-foo ornaments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like the portrait presentation of John Singer Sargent in the short Hallmark frame, which says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" large shiny letters. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a victim of the director's ego, and not of what could be - anxious and terrifyingly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Wife? Coppola?) It could be a masterpiece. In Greenwayâ€™s hands, it is best to take classes of the visual arts, which also take themselves too seriously.
