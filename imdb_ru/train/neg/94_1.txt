CHRONICLES OF ZOMBIES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio format: mono <br /> <br /> When searching (literally ) A ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Amy Smith) picks up a gray-haired hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty), who tells her two stories about meat-eating zombies that are thought to haunt the area. <br /> <br /> ABSOLUTE waste of time, from the very beginning held down by the painfully amateur game of Haggerty in a key role. Worst of all, the two stories that make up the main part of the duration of the race are completely routine, aggravated by the indifferent performances and careless guidance of Brad Sykes, who was previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a “funny” film in the sense that Ed Wood’s films are “funny” (he, at least, believed in what he did and was sincere in his efforts, despite the lack of talent); Sykes' self-made films are, in fact, sharpened, boring and almost completely devoid of any redemptive virtue, and most viewers will feel rightly angry and deceived by such unimaginable, ill-conceived junk. The 3-D format is completely useless here.
