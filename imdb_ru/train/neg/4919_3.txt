I have rarely been so annoyed with the lead act as Ali McGraw in this film. God, is she tired or how ?! She speaks in one tone and is terrible, so terrible that Ryan O'Neill, on the contrary, is magnificent. <br /> <br /> There is not much history. He is rich, it is wooden, they both need to sacrifice a lot for the sake of love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, her name is by name, in case you don’t notice a difference in the two of them, which they overcame in the name of love. <br /> <br /> Oscar nomination for this film indicates that it was a bad year. John Marley is okay as Woodan's father, but the nomination of support? At least, Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I still think that Catherine Ross should have played Jennifer, but again, if it depended on me, Catherine Ross would have been in a lot more movies. She is definitely a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I didn’t even cry when she fell ill, it never even occurred to me to feel sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones, who looked like he was about 15 years old, and the result is good. But this is already so old that he has a mile-long beard, and the sin of it is not that he is old, but he feels it.
