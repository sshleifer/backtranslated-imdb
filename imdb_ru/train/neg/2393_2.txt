I read “EVEN HIT” by Tom Robbins “GOT BLUE” when I was a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny and full of charming landscapes and beautiful writing. But when I saw the film, I could not believe what a boring, sour, joyless piece of trash it was. How did it happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under the heading "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (This is the subject heading of the Library of Congress.) Now anyone who is over 12 years old is reading this book will know that she has NOTHING with real lesbians other than STAR WARS about real space travel. Obviously, the book was written by a heterosexual man who loves the IDEA of lesbians (all naked), but never met her. <br /> <br /> However, someone in Hollywood said: “Oh, better give it to a gay director, otherwise gays will have problems.” Therefore, they gave it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against this man, but - whatever he is gay - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant took a straightforward, playful male fantasy about the actions of a girl / girl without guilt, and men's voyeurism turned her into a boring, literally customized poster for lesbians recruiting power. This is similar to the transformation of the Oscar Wilde comedy into the tragedy of Arthur Miller. Not really. <br /> <br /> The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material was a terribly bad cast. His influence allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the real subtext of the novel (the fantasy of a straightforward person, and not a gay recruitment poster) led him to make a choice that was not only bad, but also bizarre. <br /> <br /> Let's meet with the actors EVEN COWGIRLS GET BLUE. <br /> <br /> Pat Morita in the role of "CHINA". Well, very few Asian actors recognize names. And Pat Morita on Happy Days was pretty funny. But to pronounce it as CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that Cink is a very funny person. (Gus did not tell him.) Pat doesn't know what Cink is either. SEXY !!! In the book he is not the wise old Mr. Miyagi. He looks more like Hugh Hefner! He is an old, goat goat, and he knows A LOT about how to please the new and responsive jelly of Sissy and Bonanza. (You see, in the book they are not REALLY lesbians. Do you understand that this is still a fantasy of a simple person?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HERT as “COSMETICS”. Well, he is a cheerful, friendly person. But he is a serious shakepirskiy actor !!!! You need someone who is hilarious and camp for this role. For John Hert to be such a dull guy as the Countess is tragic and sad. I expected Paul Scofield to be dressed like everyone else, like Thomas More, and shook his head sadly. “Now, Richard, you know that you have completely lost your soul. To my shame, my former student! ”And yes, John Hurt was funny (and quite funny) like Caligula. But it was BLACK humor, not playful and fresh humor, as in the book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as Bonanza Jellybean. No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book of Bonanza, fun, playful, fun, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the film she is sullen, passive, passionless and boring. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book describes it as follows. "God knows that I love women, but nothing can replace a man who fits." Gus? Did you read this book? <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman as Sissy Hankshaw. This is a hard part. In Sissy's book, a truly extraordinarily passive and timid heroine. However, the more experienced actress may have made a twinkle in her eyes or influence her walk to imply some hidden power or hidden pleasure in her adventures. Mind can't handle it, probably because Gus never told her that Sissy should ENJOY hitchhiking with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Mind plays it more like a television movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This movie is sour and boring. And I blame YOU, Gus Van Sant!
