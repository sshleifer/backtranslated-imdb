Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to start with. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, this is a classic comedy. While the second part was filled with a lot of outdated humor and cheap shots, at least it was fun. There is nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, wiles and spectacles should be ridiculous by nature. To hit the viewer on the head with tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this film serves juvenile fools who will laugh at anything. When they served youth high school, any self-esteem was thrown out of the window. Ring parodies are not funny. I have been watching them in comedies since 1998. They are so outdated. Jokes Michael Jackson, too, not cool. To make matters worse, the two performers were mocked by “performers,” whose best days had never been. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema was slow. Such films are nails that drive into a coffin. What happened to the real humor? I have not laughed out loud in the cinema for a long time. Too many bad films rot the brain. Do you want proof? Go to the local rental video mega-network and see what is on the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe deception. I would prefer to watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous cycle than to suffer because of this bad excuse comedy again! <br /> <br /> Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
