HERA PHERI Priyadarshan was a good situational comedy. In this film, however, there is no story, but it is rather funny, but illogical. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not an entirely appropriate story, but it somehow manages a pleasant flow, although it is not something big. <br /> <br /> In the first half there are 2 funny scenes, for example, the one in which Akshay and John invite Neha for lunch and the other when Paresh enters. <br /> <br /> In the first half it’s boring, but in the second half it’s funnier, although they’re not a script. <br /> <br /> The jokes are funny, although I wonder how they never hear the voices of each person from the room? <br /> <br /> The climax of the confusion is perceived as a stage play, but it's pretty funny, but the movie ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> The direction is good. The music is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar does an excellent job with his role, which has now become his second skin, but this is his film completely, and it overshadows everyone else <br /> <br /> John stumbles everywhere and fail in the comedy. Paresh Rawal is cheerful, Rajpal is fine. Sometimes he is loud and clumsy. Nargis, Daisy and Nita (only Nita is visible now) are good in details, but they squeal too often. Manoj Joshi is fine.
