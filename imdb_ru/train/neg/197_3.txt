Being the great wester of James Arness, this film was the worst Alamo film ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy is everywhere and just plain untruth! Continuity was cast on the four winds. Anyone catch a sequence of guns? The Mexicans were stupid enough to shoot cannons, which clearly had dirt and ramrods still protruding from the pipes. Come on! Then there is Brian Keith's funny hat! The dresser should have been missing or something. Or just out of your mind!
