I usually support independent art and try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone, because their efforts are worth it ... <br /> <br /> but this film just goes beyond the limits of understanding and tolerance! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. Think about the REALLY worst horror movie youâ€™ve ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> 2. Think about some wonderful and attractive art for a DVD with this movie ... and a promising story ... <br /> <br /> 3. voila! You have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> View this only if you really have nothing better. ANYTHING is better.
