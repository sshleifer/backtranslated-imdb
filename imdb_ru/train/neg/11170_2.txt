There is a reason why this film for British television appeared only at the Toronto Film Festival in 1977. It is boring, painful and lacking in tension. <br /> <br /> The uncertainty of Peter Otul and the appearance of playwright Harold Pinter are the only elements of interest. <br /> <br /> Note. Will love to see Philip Jackson, known for the role of Inspector Jupp in the television series Poirot, in one of his first roles ....
