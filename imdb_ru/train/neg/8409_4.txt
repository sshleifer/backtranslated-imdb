Eddie Murphy for the best supporting actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Dzhimon Khons. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can play) walks this film like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? Did it work ??? <br /> <br /> This film fades compared to Chicago or just about any other recent musical. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the great singing and performance of Jennifer Hudson, I would give ZERO. <br /> <br /> And no, I have never seen a stage performance, so I do not play the typical Broadway against the Hollywood rap.
