Good. Look, I have seen a lot, and I mean a lot of films of this type. You know, those where the DVD cover looks so good and scary that you just can't wait to see it? Well, I received again. And I get tired of it. But I digress. It is quite simple. It sucks (I know, pretty underage), but it did. And I AGREE with another author, that if we had to come to terms with the boring thing, why, oh, why the lead actress should have been so unattractive? And the frown she used to convey unresolved pain / grief over the death of her daughter helped little. I mean, Jesus .. Oh, but the eccentric-crawler on her back was pretty neat ...
