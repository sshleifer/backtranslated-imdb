I really hate this show! I watched one episode, and I knew that this show was really terrible. The plot lines are poorly written and executed, and the jokes are really bad ... I mean, this is just a fake from Dexter Lab and Johnny Quest, about a disgusting boy with flaming blond hair and his twin, brilliant sisters and a talking dog ; Dad sitting at home and smart, very busy mom ... How, my God! Their dad is a mother, damn crazy housewife, isn't it so much fun! If my dad were a householder, I would personally die! It's a shame that ... In fact, I would. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say about this ... this parody, but only 3 words; count them in 3 words to describe this: <br /> <br /> · Chrome, · Stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! This is all I can say, guys, this is definitely on my list of the worst EV-ER cartoons! If I had one that is.
