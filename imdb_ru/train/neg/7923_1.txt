I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels, and the original “Corpse Grinders” is the main reason why, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Rene (“Desperate Life”) could not save this useless piece of garbage. This film should serve as a lesson for all past, present and future filmmakers ... when you have the same successful film as in the original Cadaver crusher, you probably should leave the sleeping dogs lying, and you should definitely not try revive him. more than twenty years later (if you don’t have financial support to get an excellent sequel such as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with “Bloody Holiday 2: all you can eat”) Even if you decide to do this, you are probably worth spending a little more money than you did on the original and for God's sake ... NEVER make a film on video ... why directors even try to do it when everyone knows that the quality will turn out disgusting ... I personally have not yet seen one film made in such a way that even stands gunpowder to blow it to hell ... if you can't afford a sequel that is better than your original film, then sell the rights to the film to someone who can ... and what you thought (or smoked) Ted V Mickels, when wrote this god terrible script? I mean, come on, dog and cat "aliens" from another planet? A cardboard box, painted to look like a destructive machine, capable of grinding human bodies ... bones, clothes and all that? If someone from these actors, except Liz Rene, was paid more than five dollars for their disgusting performances, than they overpaid them! Avoid this movie at all costs and see the original.
