The main reason people still care about “Carlton-Brown Of FO” is that it shows Peter Sellers in the role of second count. But watching this movie to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sellers played Amphiboulos, the vague reptile prime minister of the poor mud of the island nation Gailardiya, a former British colony, which now has many Russians. diggers in the midst of the cold war. Amphiboulos wants to play against the interests of both the UK and the USSR for easy profit, “everything is very friendly and all our cards are under the table”. Terry-Thomas is the main character, a lazy British diplomat, who seeks to show Gylardia that Britain has not forgotten them, everything looks the other way around. <br /> <br /> A positive review says: “The reason for this film is considered average because the comedy is understated." I would say that the reason why Carlton-Brown is considered below average is that the comedy is not there is. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening in which only the two strengths of the film are revealed, the sympathetically silly Terry-Thomas and the complete reckless account of John Addison, things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame misunderstandings. about Carlton Brown his boss and the unknown Gaillardia (which no one can find on the map) is milked to death. By the time we really reach the island (after a difficult series of air jokes), the expectations are quite low. <br /> <br /> They are still too high. The island, which seems to exist either in Latin America or in the Mediterranean, is so pitiful that its guard of honor loses consciousness at the airport, and the observation desk falls apart in the middle of the parade. The army, apparently, is still harnessed with horses, which allows for another unsuccessful auditory hype with a wild accent: "In war, the army uses many horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never take center stage, even when we are on the island of our character. Instead, Ian Bannen becomes King Loris, who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after the murder of his father. Bannen is boring and plays his part as directly as it is written. This usually makes it a likely target for Sellers to steal scenes, but being trapped behind a thick accent and a fat mustache, Sellers poses a threat only to those of us who remember him much better in two other films made this year. ”Mouse that roared "and" I'm fine, Jack. " <br /> <br /> It is strange that this film, like Jack, was the production film The Boulting Brothers, and Roy Boulting acted here as a co-director. Jeffrey Dell Usually in the movies about bowling an evil social satire is combined with the comedy “everything goes”, but there are only fey jabs in any direction. Amphiboulos is trying his best to disfigure his English (“This man looks like a bull on a Chinese ship, as you say”), while Carlton-Brown is usually offended by his boss much more than he seems to deserve. <br /> <br /> The weakest and lingering element of the film is Loris and Ilyina’s novel. Get one point for being admired by the wonderful Luciana Paluzzi, and one for the fact that they, apparently, cousins, are never considered. <br /> <br /> The film ends with an unsuccessful staged revolution, the unexpected decision of which will surprise no one. and the last act of Carlton-Brown, which, it would seem, literally nailed the lid on his coffin. Apparently, he lived to another day, but the film with the same name is strictly DOA.
