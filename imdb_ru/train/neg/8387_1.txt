It was the worst movie I've ever seen in cinemas. It was just a collection of recycled material. People are not funny to beat in the head. Kicking people is not funny. After the third time, the guy kicked in the balls, even the youngest spectator no longer laughed. Just quickly tired. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. She actually laughs loudly at the King of the Mountain, but this cinematic masterpiece bored her. I'm not surprised. The story sucks pretty. A juvenile thief stole a large diamond in what was most definitely the easiest robbery in Hollywood history. Then he hides with his family, pretending to be a child. I know it sounds exciting, but it's a whole story. Say these two lines again and again within 1.5 hours and you will get the picture. There were a lot of predictable jokes. I really felt cut off after seeing this. I did not expect much, and I was still disappointed. I would like Keenan to simply hire a few decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. It was even worse than the White Chicks, if possible. I saw school plays that were better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I donâ€™t like it when my fun is winding down
