I guess it proves that Joe Don Baker does everything for a dollar. The concept of the film was not very good to begin with. There are so many bad things in this movie that I don’t know where to start. The game is terrible. Cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The account is terrible. There is a reason why this film got on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote it, and I can't believe that 9 people really consider this “film” to be excellent. They must have liked two go-go dancers. Final justice would have been if they had locked this abomination into the repository of the film outside of Wichita and never allowed anyone to see it again! A rating of 1 out of 10 is much better than it deserves.
