The sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger, in which he finally managed to kill almost every young man in Springwood; he now wants to broaden his horizons, and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do so. <br /> <br /> Failure is like a horror movie, because it's not at all scary. It works better as a dark, creepy black comedy to tell you the truth. Freddy Kruger is now deprived of all his ability to cool this viewer. (Too many wise men, that's for sure.) The actors are not interesting (except for Robert Englund, as always, and obviously dormant Yafet Cotto), and there are just too many visual effects. The final is fine, but it doesnâ€™t give as many sparks as I think we can hope. <br /> <br /> By adding a new twist to the story of a dream killer friend, he gives Englund the opportunity to do more without makeup. Scenes than ever before. <br /> <br /> There are cameos that are worth paying attention to: a joint cameo from the then-couple Roseanna and Tom Arnold, devoid of entertainment value, a suitable look from old shock rocker Alice Cooper and funny cameo Johnny Depp, who also reminds pop icon, which he became. <br /> <br /> Breckin Meyer's film debut, which plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this reproduction of key scenes from earlier recordings during the closing credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
