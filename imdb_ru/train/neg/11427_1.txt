I don't know who Sue Kramer is, the director of this film, but I have a strong suspicion that A) she is a lesbian and B) she somehow disgraced everyone who participated in this project to prove that they are not homophobic. br /> <br /> I can imagine that everyone thinks: “My God, this is terrible. Not funny. A pedestrian. Totally lame. ” But, without looking up from fear, they will be labeled as gay or will not “understand” the gay lifestyle. (This is probably why Kramer did NOT force gays to play gay as well.) In any case, it’s not even worth reviewing. All the actors are called to play every scene perfectly flawless, so there is no sincerity or believability in everything they do. It is full of cliches, and in this film there is nothing less funny - much less funny. <br /> <br /> I hated him and am not afraid to say so. It is a pity that the reckless people who gave Kramer money to make this bomb were not so impartial in their judgment.
