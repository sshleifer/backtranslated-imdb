This film seems to be ripping off many films that have dealt with the same topic in the past. Let the future viewer be warned that Art Heist adds nothing to the genre. Directed by Brian Geres has no idea what to do with the film. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin continues to appear in films, and, frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent or directors and producers love his unusual dull look, complemented by this strange hairstyle that he does in most their films. The only good film in which he appeared is Squid and Kit, in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, is not much better; There is no chemistry between Miss Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The film can be seen at your own risk.
