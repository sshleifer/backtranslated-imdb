This film is something of a continuation of the White Zombie, as it was shot by the same person (Halperin) and contains zombies. Halperin, George A. Romero of his time, does not cope with this, though. <br /> <br /> We have a person who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, and search to destroy the source of his power, so zombies can be sent for free. In addition, love interest in an evil person. <br /> <br /> Where this film really stands out is in the images. Cambodian temples and dancers are very good, and zombies look very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we cannot see most of the zombies in action, and the love story seems to play a big role in a horror movie (although this later has a good reason for the plot). <br /> <br I would like to see the zombies of the 1930s attacking helpless city dwellers, but this film never came out. And not a single strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) waited to fight our heroes. And the use of eyes Lugosi? Good effect, but misleading, because it is never in the film ... why not recreate it with the eyes of a new actor? In general, a film that could be great with a small reworked script and could someday be a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same post-war time frame). Gosh, if they can fix “Hills Have Eyes,” then this film has hope.
