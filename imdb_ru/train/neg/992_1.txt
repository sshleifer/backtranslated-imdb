This film was disgusting. They should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is trying to make a name for himself before being held hostage for an hour and a half while watching the trash. What is rubbish? Abuse of people's time, misuse of energy and waste of any educational system that taught it to read and write. Talia, you're a sick, crazy loser. Your psychiatrist should prescribe stronger medicines for your problem. <br /> <br /> The actions and plot gave me no choice but to move forward through the middle of the garbage. I got on the stage that was out of place. If you want to learn how to shock people, watch Larry Clark's movie. I have lost all respect for the entire composition of this film “no more support from me”. How can actors or actresses sit on the set while such rude descriptions of human behavior appear in the psychic mind? I feel sorry for all the actors who took part in this scene. I think the devil now knows who the author of this film is; Congratulations, you won his attention.
