Don't get me wrong, the film is beautiful, the shots are awesome, the stuff is awesome. However, it was a big disappointment, and I was really very angry at what Disney did. <br /> <br /> Planet Earth BBC - all of the above and more. It was thin. He had a general sense of balance and showed a full circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. He was balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney Land Editing is none of this. They tried to make this film, which Americans will talk about. They did it DRAMATICALLY. They put on a musical score to scare us. They made predators evil. They made an EYE evil. They showed each meeting as negative. He tried to be tense and successful, but at the expense of a balance lesson. The film was an hour and a half negative image and only about 10 minutes positive. <br /> <br /> I’m in favor of not allowing a global warning, but it was excessive political and environmental debris. <br /> <br /> This is another thing, I went to watch it on the big screen, but was disappointed with the image quality. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like that and get the big picture, go outside, buy, rent or borrow the BBC series “Planet Earth”. These are the best lessons, the best sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) the best picture quality.
