Since there was nothing wrong with acting, etc. There was no writing of this episode for the phantom of this series. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the Martian human hunter. You should know that in the middle of the 6th series, no matter what happens, it’s not true what’s happening, and actually brings nothing to the history of the series, except to meet the Martian hunter again and spend 30 minutes to to do this. certainly another bad record in Smallville's soap opera. I really like the show, but mostly because of the cast and three or so good episodes every year, but those who have ever acted in the cast that works or once worked on soap should be canned. This was by far one of the worst. For the first 4 minutes, you know what is happening is fictitious, and everything that happens is a dream based on Clark's emotions, obviously caused by the character of the phantom zone, and when he wakes up, he will win and blah blah blah, so the authors do not should really create a villain who will develop the storyline this week. He may also add another villain to die in the last episode in which the martian was hunting, and made him fly away again or return and tell Clark that he forgot his sunglasses to take a closer look at this episode and call it day.
