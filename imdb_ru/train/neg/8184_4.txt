It is almost like two films - one is literate and fascinating, the other is stupid and cliché. It's really a shame that all the problems were not solved with the writing, but considering how quickly most B-films were written and produced, this is not so unusual. However, this is a real shame, because it could be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Good first. The film is original and includes crackers of World War II code. This is pretty exciting, and I enjoyed watching the moderator (Lee Bowman) go through his steps as the main code breaker. In fact, the first two thirds of the film were very good. But now, fortunately, the film just went on for too long and lost speed in about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as a “strange friend” should be considered one of the most poorly written and distracting roles in the history of cinema !! For every smart move Bowman made, the idiot Rogers then intervened to spoil everything, as a kind of misinformed “comedy relief.” If her role had been reasonably written, the whole film would have improved significantly! Instead, watching her, it is difficult to understand how we actually won the Second World War !!
