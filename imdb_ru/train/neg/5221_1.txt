Hello, I am from Denmark, and once I had a movie night with my friends. One brought with him this film “Russian Terminator”, and it was extremely terrible. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to rewind ahead, stopping only on some ridiculous "highlights" or, if you can say so, "weak" in the film. In fact, I was very surprised to learn that this film was shot here in my homeland, in Denmark ... this is probably the biggest mistake this country has ever made.
