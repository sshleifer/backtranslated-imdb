A question to all of you girls: if a man whom you have never met before, accidentally called you on purpose and continued to do it in the most immodest moments, would you be intrigued by them or scared, call the police? ? Yes, this is what I thought, so I could not swallow the idea that Marty Gerrard accepted the constant attention of Connor Hill. <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> This is a really stupid story. Connor Hill's wife is murdered, and the plot revolves around asking if Connor Marty calls to have an alibi? But there is a huge gap in logic, could Connor hire a hitman? something the charge seems to have ignored. And at the scene of the murder there was no forensic examination? So why does the whole process lie on how Connor called Marty at the time of the murder? Stupid . Stupid . Stupid . And it is as predictable as brainless. <br /> <br /> My unwavering memory of this film is that for someone who made the Winter Olympics, Marty Gerrard is truly a crappy skier
