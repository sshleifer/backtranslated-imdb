This film is another Christian propaganda film from the Omega Code series. Not that this is necessarily bad, but because most propaganda films donate sincerity and realism for the message they want to convey. If you enjoy life on the streets of foam and how the gospel can change lives, you might like this movie. I say save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. When will christian filmmakers find out that sometimes people say bad words? It was unpleasant to see the depicted criminals who are forbidden to swear (yes? Do the criminals say bad words?) And flat characters with whom I really could not communicate. In addition, it would be great if the film showed some T & A. Now I would like to pay to watch. Who was the dummy who compared this primitive story of a film with “Boondock Saints” and “Stings”?
