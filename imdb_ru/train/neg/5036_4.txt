SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Alais Shirley, Patrick McNee, Dana Kimmell Fifteen-year-old bad girl Melissa is new in a deserted city, and soon people around her are starting to die. The detective must collect evidence with the help of his daughter Nancy Drew, played on Friday by the 13th graduate Dana Kimmell. Local Native Americans are prime suspects, as they seem to upset prejudiced citizens. All these events led to the discovery of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party. <br /> <br /> This below-average slasher is not too memorable. It has a mood for television, without a lot of counting other than the banal theme of the title character's song, which plays a couple of times everywhere. Lines like "the killer will turn us into a cabbage salad." Fits into the standard scripts of the eighties. Marcy calls Melissa a bad name, then somehow they immediately make friends. Apparently, Marcy understands how difficult it is to fit into her, because Melissa knows how to apply makeup. This film would be difficult to make today, the main character was fifteen, and the director would put in many free close-ups. The social commentary to the Indians was not sufficiently developed to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the rather high appreciation of this film. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the opportunity to capitalize on the traditionally revered birthday party to create an intense massacre, but I feel I could not do it. But, on the other hand, the release of obscure DVD films gives hope that others will follow.
