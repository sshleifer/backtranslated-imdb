I felt the film was dry ... very disappointing without a plot ... kept waiting for something to happen and nothing dried out like a bone ... a waste of money ... One of Robins Williams' worst films .. if you believe me, wait a few months when it is released on DVD, because it seems to be a template for movies that do not succeed in cinemas, and hire before the end of the year ... Tell me why I spent my money on it! Plus, because he was such a new film, only 8 people watched it ... It was on Friday night at 9:50. I also felt that in order for us not to sleep, we needed more excitement or something else. When their characters spoke in the film, the voices were very low and you could not hear what they were saying ..
