Three authors made a valiant attempt to adapt the novel by Jane Stanton Hitchcock for the tube, but this television film was ultimately filled with too much melodrama and simply did not know when to leave. Fighting artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds herself busy with the rich, mysterious Ellen Burstyn, who wants a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning about the last meeting held there - the party of his daughter Ellen - Tilly chooses his artistic theme, never dreaming that her daughter had mysteriously died before this function began, and that she and the deceased had striking similarities with each other. ! Two excellent actresses provide their services to incredible yarn, which is not subjected to rigorous analysis, one that does not correspond to any of the women in emotional intensity. Burstynâ€™s role fluctuates in the camp, while Tilly is stuck performing exercises with dreamy eyes. Only one sequence at the end of the film (the morning after the fresco is finished) is charged with honest feeling, anger and betrayal. The rest is payfl.
