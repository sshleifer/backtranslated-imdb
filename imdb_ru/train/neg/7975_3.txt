When I sat in front of the TV and watched this movie, I thought, “Oh, what could Alfred Hitchcock or even Brian DePalma do with this!” Most likely you too. It starts to intrigue. A British park ranger living in Los Angeles (Colleen Firth) marries a beautiful, modest brunette (Lisa Zane), whom he met at the park recently. Then one day she disappears. The police cannot find any documents that have ever existed, and Firth conducts his own search. So far, so good. Just as he is about to give up, he turns to his best friend (Billy Zane), and they stumble upon her former life in the dirty underground of Los Angeles, where drugs, nightclubs and film directors live, and then her story of mental instability. At this point, Fert's life is in danger, and the film is falling apart. None of the characters from Liza Zane’s past are remotely interesting. The film moves slowly, and the action is very small. There is a subplot about missing money for drugs, but this is just distribution. No chases, no sequences and no obscurity. Just boring beatings and a lot of communication of boring characters. It is worth noting one thing: Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear together in the same scene. By the end of the film you are torn between the question of what might have been and the attempt not to fall asleep.
