Minion about ... well, minion. The slave of Satan, whose goal is to get the key that will open the door where his master is located. He is some kind of demon who possesses human beings, and when the body dies, it will have another. Anyone who is possessed will fall into a berserk rage. Dolph Lundgren plays Lucas, a member of the Templars' secret order, who is tasked with keeping the key away from the minion. The film begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where a pair of Knights Templar runs from the minion. Then fast forward to 1999, where the key is somewhere underground in New York. The archaeologist is instructed to examine / dig out the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion for the key, and the film becomes a long pursuit scene between the minion and Lucas and the archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The film, only this, the low-budget B-movie, The film lacks energy, and it just goes ahead. You will follow the chase, but you will never feel involved in a story that deliberately takes ideas from previous films (especially Terminator films). Scenes of fighting with a minion are unpleasant because you will never feel how good or bad a warrior is this demon. He "skillfully" becomes a one-man army, battling with a squad of Templars, but sucks when it comes to one on one. And it must be around for a long time. All this suggests that any sense of logic is simply thrown away for convenience. The very idea of ​​the secret order of the Templars, the door to hell and the key is not very well explained. We just have to admit that they simply exist. It seems that the film was shot with the feeling that there is not much potential in history, but enough to earn a few dollars. Dolph Lundgren probably looks like he would like to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Sentence: 2 out of 5 stars.
