KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963; as I recall, having received a BOMB rating) was my acquaintance with the work of the cult director of Honda; is this not necessarily better ?? I just learned to be more tolerant of such a low paid rate! <br /> <br /> Here we actually get two congas for the price of one: an ugly and defiantly looking giant monkey and a kind of robot that looks worse! Monkey lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where he fights with a couple of other monsters and befriends a trio of people. Naturally, this refers to the blonde (and soft) heroine; in fact, the more fatal is the colossal woman in collusion with the villainous mad genius of the movie ?? called Doctor Who and wears an anemic look and cloak, usually associated with a vampire !! <br /> <br /> He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes him to retrieve Element X, which is in the icy wastelands of the North Pole; apparently, the giant monkey is more immune to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure its full cooperation, who even captures its three “companions”)! Then the female agent changes the heart, helps the heroes (one of whom, as a rule, an ordinary American) and is killed by someone. Kong eventually runs away and gets to Tokyo, where he has a final encounter with a robot. The doctor is saved from the ensuing lawlessness in his sabe. which, at the request of the girl Kong's dream, was destroyed by a giant monkey.
