Cassidy (Kachia Brady) puts a gun in his mouth and releases the head of the guy Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the vocalist of the rock group "Demons and Death", who could not get rid of her boyfriend's sad feelings of neglect (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this problem, besides getting a bullet in your head), however she comes back, possessing the soul of Dora (Jill Small), his friend, who must replace it with vocals, so that the group could finish the album, stopped by Cassidy's untimely death. But Cassidy made a deal with the dark, and the souls must be collected ... she is absorbed in this anger mainly on Nile, but all the band members or anyone in the music studio perishes when they become victims for whom they consider Dora more distraught .. not cassidy returning for payback. <br /> <br /> A lousy microbudget horror movie looks cheap, has a cheap cast that has to make plans in a different direction, and boasts cheap killing scenes that aren't effective one bit.
