What begins with a rather cunning farce about some dubious security monitoring company almost instantly turns into an uninteresting and completely pointless riddle of murder. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying hard to make this train wreck visible, but some things are simply impossible for humans. <br /> <br /> What, for example, makes Gale suddenly turn from a cute maternal figure to a drunk recalcitrant at Tommy's parents house? Why does Heinrich, although admittedly an idiot, want to destroy a business to which he devotes his life by robbing and, possibly, killing his clients? Why does the seemingly sane Tommy believe that Heinrich could have been a murderer (almost entirely based on sleep), and even if it were true, why would he not go to the police? And why didn't Gale turn on the alarm when she returned home, especially after Howie scolded her? Of course, all these events are necessary for the development of the plot (and I use the term very, very loosely). And it can be forgiven if it leads even to the slightest comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of his date-rape to the erroneous definition of Coroner Gale and ending with a “joke” that Gale and Howie are still dead, are more tasteless and pitiful than anything else. <br /> <br /> I checked the box indicating that my comments contain “spoilers”, but I couldn’t do anything else or anyone else to spoil this thing that already stinks of heaven.
