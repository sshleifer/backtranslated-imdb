As a historical idiot who is particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed with the film. Of course, the costumes and the production were quite authentic, but the Hollywood image of this “British Little Big Horn” was really boring. <br /> <br /> The number of filming devoted to marching or attacking troops should be unprecedented. in the history of cinema. Once I heard how triumphant background music began, I knew that I had to prepare myself for another painstaking scene of meaningless filler. It is obvious that the producers have invested heavily in the "staging" and were determined to get the value of their money. <br /> <br /> Despite the outstanding cast, their dialogue, again, was boring and their characters never developed. Whenever Peter O'Toole or Bert Lancaster finished off the stage, I was disappointed. Their storylines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe that they were the same two great actors who portrayed Lawrence of Arabia and Avian of Alcatraz, respectively. <br /> <br /> There are worse epics, but this one is not much better.
