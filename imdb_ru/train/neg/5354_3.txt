The lack of a good plot, the lack of decent acting skills, the lack of good cinematography, the lack of a decent look of SPECIAL EFFECTS ... do I need to continue? Review MAY contain SPOILERS. Actors seem to read their lines, and not very well at that. Most of the "actors" behaved as if they were playing in the SECOND GRAD. It seems that this story was written by one of the above-mentioned second-graders ... it's not so confusing ... it's just JUST and SIP that a person thinks that something is missing, so he thinks it is confusing. No, it is not, it is just as easy as you think. I UNDERSTAND THE “FILM”, this is how I KNOW that this is HUGE! In most films, people were just sitting, talking (reading their lines), trying to look ominous. The narrator was annoying. The "special effects" were ridiculous. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Barrymore ... just not in this film ... you can say that they were not paid or paid a lot, because neither their hearts nor their talents were . I love Tony Todd ... however, he was only adequate in this film. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the ONLY reason I gave him 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was there only TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would advise you to transfer the DVD to the two-minute segment of Tony Todd. If I went to the theater and paid more than the DOLLAR to watch this “movie”, I would have been P.O. and would require my money back. Hope the people who did it will be better next time.
