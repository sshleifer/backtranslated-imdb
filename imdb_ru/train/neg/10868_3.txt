With the plot and the script, which seems to have been written by a high school student, “The Art of Seduction” is not able to convey the romantic, complex experience that he is trying to imagine. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female presenters are “swaying loners (or in the case of female presenters, busy),” but “The Art of Seduction” doesn’t even try. Shy away from a frank study of the personalities of these two characters, The Art of Seduction avoids something substantial based on a thin, scanty stereotype. <br /> <br /> “The art of seduction” insults, insults its heroes, insults men and women and insults the expectations of the audience. It takes the terrible beautiful people we all know, and plays out their painful interactions, expecting us to idolize them. Ji-Wan is an immature spoiled bitch. It is expected that the viewer will like and forgive her shortcomings, because she is beautiful. Min Jun, well, he's exactly the same. Neither are good people. The humor in this film revolves around Ji-Wan and Min-Jiang’s outlandish attempts to beat each other in the noble art of lying and manipulation. No character development happens, and we will never know why Ji-Wan and Ming-jung are like that. We just have to accept them as they are and not ask questions - they are cute! And that's all that matters. Abundant references to the celebrities of the main actors in azn filmmakers' reviews can draw you to the topic “The Art of Seduction”. <br /> <br /> If you are still in high school, you like Grease, or you are a victim of yellow fever, you may like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the tag "Romance" this is not a very good date movie.
