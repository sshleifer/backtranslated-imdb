Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, she is related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, returned to her old tricks. She is one of the consultants at Camp Rolling Hills. While the girls in the camp are good and stay away from sex, drugs and curses are fine. But taking a few steps behind the line, Angela kills them - all the time stupid jokes. <br /> <br /> The original “Lunatic Camp” was an evil and unpleasant film with splashes, but there were good moments in it. It is also vicious and disgusting, but it has nothing good in it. The plot was made to death, and this adds nothing to the formula. There are a lot of bloody murders here (people are burned alive, their heads are cut off, their throats are cut), but all the blood is so obvious that it actually became funny. It also has the fewest campers I've ever seen, and virtually everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As was to be expected, this is gratuitous female nudity (Valerie Hartman is provided by the extremely incompetent) and the obligatory command “good girl / good boy” (Renn Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the exception of Springsteen and Higgins, the actors are lousy, even by the standards of a filmmaker. This film also has a brutal edge, in which one character drowned in an annex! Bored and sick of a stupid conspiracy, senseless nudity and bad blood. Skip this.
