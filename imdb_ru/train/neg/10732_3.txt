The Russian film “4” tells about the lives of three (and not four) strangers who met at a local bar one evening. One of them is a musician, one is a seller of frozen meat, and the other is a call girl. <br /> <br /> “4”, as I understand it, is intended to demonstrate the gloom and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters invent stories to make their lives seem more interesting than they really are), but the film is so incoherent and boring, that I seriously doubt that so many people will be able to sit through. It seems that the film suggests that the obscure Russian government solves some obscure things behind the scenes: secret cloning equipment works, sells frozen meat of a decade ago, etc. - but the film is so shapeless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone can understand what someone is actually doing. <br /> <br /> Despite a decent game and several sharp scenes, “4” is a two-hour endurance competition that should be avoided at all costs.
