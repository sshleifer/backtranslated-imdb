Can anyone make good CGI movies other than Pixar? I mean, really, the animation looked outdated by 2006 standards and even 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent their entire budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their argument, the story really sucks. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Hugh Jackman is a rat, a rat that is flushed down the toilet. Yes, I know it seems stereotypical. But then the sewer pipes imitated the ways of London - to some extent. Add the promise of gems (????) and evil (??) frogs, and you will get a pathetic attempt to have fun. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that something was entertaining me. Maybe a clue in the movie? Or maybe happy happy rat relationship. But he did nothing. He had talent, but he exploded. D-
