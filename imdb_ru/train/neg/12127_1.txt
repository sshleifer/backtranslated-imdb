Sorry Fulci fans, but I couldn't get through this. The soundtrack was about as annoying as they were, the acting was childish, the story was made and made, and the direction did not exist. <br /> <br /> The massacre, frankly, looked like a children's film project. But I have seen some of them, and they actually look better than this! It seems that they were so underfunded that they could not afford ... NOTHING! Not a DoP, not a director, nobody who even remotely had a clue what acting was. It was a very bad cinematic experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> This was the worst suck-fest I've ever seen, next to Terror Toons, which is second only to Killer Klowns from space. I have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> He estimates 0.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
