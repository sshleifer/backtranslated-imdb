At first, I was pleased to learn about a new film about supermen, although I think it will be great, but it is not. <br /> <br /> A poor copy of Richard Donnerâ€™s work, Lex is again a villain who does nothing else, even plays Kevin Spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same as in the first film about Donner, but very strong. <br /> <br /> The script is predictable and simple (all things that Luthor finds in a museum or in an elderly woman). <br /> <br /> The story is not the same, it should be the script of Kevin Smith, and maybe better. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the sequel without Brian Singer and the new talented director will make something new, not a copy. <br /> <br /> You will read everything later.
