Yes, it was pure unbelievable indulgent chatter. We know that the French often have a distorted view of the United States, this puritanism and views on sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have enough opportunity to observe this attitude. And while some of these preconceived ideas may be true, NOT ONE ELEMENT of the city of the Midwest depicted in this film sounds true. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years ago that his penis is too big? Where in the world can you find it? In a jukebox in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A city with a population of about 16 people less than two hours from Chicago, but without a major gas station, without TVs in the house, without McDonalds, without children ... A population that knows each otherâ€™s intimate details, but steadily comes together as one big a family that hates each other. Adult males plant pillows in a local cafe, have farms, but do not harvest, kill a guy they do not like, in front of everyone, and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotions? A free French girl who plunges a 17-year-old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, a too big carnal boy who moves from going off on corn fields with a sigh of the Illinois breeze to help deflorate the same 17-year-old rural boy? HELP! I am so puzzled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that I do not clearly express how ridiculous it is. See this for an A-to-Z tutorial on what to avoid. Damn it, I didn't ruin it for you!
