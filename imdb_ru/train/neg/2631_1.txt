A homeless person gives a secret serviceman a hint about a secret service officer in the presidential details who plans to kill the president. Nonsense. How did the bum find out? Then the script moves to the most detailed review of the work of the secret service, but who cares. Most of this just slows down the movie. All the persecution that follows is a version of this movie that tiresome car chases of many films. Then, after a lot of incredible athleticism, in which our hero is ahead of all his friends and replays them, we arrange a shootout at the Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly marked with maple leaves, but how did they get into it? Finally everything is decided. But it still does not make sense.
