This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, it is EXTREMELY boring, with lots of boring dialogues, VERY annoying characters and a ridiculously looking creature. The only reason I watched this piece of garbage was because it was on the 8 disks I received. The plot is ridiculous and completely stupid, like the ending. No blood except a few bloody marks on the creature and a few bloody gunshot wounds. The game is terrible !! Richard Cardell is terrible as a sheriff and was rather ludicrous, plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts - comic relief and not at all funny! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and also was not funny! Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more than that. Richard Harrison is annoying and has had no chemistry with Casey Cobb than ever. Casey Cobb had such a chemistry and had no chemistry with Richard. In general, avoid this garbage at all costs! BOMB of 5
