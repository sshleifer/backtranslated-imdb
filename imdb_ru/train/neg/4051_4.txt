Lindsay Anderson was largely a European director, while David Lin, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker make exciting films, including Andersonâ€™s film, more about social commentary and subtext, so much so that the message often ends throughout the movie, the main function which should be the entertainment of the audience <br /> <br /> What do you think about IF, comes down to what you think about British directors. I strongly believe that the movie should be a universal medium (in my opinion, the best British films are those who are trying to imitate Hollywood), if you want to send a message, try a pony express, and I think that the film is dated Fussy and complicated in the 1960s. 1968 was the summer of love and the year of the student uprising in France. You can only imagine that every French left worships this film, especially the climax. French filmmakers of the new wave will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but the international community will not like it, and many will not like it
