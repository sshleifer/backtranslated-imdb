Don't waste your time on this movie. It might have been nice, but the final was one of the worst ones I’ve ever seen. I seriously have to wonder how people involved in the making of this film could look at this final scene and think, “Yes! Now there is an end! ”And patted his back about it. It seemed to me that they just ran out of ideas! They created the final scenes to make a sharp turn, but instead simply let the whole set fall on the face. When the last shot became faded, and I heard the credit music start, I was shocked - I could not believe what I saw, and that someone could even call it an ending. The best thing anyone can do with this film is to rewrite the end and give it some content. Seriously, I would really like someone to come up with it in the room, look them in the face and say - WTF ?? !!!!
