it's not bad, but it's not good. it's just fun. <br /> <br /> Like the comedy it has to be, it's terrible. not a lot of laughter, because every joke in the film was made a million times earlier. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because all the actors in the film are usually great, but none of them actually do anything. and the end sucks.
