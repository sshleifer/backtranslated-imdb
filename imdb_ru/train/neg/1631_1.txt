Please, please me if you want for a minute while I read you the back of the box ALLEY CAT VHS. It says: <br /> <br /> In this part of the city, every street is a dead end, at every corner is to buy something, at every alley is another way to die - to survive you have to be the best - just like Ellie Kat . Ellie Kat - this lady owns at night. On the streets, where even predators become victims, she knows how to survive. Cross it and you're out of luck. Ellie the Cat - this animal is awakened. <br /> <br /> Isn’t this one of the most miserable thoughts you’ve ever heard in your life? The one who wrote this should be insane if he thought such a horrible description might tempt us to watch the video. However, unfortunately, no matter how impersonal a person is responsible for this tragic use of English, he coped with his work too well ... the film in a small plastic case is as bad as it seems, and then some. <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays the main role, and the script basically tells her during each particular scene: a) cheat like a goldfish b) kick a man’s ass or c) show your feminine "attributes". No complaints about the latter, but from the point of view of the other two ... let's say, she is not really an actress and even less convincing as an expert in martial arts. But even Meryl Streep with the body of Cynthia Rothrock (who thought terribly) could not save this film. The disclosure of the plot is boring to the limit, as we get one ineptly directed sequence of battles after a sufficient one, pausing only for hysterical frauds in the courtroom and the occasional vomiting love scene with the interesting name Robert Torti. Filming also follows a similar shameful path, when there are too many unnecessary close-ups and continuity mistakes. <br /> <br /> That part, which I think really sums up this scum of the film, is where our heroine is sexually abused and finds testimony before a corrupt judge, while her rich child is the rapist looking at her out of the box. Not only did he go unpunished, despite irrefutable evidence against him, but she herself was imprisoned for daring to appeal the verdict before his Honor. She has a group shower, a lesbian, a couple of cat fightings and a nice sweaty volleyball game before being released on bail to continue the fight. This ten-minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the film, and the script stops to cover it. I can only imagine that the producers wanted to add a little more T & A to the mix and came up with this unnecessary plot as a means to achieve this goal. <br /> <br /> What questions ask for? Is this a movie about exploitation or a serious drama? Also, my answer to this ... is not too sloppy or indecent to appeal to fans of movies in the style of Troma, and this, of course, does not make an assessment of the study of the struggle of one woman with the system ... just because it is so terribly done . So who on earth wants to see this? Probably crazy ... or IMDb reviewers who stay up to 3 o'clock in the afternoon and watch any old rubbish on the box trying to sleep. Unfortunately, in this case, I failed, and the horrors will remain with me for quite some time. Do not make the same mistake as me. There is hot milk, or something .. 1/10
