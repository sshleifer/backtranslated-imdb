Imagine a woman in a forty-five minute house in which absolutely nothing happens. Then it goes on twice. The letter is flat and lifeless, the jokes are unfunny, and bad behavior does not allow you to take care of any characters, even when they are fighting with wolf packs and beating fraternity goons. Anyone who rated this movie higher than two is not completely sane.
