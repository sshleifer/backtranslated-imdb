Sometimes you need to watch a bad movie to rate a good one. Well, anyway, this is my opinion. This film will always be in the category of bad movies, simply because everyone except the Shu Qi performances was terrible. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel talks about Kat (Shu Qi), a professional thief who turned right after leaving his lover Chi Lam (Julian Cheung) two years ago. But her past is returning to harass her, since Chi Lam has been kidnapped for ransoming security software owned by the company that Cat works for. To save him, she turns to her old friends from orphanages, six other furious women, to save the day ... <br /> <br /> I may have said the synopsis cheerfully, but this is a stupid story. In fact, the whole script and direction had no quality whatsoever. Most of the dialogue was meaningless and combined with the plot, as thin as rice paper in water. If I could sum up, take a bad film about Jackie Chan, make a comedy, make a choreography, drop the budget, and you have the Battle Angels: formal work without imagination. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, I must pay tribute, when necessary, and Shu Qi was probably the only person who remained unscathed after the terrible act, since it was her work that shone through. Well, you can't say that she was excellent — after all, she had nothing to work with — but she managed to get some character out of her role. Other than that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made any other impression - although these were mostly glimpses and very short. <br /> <br /> In other places, the film just fell apart. Scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and incredible, special effects were obviously made cheaply, without trying to remove the lines between people and the blue screen mask, poor editing, including numerous breaks in the battle scenes, camera angles that were elementary and unflattering and direction, which I saw better from a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I think this film was a business of cooks. Most likely, the budget was carried away by excessive enthusiasm, so that there would be seven children on one silver screen. It did not leave much more. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the way this movie was made was like a cheap porn movie without porn. Charlie's Angels, it is not. In fact, while the sisters can do it for themselves, none of this was so obvious. <br /> <br /> Definitely forget.
