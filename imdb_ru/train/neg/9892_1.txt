Why does any film about Cleopatra, the last pharaoh, reveal the worst in making films? Whatever the attractiveness of this woman to the greatest Roman of all, Julius Caesar and his successor, Mark Anthony, there was never anything on the screen except for antics due to sexy high school students. Despite the luxurious scenery and costumes, this film is just as bad as any Italian extravaganza of the sandals and togas of the 50s. Admittedly, this kind of spectacle belongs to the big screen, so “Gladiator” did it all, but “Gladiator” did not have all the sex in a romantic romance. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela has so little acting talent like Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has the talent to save. It is a pity that some of them are not washed away from others.
