Isabel Allende's magical lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family was destroyed. The clumsy rumble of the film, which resulted in — mainly because of the gorgeous cast of Anglo-actors, completely unable to withstand Allende’s evasive Latin sluggishness, and the debilitating Scandinavian director’s hand — was so uncomfortable in my own skin that I returned a second time, to make sure that I did not miss something vital that could change my mind. To my disappointment, I missed nothing. None of the Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could escape the trap set for them by director Bill Augustus. They all looked completely awkward and resigned, as if, having put as little effort as possible, they expected that they would disappear imperceptibly in beautiful periods. (Yes, the film was an art shot throughout its life cycle.) Curiously, the production designer was allowed to place KFC products in a prominent place in the scene around 1970, years before KFC appeared. Then it was known by its original name: Kentucky fried chicken. Even apologizing for what the Fried Chicken of Kentucky actually does during the military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains were not in South America until the early 1980s. "House of the Spirits" was to be the event of the cinema of 1993. Because he was so club and slavishly loyal to his vague idea of ​​what a novel was, Miramax had to present it as a feature film. As a result, it was neither an event nor an art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have been charged with rape.
