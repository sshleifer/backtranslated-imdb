More widely disclosed, hysterical hyper-vigor of the 50s, which give new meaning to antisocial, pathological behavior. Danza and Grayson will leave you asking for mercy. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all the people involved in the creation of this film are already dead (or in nursing homes). I kind of sued them for torture. When this film began to demonstrate its shamelessly aggressive operatic attack on my poor, defenseless eardrums, I felt an instant, intense pain that engulfed my whole being. This damn muscular vibrato can break Soviet tanks into small pieces, not to mention the glass. <br /> <br /> “Why didn’t you switch the channel if you don’t like it?”, ask you angrily. Honest, fair ... The answer is: I wanted to, but the pain was so sudden and painful that I fell to the floor, writhing in agony. With the last ounces of energy, I tried to get to the console, but I could not. <br /> <br /> Niven discovered a stupid little fisherman with a dubious talent of singing in an annoying operatic voice, who then proceeded to "pygmalize" him. Lanza is in love with an asymmetrical Grayson, but she, as expected, treats him with contempt until they finally pick up. This may seem like a rather thin plot, but this noisy film is so full of singing and music that there is almost no dialogue. This film is merciless. Forget the torture of hippies and prisoners of war with Slayer "Reign In Blood" (as in the episode with South Park). No matter how little conversation takes place among stupid adults who flooded this strange musical world of the 50s, it’s all infantile - as if they were all 6-year-olds, posing as adults. I can only envy people who find such films funny. It must be great to be simple to give me pleasure: what a miracle the world would have opened for me if I could enjoy some silly old gag in the form of a fun, gut-breaking comedy. <br /> <br /> But let's consider this phenomenon, a musical of the 50s. My guess is that the musicals of the 50s offered more dreamy idealists among us to look into Utopia or Heaven (depending on whether you go to church or to Lenin’s coffin) or at least a very stupid version of these fantasies. . inspired places. TTONO is more like the idea of ​​hell, but it's just me. It seems I don’t “get” musicals. People say there is a story - but suddenly everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes, after which they calm down abruptly, and then pretend that nothing unusual has happened! When you think about it, musicals are unfamiliar with any science fiction film. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, TTONO (my favorite type of pizza, by the way) is not just the musical of the 50s, but the one with the squeal of opera. Opera is proof that there is such a thing as voice overtraining - to the extent that it becomes a weapon that can pierce the ears, rather than a means to bring the listener pleasure. The most striking example of this parody is when Lanza and Grayson combine their Dark Side vocal abilities for a truly unbearable duet. I tried to turn down the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. As a result, I lowered it to 1, which is usually so low that only specially trained dogs and some types of marsupials can hear it, and yet I STILL heard these two roar like donkeys! <br /> <br /> Take a scene in a small boat on a river. Danza starts with one of his deafening brain-killing melodies, and then ... nothing. No animals were visible anywhere. Even crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, are almost gone. If you look closely, you can even see how trees change color from green to yellow in minutes. No, it was not a mistake of continuity, it was just plain old torture of the flora. And these trees were just frosted pictures! Imagine how real trees would react. <br /> <br /> The reason why glass breaks when high C is burped out due to the overweight of an opera screamer's abdomen is not related to any laws of physics concerning waves and frequency, but because glass is only a human being. - therefore, he can only experience such pain before committing suicide due to a spontaneous explosion. I can spend hours listening to the loudest, least friendly death metal band, but give me a soprano for a minute and I will have a severe headache.
