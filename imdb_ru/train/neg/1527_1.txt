If you really want to spend two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) View TV listings. 2) Find the movie "People in white." 3) When “People in White” appears, sit down and look. <br /> <br /> And that's all. After a two-hour unsuccessful pun, horrible (and not very funny) references to films and experiences of something, perhaps with the lowest production values ​​in the entire history, you will waste two hours of your life and will know exactly why. <br /> Why did I do it? I was stupid enough to think that this movie really could be a good one. This is not true. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, if you are old enough to remember the Power Rangers, you may notice several familiar faces during the movie. Presumably, in order to save on production costs, Saban (who also makes Power Rangers) decided to sprinkle the old monster costumes with his favorite tasteless toy franchise liberally throughout the film. I noticed quite a few old monsters from the episodes that I saw when I was a kid, so I think that at least you can say that it has some meaning for nostalgia. <br /> <br /> But, if you want to see the real power of the Rangers, monsters, go and see the Power Rangers itself. This is much better than this piece of garbage. (And that says something!)
