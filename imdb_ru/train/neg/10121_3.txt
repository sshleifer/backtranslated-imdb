Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance for the inheritance. They use the money, go on a trip. Their life becomes more exciting when they start a relationship with the exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and the lonely Percy Marmont (for Miss Barry). But they remain as boring as before. Most likely, the bored director Alfred Hitchcock is trying to revive the titled (as quoted in the film from Shakespeare's Storm) “Wealth and Strangeness” by ordering some trick with the camera. The first event is reverence for the "Crowd" of King Widor. A low point could be a couple dining on a cat cooked in China. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Weird (10.12.31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
