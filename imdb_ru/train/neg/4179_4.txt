# 1 Vampires vs. Humans <br /> <br /> # 2 A squad of servicemen who refused to participate in hostilities as the discoverers of dangerous unknown invasions of vampires. <br /> <br /> # 3 Sexy vampire woman on the "good guys" side. <br /> <br /> # 4 Lots of blood and action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4) main story devices that can help you decide whether you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, then the next plot device may not scare you away ... <br /> <br /> # 5 In space. <br /> <br /> This last almost got me, too, but I'm glad that I watched. In a heap of terrible horror associated with live video, this is a sci-fi channel, Halloween Marathon ... this film is a breath of fresh air. He will oppose any of the other proposals of the Sci-Fi channel, and even against another vampire film, in which Natassia starred (who continues to give money to Uwe Boll?).
