A group of children staged a theater for a nightmare of horror films. However, as night falls, someone among them kills them one by one. Who is this ... and why? I saw it in the theater back in 1991. I was looking forward to it - but boy! It did not work at all. A good premise, they have a very attractive young cast and some professionals, such as Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but that doesn't work. The story ceases to make sense halfway (this may be because of the huge editing before the film was released), the murders are relatively bloodless (as it got R rating above my understanding) and the killer’s exposure at the end was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> This is really very bad - this film had potential. With a better script, this could be a great horror movie. As long as he stands, he’s mostly forgotten, and the cast itself seems embarrassed (I heard that Stone will not talk about it). I give him 3, and this is for actors only.
