Lynch Man has really cool stuff! He knows how to bother us, and then reward us, forcing us to think differently. This, however, is completely different. Dumblend's award - 1% of absurd comedy, earned, enduring 99% of stupidity. Maybe I once laughed, but somewhere in episode 4 I just started looking forward. Missed nothing. I felt relieved when it was over, and this is part of this series. This is an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, complemented by annoying animations, voices and sound. But the recognition of this and its other absurd qualities still fails to justify Dumland.
