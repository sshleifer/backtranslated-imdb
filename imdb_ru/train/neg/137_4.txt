It is clear why the creators of the movie "The Terrible Movie" so easily fake these films "Teenager slasher." They are so incredibly patterned. And if Valentine was released about a year earlier, I’m sure that they would also fake this film - so if they found some real original material to distinguish it from Screams, I know what you did last summer, and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentina does not offer anything new in this genre, except for a better ending than usual, which, of course, leaves a lot of room for the inevitable continuation. As always, the psychotic killer in the mask pursues a group of beautiful young women, killing the friends of the main character, one after the other, usually in excellent style. A lot of T & A is demonstrated, there is no character development, bad play, and overly complicated bloodshed. <br /> <br /> In such films, I can’t tolerate the fact that they pretend to be “who did this? ". The fact is that this is not the case, because the motive is revealed only after the killer removed the mask and tells the main character, whose friends were killed. Usually something that somehow never cleared up during the film (for example, the fishing partner of the main character’s uncle’s mother kicked the dog of his friend’s father). All those who survived throughout the film are “suspects”, but they are more like “red herrings” than suspects. As we all know at this moment, the protagonist controls the implausible escape and kills the reckless psycho-killer after the motive is discovered. <br /> <br /> Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. ***************SPOILER!!!!!! (mini-spoiler anyway) *************** Valentin's motive was not revealed, but left you thinking more, considering that the film was not completely completed in the typical way of a teenager. The problem is only partially solved, and the goal of the main killer may or may not be achieved, having survived the bloodshed and killing almost all. Would the killer want more, or were the demons really defeated? <br /> <br /> Valentin still did not make a good film, but simply saved him from the bad, as usual, which is still not considered. for much. For those who are thinking of making another film in this spirit, please do not. Originality is so important, and it is difficult to see any originality emerging from this genre.
