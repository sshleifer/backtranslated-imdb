The original is a relaxing clock with some truly unforgettable animation sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, although not the worst of the sequels of DTV, is completely devoid of sparkle. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of history. Like the Magic World of Belle, the characters are told a series of vignettes. The magical world, although a little better, still managed to confuse history. In between the vignettes, we see working mice, and I personally believe that the jokes of Yak and Gus are the redemptive virtues of this film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best when Cinderella is used to being a princess. This is the best because the mice were the most ridiculous here. The worst of the vignettes when Jaq turns into a man, sometimes cute, but lacking in imagination. The last vignette when Anastasia falls in love was also pretty. The problem was that I could not imagine that Anastasia was friends with Cinderella, because she considered her angrier of half-sisters. This was also overshadowed by the rather ridiculous story that Lucifer fell in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> It was very nice to listen to random music, but I hated the songs, they were really boring, and nothing like that. Tchaikovskyâ€™s beautiful melodies inspired the original. <br /> <br /> Characters were the most powerful development here. Cinderella, still caring, lost her sincerity and much of her charm from the original, although she wears very nice clothes. The duke had some really funny moments, but they were not enough to save the film, just like with Prudence and the king. As I already mentioned, the mice were the redeeming virtues of the film, as they alone contributed to the attractiveness of the film. I must also say that the animation is colorful and above average, and the voice acting was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> In general, a nice, albeit non-original sequel, which was overshadowed by songs and a lack of history. 4/10 for mice, voice acting, animation, and some beautiful dresses.
