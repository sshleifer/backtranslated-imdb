As a lover of the naval history of the Second World War and a man who is not proud of the history of race relations in this country, I was looking forward to the opportunity to see this film. What a disappointing piece of chloka. I did it about 3/4 of the way, but I had to turn it off on the sub-attack scene. The idea that a submarine will fire a torpedo at the DDE, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and then being able to “escape” from the DDE while under water is ridiculous. And this is just a little detail. The entire film was poorly written, misdirected, and acted poorly. I agree with others on this board that it could be a good movie. As if they decided that, since all these trashy propaganda films were made with completely white casts, they needed to do one with black people. And no matter how bad these old films are, it's actually getting worse. And it almost smacks of a false advertisement for Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out that they had very minor roles. I have to believe that those two wonderful actors were confused to be associated with this film. I'm done. I gave too much of my life to this shitty movie.
