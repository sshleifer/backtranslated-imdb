Christopher Durang must have been taught by a terrible nun because he simply could not let go of the concept. The play “Sister Maria Ignatius explains everything for you” was presented - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone as the lecture scenes of Diane Keaton. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, an executioner, a bitter satire of a serenely self-confident, doctrinaire and highly condemning nun — and in the performance of Lynn Redgrave she was cheerful. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously - while, as already mentioned, maintaining the same tone in the “explains everything” scenes. Two approaches collide with the head, and in the last twenty minutes the film derails, plunges into the gorge and explodes. There are no survivors. This would work if the tone of the scenes with the four former students and their meeting with sister Maria were the same as the scenes of sister Maria. Or, if the scenes of Sister Mary were more realistic. This method simply does not work at all.
