This match was overshadowed by potentially big matches that were very short. <br /> <br /> The first match was a waste of the Legion of Fate, but I think the only way they could be destroyed by Destruction was double DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have to work overtime. Kerry von Erich, an IC champion, is lost here. And this was the third PPV account where Perfect Workbed. Remember, he has never lost a match before. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, perhaps the best for the night. Ted Dibias and The Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Neidhart had one of his main points of the WWF, anchoring Honky Thin Man. Coco B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put on a new heel (remember Big Bossman and Yokozun?). This was the foreshadowing of Bret Hart’s singles career, as he returned from two to one and almost survived the match. He and DiBiase staged a wrestling clinic, which made us forget that the meaning of the match was the boring enmity of DiBias with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the Visionaries were the first team in which all its members survived (and only the second after 87 to have four survivors), this match was not a squash. It was the longest match of the night, and Jake repeated his performance in the 88th, when he was left alone against four people and dominated. I think he might really be upset. Nowadays, a match would end the other way around. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest matches in SS history was one of the most amazing. Perhaps the most underrated fighter in the entire history, Tito Santana was an inspiring fighter of the night, he put on military paint and pinned Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even the Military Leader in the final survival match. It was so strange to see how he was so depressed, and then returns to his mediocre career. Sergeant Slaughter also succeeded in getting rid of Volkov and Bush hackers, but this was not a surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only goal of the survival match was for Hogan and the Warrior to win together at the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the matches were too short. Undertaker's debut was awesome, but Tito Santana is the reason I’ll remember this one.
