No doubt, Frank Sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer. In the end, very few actors can currently get the stage right in one take, and this was in many ways a Sinatra action on the set. <br /> <br /> I feel that in the 1960s the quality of this man’s films really began to tank. The detective series Tony Rome was nothing more than an attempt to compete with Matt Helm Dean Martin, which came out simultaneously. Perhaps even a James Bond contest, but Frank did not help anything during these years. His personal life is in ruins, his music disappears ... Sinatra looked more like a return to the 1950s. Sinatra’s last great film of this period was probably von Ryan’s Express in 1965.
