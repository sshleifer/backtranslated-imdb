Let me start with how I love the show. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man who apparently cannot fulfill his dreams because of his powerful, manipulative father, in practice it was incredibly carefree and fun to watch. In my opinion, this is, without a doubt, one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The series has my rating of 10 out of 10 without reservation. <br /> <br /> This additional film, on the other hand, is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. It is unlikely that any essence of the television show was successfully transferred to the film. This film is very sad, depressing tone, which several times almost caused me to tears. Watching Harold beating in a pub (and not comically) is not my idea of ​​a comedy, but it certainly is one of the reasons why fans of the series will not like this movie. The film was terribly unfunny, with the exception of the scene where Albert is bathing in the sink and seen by his neighbor. <br /> <br /> The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of tune and makes me wonder if the producers have ever bothered to watch the show. In the series, Harold always pursued respectable girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert’s reaction to comments made against him by Harold’s friends was absolutely invaluable on the show. In the film, Albert practically says nothing when the opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> Most of the side effects of British sitcoms are usually quite boring, with the exception of noticeable ON THE BUSES films (which in some respect was actually better than the show itself!). But STEPTOE AND SON should be located right at the very bottom of the stack, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this and see the second answer, again STEPTOE AND SON RIDE instead. He has a much lighter tone, he is more faithful to the series and is actually very funny.
