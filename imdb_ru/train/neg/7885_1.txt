I believe in the preservation of religion outside the government and in the movies. When I want a sermon, I'll go to church, but I don't want it from the movie. I don't mind some supernatural themes (after all, religion is as supernatural as possible!), But there were so many sermons in this film that I was really annoyed. The hostess reminded me of witches who have been seen in other films. The bad guy even looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a silly ending: the hero went to the meeting and shouted at all these old men, and this broke the spell. If life was so simple. I think that when films are so stupid, they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PRICING IS CONTAINED HERE!
