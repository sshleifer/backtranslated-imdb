Perhaps it was done, damn it, but it was probably the worst movie I have seen in recent years. The best on all DVDs would be like that! I am surprised that people took the time to make something like that garbage, and yet spend money on it, I am glad that I only rented. I assume that the real fans of this film probably have to be sadistic and gothic to take care of this without taking CGI or any other effects in this regard, I hope that Alex Chandon has learned a lesson about lighting and SFX to make the best film in the future, that is, if it is still in the works. <br /> <br /> Notes for buyers are very disappointing, do not buy it !!!!!
