Sorry, but this is just awful. I told people about this film and about some of the bad actions that are in it, and they hardly believe me. There is nothing wrong with this idea: modern Japanese troops return in time to the times of the Bushido warriors, and their modern weapons are suitable for almost everything. When the troops first realize that something strange is happening, should every person at the back of the transport have to say, “Hey, my watch has stopped”? Imagine that such lines are repeated more than 15 times before they say anything else, and in a few words you won’t understand how big the movie is.
