Well, I watched the original French version. But I can not imagine that with subtitles better. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is the most boring movie I've seen in a long time. In this film, almost no redemptive qualities. That is why I can not understand all the positive reviews. In a sense, this may be realistic, but some real stories are best not disclosed. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow movies if they serve the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow, but it allows for introspection and, for example, sets the mood of the film. But in this case, the film is simply filled with meaningless dialogue, which can tell us little about the characters. None of which I could identify or care about. In many scenes I found myself thinking: “When are they going to shut up”? The game was pretty bad. Not too obvious way. But it seems that none of the actors cared about their characters, and they all looked as if they wanted to be in other scenes. This may be due to the boring dialogue they were given. Also, the entire flow of the film seemed rather mechanical. Moving from one scene to another. It seems that this film has just been written (badly), but has never been a director. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that, I can say, has not caused an emotional response in any of the scenes. Without waiting, without fear, without anticipation, without sadness, without self-analysis, without intellectual stimulation, without interest. <br /> <br /> A great example of what I call an anti-film.
