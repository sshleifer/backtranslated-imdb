Rest of the 1950s (London) Soho and promising people. Based on the cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more no less. Give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a popular video for 15 million dollars. Here he forgets that two minutes with people who cannot really act is one thing, but two hours? What was he thinking about? Also, who's the public? Who cares about the book, which is well remembered a long time ago. An ordinary London story about how a random person ventured. <br /> <br /> What can actually pull this movie even lower? Oh, I know, third level songs that sound like they were made on the spot. David Bowie repeats the title of the film several times, and this is the main point. The soundtrack album is made of earthen dove. <br /> <br /> There is one good thing. Good holiday period soho. Shame, they could not come up with anything to put in front of it.
