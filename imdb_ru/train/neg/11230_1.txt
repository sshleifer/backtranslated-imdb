In the sixth grade, every teacher I decided would be a good idea to make this film a full-term curriculum. Each class had something to do with this terrible show. We watched it in English and wrote in magazines, as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics, we talked about graphs and other marine nonsense. In science, we talked about whales (which was quite interesting, so it wasnâ€™t a waste of time). All day every day was torture. Not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day, forcing us to watch it also in the training room. I could see if it was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. I'm still trying to block it.
