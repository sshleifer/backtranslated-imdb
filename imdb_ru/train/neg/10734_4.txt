I have not read the negative professional review of this film. I guess I missed something. The start is intriguing, the three main characters meet late in the evening in an empty bar in the rest of the bar and entertain each other with fictional stories. This is the best part. After the three split up, the film splits into three strands. That's when boredom begins. Of course, the thread with Fellin grandmothers, who make dolls from chewed bread, is at first curious. Unfortunately, the director beat it to death, even introducing a wild storyline that leads to nothing. Bottom line: a two-hour story - subtle lethargy. If you suffer from insomnia, look at her in bed and you will sleep well at night.
