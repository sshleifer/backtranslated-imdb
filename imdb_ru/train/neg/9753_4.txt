I am grateful for one and only one thing - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent !!! Hooray!!! This program perfectly summarized how obsessed with Victoria Beckham was that she advertised herself and her family in the media in the name of self-promotion and “Brand fucking Beckham”. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I used to really like Chic and Becks, I still admire David’s talent very much, but I don’t respect him anymore. How can you respect someone whose hand of his wife lifted his back, working with him like a puppet. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria’s hand was all over Beckham’s premature departure from Manchester United, and now the same thing happened in Real I hope Beckham will be able to come to terms with the fact that may be earning billions of pounds - he sold his soul for American Buck and will end his days playing for a team that will fight for a promotion in the First Division in England (no offense to America) - but you rule in baseball and basketball - there is no football !) <br /> <br /> In any case - I digress. It has been many years since I saw such an incredible, completely false representation from Posh - it was led only during her decent performances on the red carpet after Rebecca Loos's “defeat” when instead of throwing everything * P in To David, whom he deserved, she desperately clung to his hand, trying to save the million pounds that had become her marriage. <br /> <br /> This whole PR move was pathetic. Why can't she just quietly go there, support her husband through the biggest mistake in his professional career and lower her head? When did it become so full of its own importance that it feels like moving to America should be covered by this huge fan pay? <br /> <br /> By the way, last night I saw a David Beckham documentary. At the very least, he retained a piece of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do with her studies. <br /> <br /> One more thing Victoria - you complain that you are constantly haunted by the pope. A little hint - stop telling them about your whereabouts, stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good luck, America!
