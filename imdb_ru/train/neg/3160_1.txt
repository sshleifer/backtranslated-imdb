You know that you have problems with watching a comedy, when the only funny roles in it are from the actors of “Animals”. It is a pity that the parrot, the Cat and the Dog were only in support, and not vice versa, since the people in it were rather deplorable everywhere. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what is their name), Jason and Lindsey, I would forget this acting lark and do something else, since you're all just as funny as drying paint watches and terrible actors to boot. <br /> /> The main gag in the film is the cry of one of the heroes, not a gay, which is funny, as if it were not so, you could change your mind, if you had to put up with three powerful, tedious and, dare say, very simple women are shot in the film. <br /> <br /> The worst film I have seen in recent years, and hopefully never see anything bad in it, although I don’t expect it.
