"The Crush" is a pretty nice romantic movie with 40-year-old friends trying to become British with Sex and the City. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the turn of the young trophy, whose character is not so good (if we think, we also did not see so much of his physical flesh, like Kenny Doughty). worth seeing more). <br /> <br /> They, of course, make far more young men / older women than they did in contrast with any version of Sabrina (I don’t like any film) or for that matter with Douglas / Zetas - Johns or the wedding of Diona / Svengali. <br /> <br /> Andy McDowell's setting as an ex-pater is the desired acquaintances from British dramas and comedies, such as the witty Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The plot twists towards the end, I feel very deus ex machina. But only when there were credits in the end, I realized that it might not be so. As in Sex and the City, the scriptwriter / director is a man, here is Scottish John McKay working for the first time, and I think he really wanted to write a script about three gays, maybe how they meet their lovers and at work (the characters are the principal, the policeman and the doctor), which would be a better and more interesting film. The working title for the film was “Club of Sad Fans,” which would make its parallels with the cheerful “Club of Broken Hearts” even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written 04/06/2002)
