Jennifer Cassie (Gina Phillips from Dead and Breakfast) returns to the house in which she grew up, in which she recently inherited from her late sister, unbeknownst to her grandmother (Faye Dunaway), who still lives in it. Jennifer decides to sell it, because she really needs money to the chagrin of her grandmother. She also begins to experience the unpleasant recurring nightmares of the mysterious crow. There was really no one in this movie. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, meaningless, and narcissistic, while grandmother seemed mean, sad, and narcissistic. The film is good and well made, but I have no one to empathize with, and it was difficult for me to take care of what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My rating: C-
