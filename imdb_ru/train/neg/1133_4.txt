I have seen romantic comedies, and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts. Many scenes work in the "plug and play" mode, inserted strictly in accordance with the genre of romantic comedy. This is usually normal, because we are dealing with a genre, but the problem, as a rule, is to make it original, new and inventive. In this film, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> There is no point in who the characters are, other than Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this film, not Isabelle Blace). They fit into this one-dimensional cliché and become nothing more than simple puppets, serving the purpose of a very easy narration. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film can become annoying, there is no rhythm, and editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention overly stylized decors that make some scenes devoid of any natural, or rather, an attempt to seem natural too obvious. Of course, along with this you have rich music, which, unfortunately, often sounds inappropriate. <br /> <br /> I can’t believe that a film that makes Woody Allen’s obvious hints turns out to be so deceptive. If you expect a good, carefree romantic comedy, it’s not. Or rather, it is a failed attempt. You will leave the theater, wondering why this film received such praise when the cinema is over 100 years old, and there are much better Quebec directors who make the best films. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a good movie of what it is. But this is bad if you consider cinema to be art, and directors - the author.
