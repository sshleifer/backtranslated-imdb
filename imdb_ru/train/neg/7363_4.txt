The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was because there was Erica Eleniak. She's sexy as always, but she plays second fiddle with lead man Wolf Larson. It is a pity, because she has more combat abilities than she is allowed to show here. The film mainly consists of endless skirmishes that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you see how bad guys armed with machine guns constantly miss Larson, and he is armed only with a revolver (which NEVER lacks bullets), which takes them all easy. The effects of earthquakes are decent, but there are also many blurry movements and weak CGI explosions. As a psychotic “spiritual leader,” Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious nonsense that he has to pour out is just boring. Eleniak, Perlman, or Larson (assuming he has one) might well want to take a look at this, but for others it is hardly worth renting. (* 1/2)
