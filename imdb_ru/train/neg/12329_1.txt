At one time as a lawyer, "Private Lessons" were played in 4 plexes, where I worked. It was a sleeping hit, selling off Friday and Saturday evenings for a few weeks. I never bothered to see him, but I saw that he was on cable last weekend, so I decided to give him a chance. For the next 90 minutes, I witnessed one of the worst films I've ever seen, and because of which I was terribly uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> The main story is that the teenager yearned for his sexual maid (Sylvia) Christelle. She also seems to feel attracted to the boy, but for more sinister reasons. So, we see scenes when the boy is watching her undressing, and she invites him to watch. And it comes from there. <br /> <br /> Eric, being a teenager, must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. His "scared" reactions for every time Sylvia removes a piece of clothing or when she touches him are terrible. I have never laughed during this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> And let's not start with a story about how the maid and the chauffeur plan to extort money from the child. Let's just say, this includes the falsification of death, the burial of the body ... I could go on and on, but this is becoming more and more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes are the worst I've ever seen. Although Eric Brown was older than he looked, in fact he looks like a child. It turns out that he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if it works then maybe I should rethink my critical comments from Brown), and he just came too close to erotic music that borders on child pornography. I have never been so shocked by the sex scene, although Miss Christel is quite beautiful with and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ABOUT SPOILER ** I must mention the last scene. For me, it just hurts, but I remember how the audience applauded when the film froze in the frame and dissolved in the credits. Our hero returns to school and begins to flirt with one of the teachers. He invites her to dinner, and she looks at him like Tom Cruise has just invited her. She nods in the affirmative, and he leaves, smiling triumphantly into the camera. Give me a break! Yes, I am sure that teachers from all over the world will risk everything for a simple teenager. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal of this film in 1982. Of course, it was more than nudity, because there were a lot of teen nude sex comedies that were bombed at the box office. And to think that the very same teenagers who encouraged this film 22 years ago are now climbing the career ladder and, perhaps, helping to run this country. This is a scary thought.
