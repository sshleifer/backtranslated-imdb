The hardest part of this movie is to say something positive. The characters were stereotypical “white goats”, the “plot” of the film was removed from the very beginning, and the worst feature of this film was that the nudity was so blatant from twins that it was funny. Unfortunately, it was the only fun thing in the film. Miss Jenkins will be better served if in the future she refrains from using her life story to “entertain” people. It was just so bad. One positive aspect of this film (it has nothing to do with the poor quality of the film) is that my brother laid out money for this bitch.
