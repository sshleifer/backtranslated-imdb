This afternoon I watched the Lake Hut in the USA. Given that this film was made for television, it was quite interesting to see the sequel. So, I tuned in for airing this evening and was very disappointed. I knew that I would not like the movie, but I did not expect to be puzzled by the use of DV (digital video). The film would be tolerable if it were not for these juxtaposed digital frames, which seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the storyline to be associated with these frames, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (ATTENTION: THE NEXT CAN BE SPOILER !!!!) The open finale at Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open finale in the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee that the film “Returning to the Lake House” will be watched if the film was shown with nothing except commercials at 4 am.
