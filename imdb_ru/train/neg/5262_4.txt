We had to go to the reception, so we turned on the DVR to record the final. After it was all over, I looked at my husband and asked: "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head: no. I said, "So, you made me watch the end of this film, and I have no idea what just happened." He didn't "make" me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The very body of the movie was pretty good. There was a lot of obscurity. It made you think. Then came the final. The ending was ... well, it just ended. You have not been given to understand what happened or why. Up to the credits, I continued to think that something would happen to explain this, but this did not happen. So I came here, expecting someone to understand this, and I just did not pay attention to it. Nope Four years later, I am as ignorant as Tom Sawyer. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea what happened. I'm just glad I didn’t spend $$ to buy it, because I’m sure I’d be crazy. <br /> <br /> Ooooo! I understood! The end of the film is what has disappeared! ROFL
