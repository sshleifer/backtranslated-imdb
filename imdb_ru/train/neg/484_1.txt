I was disgusted by this movie. No, this is not because of the graphic scenes of sex, but because it spoiled the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This film does not contain much truth about her and her art. This shows one work of art that she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that she was entered as a testimony in a rape case when she did not draw her first Judith during the year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know if you understood this from the film, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He raped Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to have taken false rape charges to stop her from suffering during the torture. According to the rape transcripts, he went on to say that he never knew that Artemisia (he also had sex with her), while she again and again declares: "This is true." <br /> <br /> I urge all of you, people to go out and find out about real Artemisia and see what it really is about. Do not base all your knowledge on this fictional film. I urge you to do a little research, Artemisia really has an interesting story and amazing artwork. <br /> <br /> Don't watch the movie, but find out the true story of Artemisia.
