This film has recently received wide distribution on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume that it would be interesting for people to compare it with Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks eponymous caps. The only reason to see this is for the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I must say that Matt has been trying to play high school for too long. If he were a woman, they would have played a high school student's MAT! (Is it just me, or is his daughter starting to look like Shelley Duval?) Oh yes, the plot - who cares? Typical teen hinjins played by adults.
