Well, this film was made for one reason and only for one reason TO EARN MONEY !! The producers obviously didn't care about killing the classic horror movie. I knew that this movie would suck as soon as it became pg-13, how many movies pas-13 slashers turned out to be good? It's like asking how many women were on the moon? Answer NO !! The prom night of 1980 was certainly not a masterpiece, but it certainly deserves recognition as a film that remains true to its genre and is trying to do something more. <br /> <br /> My problem with the 2008 prom is how he handles the killer, and I have 3 major problems with him ................ ..... <br /> <br /> 1) The way he runs, he was locked in a mental hospital, and he escapes through a vent !! WHAT THE HELL? Why do they need a vent in the patient room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat dubious, the killer wants all the main victims - family and friends - to die so that he can give it to himself, he says he loves her, but the next minute he tries to kill her, so he wants to kill her, love her or just rape her? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his skills? He used to be a teacher, so in this one scene, where he kills the guy of the main victims, while he mostly sleeps over her, and she doesn't notice, all this is a stupid 2 stars out of 10 horrible, stupid, stupid horror movie
