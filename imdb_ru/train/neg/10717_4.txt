I give this generous four out of ten stars, or points, or markers, or something like that. <br /> <br /> There were only two really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) progressed quite well. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual trade in stereotypes, incredible speed, roughly repelled by a blunt soundtrack, and the “soundtrack” are generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, two really funny scenes were associated with Amy P. She is just very funny in animal style. She is a mixture of that monkey monkey, which they make in SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope that they (Amy P and Tina Fey) simply established themselves, admitting that they did it for money, because if doing this, it gave birth to Sarah Palin's parodies, then I think we can say, yes, it was worth it to bring the black guy back to the role of a servant who is really there to help you be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10, as I said, generously. <br /> <br /> But no more girls, ok? Oh, I almost forgot. Mom from the movie "Two and a half men" in this film, and she had some kind of plastic surgery, so her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30-year-old girl, so that every scene in which she is in, I try to to change her face, or put it in my head, or just answer the question: “No. Wait. Wait. Did she have plastic surgery? ”Because, as a viewer, you really don’t want her to have plastic surgery.
