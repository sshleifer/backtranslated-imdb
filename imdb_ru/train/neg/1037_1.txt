The fact that this is a bad excuse for an amateur watch show announced at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most independent directors these days. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is such a thing as the art of cinematography. Just take a 16mm camera and direct it to someone who has a line, not for a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think we should consider ourselves lucky when the director didn’t take someone’s video camera ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, indie films should be about real people. This film is nothing real. None of the characters seem to be even a distant person. <br /> <br /> What they meet is a figment of the writer's imagination, trying to impress his buddies, showing them how “cool and sharp” he is. . <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this is not what is needed for writing or directing. <br /> <br /> There is only a bit of a bad film that somehow ended up in Sundance. It’s hard to believe that it was one of the best films shown ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I lost what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand.
