It was the worst film I've ever seen at WorldFest, and he also received less applause! I can only think that it gets such recognition based on the number of famous actors in the film. It's nice to see J. Beals, but she is only in the film for a few minutes. M. Parker is a much better actress than the part that is allowed. The rest of the acting skills is difficult to judge, because the film is very funny and predictable. The main character is not at all sympathetic and, therefore, a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth in the story. The film, which tells about the actor who can not find a job, does not seem to me original. Also not developing cops. This is similar to one of the many live movies I saw in the 90s ... And not even very good by these standards. <br /> <br />
