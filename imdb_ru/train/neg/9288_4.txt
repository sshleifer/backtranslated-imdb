Half Past Dead, starring starring Steven Seagal, was a major b-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a sequel to the video, an action movie in which nothing is lost, but there is no way to win anything. This is less interesting than the first: in all aspects. But it is worthy of attention. If you like action movies or just watch something during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former WWE stars on the screen or even if you like to watch sequels, even if they are direct or not. <br /> <br /> Curupt did a great job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think he was not hired. Curupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did their job, but nothing surprising, nothing wrong. <br /> <br /> The technical details, well, Sony production cannot be great. Cinematography was a disaster, but the general direction was acceptable. Anything, just watch if you want. If you look, you will not lose anything. But if you don’t ... well, you won’t lose either.
