Yes, the first "Howl" was a classic. A pretty good movie about werewolves, which, as I admit, started slowly, but gained momentum along the way to achieve a pretty good ending, after which the lead turned into a cute werewolf only to be shot at. Yes, it was made for an entertaining horror movie, to be sure ... well, forget about all this, since this film has nothing to do with this movie. Oh, of course, they sort of find out that the lead woman is the same, and that her brother or something else wants to know what and why things went wrong, but they go from a small, cozy departure from the first film to Transylvania or somewhere here, where they have to fight evil wolf-wizards or something like that. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee did in this film, but I read a trifle here, where it says that he was never in a werewolf film, but still read the script before playing a role. Perhaps you could go to hell "American werewolf in London," which would be possible. It was established in London after all. Damn it, werewolves don't seem to play a big part in this movie, except for a rather weird and long sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this film for me was when one girl began to speak loudly, and this guy started bleeding.
