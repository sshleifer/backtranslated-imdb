Since the loving cinema universe met a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombies" is automatically associated with horrible images and soaked in blood and non-stop episodes. It is safe to say that his “Night of the Living Dead” has formed a film about zombies, as we know it now. However, in the early years of cinema, the room for reanimated corpses was simply used in slow, almost inactive psychological thrillers. “I walked with a zombie” by Jacques Tourner is a great example, like “White Zombie” with White Lugosi in the lead role. This “Zombie Rise” could be another example, but unfortunately, this is the failure of the whole line, and perhaps one of the most tedious films I've ever seen. A terrible game, a very poorly written script and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes, and yet the first half hour is completely spent on stupid intrigues about love stories and uninteresting monologues. The situation in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could undoubtedly lead to a more exciting story, but all we ever see are internal shots. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, a curly-haired blonde with an ugly nose) irritated me very much, and I hoped that an insatiable undead would suddenly appear from nowhere to devour her. Not lucky again ?? If you manage to conquer yourself within 60 sleepy minutes, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent final. However, this is too little to give this film a positive rating, not to mention a recommendation. Avoid! This is a type of film that you should only see if you have already seen the rest.
