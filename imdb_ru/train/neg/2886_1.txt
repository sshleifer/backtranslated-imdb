Awful, Awful, Awful do not waste money on renting this movie. It's like a low budget movie for Canadian television. Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen, and there were a lot of others. This film is not worth the time required to install it in a DVD player or VCR. : ~ (. Can I write ten lines? The game was terrible. She had absolutely no flow. I saw a movie made for TV on the BTK killer, and it was much better (compared to this). I donâ€™t of course, what they were going to produce this film for, but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the killer of BTK, which they missed a mile, it was more like a commercial for animal rights.
