It was just awful. I read this book for school, I did like on all tests, and see it like that! My teacher made me and 20 other people watch it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Cosmos and Hudson Hoke put together. What made this movie so terrible was enough reasons to want to commit suicide. First of all, it was done at Hallmark. Secondly, the game was terrible. Third, it was like a book. Literally it was so bad that I asked for forgiveness. In fact, I would rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this. Take my advice, don't watch this movie. No one would like to watch this. It was terrible. HORRIBLE!
