It is hard to believe that this is a continuation of Henry the Fool. It is hard to believe that the same director and actors participated in both films. While Henry the Fool is refreshing, witty, comedic, Fay Grim is slow, boring and not going anywhere. Where is the wit? I'm confused. <br /> <br /> 10 years have passed since I saw Henry the Fool, and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fei Grim is painful to watch. This is not the fault of actors who are good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame lies entirely on the plot, the dialogue and even some of the shooting (low budget does not justify). Great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you liked this film, you don’t really like Henry the Fool ... the two films are absolutely not connected in any way with a friend ... there is no continuity in the characters of the characters ... it is a deception to make Henry the Fool fans see the sequel. <br /> <br /> I’m turning it off now - is Henry in some prison with the Taliban?!?!
