In general, an extremely disappointing picture. Very, very slow build up to the main storyline. The role of Maria Schrader in the search for her families of a secret past. (It seems every take lasts forever. Thereâ€™s really no rhythm in the film.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth is saved from the Nazis by a German woman played by Katya Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotypical. *** SPOILERS THE END *** The film tells about today's New York, Berlin and Berlin of the 40s. Please, when you do this, give the audience an indication of exactly when the story takes place. There is never a clear indication of time? very annoying. The worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole performance and chatter about how the Jews were terribly tortured just a bureaucratic incident! Give me a break. So the Jews left with Rozenshtrasse? When asked about who liberated the Jews, they NEVER answered. Was it Gebels who set them free? Did Lin Fisher sleep with Goebbels? In Venice, the film won the acting prize for C. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Should there be a Jewish theme ??
