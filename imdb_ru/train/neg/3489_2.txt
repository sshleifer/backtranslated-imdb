This was my first and, probably, the last film “Angelopoulos”. I really wanted to get into it, since Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, participated in it, and there was a film called Theo about which I heard a lot. The discovery was promising, a long shot over a soldier's jeep across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing to lose. There were big holes in the film, and I don’t know what to mention first. The main plot of the story reveals an old woman journalist. during a long walk. It’s like a 15-minute monologue that kills the action and patience of the audience, nothing that’s happening on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, except for this old lady telling a story. Everything that is supposed to be shown through action was simply told in front of the camera of the old lady. After a moment, the TV equipment was heading for the bar. They turn the corner, and winter begins at once! Probably shot on different days, continuity leaked. Many problems with telling stories, it turned from absurd to irrational, never adhering to the style, forcing the viewer to ask questions that have not received answers. Poor Mastroianni, given the role, which lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks, Albanians or Balkans would agree, the films showed a lot of historical, ethnic or political incorrectness, just to make a film about “humanity” as red in another review. Much more can be said, but one should not waste time on a bad film, which was not a film at all, but a crazy person captured in the film and paid for with state money.
