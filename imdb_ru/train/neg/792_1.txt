Thank you BBC for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people, and I had a terrific feeling that people hate me. However, after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes, my condition began to change. After the second series, I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes, and I really felt talented. When the series ended, I ran a sales department at work, pounded a lot of women, and often won karaoke competitions in my area. If you have ever had a crisis of trust, and you donâ€™t know where to turn, go to Poundland and get a DVD - it's just 99 pence.
