I remember how I was forced (yes, literally forcibly) to watch this film by a Southern Baptist preacher when I was a child, and even then I loved his horror. This is designed to scare the poor suckers so they are "saved." The only thing that “saved” me was that it finally ended, and I was able to go out and live a REAL life. <br /> <br /> Familiarize yourself with the chapter of this film in Sarah Diamond’s Christian Rights Policy. Fascinating. And of course more interesting than a movie!
