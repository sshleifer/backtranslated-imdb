This film seems to have been made by someone with some good ideas, but who also never made a movie before, nor did they think that the script should be edited or even fun. When I saw this film, I saw it for John Candy and incorrectly suggested that it would be fun. Instead, there was a stupid mind control conspiracy and so many flat, unfunny moments. And to top it all, Candy spoke some of the roughest lines I've ever heard before. Thus, despite the potentially funny acting and plot idea, we still have an amateur and rude film that is likely to be too stupid for an average adult, although teenagers will surely find some laughter. It really is a shame - it could be much better. I mean that with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy this should be great.
