The Blue Desert may have had the potential to be even half believable, and the more pleasant thriller had the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not so stupid. When she falls victim to another attack on the streets of New York, comic artist Roberts moves to a small town in the west. In her early days, she meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Schaeffer, who plays the role well), who ultimately will not leave her side. Fearing for her safety after having already been in a situation twice, she makes friends and relationships with the suspiciously friendly city police officer Steve Smith (D. B. Sweeney, whose character does not look convincing enough, leaving disbelief among viewers who otherwise should would be convinced of red herrings abandoned by writers). Smith needs Roberts cooperation because, as he tells her, Atkins is a former prisoner and is guilty of sexual abuse. But the police had no evidence to remove him earlier. <br /> <br /> The film had enough tricks to at least make an interesting film, because pretty soon there is confusion that Roberts should trust. However, much of the anticipated expectation seems too constrained, because Roberts' character seems to never react to simple things, as we think any reasonable person could. And her belated answers make it easy and unconvincing to occur with most of this expectation, especially in the final. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; too, the child faced in such a way as to recall the personality of Kevin Anderson, evident in his character in “Dream with the Enemy”. Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, this can also be enough. Meanwhile, the film is not so good, even as a low-budget B-thriller.
