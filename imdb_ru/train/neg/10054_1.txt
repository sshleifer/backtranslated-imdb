I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Donner masterfully performed. I'm also not alone in despising Richman Lester's Superman 2 ... which leads us to the role of Richard Donner in the same film, unfortunately, this is still an absolute abomination. <br /> <br /> Supermanâ€™s World is a world in which disbelief is required in high doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too much. It doesn't matter who led Superman 2, because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader. In a sense, there is no plot, because the characters do not have the motivation to act as they do, unlike the original superman. With or without his abilities, Superman's power (or lack thereof) is handled in the least plausible way. There is too much criticism, so I will not worry. I condemn this film ... perhaps the farce in the Leicester version is more suited to the moronic scenario on which this film is based. Super duper bad.
