When YOU ARNOLD! first aired in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes began to show again and again, so I was tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching them. I was a little surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! FILM, as it seems to be not as popular as some other Nickelodeon cartoons, such as SQUAREPANTS SPONGEBOB. However, having nothing better, I still went to see the movie. Entering the theater, I did not expect much. I just expected it to be a silly version of a movie about a child’s cartoon, as it was in the movie “RECESS”. I think I got what I expected. It was a stupid children's movie and nothing more. There were some good roles here and there, but for the most part the film was terrible. Just for kids.
