Mr. Perlman gives an outstanding performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to contend with a signed script and some meaningless plots. <br /> <br /> Larsen in the “Die Hard” mode, which has singlet and bulging muscles, I am sure that he could cope better, but he seemed pleased to make faces and roar through his part. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Erika is very decorative (albeit fully dressed!) and finally shows some signs of “triggering”. <br /> <br /> SFX These are mostly bad CGIs and thefts from other films. <br /> <br /> Skirmishes are pathetic - worthy of the A-Team <br /> <br /> Perlman is not even worth watching - AVOID
