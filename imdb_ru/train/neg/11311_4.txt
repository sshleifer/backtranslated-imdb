I vaguely remember Ben from my favorite sci-fi days of the 60s, I gave several interviews and a biography of little-known actors / actresses, especially Ben, actress Fei Paint and Jodie Faire, who played Angela in 1961 in the film Young Savages. Ben was one of those who worked in a low-key sci-fi musical in Chicago, around 1970, when I had a good talk with him, his “career” and life. All of them were published in some long forgotten fanzine of the day. I wish I had copies of these interviews, but time is ticking, and any of these people probably will not remember me so many years later. Ben was a really good guy, earning a living (The minuses of those days did not even pay his guests, unless, of course, they were famous stars, and even then the salary was a maximum of a couple of hundred dollars! It's nice to know that Ben is still alive and well! How about a remake of the Creature, but 50 years older! Terribly then, uglier now!
