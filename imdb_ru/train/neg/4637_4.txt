Police in Bangville allegedly marked the debut of Keystone Kops, named after the studio in which they worked. In this, however, they do not wear silly police costumes and do not drive a high-speed car, which is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl here who begged her father to take the calf away. Later, she sees strange people in the barn and quickly calls the police. One answers, and the chase continues. Then Mabel slams the door as soon as someone enters. It turns out that it is her mother who concludes that the robbers are there! So while Mabel is blocking his door with furniture, Mom and Dad are trying to get through! This was perhaps the funniest part of a short circuit along with some police car explosions. It was a short 7 minutes that went so fast that everything ended before it began. The only real characteristic that has been developed is Mabel, who radiates charm only with her face and big eyes and looks so optimistic about joy here, except, of course, when she is scared. It is easy to see why she became a star. Largely because of her, I recommended seeing it at least once, and therefore I give it 4.
