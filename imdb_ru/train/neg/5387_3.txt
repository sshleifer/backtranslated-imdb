In an instant, when it seemed interesting, it never reached. <br /> <br /> People move from one point to another, and this makes no sense (if it was very boring). There was no action, expectation, or any horror, and the characters were rather heartless, so there was nothing to do with what happened to them. <br /> <br /> All together the film was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I give him 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like that this is not a shaky cinematography job, and if there was music, it did not annoy me, like some really bad films, and the game was not terrible,
