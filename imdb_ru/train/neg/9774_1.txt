Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book Requiem for a Dream and wrote the script for the film Aronofsky. This film excelled at all levels, providing an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the lives of the characters and the vices that destroyed them. In The Last Exit to Brooklyn, there are still vices and many characters who live sad lives, but it is unlikely that the same as Aronofsky depends on them. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a movie seems funny against gays. Especially when in a film, homosexuality equals death. One gay character gets a stone, he goes up in a high-speed car and lands on the asphalt. The other is crucified and more simply beaten. Another exaggerated part of the shock value, which could be really convincing if everything was done well, is the scene when trade union workers literally fight the strikers. Who would have thought that the drama about Brooklyners would include militants and truck explosions? <br /> <br /> Directed by Uli Edel has the same level of skill as the director, but in fact he is far below the level of the director. films. The film is clumsy, which, it seems, can not even stop at the genre. Lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could play, and Baldwin seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager role. And then Jennifer Jason Lee comes as our leader, a hideous prostitute named Tralal (believe it or not, I’m not joking). There is nothing good in her performance, and the fate of her character is at least dirty. Poor use of color and composition makes it look cheaper than it is, and also removes the “real” edge with more provocative details. Renouncement.
