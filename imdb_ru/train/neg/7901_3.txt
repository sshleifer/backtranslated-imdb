And, this is bad, because, at least, if it were the movie "Troma", it would have been senseless violence and a stronger sense of anarchy, which could raise my rating a little. <br /> <br /> So what? instead, we have a very modest (PG rated), barely warm, low-budget (Roger Corman created him with an unknown director who later remained unknown) Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) - an imitator with an almost exclusively flat humor, a little logic, which made the Gremlins work so well - fantastic logic or not, no expectation, no sense of adventure, no violence or nudity to compensate for this. <br /> <br /> Although I’m sure that some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script - let's face it, no one could put these jokes to be funny - it seems that the biggest fault should fall on the director’s knees Bettina Hirsch. In more capable hands, the Munchies might be interesting. <br /> <br /> In the end, it begins, like so many great adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in archaeological excavations in Peru. Simon is a little wacky archeologist who always floats theories about the connection between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, he thinks he sees evidence of the laser cutting of ancient masonry. Therefore, they in Machu Picchu are looking for more evidence of Simon's theories when they enter the secret room. Inside, they quickly find an animal, which they later call the "Arnold", one of the titled hamburgers. <br /> <br /> They take Arnold home to their little Californian desert town. Simon, who thinks Arnold is probably an alien creature, should go to a colleague’s lecture, and he plans to tell a colleague that he finally has a sample of an alien. Paul and his extremely sweet girl, Cindy (Nadine van der Velde), remain behind Arnold, but since they have not seen each other for a long time, they leave Arnold unattended while they jump into the bag. <Br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Simon's brother Cecil (also played by Corman in a double role), the owner of a successful snack food company, seeks to buy out Simon's house and land - they are adjacent to his own. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil finds a scheme to steal Arnold. Things are gradually spinning out of control, and the larks, who have a passing trait to satisfy their cravings for unhealthy food, begin to overrun the city. <br /> <br /> In summary, it looks better than on screen. The best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, for example, when the characters travel on the outskirts of a deserted city. The interiors, with the exception of Cecil's house, tend to look like poorly decorated, cheap sets, and, more importantly, they show that Hirsch is not very good at blocking and adjusting shots. Oddly enough, given the lack of industrial design in general, Cecil's house is a real gem filled with the gloomy style of the 1980s, down to the smallest detail, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (John Stafford), was a fun counterpoint. It is a pity that he leaves the film so quickly. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Korman is a funny actor, but he's much better here than Simon than Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up missing for most of the film. Cecil, who physically distinguishes the funny wig and facial hair, is not only the “evil capitalist” of the film, he is one of the classic inattentive, boorish characters of Corman — it was one of his specialties often used in Carol. Burnett Show "(1967) parodies. Unlike The Show by Carol Burnett, which tended to succeed because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had an elaborate way to push parodies to the brink of chaos, Hirsch too curbed Corman, and Cecil's character simply Do not work the way you want. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems with the director, not least the precarious stimulation and editing that completely undermine any possible ambiguity or strong dramatic influence of the film. Even scenes that before The wives were to become shoes to enhance the drama — for example, when eerie girls chase an old woman on the road — go too awkwardly to have a big effect. <br /> <br /> There are also serious logical problems with the story in its present form. The Munchy in Machu Picchu Camera? The trailer of the film seems to show the answer to this, but it was edited from the final version.A more serious problem is that, unlike gremlini, the larks have no clear reason to switch from cute plush balls to the formidable mons tram It just happened. In addition, because the Manchu PG was saved, and the violence remains suppressed when the creatures are in their monster phase, they are never very threatened. They are also easy to send, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, the essence of the film is not in obscurity, horror, irresistible drama or something similar, but in humor. It was conceived as a fake of gremlins and countless robberies. The only problem is that the film is simply not funny, although I chuckled a couple of times. A surprisingly high percentage of jokes are soft cliches. Too much of the rest of the material consists of non-queens. Given the bad time from Hirsch, everything just collapsed. Potentially, it was possible to make a film which, being a fake, was at the same time funny and frightening, funny and disturbing, bold and tense, at the same time, or Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988). It is unfortunate that Munchies does not fit this at all.
