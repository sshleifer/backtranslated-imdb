I guess the bad Laurel and Hardy are better than Laurel and Hardy in general, but barely. It's sad that Fox films get a big release on DVD, exposing people who may not be too familiar with L & H, with their PEACE things, and not with their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Again the boys were saddled with a blunt romantic plot about a guy who invented an invisible ray. He is in love with the boss's daughter, who hates him and prefers some tricky guy. It's incredible to think that the geniuses from Fox thought that THAT is exactly what L & H needs in their films. <br /> <br /> Without pancake cosmetics, the boys look tired and old. The only scene that works for them in this picture is when they try to slip out of the bedroom window at night and the rather strange scene where Robert Mitchum, being the classic bad guy, is trying to sell Oliver Hardy's “insurance” to Stan. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget about it and see if you can find a copy of the “Chump at Oxford”, “Bohemian girl” or “Sons of the desert”.
