I read all the reviews here AFTER watching this piece of cinematic garbage, and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that someone else did not think that this horribly unfunny montage was not the pinnacle of humor in the 70s or even in any other place. . another era! If this is not the funniest sketch * comedy *, I have ever seen it fit until it appears. Half of the scenes have already been done (and infinitely better) by such actions as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I said that a good part of the animation, which lasts about 90 seconds, is the highlight of this film, it still does not come close to sum up how crazy and stupefied this waste is 75 minutes. Original comedy? Only in a world where the seed really means sperm. Scatological humor? Only in a world where the slope really is. Forerunners jokes? Only if by this we mean that this guide is about how NOT to make comedy. Boobs and asses and a strange beaver. Well ... if you are a young boy who has at least one free hand and you have not discovered that Playboy exists. Give it a rest, because it was in the early 70s? Never. The sketch comedy began ten years ago. The only way I could even forgive this film, even if it were made, was if it was at gunpoint. Retro? Barely Images about clowns, slightly perverting children, in some circles may be the sharpest (and it could be really funny), but it does seem rather sad. What made me go for all 75 minutes? The complete conviction that they might have saved a really funny parody to the end. I gave film 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insomnia or patients with a coma ... or perhaps to people suffering from jaw ... their jaws would finally open in disbelief .
