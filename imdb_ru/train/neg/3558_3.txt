Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (OBSERVER IN THE FORESTS) A bust-oriented bust does little. <br /> <br /> Although he is not devoid of bloody violence, he lacks narrative sensitivity and “characters”. <br /> <br /> “Incubus” in the title is a demon endowed with a giant penis, which during intercourse shoots red semen into the vagina - or, more precisely, rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, working as part of his successful directorial career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of strange attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The horrendous possibilities of the victims that give birth to demonic offspring are not considered - and neither is the audience’s tolerance for slow garbage. <br /> <br /> The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic consequences of a fertile background illustrates the main problems with this useless exercise, the Big Shlong-na-Luza.
