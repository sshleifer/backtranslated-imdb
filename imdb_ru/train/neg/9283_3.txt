I do not know how this film received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big fan of Vonnegut and I know very well the story that this original Showtime movie killed incredibly, but even if I wasn't, a bad acting game, a VERY bad cast (Sean Astin - brilliant, athletic, and everyone around, Harrison? ? The guy is absolutely universal!) And the non-standard letter made this trip barely noticeable. Someone pointed out how sweet this line was Makuleya Kalkin. If you read it and thought it was just a comic brilliance (unfortunately, this is probably the most funny part of the film), you might like this movie. But if you're a Vonnegut fan or not completely crazy, you shouldn't see it. You are welcome.
