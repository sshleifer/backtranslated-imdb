This Worldwide was the cheap male version of what NWA, led by Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett, did in the 1980s at the localized Big Three stations during the Saturday / morning wrestling Saturday. When Ted Turner got the unsuccessful version of Crockett's NWA, he turned it into a Wrestling World Championship and continued to drop all NWA links together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were labeled with the WCW logo and moved to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Fla., And eventually became nothing more than repetitions for WCW Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night. Worldwide was officially the latest WCW program under the leadership of Turner, which broadcast the weekend of the WCW redemption from Vince McMahon and WWF. Today, the entire archive of NWA World Wide / WCW video tapes along with the entire NWA / WCW video tape library as a whole lies in the repositories of WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
