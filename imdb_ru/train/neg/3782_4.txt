Good news first. "Spirit" is the most incredible animated film in the current issue of home theater. The design and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you look at this film only through visual effects. <br /> <br /> And now the bad news. I really mean when I say that animation is the only thing in this movie. You may remember that the “Spirit” suffered greatly from Lilo and Stitch last summer. The first person who claims that this was due to the fact that Disney is more authoritative and has better advertising can write me a four page essay entitled “Why the“ Lilo and Stitch Scenario ”doesn't stink. <br /> <br /> Despite all the incredibly new animation technologies presented in the "Spirit", the story is almost * surprisingly * boring. There is a lesson here, and (of course) it applies not only to animated films. You may have the most amazing visual effects that could ever grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we don’t care about your characters, this is a bad movie. Just like that. The animation is still awesome; I just can't wait to see what someone else does with this with great imagination.
