I saw it by chance one lazy summer day. He played on the HBO family programming channel. At first I was attracted by what I thought was Disney animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found that I was looking for a remote to find the "INFO BUTTON" to find out what was on the world in my television. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy it in many of his films, but the one thing he is not is the voice acting of the artist. Of course, he has one of the most unique voices in Hollywood, but it only works as part of a larger visual package. Joining his voice to the cute duck made it difficult to observe. As for the rest of the cast, boring. I believe that the work on this film did not attract a really good voice compared to the talents. <br /> <br /> So, weak voice talent, strong animation ... who was this movie aimed at? Blue ducks? I don't understand. Is there really such a lack of role models for young and future homosexuals that we have to resort to animated ducks? A pretty story, and, like the title, this film is hard for me to love, like an ugly duckling.
