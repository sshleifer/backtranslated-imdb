This is cheese. If all you need is a video game, supplemented by what looks like frames taken directly from the computer, for an action for which the film was too cheap to actually create special effects, that's all. My friend and I really had a great time seeing him, since the theater was mostly empty, and we could have a little shabby. This film really requires hekling. <br /> <br /> Story? Was the plot? Well, some stupid colleges or later students are invited to the "rave of the year" and go to one of the islands of San Juan ("If they stayed only in Seattle, they would have survived") - a direct quote or almost.) Attend. They get there, and everyone’s gone, and the site is somewhat destroyed (but hey, the barrel is still full!). With the help of a crisp old captain and a coast guard woman (who acted just a little less harsh — and a little less well — than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight many zombies (some of which spit acid), get a lot of fancy legends, and mostly kill them. That's all. <br /> <br /> This is not as BAD as Demonicus, but not much, and still better than Severed (they are a kind of my personal alpha and omega for bad films - the first is bad, but the fun is poking fun, and the last is just damn bad to watch more than once). On the other hand, if you expect a film as excellent as Resident Evil, run away !!! run away now !!! <br /> <br /> Well, some really big questions (without too many spoilers): since when did the Spanish ships of the 18th century go to the Pacific Northwest ????? Why is someone in the Pacific Northwest engaged in smuggling weapons and to whom is CANADA for crying loudly ??? Why is the rave on the unnamed (oh, sorry, it's called "isla del muerto", shya, right) San Juan Island - and in the open air, still remembering that this is the Pacific North. And there are about 30 people on the rave - “rave of the year”, my patriot. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are a lot of axes around. A lot of them. Everyone has them. There must be a hatchet shop nearby. <br /> <br /> Finally, while the film began with a small “parody” (with the words “I know what you did and the jaws), it did not go through it. Close enough. <br /> <br /> OK, really, finally - when in the introductory comments (behind the scenes, no less) it is casually mentioned that one of the characters “left his boyfriend to focus on fencing”, you can be sure that the end of the film will be some kind of fencing. Not a good fencing, but a couple of people, in any case, chop each other with swords.
