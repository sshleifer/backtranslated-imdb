This film is badly broken from Friday the 13th. The film tells about a killer named Bernie, who kills people around the camp counselor's training camp. He kills people because the camp of the camp advisor is on the land belonging to his father, and when the police forcibly seized the land of his father, they accidentally killed his mother (another F135 take-off). The entry sees Bernie killing his first victims. Then we meet a family who goes hiking in the same forest, soon after they arrive, a strange old man joins them, who likes to talk about his son. Later, we learn that his son is Bernie, and he locked him in the back of his caravan after he pulled him out of the psychiatric institute. He looks after the family of Bernie so that they can take their things, and then the chase began. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended only to those who love class 80 Slashers.
