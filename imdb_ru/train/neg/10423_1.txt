so ... this is really a sexist and a classic, and I thought that this might not be in the initial stages of the film, for example, when Stella tells Stephen that she really would like to change herself and start talking correctly, and he says not to change it. well, he definitely changed his tune, and it looks like other reviewers followed suit. what at first seems like a love story, in fact, concerns the social order and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the film does not make her a hero, it makes it all sad. and it's sad that people think it makes her a hero. perhaps this is a commentary on the film that people should pick up. positive reception reflects the constant patriarchal trends in the public consciousness. Ugh.
