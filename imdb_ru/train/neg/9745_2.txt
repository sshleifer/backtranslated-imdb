This film is faked in the episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was at its best when they tore up this movie. <br /> <br /> Awful game, bad makeup, bad effects, a chick in poor underwear (1960s), I give him a 2. <br /> <br /> Villain is hard to understand because of makeup An assistant says things like “not you” that sound like NACHOO! (think sneezing). This is just a bad speech. Long eyebrows are funny on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still don’t know what “Projected person” means from the point of view of the plot. I missed some of the start though. <br /> <br /> What happens to this minimum of 10 lines when publishing ??
