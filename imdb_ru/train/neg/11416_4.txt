The fact that this film received the title of the most successful film in the history of Swiss cinema, makes me shake my head! This is true, but at the same time a pity. A brush over the Swiss army could have been much better. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story sounds interesting: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to cancel military training of the army while he is in church, the wedding of his love Laura Moretti (Mia Egerter). <br /> <br /> Acting in a sense is no different from just a few recruits who get drunk and exposed by reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as a strong mediocre Michelle Blanzky, I personally find her rather annoying. <br /> <br /> Storyline contains a comedy combined with a novel that does not work as expected. The romantic part is too crappy, and the comedic is not at all funny, just a cheap attempt that does not change throughout the film. This is funny for teenagers 12-13 years old, but not for those who are looking for entertaining comedy. Humor is weak, except for some frames. <br /> <br /> Doping? Great! Theft? Great! If you want a good comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure that you have not yet canceled your military training, and even then do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give her 4 out of 10 stars because Marco of Rome is pretty funny during his screen. Not a hell of a lot of screen time though
