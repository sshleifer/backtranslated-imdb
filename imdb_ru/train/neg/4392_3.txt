A young scientist is trying to continue the work of his deceased father on the regeneration of limbs. His overbearing mother convinced him that he had killed his own father and was monitoring his progress for his evil ends. The young doctor uses reptile DNA, which he extracts from a large creature, and when his hand comfortably comes off after a few minutes, he introduces his formula and grows a new murderous hand ... Admittedly, the special effects in “Broken Ties” are pretty good and grotesque but the rest of the movie is terrible. A severed arm behaves like a snake and kills few people. Big deal. The game is mediocre and the climax is stupid. 3 out of 10.
