I grew up with Scooby-Doo all my life, My dad grew up with Scooby-Doo. We just watched the first episode of the parody that calls itself Shaggy, and Scooby gets a hint. What planet are the Warner Bros. to allow this routine to go on the air. Characters could be better drawn by my younger sister. This story could have been better written by my three-year-old twin cousins ​​(who are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy are simply not there !!!!! if someone other than Casey Kasem makes Shaggy's voice, it just won't work, guys !!!! believe me. <br /> <br /> This program was shameful. What's new is Scooby Doo much better. Why change the winning format. Bin this piece of trash and go back to the real Scooby
