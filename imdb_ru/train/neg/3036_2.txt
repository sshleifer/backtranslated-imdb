This movie was absolutely terrible! I can't understand how this film got into production. Nothing against the cast of the film, of course, the writers are to blame. You take the old middle plot - let's dance our way out of poverty and impoverishment - or STEP in this case. But it has no semblance of a true conspiracy â€” or at least one that someone would care about. With Canadian-speaking actors in what should be in the American setting, this film is very flat. The good news was that the direction was pretty good and the cinema was pretty decent. Looks like the production budget was very generous. My only request is that this team leave the script alone and find real screenwriters to help them liven up the words in the film. The net result is how she moves, how she sucks.
