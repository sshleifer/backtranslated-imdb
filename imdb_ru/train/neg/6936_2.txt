well, I don't know what people saw in this movie, I don't know. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday, and my head ached a lot. apart from a few good conversations, there’s nothing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Big brother now preaches that you need to fall in love with girls who have reached half of your age. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like the movie at all. I wanted to give 1 rating, but 3 - <br /> <br /> I like the role of the little girl, which AB calls "sexual". my word "DO NOT LOOK" <br /> <br /> save yourself not to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> save time and money.
