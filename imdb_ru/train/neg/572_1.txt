Ugh, what can I say, except, ugh. I rented this film because it was tagged as a sequel to the original vampires. This film could not be a lamer. The disadvantage is not only in the plot, but in the act of atrocities. Combined with some obvious whitespace, the plot makes this movie very difficult to watch. Many times I questioned my own sanity, continuing to watch the movie long after the plot had leaped from a shark. Here are a few examples of the lamer aspects ... *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Professional "Slayer" insists on sleeping on the street on your own at night. He wakes up from a crying woman sitting at a distance of no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere. He immediately comforts her, without questioning her sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seduction, and he lets it happen with obvious results ... <br /> <br /> One of the main characters is Zoe, bitten by a vampire, but for the time being she takes these "experimental" pills "she received in Mexico City everything is fine with her, although her body temperature is below room temperature ... <br /> <br /> A guard outside the monastery where the hero lives at night is killed by vampires, the hero leaves the next day, then he comes back in a day, only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left ... <br /> <br /> ... avoid this movie.
