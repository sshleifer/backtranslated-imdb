I donâ€™t really like directing Shaun Penn, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no basis, it is painted by a kind of goon, an anti-authoritarian teenager who, frankly, spoils most of Penn's work, his last work is even more so than the previous one. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn seem to produce such a fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some fidelity to honesty, but in the end, most of them glorify wrestling and moralist games, almost as if there were a lot greetings from Hell's Angels, and it will make me miss the days of Liberation, which is a good movie. The acting of Viggo Mortensen is much, much more believable than the ridiculous thing of the Eastern Promises that he did with Cronenberg, and that is all. The film is senselessly dead, and it seems like an exercise, a series of tricks, more than a story. Kudos to Charles Bronson, however, which proves that he can act. And I wanted more character Sandy Dennis. Lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner shit.
