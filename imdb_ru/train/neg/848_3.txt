Well, if you're looking for other Bastketball diaries, this is a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I rotate around two brothers. Max, Junior, is heavily addicted to cocaine. Adam, the eldest, doctor. It is assumed that this film shows a dive from reality to the extreme lows that make drugs possible. However, it is not. This shows that cocaine can be fun, no matter what situation it is in. Much of the film focuses on Max and his ways of parting. In the end, Adam can no longer take the stress out of his job and also starts using drugs (prescription drugs). <br /> <br /> This movie has almost no climax. It doesn’t go so far as cocaine does with you, it’s boring and low-budget scenes, and the game of Adam’s older brother is terrible. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this film managed to go through and receive awards, it is not a smoothie. If you want to get a clear and truthful plot of the film about the extreme world of drugs, if you don’t buy Basketball Diaries. And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you will like it. Try it and see for yourself ...
