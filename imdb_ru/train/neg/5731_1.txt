I watched the unrated version of this film and after 30 minutes I realized that I would never return the time. I persevered, hoping that the dialogue would improve, martial arts would look realistic over time, a special FX would actually look special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I'm a real bloody hound. I list some of the eighties movies among the greatest in the world of cinema. This, however, was not done in the eighties, if this film were released in the early eighties, the fax could have been forgiven for looking so bad. This was not the case; he did not have such protection. The dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines that I make a face from the letter, and not wriggle from torture. I don’t like the Hostel, never, I thought it was overvalued, over-promoted, and I didn’t feel anything about the heroes, however it shines like a beacon of greatness next to this garbage. The back cover for the Live Feed promised a turn that you will never see, I'm still waiting for the promised turn.
