This is one strange film, hacked together, you have the feeling that this time the communications company was supposed to come, I am not surprised that there are no credits on it who would like to be associated with this film. The action of all participants is terribly unnatural, and the story jumps everywhere, it all makes little sense. As I said earlier, it seems that the bond company should have come, because it seems that there was a lot of footage that should not have been shot, which should have been, and all the music was very bad library music (I think cheap). Very, very strange. Although I could buy a DVD with him, if he let me tell you what the hell is happening and what happened to this movie.
