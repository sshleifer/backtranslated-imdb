Let me first say that this film at the very beginning has one funny moment with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Ah? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you George: I'm a new George. The studio is too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the role? George: New George is just lucky, I guess. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only fun role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still interesting ... But again, it was easy to entertain me ... <br /> <br /> I would not say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen (this heading refers to the horribly unfunny movie “Disaster” ...), this film took 7th place in my bottom 15 list. <br /> <br /> If your little child has a lot of fun, you will like this movie. If you're a movie lover who wants a good, funny movie, then ultimately you shoot yourself halfway through this ...
