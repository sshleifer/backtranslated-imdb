Funny. This film is actually a tool for Ramtha’s school of enlightenment. If you're wondering who the * bip * Ramtha is: “Ramtha is a 35,000-year-old warrior spirit who appeared in the kitchen of J. Z. Knight in Tacoma, Washington, in 1977. Knight claims that she is Ramtha’s canal. She also owns copyright Ramtha also holds sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks a hollow, hoarse voice in a Hollywood version of Elizabethan English. She has thousands of followers, and she earned millions of dollars by acting as Ramtha at seminars ($ 1000 for crack) and at her Ramtha school of education and selling tapes, books, and accessories (Clark and Gallo, 1993). She must have hypnotic abilities. In search of self-realization, otherwise normal people obey her orders to spend hours blindfolded in the cold, a dirty labyrinth without doors. "John Wheeler, one of the best American theoretical physicists, rolls his eyes to this film. Recently, he criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretation of quantum theory. This film does the same thing as these fools. <br /> <br /> Skeptico has an excellent review of this film. I recommend to anyone who wants to watch this movie, first read it , etc waiting to contribute to cult chests. <br /> <br /> http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed here one reviewer in IMDb is told to take this film with the grain Salt: It will take enough salt to kill a horse to get through the reflections on this film.
