this is the result. A piece of trash film that doesnâ€™t deserve to be even classified as a film is just a bunch of material on a film strip that makes no sense. Let us return to the actors, who from the very beginning seem to be just a group of friends who thought they would collect some money and try to make a film that would be a great horror movie. Well, in any case, it's terrible, despite the fact that this is a movie. In Hobgoblins there are a lot of terrible actions, but the worst of all is the main guy named Richard, who is too weak to even cheer on him. Well, when you get a bunch of friends and try to make a movie scary, with a smaller budget, no less, that's what happens. Oh well, at least the MST3K version was fun. But this is still a terrible film that deserves all the blows. 9 for the MST version.
