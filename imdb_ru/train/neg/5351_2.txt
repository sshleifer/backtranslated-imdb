If you liked the first two films, then I'm sorry, but you will not like this movie. This is really rubbish and unnecessary live video, probably a sequel made by television. Still idiotic, but good scientist Wayne Salinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family, and he has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of the statue, Wayne is so stupid that she squeezes her statue and herself with his brother. Then he squeezes his wife and daughter-in-law too. Now adults have to find a way to make the children at home make them bigger. Much of the repetition of the other two with only one or two new things, for example, a roller coaster, swimming in a toy car, etc. Pretty poor!
