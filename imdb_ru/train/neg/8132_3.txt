Indeed, the use of a documentary on the nature of swarming bats used by THE BAT PEOPLE is one of the most effective in history. There are snapshots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves, swarming bats flying from caves or circling around the mouths of caves. This alone is enough to disturb: Imagine how they all swarm after you? And they really swarm in what was supposed to be a show stopper that happened in about forty minutes, a completely unacceptably fun episode when a swarming swarm of bats seems to attack the police car, splashing on the windshield like bloody broken eggs, Problem that this sequence occurs about fifty minutes later in order to save the film, most of which consist of one or more people running around, screaming, waving their hands, talking excitedly about some poor muddle The new ball, which managed to bite a bat during his vacation. <br /> <br /> The fear is that he suffers from rabies, which really sucks, so their holidays are ruined because the plot synopsis at the top of the THE BAT PEOPLE reference page really points out. So, here is an effective summary of the film: a young couple goes on a romantic journey that collapses when the guy is bitten by a bat. They are bravely trying to wrest it, but he begins to wander, trying to convince others that it is a little harder than rabies, that he cannot control himself, and they all have to unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Now that someone is foaming in the mouth, covered in sweat, eyes are bordered like one of the cheaper dolls, and shout at you to get away from me, you leave him. You are not trying to give him drugs, you are not trying to tell him that you love him, you give the guy his place, go home and try this picturesque vacation next year. <br /> <br /> But not all the people in this film behave like idiots, insist on pushing the guy to his edge, and he flies out, mutates into a creature, half bat, and kills a group of minor secondary characters. There is nothing wrong with this, but the film forgets that this is a low-budget feature of creatures, and is trying to become a kind of psychological research. Instead of a monster film around us, a lot of people are running around trying to get this guy to take a cold pill, and eventually he runs off into the hills, looking much more humane than he should have been, people insist on pursuing him. and pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main thing that happened to the film was that it had to happen in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty peaks, and the film had to tell about the guy he had turned into a bat man, and not about traveling there. It takes a good eighty minutes to truly gain momentum on this front, with some interesting sketches of characters along the way, involving always interesting Michael Pataki as a small city policeman who lost moral superiority, and the late Paul Karr as a friend-doctor who isnâ€™t quite understandable. <br /> <br /> The film is terribly boring, about fifteen minutes too long and missing the opportunity to become a cute, memorable little creature, a running mutant, similar to the Italian horror favorite RATMAN, which I watched today, and, unfortunately, was inspired to try this is after watching. I and my brilliant ideas, although the scene with a police car was screaming: it is a pity that we would not have another twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> 3/10
