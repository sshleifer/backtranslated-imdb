The plot: a couple in love decides to participate in a luxury car. Then they are (literally) stuck in a compromise position, while the car wanders aimlessly around the countryside until the authorities save the poor couple. <br /> <br /> That's it. This is the whole movie. Perhaps there was some kind of dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. By now, it should be obvious that this film is not only meaningless, but in fact it is physically painful to watch. The fact that two of the best and most promising UK actors were filmed in it (one of which is now, unfortunately, dead) only adds to the horror. <br /> <br /> Ian Charles was outstanding in a very well-deserved Oscar winning "Chariots of Fire". Let's remember him for this role and try to pretend that this particular celluloid abomination never happened.
