I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is, without a doubt, one of the greatest actors of all time, but what was he thinking about when filming this movie. Usually, if he makes a bad film, I can blame the screenwriter or director, but in this case, it's all him. The suckiness of this film is his fault. This proves that even Heston cannot make Shakespeare's story interesting. I spent 2 and a half hours of my life on this slumbering festival, and I will never return this time. This is by far the worst Heston film I've ever seen. If you are a fan of Shakespeare, you may find this film interesting, but if you donâ€™t waste your time, you will eventually regret it.
