It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of throwing! I swear the audience (half full) laughed TWICE for 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was too cruel to believe. <br /> <br /> Cusack was fine. Fine. I felt sorry for him (the actor) in case people remembered this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as she always was. Charming and cute, but without a goal. The "novel" with John was absolutely incredible.
