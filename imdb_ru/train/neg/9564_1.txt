Some people seem to think that it was the worst movie they have ever seen, and I understand where they are coming from, but I did see the worst. <br /> <br /> As the saying goes, films that I can remember (that is, those that I did not block) that were worse than this were so bad that they physically hurt all the feelings associated with watching a movie. Movies that are worse than War Games 2 are those that make you knock your eyes out or strike a sharp object in your ears to prevent another part of your soul from falling from you in horror. > <br /> War Games: Dead Code is not so bad, but it's pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but no, I did not expect miracles from it. Let's face it, the original was not a really good movie, it was just a teenage romance of the 80s, with some kind of sillyness. <br /> <br /> This is all I hoped for, something bad, but it could pull me by the strings. Was it too much to ask? Is it really impossible to achieve greater success than in the original war games, even for the release of the video? Well, obviously, it was too much to ask. Stay away from this movie. At first, it's just bad, like, “Oh yes, this is bad, but I like it, maybe the end will be good, like in the original.” And then it gets worse and worse, and by the end, believe me, you will regret not seeing this movie.
