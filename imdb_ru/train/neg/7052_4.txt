God, this film was so boring, except for the music that I really loved, I mean, what's the point of making this film, please, the one who reads this review, does not watch this film, it is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can act, but he was really pretentious. In this film, I am really ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this film, it was just very bad. <br /> <br /> Selina is just another pretty face without any lack of talent, she cannot play at all, and there was no point in being in this film, since sheâ€™s with another girl Radha I was fine, I think, but it could be better. <br /> <br /> what a waste of time. Please buy great music and don't watch this movie.
