What a stinker it turned out !!! At one time, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - not a very cool actress, but very beautiful and pleasant (especially in such films as "The Sign of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand"), but when I saw this monster, the memories of her golden days quickly disappeared. The story is incredible and farcical, the second-rate cast, the cast is unbearable. I can't think of someone being more immature than the Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray should have been the most boring lead man they could choose. To this was added a terrible picture (and I mean not only color!) Everyone who was associated with this had to shudder whenever it was shown.
