I stayed for one night and it became very boring for me around 2:00 in the morning, so I was aimlessly flipping through the channels and came across H.O. where this "classic" played. Initially, I was happy that I caught something at the beginning, but my happiness disappeared after about two minutes in the film. The entire film was about an unattractive man who feared women, four beautiful but empty women who worked as waitresses at his uncleâ€™s diner, and his extremely fat and extremely unhappy cousin, who also works at a diner. There are a few strange turns in this film that make it somewhat interesting, but definitely not worth watching. Basically, if you have nothing to do at night or just can't sleep, medications work much better. However, guys, there is a lot of skin, so it can be normal to look without sound, but even this can be annoying
