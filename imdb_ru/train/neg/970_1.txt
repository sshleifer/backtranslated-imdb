I am usually not one of those who are afraid of horror films, but this film is an exception. somehow this film hit my head !!! This is a very simple film, but at the same time extremely effective, with a great atmosphere, and this leads to some shocking moments when the girls' father comes down from the mountain, this is a real outstanding player. Another seen was a family photo, which I did not expect, and I jumped out of my seat !!! I would recommend everyone to watch this movie, with the lights off, it will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
