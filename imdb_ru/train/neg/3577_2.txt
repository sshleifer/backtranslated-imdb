This early car "Pia Zadora" followed the familiar formula of Harold Robbins: the ambitious protagonist falls into decay, following the path to the top of some randomly chosen but charming world, in this case the film industry. But, despite the fact that this film is so predictable that it is completely predictable, at the same time it turns out to be absolutely incredible. Zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress means to be charitable) never convinces as a screenwriter. One would expect that a film about making films would have some insight into its own industry and creative process. But the script does not give her any of the qualities that make writers interesting characters in the film: compliance, ability to speak, love-hate with their own creative abilities. Her character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here. The cinematography is so dark that it is sometimes difficult to see what is happening. And the scenes never really meet, so everything seems random at the bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
