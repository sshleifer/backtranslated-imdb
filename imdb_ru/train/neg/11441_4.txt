After the promising first 25 minutes that make you feel warm inside, you are pretty sure it will be a great romantic comedy. Then the film gets worse. <br /> <br /> A warm feeling may still be present, but as others have said: the plot becomes so incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to look at it. <br /> <br /> The film is accelerating, and you have the impression that you are either rewinding it forward, or that the producers decided to place it in less than 1 hour and 40 meters, and he had to cut out many scenes. . <br /> <br /> Realism is not an end in itself, but as a spectator Iâ€™m quite convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic, it just happens. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film has a couple of nice interiors, and, despite the bad script, I think that the actors' performances are mostly good. If I could only rate the first 25 minutes, I would give eight. Like now, he gets four. ... and that's great! <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of romantic comedies, you still have a great time. If not, I would recommend that you look for something else.
