This movie is bad. If you think about watching it, there’s only one decent scene in the film, and it lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway’s topless scene). The rest of the movie is terrible. I think school plays are probably better at playing. The plot does not make sense at all. The set was pretty lame, and it was not even a good laugh. It was just boring and very, very bad! I looked at Starz, so I thought it should be at least decent. The mini-description sounded like everything was in order. A friend kills herself, apparently for no reason at the beginning of the movie, after you need to watch some awful music video. The transitions between scenes are VERY sharp, and as if someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transfer them. Just cut from one scene to another, without smoothness. It seems like my random switch from talking about how bad the film is, to explaining why the plot sucks. The sound in some places becomes weak, where you can barely hear it, and then it becomes loud when merry "terrible screams" appear in random moments in the film. It is the same sound every time. This is now officially the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Storyline: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> Lame-meter: 1,000,000/10
