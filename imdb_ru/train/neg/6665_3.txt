Well, the story - a psycho with a simple mind enters the life of a young nestling bored to death and her younger brother and sows chaos in their lives - quite interesting. In any case, ideas are nothing (everyone has something ...) - execution is all. <br /> <br /> This is what bothered me with this click. And it really bothered me. The rhythm (directing, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the expected climax. We've seen these damn highways five, six, seven times — why? The problems of the character of Norton were considered as a child's play, not deep enough to understand his problems / soul / bla and support him or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator, or just a psycho? References to Taxi Driver were ridiculous and unnecessary, and certainly not in favor of this film (or E.N. in this regard). <br /> <br /> And IMHO, this is a cowardly execution at the end. Cheap emotional tricks for teen lovers somewhere in Central America. This guy had to kill the child, blame the father, create real chaos. Or the child should have killed the father at the end, and so on. D. But no, we got a stupid end, when the children miss the psycho, the father is puzzled by his own life and relationship with them, and the psycho, of course, dies. A happy dysfunctional family remains unharmed, safe, and again happily bored, so that we can safely enjoy our pop roots. <br /> <br /> And the scene where the psycho comes to the movies, oh God, I would have to think long and hard to find something sillier than that! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and a hidden team. The creators of this film probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you're a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas, nowhere or somewhere else, and dream of having sex with a crazy man twice your age, well, then you might like this movie and its “message”.
