Yes, Marie Dresler drinks prune juice, which, in her opinion, is poison, and she runs. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea, but she is a solid performer who certainly holds the screen. <br /> <br /> I watched this for Polly Moran, whom I saw elsewhere. Here, Moran is all right - just fine - like a shrewd friend / enemy of Dressler. It is a pity that she is almost completely obscene. <br /> <br /> The plot is good. The bad guys are trying to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs, and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m curious about the central conspiracy mechanism: connections. This happened during the Depression, so perhaps everyone was familiar with the bonds and what they can do if they are used correctly and if they are used incorrectly. I, however, not of that era, vaguely familiar with them. They are like stocks, just different, right? It seems strange to build a story about the Little Man around some complex monetary entity.
