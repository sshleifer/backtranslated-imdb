Stupid, thoughtless chatter about an airplane assembled for hours by mechanics who never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chasing a Porsche racing car running on a ten-year-old gasoline slurry, driven by Lee Majors, with Chris Mikips as a fleeing techno - someone who can stock up on McGyver spare parts in a radio receiver that can pick up all the frequencies at the same time, and someone has learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make explosives in overshenno peaceful society. As moronic as it sounds. Burgess Meredith is a terrible waste, but Chris Miquip, at least, can be forgiven on the grounds that it was only his second film.
