In this boring, unremarkable action movie, stars Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL) play the role of Geronimo’s deputy, a fat, talkative guy who sits in a stupid-looking cowboy costume, listening to country music and eating too many donuts. Meanwhile, a vaguely criminal guy named Palermo (played by the guy who owned the exercise at the Gates of Hell, Fulci) stumbles upon Joe Don's territory and shoots the sheriff in a badly edited scene. Joe Don - slowly - pursues and kills Brother Palermo after uttering his now legendary catchphrase: “This is your turn. Think you can pick me up? Well, go on. ” For some reason, Texas lawyer Joe Don must transport Palermo to Italy (“Mr. Palermo was the main source of embarrassment for the Italian government,” says Mr. Wilson, another vague character played by Bill McKinney, who played MASTER NINJA 1 , SHE FRIK, and many good films about Clint Eastwood). <br /> <br /> In any case, Joe Dona’s plane should land on the island of Malta, where Palermo escapes with a briefcase and a guy who looks like John Lovitz. And that's where the movie stops. In the rest of the film, Joe Don is looking for Palermo, losing Palermo, falling into a prison cell, the Malta Chief of Police shouts at him, and then released with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. Then Joe Don continues to search for Palermo, loses Palermo, gets into a prison cell, the Malta Chief of Police shouts at him, and then he is released with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. Then Joe Don searches for Palermo, loses Palermo, gets into a prison cell, the Malta police chief yells at him, and then he is released with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. This is one aggravating film. <br /> <br /> At some point, Joe Don is considered dead at sea. All other characters wonder if he is dead or not, eventually concluding that he is dead. But then he shows up (a poor family saved him), and no one mentions the fact that he went missing at sea for several days. Even his pretty girlfriend Julia Louise-Dreyfuss-esque does not welcome his return. However, she offers to help him find Palermo, so Joe Don is looking for Palermo, loses Palermo, gets into a prison cell, the Malta Chief of Police shouts at him, and then lets go with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. <br /> <br /> Among the main events are a strange carnival with strange colorful floats, sexy strippers, a shootout with a child dressed as Napoleon, and a cart with tomatoes, a chase scene with a guy dressed as a monk, and any scene without Joe Dona. Low points include Jo Don Don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this is from Graydon Clark, director of ANGEL'S REVENGE, who acts as a sheriff. Ik! <br /> <br />
