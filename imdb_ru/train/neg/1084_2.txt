I rented this DVD for two reasons. The cast of great actors and director, although Robert Altman can hit or miss. In this case, it was a big miss. Altman's attempt to create indecision fell on his keester. After watching Kenneth Brann in such a good film as Dead Again, I did not think he could contribute to such a turkey, and I hope that this did not destroy his reputation. Robert Duval seems to be in the way of most of the former Oscar winners. In a downward spiral, which includes participation in films about food money, such as this. Duval was once a great actor in great films, although his best performance was not “Gentle Graces”, but “Great Santini”. This film was a real waste of time. I give it 2 out of 10.
