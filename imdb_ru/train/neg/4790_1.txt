I hated this movie. The original Phantasm possessed such a wonderful atmosphere and mystery. Like many 70s horror films, it looked and felt like some kind of creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80s, pumped up the action, but maintained this pleasant attention to mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is just awful. This tediously explains all the strange events in previous films that reduce rather than expand their capabilities. This shamelessly worsens the images from the first Ghost, as a cheap reconstruction of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this film that they look more like domestic pests than threatening death balloons. Hundreds of people hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in a draft. Really no one - the head of the winery, DP, editor, director - did not notice or did not make sure that they looked so sluggish? Even worse, the Phantasm III represents one trite, unfunny joke after another. How different is the intensity of the first movie. The original Phantasm used humor to weaken its inexorable attention to death. Phantasm III uses death to create countless cheap jokes about Reggie's arousal: some refer to the film's “flying balls”, haha, oh, I get it, the balls. Perhaps the team enjoyed these jokes, but they are on us.
