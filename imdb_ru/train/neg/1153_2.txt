Frustrating and annoying. The writer does not have a true understanding of human nature, but instead connects the clich√© in a fragmented manner. Character not studied in depth. These are puppets, plotted in a plot, in which he openly confesses that they need a dramatic element - the affair of a mother with her daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Ann Reed does an excellent job with her job, despite the fact that she is given some specific situations and lines, such as a passive position that allows her evil daughter to hit her eyes. The script portrays Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde, without a hint of why, except that he is sniffing cocaine in front of the big stage. <br /> <br /> A mature writer could do a lot more with this topic.
