Celia Johnson is good as a nurse. Michael Hordern is as good as the Capulets, although he usually laughs and laughs, and not on his king Lear. John O'Conor reads this verse well, as does the monarch Lawrence, although he never perceives it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good in the role of Tybalt in the first roles of "uk", which will make him famous. Benvolio Christopher Strawley is very cute. <br /> <br /> The sets are beautiful, if not stunning, as in some other BBC Shakespearean TV shows. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The rest is from weak to terrible. Rebecca Sair was 15 when she was filming, and she has no idea how to deal with Juliet - she opens her eyes wide and whines every line in exactly the same way. Patrick Raikart does not suit her well, and his self-esteem is inexplicable. Balcony scene flows smoothly and without incident with zero emotional or erotic impact. Their death comes as a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered it to them a few hours earlier. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews cannot be expressed as Mercutio, and this is very shocking if you recall his excellent work in “Return to Brideshead”. He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand pieces of two or three words each, and then shouts out fragments in as disconnected and indiscriminate manner as possible. In this production Queen Mab abdicates the throne. Awful. <br /> <br /> Directed by Alvin Rakoff shows only a random gift - put the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening scuffle is especially disjointed. However, in the subsequent fight there is humor, apparently, Romeo is kneeling by Tybalt right in the shoemakers. Then Tybalt grabs the offended area. However, it passed? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long game. This version is not recommended for use in class, or much more.
