Art House Maven Dream. Overvalued, overvalued, overdone; the pretentious melange, which not only did not deserve the “Best Picture of 1951” by its own merits, but was also obscured by competition from the very beginning. “Place in the Sun”, “Detective Story”, “A Streetcar Named by Desiree”, “Abbott” and “Costello”, “Meet the Invisible Man”; You call it, if it came out in 51, it's better than this Arthouse shit. The final ballet is a biting sound for an intellectual crowd, inappropriate and not in that film. Few actors at one time were less capable (acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My number 12 is the worst of 51 (I've seen 201 films), and among the 5 worst Oscar winners for the best picture.
