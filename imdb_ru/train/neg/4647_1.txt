Half of the reviews were good, so I took a chance for $ 10. Of course, Priscilla Barnes talked a little about sex, but it was a little. Later, the whole plot that she may be another mother of the actress, and the creator of documentaries in love with a young woman, stretches her. This is not funny, not that obscene, not so much, except for a waste of time. Boogie Nights were based on real people who worked in the adult industry, and this is based on what never happened in the industry. It might shock the fact that itâ€™s popular today in adult films, mocking today's video about gonzo, and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot, what a joke - a big orgy was done more and better than a decade ago at the beginning 1970s.
