This typically melodramatic Bollywood film inexplicably became a favorite of Western critics. The script is ridiculous, acting is excessive, and it looks trashy. The only reasons to watch this soap opera are the wonderful songs performed by Mangeshkar and the curtain of the legendary Mina Kumari. Watching an actress who fell ill during filming and drank herself to death at the age of 40 shortly after the film was released is as admirable as watching a train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and supervised, but he lacks the competence to perform any task well. Bollywood has released much better films.
