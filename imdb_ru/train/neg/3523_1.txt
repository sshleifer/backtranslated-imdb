Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Look in the lead role with Sylvester Stallone - this should have been enough, and there are too many scenes of rock-climbing, dizziness, falling and chewing the scene and spoiled aerial robbery. There are two sites, both lame. One is associated with a traumatic unsuccessful rescue operation, and the other with bad people who crash a plane for the sake of prey and kill various harmless people when it is possible. Usually, the reliable John Lithgow, perhaps dejected by the sheer horror of the product, comes down to ridicule and calls those who are indifferent to him, “Bostid!” In the dim approximation of English accent. Janine Turner, who was cheerful and mysterious when she played Maggie on the Northern Impact, unfortunately, is lost in the role of a rescuer and pilot. Stallone is firm and muscular. No immortal lines in this. No living lines, either.
