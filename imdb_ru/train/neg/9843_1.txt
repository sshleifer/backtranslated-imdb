This is only a Robert De Niro film that I really hate. This is a stupid film with a terrible acting game (of course, not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma should make his own mafia films, as always, like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also liked De Palma's Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro also worked with Palm two times: “Greetings” and “Wedding”. I thought the Wedding was also fine (I did not watch Hi). <br /> <br /> The script is really bad and unfunny. There is not a single scene where I could smile at least once. The film lost the chance to become a funny style even a little bit in the scene "Be Black baby", and also I don’t like the scene where the guy's sexy organ appeared. So this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! just the worst I hate it.
