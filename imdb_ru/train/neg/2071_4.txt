I had two reasons to watch this scam when it was broadcast yesterday on Danish television. First of all, I wanted to see Gene Lollobrigida - and here I was not disappointed. She looked great. Secondly, after reading about the film, I got the impression that it depicted an absurd humor, similar to the one that can be found in the films of Philippe de Broca. However, in this regard, I was disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (except for a few witty remarks about the war) and the characters are completely one-dimensional. In addition, the battle scenes were made in a strange mechanical and uninspired way, with no sense of drama at all. I continued to look until the end, but I quickly became bored, and I just sat there, waiting for scenes with Lollobrigida.
