I had high hopes for this indie, after reviewing a lot of good reviews. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here are my additional “two cents” to the already published, excellent “lost in translation” review. Premise: Morgan is “stuck” in a dusty little town where he meets the beautiful Scarlet, who works at a local supermarket. Can Morgan help lift the cute Scarlet from her life in a trailer? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? NOT. How about those shopping at Target. First, Freeman looks at the goal of the goal, as if he had entered Harrods. Then he is shocked at the stand with a T-shirt, confirming that he has never been to any store that has been visited by beautiful Scarlet. Morgan is suspended from all aspects of Scarlet’s reality and portrayed as joyful in her ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet’s life. <br /> <br /> One reviewer enjoyed the scene of the battle of Scarlet and her ex-husband, where her survival, the car in this case, requires her to physically attack her ex-husband. Does Freeman run in her defense ... no ... he shrinks from disbelief and is completely unable to cope with such a blunt aspect of her very real, pitiful fate in life. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character believes that a car wash and a new, very revealing, tight blouse is the key to Scarlet's interview. Another sign that Freeman is dishonest. Freeman's endless “stage talk”, where all aspects of Scarlet’s reality come down to one stage or another associated with Freeman’s experience, was annoying. <br /> <br /> Freeman is right when she emphasizes that Scarlet is young, her future is ahead, and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces: uneducated, white collar workers with no skills and experience, VERY POOR, without family support and lifelong low self-esteem. Scarlet draws such lessons from Freeman's life: some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt, and an outright blouse can open the door instead of a lack of education and skills in white collars. In the end, Freeman offers Scarlet little more than a strange entertainment with a "star", without even paying for gas for the night of Scarlet's death, and will return to her unchanging life in a city whose name Freeman does not want to know.
