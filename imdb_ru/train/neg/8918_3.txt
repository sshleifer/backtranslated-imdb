... fortunately, not yet! This is a rough, simplified student policy, turned into a drama. This is needed by the viewer to buy in the vanity series. Idea 1: that the British electorate can be rotated from being mostly right from the center to the vast majority of the left. Concept 2: that all debates in the media and the general public are unanimously stopped and that the only critics of the new prime minister are sinister government officials, MI5, big business and the Americans (of course). Concept 3: that this radical socialist prime minister can solve all trade union, economic and social problems with complete ease, uniting the nation. Concept 4: Breaking all ties with the United States and NATO is good. Idea 5: that the Soviet Union is not a cruel and repressive regime and that we should have closer times with them in the 80s. And finally, Conceit 6: the reactionary forces of the United States will actively seek to launch a coup d'Ã©tat against Britain. <br /> <br /> This is ridiculous, and the show has received only a reputation, trying to cash money. in some anti-Thatcher feeling in the country and leaving the critics of the TV wing to sing his praises. When this was done, television was still an extremely popular and influential medium with shows receiving huge ratings, so the widely discussed drama with a hint of argument had a good chance to get a large audience. Speech by Ray McInally was great, which is one of the few advantages. History and time have shown tremendous weakness in the premise and plot of this show.
