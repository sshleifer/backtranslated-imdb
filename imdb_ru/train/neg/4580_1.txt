I'm still trying to decide if this is really the worst movie I've ever seen. A very disturbing problem with this film is that they are interviewing real scientists, but their shots are edited to look like they support the many BSers ideas that inhabit this film. BS's attitude to the interview signal is about ten thousand to one - at the end, the interviewees seem to say: “We want you to think!”, But they themselves are too lazy to do a simple study about the things they claim to be a fact. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you are open-minded and want to expand your consciousness, please be open-minded enough to read some relevant books on quantum theory: “Einstein’s Universe”, Nigel Calder (small volume, not a challenge ), "Space Code", Heinz Pagels. If you cannot bring yourself to read a book, do not complain to the reviewers that they are “unbiased." <br /> <br /> Recall that this film is just incredibly bad. <br /> <Do you know what a really good film is that calls into question the nature of reality? Thirteenth Floor, directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'Onofrio. Smart, sexy, thought-provoking.
