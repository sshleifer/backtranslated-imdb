Who in their right mind is doing something as stupid as this movie? <br /> <br /> The accidental killing of a guard ... characters who are so two-dimensional that a two-year-old child could draw them ... and better ... <br /> <br /> A red box with instruments of death? Please .... <br /> <br /> Hypothermic weak thugs ... <br /> <br /> Acting from hell ... <br /> <br /> This film switches stylistically between teen comedy and thriller . , voyeurism and ... woman ... (hm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Incredible, and an insult to any thinking person. Do not look, go, it is worse than you can imagine ... <br /> <br /> And on top of that, he is trying to be fashionable, showing excessive graphicism in his violence ... <br /> <br / > Mrs. Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, it's just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
