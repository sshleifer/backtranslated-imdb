You want to watch the movie "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not the movie. This film is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All the good comments here are written by (badly disguised) fake third parties. The people who made this film seem to be trying to synthesize fake interest. <br /> <br /> This film is not a very good example. Comparisons with Spinal Tap or Christopher Guest are offensive. <br /> <br /> The film is so vile that I cannot imagine anyone who is familiar with the object that finds it ridiculous. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are fooled in this way, you will have to hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive because of its great satire of forbidden themes, but because of its constant pitiful banality.
