Honey, I cut the Kids franchise, it was a huge deal, and not to mention a very famous one. I loved Honey, I reduced Kids when I was little. It was an original story with such an exciting plot! The sets were so amazing, and the actors seemed to enjoy each other's company. Honey, I blew that guy was pretty stupid, so I think they would like to go back to the story everyone loved. <br /> <br /> In fact, Adam is now a little older, and moms are going. on vacation leave your husbands with their children. But when Wayne's favorite subject is threatened with garbage, he wants to reduce it and save it, but he and his brother get in the way. But when the wives return after they forget to give the medicine to their son, they also get into the car, leaving the children alone in the house! <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid, but, as I said, it was just a family film that I think some might enjoy. Initially, “Honey, I squeezed the children” - the best, I think everyone can agree. The third film was not so bad, I would recommend this film, at least with Dear, I blew up the film “Kid”, it was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
