As usual, I went to watch this movie for AR Rahman. Otherwise, the film is no good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this film so that it would be successful. But, fortunately or unfortunately, the film failed. After that, he hit Chandramuhi. I look forward to his next coming, Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I have read another user's comment about Rajni. I found this interesting, since the user is also from TN. Rajni is one of the actors who, I think, acts from his heart, not from his mind. He is not a Methodist, like Kamal Hassan. I think we need to thank Rajni for his energy at his age. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I need to fill in 10 lines for this comment ... so I wish you good luck, Rajni ...... .....
