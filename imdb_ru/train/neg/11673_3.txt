First viewing 05/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): a rather unfortunate description of the accident on the Titanic - the first filmed version of this so loud event. The reproduction of the catastrophe is not bad, but the drama around it is sometimes stupid, does not work well and is too similar to a soap opera. The story is much the same as that of Oscar, except for the fact that we are shown how the team tried to hide the actual catastrophe that occurred before it was almost too late. Good only for nostalgic purposes and to feel what James Cameron struggled with (hardly?) In his rest.
