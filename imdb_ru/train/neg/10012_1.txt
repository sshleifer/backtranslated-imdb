This film should be in line for the most boring film in recent years. Even Woody Harrison cannot save this film from sinking to the bottom. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that the murder in this film will be of interest in this film, but it is not, nothing is of any interest. The actors are not bad, but the script is just awful, I just sat there in complete amazement during this movie, thinking how the hell this movie might seem interesting to someone <br /> <br /> They made a boring movie, but they hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this film and they will think Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Defoe should be fine, and rent this movie. If you like being ripped off, rent this movie, some people really enjoyed the movie, but I like to watch the movie with meaning.
