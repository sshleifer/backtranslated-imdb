Sorry, did I miss something? did i leave early The first ten minutes of unusual (and improbable!) Stories made me think: “It will be a classic.” But from there everything was down! The acting was great, because William H. Macy is worth something fantastic, and with every movie I watch him, he gets better and better. But it never seemed like a binder. I was waiting for a big moment when all the stories are connected, and then suddenly ... is it raining a frog ?? it was if the author said: "I went deep into how I can skillfully put all these stories together ... Oh, my gosh, I will just have rain frogs." I love smart movies, I like weird movies, but it was just weird and boring. 4/10
