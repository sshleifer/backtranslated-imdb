Well, here we have another role-playing video. There were many notables, despite the weary plot of a sex change. However, this is not. In previous reviews, I think I expressed my opinion on a general decrease in the enjoyment of Haim films, which followed the end of the 80s. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> “Just One of the Girls” talks about a high school student (Corey Chaim) who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up a girl and attending another school. He joins the support team and befriends the supporting team, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can not continue in the same spirit. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was complete nonsense and it wasn’t even funny. But judging by the majority of reviews, it seems that fans of Alanis Morrisette or the teenage sex queen, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who would like to see this. If you need a good Chaim function (or a comedy about changing roles), look no further than in 1989. The point is that the career of Haim went into decline.
