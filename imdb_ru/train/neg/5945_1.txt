The black guy fights ..... and allegedly wins .... yes ... 1/10. Obviously fiction. <br /> <br /> So, we have a damn pretty headline, a very nice tag, and even a pretty storyline. That's it, that's all. this. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White is a black guy, so donâ€™t confuse him with a name .. portrays a black guy .. Hmm, that's all about the name .. <br /> <br /> So hard finding decent help must have hired black guys friends to help cause a low budget, low ineptitude of this film, camera shadow lags behind first scenes .... Yes, an obvious idiotic moment for an average guy like you and me .. but yes ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. Feedback sent. if you paid to watch this movie, you screwed up.
