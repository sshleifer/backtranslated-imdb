I watched it with a growing sense of anxiety. Why does God in the form of Ian Hunter help these particular people in their attempt to escape from the island of devils? And what did he do there in the first place? I mean, I know that God works in mysterious ways, but helping thieves, murderers and prostitutes to find redemption, forgiveness and heart changes in such a godsend place ... In any case, this is hardly a pretty film. Whatever Gable has because of the charm in this portrait of a completely selfish person, Crawford is just as attractive as ever, i. E. For me, not at all, and the whole look of the film creates the impression that it was made years ago. Compared to modern films such as Stagecoach and Mr. Deids Going to the City, this looks prehistoric.
