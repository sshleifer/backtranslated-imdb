I hoped that this film would be at least watchable. The plot was weak at least. I expected much more, given the cast of actors (I wonder, will any of them include this in their resumes?). At least I did not pay to rent it. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Ber, but the rest of the film is full and full of TROUSERS.
