The second attempt by the New York intellectual in less than 10 years to shoot a "Swedish" film, the first of which is Brother Karl by Susan Sontag (shot in Sweden with Swedish actors, no less!) Results? Oscar Wilde said this best of all, referring to Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop: “We need to have a heart of stone so as not to laugh out loud when Little Nell dies.” Almost the same here. "Interiors" are crowded with solemnly curled howlers. (“I’m afraid of my anger.” Looking at medium distances: “I don’t like who I’m becoming.”) The directive quotations (if you use the polite term) of Bergman are close to parody. An incredibly enthusiastic family constantly reminds us of how talented and talented they are, even strangling. ("I read your poem the other day. It was in — I don't know — a New Yorker.” “Oh. That was an old poem. I remade it.”) Not caring about these people, but I found them quite funny . Most of the dialogue is exactly like the funny things from Allen's earlier films - only he directed his actors to straight lines. By not starring in the film, he forced poor Mary Beth Hurt to copy all her pompous tics, intonations and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity). <br /> <br /> The main plot — a dysfunctional family with a calm, imperious mother — seems more or less to be filmed from Bergman's Winter Light, the main family melodrama burdened by a multitude of existential experiences. All this is manifested in worn-out visual / auditory tricks: deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, high surf, which overshadows people walking along the beach. and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Allen’s later “serious” films are less embarrassing, but much less interesting. I'll take the "Interiors". Woody rarely makes a funny movie.
