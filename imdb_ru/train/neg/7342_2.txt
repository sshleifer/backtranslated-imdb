The Man in the Attic is a film shot in the 1910s. This is inspired by the real story. Unfortunately, this story did not really need to be told. <br /> <br /> Looking at the box, the people responsible for packing the film tried their best to make this film look full and erotic. They use terms such as "illegal passion", "forbidden romance" and "unlimited pleasures." They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Dougie Houser, MD) holding a gun! <br /> <br /> In this story, Krista is played by Anne Archer. Unfortunately, she is married to a gentleman who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband’s company. Christa and Edward end up falling in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Allegedly, the “shocking” part of the film is this: Christa's husband finds out about this case and forbids them to see each other again. So what did they decide to do? Krista ends up with Edward living in their attic. Blimey! Krista ends up seeing someone else, and Edward becomes extremely jealous. And so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> “The man in the attic” does not apply to any new territory. This is the original Showtime film, which explains why the stars are a couple of B-list actors, and both appear briefly in a positive light. <br /> <br />
