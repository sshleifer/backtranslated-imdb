Her Cardboard Lover is Norma Shearer's latest movie. She quit the movie and, I think, joined MGM's board of directors. It was a good move on her part. "Her lover of cardboard" was chatty and boring in parts. It was obvious that there were only a few actors with protruding parts, so they had many dialogues to keep this turkey afloat. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea that a rich woman (Norma Shearer) hires a man (Robert Taylor) to make her playboy bride (George Sanders) jealous. I’m surprised that director George Cukor didn’t shoot many conversations between Miss Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Tsukor has served Miss Shearer well in the film “Women,” but not in this film. <br /> <br /> Robert Taylor gave the best performance in the film. During Mr. Taylor’s career, he received his best comedic roles in this film and the film “When Ladies Meet” in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy work in the film “Her Lover of Cardboard” and, until that time, his best dramatic performance. in "johnny eager". He had a busy year. I think about all the MGM actors, Mr. Taylor has worked with all the major and minor actresses. In addition, MGM gave Mr. Taylor all the types of films that could be made - most of them were successful. That is why MGM held it for 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good as a social heel. He played a similar role eight years later in "All About Eve", for which he received an Oscar for his supporting role. As for Miss Shearer, it was one of her worst performances, she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. It is strange that she shot a wonderful comedy "Women" in 1939 and gave her the best performance. It was obvious that she was too old, looking for her younger leading men in the film “Her Lover of Cardboard”. Moreover, it did not help that some of her clothes were terrible. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that she and Mr. Taylor have not made another dramatic film, like their last film, the excellent Escape. The same comments about this film can be said about another film “Personal Property”, which Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too talkative, boring, and the actress looked old. Miss Harlow looked sick throughout the film, and no one in Hollywood noticed that she told the doctor, so in 1937 she died at 26 years old. What a waste! She became a good actress and got the best roles.
