Wow ... pure brilliance. <br /> <br /> Turning a thriller / suspense / horror into a comedy. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I never laughed at a horror movie before ... a funny plot with 3 characters that were simply crazily designed - either not written in detail, or too deep. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch an absolutely horror film with a silly dialogue, a confusing plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and lousy development in general, then this is something to watch. <br /> <br /> Be sure to focus on the classic scene of the "food processor" and the totally inept scenes of a police investigation. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful new low level of screen performance and writing, and if you sit on it all the time, you will be stupid, brave or bold.
