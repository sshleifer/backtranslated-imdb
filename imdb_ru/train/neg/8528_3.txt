The poster says: "At birth, he was given 6 years to live ... At 34, he goes on a journey of a lifetime." Ami is an Israeli of American origin who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy disease at the age of one. At 34, after his love for his 22-year-old caregiver did not come true, he decided to come to the US to meet with a doctor who said that he had only 6 years left to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he was still alive, and weighs 39 pounds. What for? Your guess is as good as mine, even I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it’s bold to live when all he can move is his left index finger, but why is he so angry with the doctor who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor had just told his mother that, based on his medical history, people with his illness would not live long. Why should he show up at the door of the old doctor? Why is tracking this old doctor in the USA a journey of his life? In Ami’s life, we can be interested in so many things: how can he make these animations with just one finger movement? How can he live his daily life completely dependent on others? How did he live the prediction of his doctor? How does he behave emotionally when other people look at him as a strange creature? The film did not tell us any of this. Instead, the director took the van and made a trip so that Ami appeared at the door of his old doctor to show him that he was still alive. I thought it was a joke.
