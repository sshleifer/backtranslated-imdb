I can not say that this film was terrible to say. All Chineseism is awakening in your being, because ancestors were hard to sell. But to tell the audience that every Chinese knows the history of China, even without studying it, is ridiculous. It is the same as saying that every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino, etc., D., etc. This is simply implausible. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely disgusting. It said that Shin was from a monastery in China, and later identified him from Beijing. However, early episodes of the film show a map focused on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas such as Mongolia for granted. But this is a separate nation, and it even marks "Mongolia" on the map. Did Disney Studio fail the 5th Variety Geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, and yet she somehow feels connected to him. Her training is also just dumb. And let's move on to the pursuit: everything in this film is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. In many cases, the taekwondo action was replayed and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The evil eye was trashy. However, the left end would be the only thing of descent in it. They had to leave evil eyes ending in this. But instead, evil is somehow defeated. Yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, it’s not worth the dog’s time in the film. Brenda Song should get along with another studio. "F"
