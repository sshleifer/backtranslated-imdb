A guy walks without a reason ... I will never return those two hours of my life. The guy continued to take on the person and cheated on his pregnant wife. What was I just thinking about? How did it win the price anywhere? I realized that he loved his father, but besides that the film was absolutely meaningless to me. That was the purpose of walking so much and going to the strangerâ€™s funeral for no apparent reason. How did this enrich his life ??? Why should we see a dying old woman in her underwear ???? !!! Why ??? ?? I do not recommend the film even leave while sleeping ...
