The former private security guard, who has gone into the eyes, quits his last buzzing job and immediately gets a chance to return to his former profession. His mission: to catch the mysterious Frenchwoman, recently arrived in California ... and clearly wanted by racketeers in suits and ties. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough stinging or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the script. Director and co-screenwriter Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the picture was edited without him) does not make the impression that he appreciates the films of the 40s, of which his Chandler was shot; his nostalgia, respectively, is crumpled, but at the same time bitter and somewhat indifferent. The processing is curious, commendably low-grade, and Warren Oates is as good as this version of the 70s in the “private member” archetype, but the film is no big deal. It's nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Graham in the cast - although none of them has anything in common, and the hot and cold running character of Caron is annoying everywhere. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stenswold, a great location for shooting, but it cannot lead to any boil. * 1/2 of ****
