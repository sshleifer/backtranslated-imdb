There are exactly 2 good words to say about “Fantasies” (both mentioned by the previous reviewer): <br /> <br /> a) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poet-inspiring beauty. She has the shots in this film, where she even defeats Catherine Zeta-Jones for her money, and this is a really big compliment. Her nudity is short and restrained, but just enough to look at her face. <br /> <br /> b) Sunset of the Greek island with its sun and crystal clear blue water. <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is terrible and sometimes unintentionally funny (“He touched you where you are a woman!”), and the character Peter Houten is a slimy moron. Bo overlaps the naivety of her character, but, again, when you have to work so badly with dialogues, it is dishonest to blame the actors (the fact that she continued to pronounce the name Damir in almost every sentence causes great irritation). Yes, and although the film was made on a Greek island, one can hardly hear a Greek word - obviously, everyone, from children to old people, speak English all the time. (*)
