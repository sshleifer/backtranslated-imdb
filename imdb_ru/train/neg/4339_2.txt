This film was not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this film were called something else, no one would even notice the difference between them. <br /> <br /> this is really strange, because I see no point. the prequel and the sequel allow you to simply say that it does not make sense, it does not even coincide. Maybe I'm naive, but not Volume 1 and Volume 2 are meant to be coincident. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in prison in the first and dies in the original, but in the prequel he lives and does not go to prison. <br /> <br /> The plot was fine, but they had to change around some of the actors and the plot, as well as the title of the film, and it would be a good film. <br /> <br /> I really expected it to end as the other began. <br /> <br /> If someone has an opinion on this post, please.
