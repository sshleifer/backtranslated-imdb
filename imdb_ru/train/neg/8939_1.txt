Yes, I saw the rough cuts. Unedited sex scenes. Scary scene. Almost on a par with the film "The Need" in a terrible acting game. This movie is as bad as the movies are. Bad script, bad game, bad effects, bad locations, bad stunts, bad things. The best "actors" in the film were the dancers on their knees, whom they hired as vampire extras! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, “the stupid actor,” as someone else said, makes a match look talented. His amazing ability to drive poorly when people are clearly shaking him on the hood (check the reflection on the windshield), his inability to turn left, which is class. OH and do not forget the sex scene. plus his remarkable use of a toy pistol, which the guys from the props did not even bother to disguise as a real weapon. The rest of the actors on the screen could hardly present their lines. As if half the time they were waiting for a line that was not there! <br /> <br /> “The special effects” were so good to the extent that the guys who did it took their real names from the captions! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party, then make this movie ... again, there are a lot of good comedies that are just as fun and don’t give money to people who don’t deserve it.
