I always liked Spike Lee movies, but this one was a waste of 2.5 hours. I expected more from Son Sam and instead received a film that seemed to have little to do with the 1977 serial murders. The talking dog was ludicrous (you know, you are in trouble when all the visitors of the film laugh out of place). The whole film seemed very fragmented and not very interesting. Sex scenes were completely irrelevant to the plot. I am not against sex in the cinema, but this should make some sense (unless it is a movie XXX). Overall, we were very disappointed with this Spike Lee effort !!
