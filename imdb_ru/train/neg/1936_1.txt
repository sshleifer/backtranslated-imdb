Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> When the main character’s sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer smashes a glass of vodka next to her to create the impression that she was drinking. But right before they kill her, she speaks on the phone of her sister’s business partner (Teri Garr) that she didn’t drink for 4 days. However, the police never mention the results of the toxicological report! And the characters say that she was drunk when she fell down the stairs. BUT? A really bad mistake in this film, which is generally pretty terrible. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad given the great cast. Some drawbacks: the writing is not very good, the music made for television is bad, and there is no tension, because we already know the answer to the riddle from the first scene in the film.
