I am very surprised by the positive comments, because four of us saw it at one show, and we all came out. We personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and we could not watch the whole movie. And we really tried to stick with that. In particular, those from the group who really wanted to get pleasure from it because of their personal experience of alienation about their sexual orientation during the school years didn’t like or identified themselves with him at all. :( <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it’s nice to see that this film really caused a response from many people here, on message boards and from reviewers. This is the beauty of the film’s subjective artistic form.
