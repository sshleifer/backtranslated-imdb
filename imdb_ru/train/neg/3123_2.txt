Felt while watching this movie ... but it seems that in this movie the reason for the madness in the family. In any case, it does not make much sense, as others have mentioned, it was one of the last films of Karloff, and only his presence on the screen gives him at least some credibility. It is sad that all the great horror film legends in the era of sound were ultimately turned into a major role in low-quality trash like this. By and large, Boris is slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi, but not by much. <br /> <br /> Boris tries his best and pays tribute to him for trying to rally this mess. Harsh background music does not help and distracts from any clear moment. In addition to Boris, the rest of the Mexican gypsum are duplicated in some strange, cropped, English monotonous, which resembles the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> I think that this is the “House of Usher” by Edgar Allen Poe, from which he was taken, but it will be difficult for you to find a lot of Poe in the finished article. <br /> <br /> However, there are much better films with Boris Karloff at his best, find them and think about them, if only you don’t want the curse of a “compressing brain”!
