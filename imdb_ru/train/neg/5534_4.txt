I am working on a horror movie collection "Classic 50", and "Zombie Rise" - one of the films in the set. I am watching them with my future seven-year-old daughter, which makes most of these films a wild laugh. <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for Zombie Rise after watching White Zombie, which really precedes such a value that is the mainstay of zombies in the movie (remember Clive Barker's Snake and Rainbow) and James Bond’s funeral scene “Live and let die”, NOT “Night of the Living Dead”). <br /> <br /> However, although the name includes the word “zombie”, this is just a love triangle in which anthropologist Armand Luke is involved, who is smitten by Claire Duval; who in turn is taken with his companion Clifford Grayson. What a yawn, my daughter fell asleep halfway. <br /> <br /> It was very difficult for me to understand for whom these people worked — allies or axes; but I think it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the role in this film; but, of course, these were his eyes (from the White Zombie), serving as a mind control device for the zombies.
