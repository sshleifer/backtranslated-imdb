I thought that in this film there is absolutely no moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fiancé left you on your wedding day for a cousin ??? I would be heartbroken !! It is classified as a comedy, but I did not find it funny at all. I thought it basically found a cheap laugh and took them. I usually love Julie Stiles films, but this is an exception. Jason Lee stars in another shameful show, which once again proves that class and decent morality are not relevant in modern society. He had a total lack of taste, and I despise such films. I understand that people will defend this film and its moral because it is “Just a film”, but I still hold the view that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you liked this film, you are a bad person, as everyone has the right to their own opinion, and parts of this film were pleasant, I just say that in real life people act like heroes of this film were shameful.
