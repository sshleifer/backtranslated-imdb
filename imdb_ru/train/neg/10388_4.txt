Due to reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this film seems to be badly cut, but I don't think it was THAT bad. Actually, I have seen much worse. <br /> <br /> “The home of evil” is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, Teda and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who are moving to an old house in Japan. Little did they know, the Japanese ninja brutally killed his wife and her lover, and then committed suicide 100 years ago with the help of a samurai sword. When strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous inhabitants begin to take possession of the bodies of the living and plan to reproduce the bloody murder that happened 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this film and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was common, and it was commonplace, but I saw worse in my time. The sequences of ghosts were a bit exaggerated, we see how translucent blue-colored figures randomly appear around the family and capture their bodies. Honestly, the ghosts in this film reminded me of ghosts during a trip to a haunted mansion in Disneyland. I may be mistaken, but after watching it, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of this film cut it off a bit. Old Japanese house, where there was a brutal murder, ghostly activity, curses on the house, etc. But I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this is a rather banal ghost story. Don't try your best to see it, but if you like these things, and it happens on TV, you can do it. 4/10.
