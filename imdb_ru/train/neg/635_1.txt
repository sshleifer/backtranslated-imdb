Louise Reiner won an Oscar for performing at Good Land. Unfortunately, her role was not required. She did not speak much and looked pale throughout the film. The character of Louise was a slave, and then given into marriage with the character Paul Mooney (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Recruitment in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Mooney won an Oscar for his performance, because it was for this that Louise must have received her Oscar. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to act. This is similar to what Hollywood does often. Al Pacino played Italian and Cuban. I felt that Louise's presentation was dull throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She remained the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion, maybe twice. If her brilliant game was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.
