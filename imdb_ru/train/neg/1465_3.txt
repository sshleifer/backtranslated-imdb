Well, first of all, I would like to add that I myself am in some way a historian, so what I'm looking for in a film based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Of course, the film is interesting, and everything, except the fact that it is not completely based on real facts, is more than annoying. Hitler was not an anti-Semite in his youth, he even worked for the Jews before the First World War. However, during the First World War, he formed his views on the Jews. His upbringing in this film is also inaccurate; Hitler was not a worried little boy as a child. He had more or less normal upbringing. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important things that complement Hitler's riddle. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlisle is a great actor, but he is not exactly suitable for the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he is, the portrait painter here. In his youth, he was a charismatic man who "manipulated" people with the help of his spell. His unstable behavior and outbursts of rage began at a turning point in the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about the life of Hitler, based on real historical facts, and not on charges. I really hate it when people point a blaming finger, for example, to Hitler and others, and tell inaccurate stories, just to paint their picture as pure evil. It is much better to tell the story EXACTLY how it was, so that everyone can find out how it was! Those behind this film should have done some research before doing so. Because it seems that they did not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot dead on a revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder was torn out of the nest. <br /> <br /> This gives you more opportunity to see a good documentary than to see it.
