I found it on the shelf while I sit and miss. How can people give it 10? This is not just a film about redemption, which seems to me pleasant to the touch (I think), because at this level it does not work either. Weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible game; Harvey Keitel has nothing decent there, but thereâ€™s nothing to work with, and Bridget Fonda and especially Jonathon Schach are just awful. The development of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) does not make sense. It seems that the authors wanted the plot to go a certain way, and made it, without actually writing down the necessary fragments, so that it would continue to flow. It's only an hour and a half, but it's 90 minutes of your life, you will never return.
