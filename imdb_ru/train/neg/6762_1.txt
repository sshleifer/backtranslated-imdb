This is the film that should embarrass everyone associated with it. Bad direction, excessive play and plot that rumbles without meaning, except to show violence. When I first saw it, I thought that it might be a media satire and how violence shows it, but it’s not. I'm not sure what makes a movie worse. Oliver Stone makes his worst direction. From scenes where Woody Harrelson’s face is changing for no reason, or the awful performance of Robert Downey Jr. as Wayne Gale, a reporter who looks completely crazy, this film is a mess.
