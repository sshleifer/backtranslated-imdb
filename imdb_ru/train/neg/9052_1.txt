I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, compared to the brilliant, fun, crazy and innovative classic of the 1970 Robert Altman films, this show probably was doomed to be less than mediocre ... even if it really lasted 11 years, it doesn't necessarily make it any good. This show was an integral part of my early childhood (it was on re-broadcasts every night, and I think whose parents watched it and laughed at it), but this is one of the memories I don’t miss. And now, when I really watched the movie, I can give accurate criticism of this series. In itself, this is not nearly “2 out of 10” bad. However, the characters in this show are not like the characters in the film. Some of them are technically the same, but similar only in name. For example, since when does Alan Alda look like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is completely different, as is his characterization and worldview. New characters are not so good; they just make you miss those they replace. Same with new actors (including Jamie Farrah). The only thing that is really transferred to the series is Radar, which until now (although it is played by the same actor) is just a pale imitation of the original. Something else? Oh yeah. With the laugh track (it didn't matter if it was used in surgical scenes or not), it looks like creepy, due to what happens in other conditions. And since it lasted almost four times longer than the real Korean war, it forces viewers to penetrate this strange time gap that does not work outside the world of cartoons. I never liked this show, and I never will.
