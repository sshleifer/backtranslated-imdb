American filmmakers have decided to make a film that they consider Japanese. All the characters are poorly represented, the actors are not even Japanese, but the set is cheap, unreal and definitely does not represent Kyoto in the early 20s and 30s. Anyone who has ever read a book, he understood that the authors of the script did not add any additional value to distinguish the film from the script. Worse, they even changed the original storyline with a few stupid things. Rob Marshall uses as his two main characters two famous Chinese actors who used to participate in a secret dragon. Marshall probably saw one Chinese film, and they represent Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together is even more funny for movies. Quentin Tarantino’s last scene in “Kill Bill # 1” is ten times more Japanese than in this film.
