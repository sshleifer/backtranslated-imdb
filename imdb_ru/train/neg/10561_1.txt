I saw this film in my time, when the birth of a child out of wedlock not only ruined your life, but also put your child on the bastard. These days, "single mothers" may seem far-fetched, but this was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at those who stutter. Between these two problems, it was hard for me to find this movie funny. At that time I didn’t know who led it or what an amazing reputation he had. I knew who Betty Hatton was and she just made me nervous because she was so insane. I liked the movie “Raising a Child”, but I find this film just awkward. I am sure that the blow at some church events was probably pierced, but I was the one who needed a drink after watching it again. The idea that the girl would have to drink to “get married” and get pregnant, only added suffering. Under such circumstances, the whole city can excite you, so the result of this film is really funny. Of course, shoot me, I don't like it either. "This is a wonderful life."
