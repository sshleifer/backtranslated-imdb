The cradle of fear <br /> <br /> This is not a film in which intricate subtle, subtle narrative nuances occupy our attention. This is not a movie in which the special effects are supposed to leave us slackers, uttering this wow feeling. What it is, although it is a piece of Lofigot horror, which does little to the imagination, created in the eyes of director Alex Chandon as “a return to the dirty 70s and the horrors of the 80s”. <br /> This is a very intuitive experience for 2 hours, when four plot lines are connected through a lot of watery blood, stacks of dismembered body parts and internal organs connected by intestinal revenge. <br /> <br /> The supplier of such terrible violence is Dani Filt, the lead singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth, performing the role he was destined to play. <br /> <br /> As others have said, there is nothing new in the desire to carry out occultist revenge. In this particular context, a convicted sexual predator and murderer, Kemper, the father of our devilish avenging angel, forces his son to exact punishment of those who are somehow connected with his conviction in purgatory in an insane asylum. <br /> What this gives Chandon, who should be congratulated on writing and editing this work, is the opportunity to free his sick mind. He seems to be enjoying the idea of ​​splashing blood into the holes of those on the screen and every nook and cranny that can be reached. We also turn to close-ups of skull destruction, demonic rape, and other diverse images in order to attract those who like to approach their horror. And for some of those who are closely watching films of this type, there is a strange sequence that can make you think: “I just saw what I thought I did,” because, of course, Pretty Woman is not like that. It reminds me of some bloody festivities created from Italian horror about 20-30 years ago, and a number of other works where the hideous images left their mark, but not the context in which they were viewed. <br /> The plot of the 4th set is especially intriguing when the idea of ​​possession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of online violence through the “Sick room” where the user controls how to extinguish life. Further recognition should also come to a drowning soundtrack that allows Filt to show his day talent, and the effective use of drum and bass, often overlooked by filmmaking as a viable form of visual effects support. Using the city of London as a background with real people, unlike film substitutes, also adds the feel of a movie commando. OK, the classics may not be, but the blood, guts, intestines, occultism and demons in a slightly perverted, problem-free form.
