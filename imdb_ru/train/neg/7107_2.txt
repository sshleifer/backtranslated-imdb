I'm sure there is some IMDB cult that loves movies that MST3K is mocking. After viewing this and the "Werewolf" and reading dozens of comments on how underestimated they are, I was convinced that there was some kind of conspiracy. Many people say that people who hate it are “scared only by blood”, “I don’t know a good horror” or the like. Well, I don’t care about blood, but I want SOMETHING to happen in a movie! Most of them are just a wife sitting and looking around! Or walk around the house / garden! The film requires something to give it an atmosphere; you will not get it just by having meaningless scenes where someone walks and watches. Oh, and makes you think? Yes, I thought: "MOVEMENT! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever had! <br /> <br /> P.s. For the record, I'm a big fan of the old-style horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, that sort of thing.
