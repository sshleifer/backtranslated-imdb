This film is not well maintained. Maybe it's just an effect and a tricky feature, acting and directing, which we saw with The Sopranos, but I just watched Prizzi's Honor for the first time on a single DVD. <br /> <br /> The experience of viewing with an audience 24 years ago must have been different, but I must say that I was just shocked in the final. Not only his violence, but simply the idea that somehow this would be a satisfactory end. <br /> <br /> I like a good shocker, but it didnâ€™t look out of character ... Also, when was this step to be installed? All the cars looked as if they were from the 1960s, and yet the towers of the World Trade Center {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many scenes of the cityscape. <br /> <br /> Another way of poor exposure is simply the idea that a passenger can travel along the coast with a knife across the face. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the mid-1980s viewers found this film charming and funny. Mid eighties, meet the late past: only you can live.
