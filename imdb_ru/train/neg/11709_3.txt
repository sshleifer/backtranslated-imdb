Have you heard how they say they live every moment, as if this is your last? Whether this is your last day or not, I ask you not to waste any part of it, watching it! Nichole Hiltz offers some pleasant moments for eye candies (which, alas, remain wrapped), and David DeLuise shows why he should stick to a small screen or ad for dog food. A small, unrealistic plot with a terrible dialogue means that there is no “Art” in “The Art of Revenge”. <br /> <br />
