A pair of farmers are fighting for life in a small village in China. Van Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lana, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Louis Rainer). American stars are starring, talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideologies. A good wife, a lot of children and the land are the best things for men. They are treated as property and investments. Since this is a big budget film, in which many additional characters work together, large sets are created and special effects take place, the filmmakers could not risk hiring less popular actors. Louise Rainer received an Oscar for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the film. Her unwavering face creates a barrier between her and the audience. It is assumed that O-Lan is the heart of the family and the best character you can sympathize with. On the other hand, Paul Mooney shows the best performance, again showing his talents. Another problem with the film is the final. It seems that Franklin did not know when to finish the picture. This film can be dangerous if taken as a true example of Chinese culture and tradition.
