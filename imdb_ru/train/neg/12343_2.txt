Oh brother The only reason this very annoying film avoids getting the whole “bomb” from me is that it is at least historically remarkable as the first film “Three purrs” (when they weren’t alone and still burdened this terribly unfunny Ted Healey) But even as a long-time Stooges fan, I would say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are not used well here as three crazy helpers for the cleaner Boss cleaner Mr. Healy. They do not appear in the film all the time, and their stupid episodes “from time to time” paint them more like crazy over-active cartoon characters who try too hard to be funny. <br /> <br /> Much of this toothache is associated with Jack Pearl, vainly seeking to get a little laugh from the audience, like a man who pretends to be Baron Munchausen (here’s a good example of the level of humor: “I object!” grounds? "" Coffee grounds! "). His girlfriend is none other than the young Jimmy Durant, but even the Schnock is a bore.
