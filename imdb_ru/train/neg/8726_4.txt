First of all, I want to say that this film is worth more than four stars, which I rated. I gave him four stars, because for me this 86-minute film always looks like 2 and a half hours and is not fun enough to go through all this. However, the Big River Alligators (so called my DVD) is better than your usual nature strikes back. <br /> <br /> The tourist resort in the jungle of Southeast Asia is just opening and locals work there. trying to manipulate wildlife around. Mother Nature, thirsting for revenge, comes in the form of the god Crohn, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing that tourists and protagonists should worry about (the photographer and the resort staff), the natives are also rubbing up incorrectly. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pretty well-made adventure / horrible story with good music and directing. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, clearly looks fake. Some close-ups of his jaws are nice, but that should be all we need to see. Some of the far underwater shots show painfully that we are dealing with a squeaky alligator leather toy that you can probably buy from the zoo's souvenir shop. But locals are believable if not authentic. <br /> <br /> This is probably not the movie that will give you nonstop thrills, if any, but shot and filmed well enough to give a good mention. And, as in many creature films, this film ends with an extremely large number of bodies. It also has a lot of nice jungle landscapes. Act lower though, but who expected it to be better, eh? <br /> <br /> Much better than his recent American counterpart, Primeival, but nothing compares to Jaws. But remember that this may not be fascinating in a few moments.
