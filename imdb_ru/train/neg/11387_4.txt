Medellin is a fantastic place to live, work and study. I have been there twice, and have never heard anything about guerrilla actions, paramilitary forces that have taken hostage tourists, or something like that. There is an “invisible police force,” but this is not the Big Brother system. There are enough policemen to be seen in everyday life, but they don’t disturb someone without good reason. <br /> <br /> “La Sierra” is an interesting documentary in which the young people whom he depicts in the film, in fact, become his characters. Film directors carefully line up the storyline among the daily activities of the residents of La Sierra, and when the “character” dies, real pathos emerge. It is hard to imagine, however, that all three young people are members of Blo Metro, the gang that terrorized La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is not an accurate description of life in Colombia; There are, of course, things to beware of, such as minor crimes, but when someone thinks that the theft occurs in “modern” cities such as London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia does not seem to be that different. Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show the world that the country once at war has flourished as never before.
