I have never considered myself a “student” when it comes to watching movies, I watch them, form opinions and that's it. But Unheded has changed all that. This film is, without a doubt, the most inept attempt at making a film I have ever seen. Every child who studies at the university and thinks that he will be the next Spielberg or Tarantino should be given this film with a guide entitled “How not to make a movie.” Not only was there no story, the filmmakers were not even competent enough to make a film worth watching. It has been a long time since I saw it, but all I can say is to look at the pictures with the tracking on top in the first scenes. They never end! It's almost the same as gritting your teeth, but not so much fun.
