This is a story about a young woman who was seduced and then abandoned by her elderly, married lover after she became pregnant; is she taking revenge for him and for all his family with black magic ?? which, unfortunately, she does not herself, but someone else does for her. Good performance for a Thai horror movie. But a soft script never creates uncertainty, the director approaches the material quite arbitrarily, and the last act loses the viewer's sympathy for the victims, throwing logic to the wind. At some point, the character has a great opportunity to just shoot the villain, and instead she gets up and runs away without raising a weapon. Bad record ?? You absorb it! <br /> <br /> Some of the unpleasant effects of blood, including the truly tasteless corpse of a fetus with a late pregnancy and one guy dying from the fact that hundreds of live eels fell out of the stomach. a horror film made in Asia over the past 15 years.
