Recherche is a good word to describe this film. <br /> <br /> Suppose each film has its own characteristics, a trick. Transforming tricks are amazing effects as well as fan nostalgia. Seattle insomnia is a ploy in their slogan: “What if someone you never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only one for you?” Many novels rely heavily on these tricks, and some - thanks to the attraction of big names. In leap years, both Irish folklore and fairly well-known names within the country are used. <br /> <br /> So now the viewers in the movie, except for all the usual elements in the characters, conflicts or consequences. crisis, determination and unleashing, they also count on a stimulating dialogue, more exciting situations as a result of leap years, interesting plots, and perhaps some good turn in the middle or near the end of a story that favors the characters' circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is what Jean Yeo does not want to achieve. If they had tried, their goal was obviously on another court, on another stadium, on the other side of the planet. She and her writer Alain Leirac were completely unable to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most lines were invented. They seem to have a bag filled with lines that she would like to use in her film: “Well, these are the lines and quotes that I heard or read from the films I saw, or from the books I read before. and they all sound good to me. If they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience. So all I have to do is put all of them together. I'm going to use them all. ” The result is catharsis. I cannot say that these lines were unnecessary and have nothing to do with the story or the movement of the plot, but they seem to come from nowhere, catching you by surprise with these quotes. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who quote quotes based on most of the situations in our dialogue, trying to give them meaning for themselves while nodding. I no longer go on a date with them, because the desire to hit them is huge. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the characters depicted are stupid and one-dimensional. With the exception of unnatural dialogue, which implies their motivation (necessary for the development of the plot), they did not have a sense of conviction. I have no idea who they are. All of them are simpletons, spewing lines from the advice column of a women's magazine. <br /> <br /> The leap year trick is not enough to advance the story, because the circumstances are too small. Again, there are movies with less cost, but better than that, isn't it. They did this with my first and second points. Moreover, the minor plots are irrelevant (not that it is bad for films) and thin (not good). <br /> <br /> Gene Yeo and the producers are trying to give a horrible story with fancy locations and a decent picture. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to get approval from some viewers than others with good use of cinematography, the soundtrack and the location. These are not astute spectators. <br /> <br /> This is not even the film that is so bad that it is good. This is just bad. Don't watch it.
