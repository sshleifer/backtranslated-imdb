HeidiJean really saw this movie? Great Christmas movie? Not even close. Boring, boring and totally lacking imagination and heart. I kept watching this movie, wondering who the hell thought Carly Dad could play the main role in this movie! The woman has no definable personality and gives a completely dull performance. Baransky, as usual, was great and provided the only interesting thing. Her participation was probably the only reason why this project was originally green. Maybe I expect too much for the movie “Lifetime”, played 15 days after Christmas, but I survived this thought, thinking that with another director and a terrific J.J. with an actress who could at least cause sympathy , it could be a pretty cute little movie,
