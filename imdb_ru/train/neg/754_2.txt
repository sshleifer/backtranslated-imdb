I have to admit that I laughed when I saw one reviewer compare it to LOTR. Well, yes, if you exclude the dwarves, the cast of thousands, great special effects, big battles, strong characteristics, a decent plot, a good game, great leadership and everything else. What leaves you with walking. And boy, this film makes walking! If Mr. Piano had his own way, it would probably be a continuous three-hour hardcore walk in the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these annoying Martians would jump out for a few seconds to interrupt him before he went on another walk You've never seen so much movie going. If it really had a budget of $ 20 million, most of it must have gone to Mr. Pianoâ€™s shoes, because he had to go through a lot of pairs in his entire walk. Which explains why there is no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or suitable actors. Honestly, it's like watching some weird fetish videos for people who like to go for long walks in vintage costumes. Even with fast-forwarding, it's a walk around. <br /> <br /> As far as science fiction is concerned, I consider it a mistake to put the Martians in the film: they only prevent to go, which is clearly much more interesting for the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr. Piano charges with the dog?
