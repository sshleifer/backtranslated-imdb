First, I would like to excuse my bad english. <br /> <br /> I'm not a hardcore fan, but, nevertheless, I liked this movie. Live Feed, however, is FULL TIME! I've never seen a horror movie with great acting, but who was surprised? The live feed acting was ... well, not there! I saw some commenting on it as if it was a school project or something like that. Good, but not students in the media or acting school. It was not a class at all! What about the story? Really sad robbery at the hostel. What about blood? What about scenes of psychopathic torture that make your guts curl and leave you in a cold sweat? It was the most disappointing in the hole film! Short, fast and without edge. More like a penalty, not a torture. Okay, where the buckets of blood are, but it didn't even look real. Massacre and violence more reminiscent of the "Brain dwelling" than "Hostel" or any of the films "With." And Braindead was fun! Okay, I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times, but it was more disappointing than just fun! <br /> <br /> So instead of spending 80 minutes watching the live feed, watch ANYTHING ELSE!
