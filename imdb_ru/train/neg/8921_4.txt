The premise of the African American woman Scrooge in a modern, struggling city was inspired, but there is nothing else in this film. Here, Miss Scrooge is a mean banker who uses the services of her employees and clients in the poor and black areas where he lives. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not reflect very well on the urban setting of this film, and the script cannot make the update work. In addition, the constant message of sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly that the audience gets tired of this long before the film reaches its usual end. This is a movie with messages that does not know when to exit. In the leading role, the talented Ciceli Tyson gives an overly tense performance, and sometimes the lines are difficult to understand. The novel by Charles Dickens has been adapted so many times that it is a struggle to adapt it so that it is fresh and relevant, despite its very current message.
