This film acted terribly, written, directed and produced. But it is so polite, it is actually semi-safe. This semi is watchable. <br /> <br /> The storyline (which is not enough) makes almost no sense. The Barney Drum character is the only real comic relief in the film that gets tired in about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian supporting actors can be found in television commercials. None of them touched on anything I knew. And, of course, even less talented brother of Sly Stallone ..... = \ <br /> <br /> General information: He was almost completely shot in the small village of Claremont, Ont and around it. (about 20 miles northeast of Toronto) I learned a lot of local landmarks / intersections / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed on the now-demolished Oshawa Drive-in shortly before it was demolished.
