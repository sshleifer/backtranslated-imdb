Strictly speaking, routine, by the number of Western (director genre support Andrew W. McLaughlin, so what, surprising?). Army Colonel Brian Keith sparred with cunning thug Dean Martin, who had just kidnapped the colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found her niche after playing Pussy Galore in Goldfinger). Fist fights, shootouts, looting of stagecoaches and Denver Pyle in the role of support ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking with low monotony everywhere, Keith enjoys communicating with a prostitute (something like a shock after being shown in the television "Family Novel"), but otherwise this material with a low rent is losing Keith's kind talents. This is also bad news for Dino, who does not seem to notice or care. Hacking, bad writing and a few unfunny attempts to play humor. * from ****
