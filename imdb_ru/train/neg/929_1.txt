My wife and I love to rent really stupid horror movies and fiction and watch them with friends for a laugh. We saw this on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say that this movie is terrible, I mean good. Everything is in it, acting, camera work, plot, costumes, just so gentle and with a low budget, but this is what makes it so good. I think that in one scene the actors looked as if they were really walking on the spot. I really hope that the one who made this film was not serious when they made it, because if they were, it would be just sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies, just to laugh at them, then I recommend this one.
