I've seen bad movies before, but this one gets the award “The Worst Movie for Life”! Anthony Hopkins must be completely mentally ill so that his name is attached to it - anywhere! I will never see another film with him, director, etc. And so on! I can not believe the other actors and actresses who I liked (in this photo), who bent so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some great medicines! For anyone who is not shy about being part of such a film, it’s beyond me! Save your money on this! HUGE flop from start to finish! Shame on you, Mr. Hopkins! Besides the shame of Christian Slater! I can't believe you put your reputation on the line for this!
