Can I first say that I felt this film so strongly that I specifically registered with IMDb to watch it. And my review? This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film’s synopsis sounded interesting - the Nazis, the occult, time travel, etc. But the plot of the film failed to properly combine all these elements. Remember the episode with South Park, in which the manatees wrote "Family Guy" using "ideological balls"? Did these manatees write the Wicked too? As if the author wanted to include all these different ideas, but did not know how to tie them all together, and then, to make things even less meaningful, he included the theme of time travel Donny Darko-Esquire to the final, spoiling the chronology. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning I could say that this is a bad movie. The special effects were too low-budget for something better than directly on the DVD. The game was not great, but to be honest, I saw worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings, they were creepy, but the evil Nazi butcher boy was just comical. <br /> <br /> I don’t have a vendetta against this film or anything else, but to be honest, I'm not even in the horror genre. But this film cannot be described as a thriller or drama. If this story were well told, it would be a good film. But it was over-promoted. Waaaaaa over bloated.
