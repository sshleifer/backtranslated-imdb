I saw it on cable recently, and I liked it. I read the comments here, and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I liked the first story (too bad that it was not expanded). The second story, it seemed to me, was a cliche. And this is "California Dreaming", if I hear it again ... Chungking Express is fine, but this is not what the mass audience will understand, like the "Crouching Tiger."
