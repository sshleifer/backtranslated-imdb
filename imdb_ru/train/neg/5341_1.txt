Burdened with great actors, I expected much more from The Trickster than I was delivered. The plot is extremely contrived and manipulative. Many memories just add confusion. Credibility flies out of the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and completely ridiculous. I would strongly advise everyone who likes their stories to base themselves on something that, at the very least, can be avoided by "The Cheater", because you will be very disappointed. Maybe I'm just not fashionable enough to get it, but I suspect that many others were completely embarrassed by the storyline and especially the final. Blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work, because the whole film does not make sense. - MERK
