... when he remade Broadway Bill (1934), like riding (1950). The reappraisal of the role of Bing Crosby in the role of Dan Brooks did not help the script, which was “dated” 34, not to mention 50. In this sad film, the whole scenes were removed from the original, and many of the support crew repeat their roles, unless they are dead. Although being a senior did not seem to matter to the director. Not that the cars and clothing on the 1934 background plates did not meet the standards of the 1950s. Even singing "der Bingel" cannot justify this effort. <br /> <br /> We appreciated both the original and the remake of IMDb Four **** Stars. From the touch of Frank is long gone, and all that remains is the CAPRA-CORN. That did not stop Mr. Kapra. After passing around the 50s and making several educational documentaries, he ended his career by remaking Lady for One Day (1933) in DOLLS OF MIRACLES (1961). Again, this IMDb Six ****** Star had a great line-up, which also compared the originals of Eight ********. Sometimes it is better to leave while you are still ahead, immediately after the CONDITION OF THE UNION (1948).
