1) I am not an expert on weapons, but even I see the difference between US army rifles in the First and Second World Wars. In the film, we can see privates, armed with “M1 Garand” (invented in 1932!), Not authentic “1903 Springfield” (aka “Silent Death”), which ordinary soldiers use until World War II. The difference is that the M1 can load 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times the rate of fire! The M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires a reboot after each shot. Little difference ?! 2) The uniform of the German army has also been borrowed since 1940. Especially - helmets. German helmets have a significant peak at the top until the end of the First World War; we cannot even see one in the film. And if we make a small additional search in the archives - how true is this "true story"? I'm surprised at how “truthful” directors can be in pursuit of cheap propaganda.
