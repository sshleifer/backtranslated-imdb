Absolutely nothing happens in this confusing, annoying, carefree thriller, filmed by the usual employee of Amenabar Mateo Gil. The film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the search for thrills, really gives nothing, and looks like an exercise from boredom. The only slightly disturbing moment is the climax of the film, which takes about 30 seconds out of all the painful 100 or more minutes and is solved too simply. The plot lacks sophistication or believability, and although the idea is original, the way the plot unfolds is arbitrary, and each plot device or rotation is the result of external intervention (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to take initiative or resourcefulness. If you're a fan of the genre, see Tesis.
