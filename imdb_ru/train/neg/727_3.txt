I'm really shocked that such a great director like Chuck Jones began making the most incredible boring cartoons I have ever seen. I never laughed once during this short film, and this, for God's sake, is a caricature of Bang! Bugs bunny cartoons are always fun, not boring! Alas, this short shortson turned out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones shorts) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign of a boring cartoon is always not a gag. Good night, Elmer was boring because he always pulled the same joke with a predictable win. This cartoon, on the other hand, is struck by the second warning sign of a boring cartoon: too much dialogue. In the cartoon, at least there are more than two jokes in the sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are due to the huge complement of the dialogue. At some point, Elmer ends up having lunch and comments: “It was cool, very cool,” perhaps the most unnecessary dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters read the text out loud in Woody Woodpecker’s late-era cartoons is not considered in my book ). Despite the fact that this cartoon only lasts 8 minutes, it looks like 20 due to redundant dialogue like this. <br /> <br /> “Elmer's Rabbit” was not funny for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are not able to admit that he led a few fools during his career, you might like it.
