In Just Don Baker, he runs around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he goes to Malta, where he shoots more people. He has been locked up many times for shooting people. Then he engages in a shootout with a bad guy who is dressed like a monk. There is a boat chase, and Joe Don is in jail again. Finally, Joe Don, with the help of Elaine from Seinfeld, killed the bad guy, blew up one or two boats, and someone was shot in a flash. All this and a memorable topic, like Mitchell!
