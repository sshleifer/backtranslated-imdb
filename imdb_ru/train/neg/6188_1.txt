This is by far the worst Jane Eyre adaptation I've seen. It is unclear whether the script author read the Bronte book. George Scott is ridiculous and clumsy, like Rochester - when not just old, behaving evil. Suzanne York has the hairstyle of the 1970s that I have ever seen in a Victorian film. The characters barely speak to each other, so the rich banter in the book, which is the basis of their deep intellectual and unchanging love, disappeared. The final is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent a version of Timothy Dalton. This is so true for a book, it's like reading a novel aloud. Dalton is great as Rochester. G.S. Scott is ridiculous.
