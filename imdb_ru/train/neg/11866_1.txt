At first this film, according to the slippery, said that he won the “best film” at the Worldfest film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't call it the worst movie ever, but it certainly sucks, pretty much as terrible as the other Aussie B graders “Body Melt,” but at least this movie is not It looked like it was shot on HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers have watched a lot of Trom movies and really bad B-class movies, thinking that they can also crack this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like movies of very poor quality, just the fact that some characters impose fake American accents, as if it makes them more likely to sell it in the states or something. A really disappointing finale, the autopsy could be a lot more exciting, and some good fight scenes. You can fully see that the filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad Taste" with a whole, car bombing, rocket launcher and an infinite number of people shot, but in the final there is no excessive humor or style as "bad." taste. "<br /> <br /> If you like to watch really bad movies or are interested in extrabudgetary filmmaking, watch it, otherwise stay away.
