I love Don Knot, let me say it in advance! He is a tremendous talent and the best in what he does, which portrays a nervous, charmingly bewildered loser, thrown into the position of power. He is great in this role of Roy Fleming, a reluctant astronaut, but the film is actually quite boring, although as a child, my brother and I were thrilled to see this and his other films. It’s still worth seeing, but in fact it’s a movie that kids love most. I would categorize it as 100% family friendly, and also that you could sit down and watch with your children on a family night. <br /> <br /> As with all Notts films, there is a wonderful composition of your favorite character. actors, and you can not help but smile when Notts throws one of his shaky looks with his mouth open, no matter how old and exhausted you are. <br /> <br /> From an adult’s point of view, I think there is one thing: It's great that this film captured NASA in the 1960s - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how courteous and courteous Leslie Nielsen was then. The only complaint about this story is the love interest of Roy, a rather exhausted, incredible woman who cannot give him the time of the day until he becomes a great friend - if you are like me, you will hope that he will give her a push at the end. Carefully - you will whistle the theme melody for several days after viewing, it is so memorable.
