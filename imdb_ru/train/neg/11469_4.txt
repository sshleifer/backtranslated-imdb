ORCA is not really bad, but in fact it is not the best hour of Richard Harris. Like a crazy, Ahab-like fisherman, Harris enters the death game with a vengeful killer whale after killing the "wife" and the unborn baby of the whale. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who contacts Harris. She yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and somehow falls into the arctic battle for the crazy whale's revenge. There is no need to talk about any special effects, except that it looks like a round mirror for the whale's eye - Harrisâ€™s endless frames are reflected in the eye, so viewers understand that the whale knows who he is. Bo Derek, because one of the members of the Harris team is particularly unpleasant to break in with Orca, and most of the supporting actors, including Robert Carridin, Will Sampson and Keenan Winn, also do not feel well.
