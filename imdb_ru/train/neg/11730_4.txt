Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (as Karl Kolchak) is back; this time he is after the "Night Strangler". Again, police officers and fellow journalists either do not believe or want to hide a supernatural angle. Producer-director Dan Curtis presents the same main story as his previous “Night,” with clearly less success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis gathers a cheerful minor cast, including Dark Shadows graduates George DiChenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflugh (as Louise Harper) heads the sexy belly dancers collection. And, although I have never seen it mentioned anywhere, it must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin’s lunchtime companion, feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pfloog, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
