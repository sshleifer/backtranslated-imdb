Back in the 70s, when I first saw it, I was in high school. It was cool then. Now, as an adult, I look back and tell myself ... yes, that's right. What was funny? He has moments, but they are few and far between. It is so outdated that jokes no longer stand. Show it to the young crowd, and they will be completely lost. If you like this type of humor, you can choose the film Kentucky Freed or Amazon from the Moon. Tunnel Vision and Groove Tube are too outdated for today's viewing.
