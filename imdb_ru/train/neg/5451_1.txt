Filmfour will have to do a lot better than this little movie punk if they are going to get the right reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This film is set in Glasgow (although only a couple of minor characters come close to the Scottish accent). Making about people whose lives do not lead anywhere, who all meet in the same cafe early in the morning, when they have night work, CAN make for a really funny, insightful, fancy, cult film. Instead, we have a group of smug saddo and a plot that was so shattered that I was surprised that it was not banned. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y sleeps with Z also. Oh, you get it. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of time. Painful dialogue - it sounded like what a group of 16 years would write for a dramatic project GCSE. The female character was completely unnecessary - just written down as a symbol of the female in the hope that women would persuade him to see him. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those dark-skinned guy who laughs at beer advertising and can usually be found wandering in a flock, screaming on Saturday evenings in indescribable centers of cities, then you will like this film and you will find it right choice. " All the rest, run, do not go away from this pathetic little failure. <br /> <br /> And one question, when the group left the “boring” seaside city (by the way, Soltsuts, although they changed the name in the film) To return to Glasgow, WHY they did it through the Forton motorway services in LANCASTER, which is in england?
