I will say that at least the film makes sense, but this is bad. Acting for the most part is not very good (I think that only Sky showed some promise), and you feel uncomfortable watching it. All the scenes that should be meaningful are really small, for example, when Ng goes to her parents. There are many trivial details, such as a kanji tattoo on Skye's shoulder, fridge magnets for girls and terrible decor on the set ... and music ... and clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy once says: “I’m gay, not banal.” And do not know. Even the comment is terrible, I turned it off after Ng told about how she was perverted playing a lesbian.
