I have seen all kinds of Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was fast and, by the way, Lawrence Olivier was the best - hands down. But now we come to the role of Maximilian Schell over Bard. <br /> <br /> First, this is a duplicate version of the German television production of the venerable chestnut, William Shakespeare. But if somewhere there is a slower, more foolish, more sluggish and worse version, it must have operated at the elementary school level. <br /> <br /> Seeing that on MST3K it helps, Mike and the robots make successful strikes at the old boy, breaking through the depth of black and white television, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of the Germans playing the game in English, and it looks as a failure of Ingmar Bergman. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best part is the MST reefs. The best lines? “I will let the great Dane go”, “I don’t think so,“ respite ””, “Meet the Beatles”, “Hey, Dad, you will help me with my research project” and, my personal favorite, during the party - “Keylor Garrison leaves Germany (YAAAY !!) ". <br /> <br /> But there is also Shell, who plays Shakespeare's greatest character, like a mannequin from a department store, but not so expressive. No doubt he is a great actor, but here he tells the same story as Paul Newman in The Silver Bowl. Have you ever seen it? You MUST watch these two on a double bill! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is one case where you really should just read a book. At least the book is not duplicated by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> One star only for this Hamlet; ten stars, of course, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Good night, not so sweet prince.
