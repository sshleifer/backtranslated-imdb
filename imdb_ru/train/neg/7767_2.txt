For those not familiar with C.S. Forrester's book, this film should be interesting. It is colorful, well-played and represents a great adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories, this is terrible. I could hardly put up with it. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the writers have to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written one, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. But why do screenwriters rewrite history and not just adapt it? In this case, the authors have surpassed themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples. The officers hijacked the ship after the half-mad captain went completely crazy when he fell through the door - for reasons implied but never received. There was no military tribunal. The investigative trial was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellou does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor does Colonel Ortega's wife. Hornblower himself has never been in the brig either on a ship or ashore. There are many such manipulations with the history of Forrester. <br /> <br /> I think that the use of a film using the feedback device in the film affected the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why did the writers have to spoil a good story?
