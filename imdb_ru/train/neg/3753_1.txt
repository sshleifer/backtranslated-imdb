Due to the 1988 strike of the Americans Writers Guild, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. This is pretty much a shit made up of repetitive "cut + inserted" clips from season two, and his writer Maurice Hurley called it "horrible, just awful." <br /> <br /> Why the producers could not wait to shoot something decent, who knows. I suppose that because of the strike, the production ran out of money, and he could only release a memory episode, or maybe Roddenberry was too ill at that time to veto this half assembly. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Catherine Pulaski) in the series.
