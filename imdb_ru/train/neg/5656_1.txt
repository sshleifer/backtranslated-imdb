Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a terrible movie. This is just a superposition of scenes with no clear connection. Acting is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor such as Ezzat el Allayli. But something really amazing in this film: talking about sexuality, the emancipation of women, naked scenes in Arabian cinema is very rare, even today. I really congratulate the director and actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that prompted me to vote for this film as terrible are not only in the script and action, but also in the absence of professionalism. This film looks like an amateur. We see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic film, Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not recommended. But if you want to promote uncensored films throughout the Arab world, watch it and get your friends and your family to do the same.
