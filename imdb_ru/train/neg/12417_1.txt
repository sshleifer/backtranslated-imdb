Any film that begins with the fact that a cow shakes a female cannot promise much. As for the kibbutz stereotypes, as it was 50 years ago, well, I was there, and it just isn’t. Well, each kibbutz had only a small piece of something shown in the film (as teenagers who raided the kitchen at night), but you can't show that the whole kibbutz is full of all these - let's say - capricious qualities. Each kibbutz had its own problems, but each of them was unlikely to have everything. The views of Israel were magnificent. I still remember my youth in this Garden of Eden called Emek (valley). Yes, and the game was good, so you see that not everything was black — just the wrong image — perhaps on purpose.
