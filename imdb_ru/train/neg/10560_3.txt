Many other reviewers, including many whose opinions I respect, highly appreciate this piece of European horror. Personally, I did not like it at all. This is an inconsistent attempt to combine sex and violence in the atmospheric period. Jess Franco at his best makes such films very well. Unfortunately, there is no infamous operating director Joe D'Amato. The most famous films of D'Amato are notorious for their high frequency. This, his early film, does not have the constant disgusting scenes that made him the more notorious "Anthropophage" and "Out of Darkness." Ultimately, this is a rambling film that does not attract the viewer. Without the factor of meanness, too, it becomes very boring. As I said, others liked this film, but I just found it the perfect example of an incredibly lazy letter. <br /> <br /> The film has several advantages. Eva Aulin (from “Candy”) is in it, and she looks rather hot and often naked. However, the iconic film icon of Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in the plot without being connected to the main film. It seems he is bored with this role, and he does not have that manic intensity, which he manifests in all his glory. The music is good, and there are a few short moments of unintentionally ridiculous bleeding. However, this is a pretentious and meaningless film that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
