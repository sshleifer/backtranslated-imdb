Usually I am not one of those who say that the film is not worth watching, but this is certainly a mitigating circumstance. The only true side of this film is Cornelia Sharp, who looks pretty good and the fact that this film is REALLY short. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is incredibly boring and almost never occurs. None of the characters is even remotely interesting, and there is no reason to care for anyone. I'm not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to make this film, but he should have definitely missed this one. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see this film was if you died - A solid fan of Sean Connery and just want to see everything he did. Save this file for the last time. <br /> <br /> Well, if you miraculously saw it, despite my review (or any other review on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than me. made. Thanks for reading.
