It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar reached her old collection of empty expressions of fright and shock. She could not sell her character, and no one else in the photo could. <br /> <br /> For those who thought that “Malice” was “fine,” then don’t go look at it if you don’t enjoy your time and your life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched this movie for free, so I don’t want it to look like a rant from a guy who lost 8 bucks in a horrible movie. It was for free, it still sucks, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
