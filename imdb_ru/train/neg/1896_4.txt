This film does not show us anything original. Each idea or (action) scene can be found in many previously released films. Fairy Nick here is completely simple. Even Will Patton is calm and evil, nor good. Mr. Duval is fine, but has a very small part. Just like Angelina, how can we define her new glory? In general, there are too many characters, so no one and nothing is particularly detailed. This makes the film easy to forget. Sorry, don't you think?
