note for George Litman and others: Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff - “I don’t think so, * breeder *”. <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is “Why did you look at his“ how ”? ? “just for complete absurdity. that, and“ That's right, well, not! ”In general, I would say that we should pay tribute to the MST3K team for trying to make fun of this television film. you really can't make fun of the dialogue; Bill S. was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would refuse it. A theater club for junior high school could work better. <br /> <br /> I would recommend you buy a book and read Hamlet ".
