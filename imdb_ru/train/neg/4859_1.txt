You have to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to filmmaking: between 1985 and 2000 he made a whopping 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is worth something, then they are probably all crap (and a quick glance at their IMDb scores seems to confirm my guess). <br /> <br /> Part 3 sees a group of nasty students find the detention a little more intense than usual, after being attacked by hordes of the living dead, who fled from a top-secret military base located right under their school. Working on the terrible script of Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on the liberal use of the f-bomb), director Sheets represents yet another embarrassingly amateur effort that demonstrates some of the stunning horrific performances from his incompetent acting skills, terrible visual effects (some of CGI shit and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space shuttle shuttle) and its blood-stained brand (handful of offal extracted from the clothing of its victims). <br /> <br /> Finally, after what seems to be eternal, annoying Characters running for their lives, and unconvincing people from the undead, caressing the insides of animals, finish the zombie-armageddon with a turn in time / paradoxical turn that makes viewers review a few painful minutes from the beginning of the movie. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets, what did we do to deserve the need to watch it again?
