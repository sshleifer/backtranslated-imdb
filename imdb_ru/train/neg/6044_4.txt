A well-written record in the serial killer genre, which, unfortunately, is bogged down in its own pretentiousness, to be truly satisfactory. Willem Defoe is great as a detective from New York who is trying to track down what seems to be an imitator using the same murder techniques related to Renaissance art that were used in the series of murders that he had uncovered over the years. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's junior partner, and they have pretty good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters float to conveniently link the two cases together. Clea Duval is a friend of an earlier victim, and Peter Stormare is a kind of broker / art tutor for Defoe ... it's a bit difficult to accept, although Stormare is, of course, never boring. The end of the film is especially disappointing. Take a closer look at Deborah Harry, since Defoe is a less willing neighbor.
