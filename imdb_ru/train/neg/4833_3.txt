Yes, this film is a real thief. He stole several brilliant Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another film about war heroes to increase the recognition (support?) Of the wars that the US still fights today. I do not really want to go here in politics, but come on, it's clearer than the summer sky. A damaged cabinet actually has nothing outstanding, no real story at all. I really feel in the 50s in Hungary, when the party told people what they like and what they don’t. At the time, the same propaganda films were shot, except that they were black and white. Even if we consider this title a sensible part of the “War in the USA - this is cool” genre, you probably have much better films to choose from.
