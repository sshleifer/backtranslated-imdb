This is the same old film “If I can’t get funding for my project, I’ll do an injection.” There is nothing new here. This is very similar to Jeff Goldblum's film "Fly." Man manages to preserve some semblance of sanity, but ultimately he is inferior to the consequences of his experiments. The game is pretty bad. Throughout the journey, people behave foolishly, putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. The guy continues to return to the laboratory, which he was forbidden to enter. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. Admittedly, he looks good, but he seems to have a lot of problems. It's just a big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaur costume looks like he’d come off a stand at a congress in Star Trek.
