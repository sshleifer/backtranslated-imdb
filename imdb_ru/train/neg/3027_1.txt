If it smells like trash, and if it looks like trash, it must be trash. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my whole life. The poor style of director Tony Scott shames the already uninteresting and slightly erroneous story of Domino Harveyâ€™s life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely intermittent and confusing to watch. Some aspects of the story were ridiculous and completely unbelievable. It seems that all the action scenes were loosely connected by bad storylines and terrible actions. Keira Knightley is really completely undressed in this. This is the only advantage of this film. If you want to see her naked, just rewind the movie forward, until it takes half an hour, and you catch a lot of nipples. I highly recommend that no one sees this movie EVER! </ 3
