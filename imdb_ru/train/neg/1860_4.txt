The childhood comedy of Michael Keaton of 1998 with the same name was sharply condemned for her cheesy special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George had prepared for this horror comedy, they are simply stunning. It seems that the killer of a snowman is made of foam, and his hands are like oversized mittens. What they probably were. In this parody of dozens of other (much worse) films, the actor's actor challenges, and Paul Keith, as a city doctor, is especially remembered for his small but fun role.
