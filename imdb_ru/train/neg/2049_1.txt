At least I liked to scoff at the movie, which is amazing because I could barely watch it. Honestly, I guess the DVD cover is worth more than the entire movie. And, saying that this is the same director as “Boogeyman,” when his new version just came out ... nice touch, guys, it was deceptive enough to tie me. The only thing that upset me more than the intolerable game of the imitator was his haircut. Usually you only see such hair on a ten-year-old boy, and the character behaves like this. The film looks like it was taken by a graduate student D + from some film school, worried that he used every movie technique he ever studied while attending classes ... sometimes less is a friend. Because of this, I was lost by random plot twists that resulted in nothing or were inexplicable. All this makes the film a bad one, but when the ending doesn't even come close to its connection, it makes the film extremely bad. No doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it includes the French final video of my friends for high school, but maybe I'm a little biased, I mean, I got an extra role. Postscript I don't even think it deserves a star ... even half. NOT FOR YOU !!
