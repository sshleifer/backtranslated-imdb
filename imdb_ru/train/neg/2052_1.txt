This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original has been added, except for the Perry back reaction, which is of minor interest. He lacks the documentary feeling of the first film and the lack of development that made it so effective. Also painfully lacking a clear soundtrack from Quincy Jones, who added a lot to the original film. I can not understand any high marks for this at all. This is pretty bad. Why does someone spend time or money making such shit, and why do I spend time watching it?
