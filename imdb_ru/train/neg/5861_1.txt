I saw this film when it first came out in 1978, when I was a sophomore in high school. I took a date to see it. Needless to say, I didn't get it, because the film was very bad! Career Joan Rivers never developed as badly as she deserved, after she made this terrible non-funny nonsense. In fact, an unfunny term is not sufficiently harsh: this film is ANTI-FUNNY! You go out feeling that any laugh that could have happened was knocked out of you before it could happen. It is not worth looking at out of curiosity or because it is "so bad, it is good." Even the gang in MST3K could not have made it worthy of attention! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
