Keep in mind that neither Zeta-Jones nor MacGregor play a major role, as the poster will make you believe. Their roles are really minor. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles terribly between an exaggerated comedy and a realistic drama, and none of them is really attractive. Especially I find it impossible to collect a lot of sympathy for the protagonist, not to mention his talker friends and the sex-obsessed bridegroom. The plot stretches horribly, and I turned it off after about 2/3 - unusual for me, since I like to finish what I start. Good acting and beautiful setting - from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
