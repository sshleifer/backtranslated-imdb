Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: mainly Lucio Fulci, as well as Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei. <br /> <br /> Starring: Ottaviano Della Aqua, Massimo Vani, Beatriz Ring, Deran Serafin <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and get a good background, I have to start from the beginning. And the beginning of this really is George Romeros the Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn was released in '79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to him and call him Zombie 2. This is the film that we know as Ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with a shark! So, after this film (called Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and earned a lot of money, the Italians decided, damn it. Let's make some more zombie clicks! These things rake in the test! So Zombie 3 was born. Are you embarrassed yet? This story is actually just a repetition of the stories that we saw in many American zombie films that we saw before, the best comparison that comes to mind - “The Return of the Living Dead”. Let's see ... the government is experimenting with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. The canister is released into the general population and shebang! We get a lot of zombies hungry for human flesh. A group of people runs away from the zombies and gets into an old abandoned hotel. To survive, they need to fight with zombies. <br /> <br /> During the filming of this film was a lot of trouble. First of all, Lucio Fulci, the beloved godfather of blood from Italy, was ill. Therefore, he could not finish this film as he wanted. Then the film was handed over to two smaller directors, Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to revive the film, which was already not so good. You see, Fulci himself didn’t really have a soul or a soul. He was disappointed by this. He gave the film to the producers and basically said: “Do whatever you want with him!” And God loves them, they did. <br /> <br /> And that is why, ladies and gentlemen, we have such a crappy zombie film with the great Fulci, who is considered to be his “director”. The main problem, in my opinion, is that it is just such a meaningless bore! This makes no sense! After the first few minutes, during which some terrorists steal a toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the film is just a bunch of empty soulless characters without any personality running away from the zombies. Now in some cases it may seem funny if the zombie's # 1 makeup and zombie action is really good and fun, and # 2 is a lot of blood and guts. <br /> <br /> Here we do not get! Well, there are some inspirational moments, like when some eagles get infected with gas and start attacking people. It was cool. There is also a scene with the participation of a flying zombie head (which, by the way, defies no logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of an abandoned hotel and chewing on the legs of poor girls. But other than that ... the rest of the movie just falls on its ass. <br /> <br /> Infinite endless scenes that don’t make a jack to promote a story that no longer exists. This was my main flaw in this film. The sets look unfinished, and the artistic direction is almost absent. I hate it when everything looks damn unfinished! I like my bi-movies, but this one really was even lower than that! This is closer to a click on the z-level if you ask me. <br /> <br /> What is a zombie? Pure crap. All zombies are Asian actors (the movie was shot in the Philippines), so you get a bunch of Asian zombies. But this is not a big problem, since their film was shot in the Philippine Islands anyway. This is the kind of zombie that really sucks! For some reason, they all died in the same clothes. And what zombies are masking here is a bunch of black makeup (more like stains) on their faces. One or two zombies had a slightly more complex makeup, but it still wasn’t good enough to make an impression. This is just meaningless mucus on the faces of the actors. So not only is this movie going slowly, but the zombies look like crap. It must be dead people! In any case, for those who expect the usual coolness in the Fulci film, do not expect this here, because it’s mostly someone’s movie. And the two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) did not really put their heart and soul there. In fact, when you see the statistics on a DVD, you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his memories and his feelings about this, he does not even take it seriously. You can say that he is ashamed of it, and in many cases he says that they "just had a job, and they did it." And this, my friends, is the final nail on this film. There is no love or heart in this movie. So you get a half dazzling, crappy zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Only for the most complete or people who want to see or see every zombie movie ever made. Everyone else, do not even worry! Rating: 1 of 5
