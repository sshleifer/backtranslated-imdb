Not worth renting video, neither time nor extra effort. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can do. * The acting is finished ... bad direction. * Editing was very fluid ... many things didn't make sense or just seemed free. * The sound was poorly dubbed. * The music was extremely inappropriate. * Casting has been extremely off ... must be on a crack. * Zombies who say, not to mention ... drive, dance, work ... just piss me off. * And the bad guy ... Damn it! No matter how terrible he was ... he was the most attractive zombie of all. That does not say much. <br /> <br /> The cover was good, but very deceptive ... like the DVD's Main Menu ... great work and music. <br /> <br /> Don't be like that!
