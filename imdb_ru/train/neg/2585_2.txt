It was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only does this have nothing to do with other American pie films, the story is clear, flat and absolutely not funny. <br /> <br /> Girls are good, though, but spending time on watching cheap soft porn may be more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have done very badly a sex ad created for an audience no older than 12 years old. <br /> <br /> I never attended an American college, but I seriously doubt that anyone who did this could actually laugh at any of these scenes. <br /> Save your time, do something else.
