I really love sex movies and science fiction movies of the sixties, and this is because of the actress who appeared in them. They found the sexiest women in these films, and it didn't matter if they could play (remember “Candy”?). The reason why I was disappointed with this film was that it was not nostalgic enough. It tells about the European science fiction film “Dragonfly”, and the director is fired. Therefore, the producers decided to let the young novice director (Jeremy Davis) finish the picture. They are one truly beautiful woman in the movie who plays Dragonfly, but she is barely in her. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his father's exploits from an early age and puts it in the script. I wish the film was a tribute to these early films. They could have had a lot of cameos from the actors who appeared in them. In this film, there is one actor who has been popular since the sixties and his John Phillip Lowe (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I will have to continue to wait until the director renders due to the films of the sixties. If someone reads this, “Make it as sexy as you can”! I will wait!
