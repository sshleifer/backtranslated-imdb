I do not see the appeal of this series (which should be sci-fi). In fact, it's just “let's see what soap happens quickly this week,” and oh, the Cylons are involved in flashbacks. <br /> <br /> “Baby” Cylon, which continues to nail the other guy, is rather lame, quite obviously T & A was added to the show. Every time she shows up, I am amazed that the WTF should continue. And do not even try to scold me about the "plot arcs." <br /> <br /> This is a soap opera with added CGI. This is not science fiction, except for the original premise. <br /> <br /> This series is not everything he does. If you like trendy, sharp, cunning, nervous, vague camerawork with the editor on the crack, this show may be for you. Since the nerds seem to rave about this show, this is a clear sign that the voice nerds have changed their opinions compared to Pikard PNG.
