Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who has great potential under the guidance of a reputable agent. Obviously, the person who led her to this parody is not the one who cares about her career. I sat in a theater surrounded by teenagers who had left in droves to find another film, to find out who thought that this film would be liked by someone. It was poorly written, the casting director could put in just 1 or 2 minutes of effort to the characters, and the director clearly didnâ€™t care.
