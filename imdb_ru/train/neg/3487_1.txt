In Surviving Christmas, there is one great moment that almost justifies the pain: James Gandolfini breaks a shovel over Ben Affleck's dull head. <br /> <br /> This film is yet another unfortunate example of how James Gandolfini proves that the Great Actor, who simultaneously tarnished his career, was acting in this film. <br /> <br /> Young and rich advertising director Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) suggested that you can't be alone on Christmas. (And from the very beginning in this idiotic film lies the main problem with the suspension of disbelief: how many people of social status did Drew really care in 2004 about whether they spent Christmas alone or with half a family or with a fifty dollar prostitute?) He finds that Drew redeems his family to spend Christmas, on the condition that they pretend to be his own, unceremoniously ignoring all signs of the opposite, that his money did not buy the emotions he was looking for. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, the ugly suburban truck driver Tom Valko (James Gandolfini) and his disheveled wife Christine (Catherine O'Hara) agree to become the special family of Drew, protesting against their protests. son Brian (very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter Alicia (very softly focused Christina Applegate). Then Drew spends the rest of the film, allegedly returning his youth or something else. The messages in this film are as perverted and illogical as the storyline with a dry mouth. Fraught with open psychosis, Drew smears a fake smile on his face and blindly denies any slander he allegedly bought to avoid the Valko family. <br /> <br /> The question arises: does Drew pay this money? people, in order to regain some semblance of joyful family emotions, how psychotic should it be in order to pretend to be happy among its chipping and mental sufferings from its presence? This is not the case when the Valco family hides their true feelings and pretends to be happy when they are with Drew — three out of four members make it clear that they despise him. Is he really unaware that he cannot see that his money does not buy him the “family” atmosphere in which he inspired to believe, in the first place was true? As in all films, causing such a blatant surprise, as * four * writers could be so entangled in their own narcissistic dreams of appearing in a sequence of credits, that they would lose sight of any likelihood or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mike Mitchell, who was in charge of Twain Bigalow: Male Gigolo - stop right here. - said Nuff. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow manage to shine, proving their courage in the midst of this mess. Christina Applegate is lithe, cute, blond and fiery in all the right places, cutting Drew violently with small stripes of carcass throughout most of the film, then turning around and falling in love with him because the script tells her about it. br /> <br /> And I wouldn’t say Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider is better to look over his shoulder. The city has a whole new level of desperately seeking talent.
