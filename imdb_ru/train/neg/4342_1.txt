I have to say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. They had a pretty good storyline, but it messed up so much. Firstly, in the cast, everything is wrong, where did this Van Peebles (idiotic actor) and pap-pooh come from? Looks like Carlito came out of the hood and hung out with real idiots. This film does not make "The Way of Carlitos" fair. I am so happy that the sequel “Way of Carlito” was the first to go, if I had first seen this garbage, I would never give a chance for the pacino version. And anyway, Pacino should have read this story, thought it was crap, and made a sequel instead. Way of Carlito: Ascent to power - 1 out of 10. Way of Carlito - 9 out of 10.
