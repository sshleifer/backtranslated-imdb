The only nice thing about this very funny movie is to play "guess" this place. What a landmark Toronto will stand in which American / international place. <br /> <br /> Who knew that the Antichrist would be Russian? obviously, he cannot be an American, since we need the Yankees to save the day - oh Buck ... you will tell us the whole truth ... you will show us the light ... and the exit from the building should these nasty antichristers have achieved their goal. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. There is not enough faith to hope that they will not do another such! We should not pray.
