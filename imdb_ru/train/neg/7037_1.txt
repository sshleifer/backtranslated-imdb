This is really a terrible movie and a waste of two hours of your life. He is both mild and offensive, with nude and lots of violence. However, nudity is not so exciting, and the violence is repeated and boring. In addition, the plot is unconvincing at best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie should be funny, but it is not. I did not laugh even once, when I looked at him, and did not even smile. The creators of this film tried to combine the comedy with the action movie, and they failed in both cases. <br /> <br /> Some poorly made films are funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
