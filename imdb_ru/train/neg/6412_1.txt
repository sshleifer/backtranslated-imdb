I just got back from the movie, and I'm totally shocked. This film is an absolute mockery of all humanity. In the theater in which I was, there might have been 4 more people. This film was recommended to me, and I could not believe that this person liked it. I can not believe that any sensible person will like it. There was no plot. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about anything. This film only shows why Hollywood is in such a mess. I can only look at the spiral of the horror movie industry and laugh. What a parody of all filmmaking, this is true for all new "teen horror films" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw. It's all such garbage. Do not support such garbage!
