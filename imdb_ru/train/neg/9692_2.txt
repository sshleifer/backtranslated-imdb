Bonjour Tristesse covers the same ground as Wedding Party. in fact, the daughter-proprietress tries to prevent the establishment of relations between the beloved family member and the offender. While critics love “The Wedding Party,” I find Julie Harris a slow and adenoid talkative landscape in everything she was in. It depicts annoying, rich idiots, like last year in Marienbad, but this time it's a journey. <br /> <br /> In this film, Preminger develops sequences, but characters do not. For the first 30 minutes, he is pleased that he was eroding the relationship between father and daughter between Seberg and Niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible. Once the conflict is entered, Seberg cannot provide the depth needed for this part. Kerr receives the title and turns the film into "Infinite Love." Seberg's useless narrative seems like a strange interlude - this is not good. I really wish someone other than Niven was in his role. He spends so much time normalizing the behavior of the orthodox Britons in all his films that he never bypasses the character. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable sequence, the evening dances become free for everyone in the harbor, Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty exercise “The Conformist”. Kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another serious pain (as in "Black Daffodil", "Iguana Night", "The King and I", "Heaven Knows Mr. Allison", "Tea and Sympathy", etc. Etc.). Indeed, Kerr was a terrible actress. I would like every movie to end with a fatal car accident or, even better, start with it. <br /> <br /> People who do not feel ambiguous should avoid this.
