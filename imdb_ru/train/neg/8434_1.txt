This film showed more racial hatred for Jews by David Mameth than I have ever seen in an American film. Stereotypes are so exaggerated that my ability to keep looking is dead. I was very disappointed that Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna calls a bunch of men sitting in the Jewish center of New York and cleaning their weapons, but common sense won, and I stopped. I am deeply concerned that the Jews are not Americans, but "others." I believe Mr. Mamet is one of the reasons for the hatred, and not the healer of the same.
