And it directly falls into the category of “terribly bad” - that is, a film that drunk students will rent to enjoy. I was at a sci-fi film festival, and all I remember is wave after wave of hysterical laughter when the premiere of this film. Other criticisms will better describe the fecal nature of this film, and I felt terribly ill with the poor fellow from the production company, who appeared, obviously, to gauge the reaction of the audience. What he got was the sci-fi equivalent of a drunken student audience, and after the “serious” anime film, I think it was sky blue, the audience was in a dark mood, and then this film opened, and after a few seconds everything in the room rolled on the islands. I will highlight the worst sides; <br /> <br /> Script. The funniest and worst part of this film, it clings along a linear and predictable road, and sometimes it’s poorly thought out. Rubbish, but supremely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Animation: Poorly done and folded, if you can put up with a gray background and gradually remove the costumes for the heroine (I know that I can!), then watch the montage where it “transforms” from the Swedish peasant girls in LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: So one-dimensional, it is painful, there is a brief prehistory (with divided lines of dialogue on the sides) and the actual motivation of some of the main characters is highlighted. <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, if you have a captive audience and a few drinks lying around (try and make sure they're an alcoholic to ease the pain), then put this movie on a DVD and immerse yourself in the mindset "mystery Science Theater 3000". There is no other motive to watch this movie, except to laugh at him, and this does not mean to be a comedy. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It may be even more boring to look solo than the New World with Colin Farrell, since you cannot laugh at the absurdity of a friend or two.
