I give 3 stars just for beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was ... pretty boring. About 50 minutes we have a plot plan ... In the War of the Worlds, the intro part lasted, oh, about 10 minutes? Then there was real action! It's something like: "Let's take a walk on the savannah and suffocate from the beautiful sunsets!" And, perhaps, to deliver a message, such as "Do not kill the elephants!". Very eco-friendly. I would expect this from the “new” film by Stephen Segal, and not from this ... The leading actress makes me think about artificial tan, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I have not seen a single scene where her hair is matted, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. She just does not look like a woman of the 19th century! And in the bar where they are looking for our hero, Swayze comments on the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the following years. Livingston and other researchers traveled to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. Therefore, if the action does not take place between 1896 and 1900. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a pleasant impression ... as if - tough on the outside, but soft and pleasant on the inside. Not that I was hugging with a nut, but you understood. He really manages to look at this beaten puppy several times. The film stinks. Too long and duller. don't look! Do not buy it! This is a waste of your money!
