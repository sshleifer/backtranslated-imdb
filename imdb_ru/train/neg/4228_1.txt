I can not believe how bad this piece of garbage! I want my $ 3.99 back! Words do not give in to the description of this poorly done piece of shit! Duplication in no way matches the shape or shape of the actor's mouth. The film looks as if it was filmed on a video camera from the 1970s. I shot the best movies on the camera of my mobile phone. The blood is ridiculous because of a silly, unbelievable conspiracy. Acting is what you would expect if you called all your friends on Saturday afternoon and continued to go broke, and then tried to put the play in your garage. Don't get me wrong ... I did not expect that O'Neill and I like Zombie films, but the production figures in this film are so low that it is impossible to see him. Avoid!
