... children's actors were annoying. It also seems that the creators of this film have struggled to fill 90 minutes. Although worthy scenes of death. If it were not for the scenes of death, this film would have a very Disney mood. <br /> <br /> The main childish hero didn’t seem as scared as he should have been. If I was in the middle of the forest with a killer-like human fairy fairy, you could argue that you would not wander and ride a bicycle. <br /> <br /> In general, I’ve seen worse (i.e., it’s waiting), but I wouldn’t look again or recommend to someone to worry, unless you're an avid horror collector.
