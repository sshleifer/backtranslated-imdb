As I understand it, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. I doubt that this is the work of an ordinary guy who loves films, or this is the work of a student of cinema, because in the final credits there is a link to the Porto School of Art. <br /> <br /> However, director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this film a complete lack of awareness of some basic concepts about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It does not matter for a novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you study film is how to tell a story. You will learn that, like in novels, in films you should also build your story in three actions: introduction, development and conclusion. You will learn that your story should have a protagonist and antagonist, and that there should be a climax. You will find out that this is really for a 3-hour epic, for a regular film, for a short film and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second advertisement. You will also learn that there may be levels of subtlety in your approach to academic structure, and, ultimately, you can even deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> In rude expressions, Tim Watcher introduces his protagonist to us, and then the film ends - the whole movie sounds like an introduction to the characters in the AMÉLIE Juny. There is no second or third action in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or a feature film, so you cannot even try to justify disrespect for the academic structure. You expect a story to be told, but this is not happening. Worse, TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one without a real goal. It does not make sense, or at least it is not valid. His point of view is childish, with a sense of revenge. The situations depicted are extremely simple, and his approach is Manichean. <br /> <br /> I expected much more from this short plot. The film begins with a rather nice sequence of titles, and you quickly realize that you are watching something with better performance than a regular Portuguese short film. I don’t know the budget for this film, but judging by the list of thanks in the final credits, the film crew should have credit for such good connections in a country where it is difficult to open the doors for young directors. <Br /> <br /> TIM WATCHER is an exercise in style, color and carefully selected plans combined with an excellent score. It's all. There is nothing else. There is no plot. And it's a shame, because it looks like a loss of production value. Hardly, in the usual Portuguese short text you can see such a variety of places and so many add-ons available to enrich the story. <br /> <br /> No matter how ridiculous the comparison may sound, I have to give BMW shorts as a perfect example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film, strictly conditioned by the placement of the product and stunning stylish cinematography.
