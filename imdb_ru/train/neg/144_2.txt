It is impossible to describe how really, really, really bad this film is. It is a pity that I actually sat in this film, in this very tedious and predictable film. What's wrong with it? Acting: there is not a single performance that is even remotely close to even being sub-par (at least they are all very pretty). Soundtrack (songs): “If we take Orgy on the soundtrack, everyone will know that they are watching a horror movie!”; Soundtrack (score): Good, but anyone with a keyboard can make a good soundtrack these days. Don't even get me started on "What the hell is that?" moments, here are a few: the killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens, as the actress turns, no one turns back, something sits in front of her.; Over there, where the killer appears with a powerful drill, really big! The filmmakers get points, at least for plugging it, but can I really believe that the killer took the time to find an electrical outlet to plug it in. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grail and I want to say “Where did you get a power drill?” I could talk about how bad this film is, but I only have 1000 words. I will give it 2 out of ten stars. One star for making me laugh, and another star for all splitting. Seriously, do not waste your time with this.
