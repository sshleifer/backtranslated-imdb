This film is really very creepy. Unfortunately, not for the reasons that the filmmakers would have hoped for. <br /> <br /> There is also a master killer serial killer, but he's not that creepy either. He’s just your standard comic villain, a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddy Krueger, although there’s nothing particularly fresh about it. By the way, even for the most vile and most reprehensible of criminals, can they be detained in a tense position, on their feet, arms stretched out 24 hours a day a week a week? I believe that in the world that Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay have given us, everything is possible. <br /> <br /> No, the main character really sounds terrible in this movie, Danny. This unattractive young man, who is assisted and instigated by some truly absurdly weak security measures and a doctor who is completely indifferent to any concept of a patient’s professional ethics or confidentiality, wanders into a hospital ward, which can only be called a very vulnerable and defenseless young man. a woman, and on the basis of anything (her chronic sleep makes it impossible to give something like informed consent), imagines that he has some special relationship with her. <br /> <br /> Apparently, after a few days, he assumed the right to abduct her, believing (completely false, as we discover) that he is able to take care of her better than anyone else, and for several minutes after returning to her apartment sexually molesses her, although she (again, because of her drowsiness) absolutely cannot agree or resist. <br /> <br /> Our suspicions as to why he feels this connection will soon be confirmed. He is, of course, more or less unable to establish any mature friendships with adults, not to mention sexual relationships, so instead he resorts to this essentially infected woman, who, because of her constant sleep, has an intellectual age corresponding to the life experience of all only a few years. The scene where she finds ice cream is especially scary, and the shy look that she looks at him when he gloatingly says that he will have to clean it out again causes a particular shudder of horror. But, again, I fear, not so much the trembling horror that the filmmakers had hoped for, but a much more direct spasm of disgust. We can all see clearly what is at the end of our forks - this is a pedophile's ideal dream of innocence, sexual consent and complete dependence. Awful, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> What else do we have in this mess? Twisted dreams are not as good as del Toro. Mandatory argument “You need to go to the police”, where the main character always has a reason not to do this, even if this is the only reasonable course of action. The sequence of automata, highly appreciated in the comments here, although completely and completely meaningless (“Sigourney Weaver protested unforgettably in Galaxy Quest”, “it doesn’t perform any function!”) ​​And looks at me just like the disgusting Dr. Fibes, paraphrase one of the saws. Derivatives. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs is trying his best, so the star is for this, and a couple more, because you have to keep a lower rating for films that are even worse, and in general it’s well filmed and correctly executed.
