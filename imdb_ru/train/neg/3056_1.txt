Before I saw it, I saw some pretty bad Christmas movies. But as soon as I saw this, “Jingle All the Way” looked better than “The Godfather”. Santa Claus is a funny movie about how Santa Claus helps some children, but he looks almost like a demon watching him. Santa's funny ho-ho-ho is being replaced by an evil, devilish laugh, which I am sure has turned many children away from Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which is combined with all speeches and dialogues. Santa lives high above the Earth at the North Pole, where he and children from all over the world are preparing for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Peck or Satan. Peach is trying to spoil Santa's Christmas by making the three boys naughty, and creating distracting maneuvers, such as moving the chimney and heating the doorknob. When Pitch forces Santa to attack the dog, it’s up to Santa's assistant and the wizard Merlin to get Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film, along with the fact that it is completely bad, is so strange. Satan dances a lot, and in fact he seems much more fun than Santa. Santa is talking about delivering gifts to all boys and girls, but he seems to be delivering only 5 children's homes in Mexico. Deer are toys, and when they laugh, I am amazed that it does not cause tears in the eyes of children ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes - just Santa plays the organ, and the children sing on it. Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa shooting Pitch in the ass with a mini-gun and laughing out loud while Pitch dances in pain. I think it is better for parents to tell their young children about the origins of children than to show them to them. The only plus is that you will laugh hysterically if you can appreciate a bad movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes
