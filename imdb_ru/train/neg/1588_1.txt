It was the worst movie I've ever seen in Billy Zane. I understand that this film was mainly for demonstrating beginners who were very good for beginners, but overall the film was not believable. <br /> <br /> With all the shooting, you might think that the police would intervene. Even the coin, which is a beetle on Shona, was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes that the coin is a mistake was unrealistic. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have developed quickly. Bad work Find the best writer. <br /> <br /> Countdown to the end was not synchronized with anything. The fight took longer. And what a coincidence that every time Billy was going to blow up Sean, he had no bullets. Once I can believe it, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was stupid. It was so stupid when Sean hit him at the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
