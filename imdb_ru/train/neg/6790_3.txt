Oh, cruelty, oh-oh, dying breed, oh-oh-oh, a sense of loss, oh-oh, prejudice! God, when all of you, the aching revisionists, stop analyzing westerns because of a loud cry? S ** T happens. If this offends your socially engineered feelings, return to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Boring, tedious and very tedious celluloid waste, especially in light of the presence of Cobourne / Hackman / Bergen. There is nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentistry. Perhaps it would be a little better without the constant distraction of an inappropriate Mexican guy with a bad tooth. Monument blunt ultra-creeping sensitivity of the 60/70-ies. Almost impossible to sit out the whole movie. I think I would prefer to open my eyes to the whole series of Lucky Luke / Trinity. 4 Horses / 10-all deader'n hell.
