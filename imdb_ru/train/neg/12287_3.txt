In the late 80s, he saw an inexplicable number of supernatural horror films, installed in the dark penitentiary institutions. The magnificently gritty and capricious "Prison" by Renny Harlin forced the entire haunted ball to run; he was immediately followed by a noticeably inferior "Chair", a pleasant trashy "House of Death" by John Saxon, a passable psycho-movie "The Destroyer" and this ugly weak, slow exercise in hopelessly comatose boredom. <br /> <br /> Your usual annoying collection of terribly unsympathetic college students led by the unbearably tortured spineless tvirp Alex (the extremely unattractive Nicholas Chelozzi) goes to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances of sudden terrible death future rock star Sammy Mitchell ( performed by Tony Basil, who won the fame of "Hey Micky"). Alex's brother becomes obsessed with the evil demonic spirit of the evil cannibalistic commander of the US Civil War cavalry and continues the expected murder, forcing the weak Alex to overcome his passivity and oppose this disgusting ghost. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he was photographed by Nicholas von Sternberg, with several decent scenes of bloody balancing and a fair amount of eerie atmosphere (the film was shot on the spot in the dark, rusty, worn out ruins of Alcatraz Island), “the rock slaughter ”nevertheless simply do not cut it out as a solid, effective function of startle. In many ways, this is due to the equally unpleasant and incredible student-friendly characters, a tedious grin, whose silly comic antics turn out to be more annoying than funny. The apartment, played by a noticeably disinterested cast, is even more burdensome, because once Playboy's friend and the undeniable hot blonde cutie Hope Marie Carlton played the particularly annoying role of Linnie Quigley as the symbol of the prefect nymphomaniac. The direction of Dmitry Logothetis shows at least some flashy visual style, but the tone is unevenly transferred between grim seriousness and stupid, terrifyingly sophistic stupidity, and, worst of all, sloppy, inconsistent, excessively complex and, finally, quite confused, Ted Landon’s script fails miserably necessary internal logic to make a contrived story even remotely believable. In other words, this bastard, unfortunately, succeeds in making the meager 90 minutes seem painfully drawn out with a cinematic sentence of imprisonment.
