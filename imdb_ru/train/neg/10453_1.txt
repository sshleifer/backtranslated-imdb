This film deserves more than 1. But I give him one, because so many fans, fans gave him 10, as a result he received a rating that will fall in the top 100. Seriously, this is not so great, not so bad. This is a silly cult classic with so many fans, it's funny. These are the people who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris' jokes and still say, “I'm Rick James Beach!” No matter how old or annoying he is. I'm afraid to hear that "I'm tired of the MFn snakes on this MFn plane" months later from idiots trying to be funny. Crazy story shit actor, etc. It's good to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit that this is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the marine with John Cena in the lead role if you want to watch a real movie
