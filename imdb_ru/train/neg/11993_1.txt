After watching only half of the film at school in November, today, I saw that he was on Flix, and decided to watch it in order to see the rest and write a new review. <br /> <br /> The book on which the film is based, The Ax, is in order. This is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> Awful (and I mean horrible) play, poor dialogue and average cinematography make up this horrible Ax adaptation. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Brian, who is an 80s teenage cliche movie (sporting mullet, beating his head on cheap 80s rock music) and his mother riding in a car to get on a plane to take off, to see his estranged dad (his parents are divorced ... and now a dramatic pause.) Now Brian said goodbye to his mother and dog and takes off to see his father. The pilot is a fat, ugly, rude person (in the book this was not the case), who after 2 minutes had a heart attack in the air and died. The book describes in more detail that the pilot has more pain, and it looks like they were in the air much longer than the pilot had a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Airplane (in another two minutes). ) refueled (leaving us, the audience, to assume that he was there for hours, although the sun has not changed its position and the landscape looks EXACTLY the same.) Now it crashed landed. <br /> This is the point in the film where everything is very different from what was in the book. The book says that his jacket was torn to shreds, but everything is fine in the film, without tears and tears (it looks like he just bought it), it never said that he climbed a mountain, saw a wolf and fell asleep upstairs . on the mountain it was never said that a bear attacked him (it is said that it is an elk, but not a bear), it was never said that he eats several bugs, which he does, he never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to mine these sparrows, take them away and eat them or that little trap of a fish farm that he makes (which is destroyed by one of the tornadoes), and it does not mention that he damaged the ribs from one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> I don’t wear it I don’t even think that you can call what was depicted in the film tornado. It was all just a storm that hit several of his things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp holiday is Brian's lame memories (which are never mentioned in the book), especially the cliché of Brian, who woke up. got up, walked over to the window and saw that his dad (with all his things that could fit perfectly in the back of his truck) leaves and shouts "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (nevertheless, of course, his father did not hear him, although he was only outside), and he punched a window with his fist (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The end is the only thing that came close to what happened book (I said close). In the book, I think that one of the key things that a rescue pilot said to Brian when he landed was: “You're the child they were looking for! They stopped a few months ago. .. "And yet they left this line in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a pitiful epilogue with Brian (somehow without consultation or therapy) to return to normal life with the family. I think we were supposed to come together for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter). Then it shows his temporary home (for what, in the film, it seemed like three days, but the book had a few months) and his ax, still in the tree, where he left it (also did not happen in the book), showing where he cut the message, so they What is done: "DOM" (where did we really have to believe that he cut it out with this ax?) <br /> <br /> No quotation can sum up this film better than when Enid from The Ghost World said: “It's so bad that it went good and became bad again.” The ideal description of this film. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to someone (who did not read the book) and would just like to watch the movie, as well as someone who read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored to death. <br /> <br /> For those who have read the book, leave what your imagination has created as a film. This is terrible and will ruin your thoughts about the book. <br /> 1/10
