Oh ... My God ... this is without a doubt the most fun movie I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole film simply does not make sense. Combine this with mediocre directorial, really strange scenes (for example, a scene in which a child stretches his hand over a ravine and mysteriously falls), and a completely bottomless dialogue ("Look!" renouncement. Not to mention that Mr. Atlas can only win because of chocolate. But this is part of the charm of the movie. Sit and watch this with a few friends to laugh. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because itâ€™s just SO BAD!
