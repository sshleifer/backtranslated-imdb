I had several problems with the film: <br /> <br /> (1) The script, in particular Kim Baysinger’s voice: movies are not books; they should * show * action, not voice * tell * us what is happening. Sometimes I find a movie with the word “voice over” that works, but here it seemed to me that this is a more lazy way of writing the script. In fact, it seemed to me that she practically read excerpts from the novel in her voice. <br /> <br /> (2) I didn’t feel any emotion in the relationship between Jesse and Brother Thomas, and also felt that Alex Carter’s play was pretty bad. For me, this is a significant failure in determining the characters of Jesse and Thomas - without a connection between them, it seemed to me that she simply wanted a carnation, and that for him it was a question of the absence of sex. If this were done correctly, the relationship between them would give a much larger context for the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood Jesse’s mid-life crisis. In the film, it was more like simple boredom. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I did not think that the film was so bad that I could turn off the TV. Although this thought occurred to me.
