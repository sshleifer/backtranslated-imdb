Please do not waste your time. This film is about the worst of Bram Stoker’s Dracula (Van Helsing), Anna Rice’s Vampire Lestat (rock music and stupid biblical references) and Blade (high-tech toys). I really like movies and novels about vampires, and many of them are very good. But not this smelly. Even the soundtrack does not help, mainly because the film resorts to ridiculous, scary classical music, and not to the awesome metal that some have reported. Only a few times I heard metal; They were mostly tortured violins. Avoid it like garlic and crucifixion.
