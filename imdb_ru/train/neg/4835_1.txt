Catherine Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young American corporal in Afghanistan. He is also a highly skilled surgeon and freely roams Kabul, working with wounded NATO soldiers. During a particularly challenging mission, he accidentally picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards. Then he finally received the rank of sergeant, but could not make a choice between the career of a sniper and a surgeon, so he generally leaves the army. A year later, frustrated by civilian life, he joins the navy, and on the last stage he proudly wears a white uniform.
