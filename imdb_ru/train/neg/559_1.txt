I saw this movie at the London premiere, and I have to say - I did not expect much, but I did expect something that was at least a little entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original “Basic Instinct” was not a great film and still something like “cool dirt”, but it was interesting. I can remember countless times when I watched channels on TV at the end of Friday or Saturday, when I came across a film and found myself starting to pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> However, this settling brain ... Belated continuation has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still gorgeous? Well, let's say so - for a 47-year-old she is quite hot. Is it as beautiful as the original? Not. She also clearly had plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this film is somewhat unattractive. She does not look so soft, sincere or innocent, as in the original - this is the whole essence of being an evil temptress, and so on. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (typically a safe director is one who doesn't always do a great job, but knows how to make decent films) officially delivered his first real turkey; a film in which bad people laughed at certain moments that were supposed to be serious. <br /> <br /> I heard that the film went through several editing sessions, and this is very clear from the very beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess, and the ending is - oh my god! Talk about stupid and incredible. (Still, it’s still predictable.) I saw Gigli, I saw Son of the Mask — and although I’m not going to smear this film, I can say with my own power (which you don’t do, I have to agree with the fact that I prefer both of these films because of this catastrophic failure. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone left five minutes before the film began, and people in the theater started throwing things at the Screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting the scenes inside the nightclub of the Orgy type. <br /> <br /> “Basic Instinct 2” - in principle, it also stinks.
