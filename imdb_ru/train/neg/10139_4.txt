You have to pass it on to Steven Seagal: whatever his faults, he has a good taste for women. If you choose a film about Seagal, most likely there will be one or several very beautiful women in it. And usually they do not function as just eye candy; they fight and fight, shoot weapons, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers a duet of Ciara Payton (with a very sexy face, with juicy lips, suitable for Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones, and finds time to engage them in a fight and lesbian caresses! And if it seems to me that I spend too much time talking about them, then this is because the rest of the film, although tolerable, is so uninteresting that it is difficult to find something else to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks as if he cannot even be bothered by an attempt to pretend that he cares. Being a militant of a military type, there are very few military actions in him, and he doesnâ€™t fit very well into his role (the invisible pilot, "the best in the world", of course), which can explain his almost lunatism offensive.
