Student Seduction finds the Bell Saved by graduates Elizabeth Berkeley on the other side of the table and attracts the attention of a young and energetic Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself, I can honestly say that no teacher, except one, has ever done anything hormonal for me when I was a student. It was Ms. Diaz, who was a high school music teacher. Even as a young gay, I saw what she was doing with the rest of the class. She was my only teacher that Elizabeth Berkeley could play anyway. <br /> <br /> Corey, being hot, he was also used to having his own relationship with women, whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents confirms this belief. He floods the chemistry that Berkeley teaches, and to maintain his grade point average, she agrees to instruct, but no longer believes. <br /> <br /> So when he tries to rape and gets no answer, it damages his ego. When Berkeley comes out of the canals and reports the crime to the police, the police who remember the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay Leturno simply do not believe here. Sevier's parents have everything they need to get a good promotional video about this for their boy. <br /> <br /> Seducing a student, which is the wrong name, if ever it was, is rubbish. After the beating, which Berkeley took for Showgirls, this television film did not become a career step up.
