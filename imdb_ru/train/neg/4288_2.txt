since this is the second part, comparing it with the first part ... <br /> <br /> A man who was strange in many places ... too many jumps in time, etc. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was really disappointed ... <br /> <br /> only in some places a bit of stupid actions ... and that's all .... <br /> <br /> they could make it better .... <br /> <br />
