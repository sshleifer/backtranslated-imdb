I manage the group to stop exploiting comedians, and I just spent the last 2 months listening to horrible stories from comedians who tried to audition for Last Comic Standing. If they don't have a GOOD agent, then they won't even have a chance to listen, so more than 80% of the comedians who appear are rejected before they can show someone that they have talent! If they did reach the audition, they told me that it was “predetermined” if they got a second chance. Therefore, what the viewer sees is NOT the best comics in the United States. <br /> <br /> If comics really get on the show, most of them will not get IMDb points. I know this because I received credits for all 6 seasons of the “Last Comic Performance”, and I don’t get paid for the work of producers. This is really a shame. A month ago, I asked Facebook for the latest Comics 7 on Facebook, why producers do not give IMDb points, but they banned me on their Facebook page !!! I am not a comedian, so I have no personal interest in this. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to see that ANY is exploited, and that is why I help comedians. Comedians are operated on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is the BIG THREE network, so those responsible for it should be ashamed of the possibility of this operation. <br /> <br /> Please watch this video comedian who became a victim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
