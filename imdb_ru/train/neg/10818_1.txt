After reading the novel before watching this film, I was extremely disappointed with the wooden game and arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel that this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte’s work and rather creates the impression of a petty love story. When the film is compressed by a short 2 hours, the film has lost many of the key features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a somewhat nervous plot with a slight grounding. There is no romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so it looks rather unexpected and unreasonable, because these two characters have such rare interaction that you can't help but think that their “love” is superficial. This is such an injustice to the Bronte novel: you have no impression of Jane's bizarre cheek and courage, which attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance, which attracts Jane to him. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor writing of the scripts, I think that some of the characters were portrayed very shrewdly, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, but overall the production was bad. If the script were better, perhaps the film would have been more successful. See “Jane Eyre” (1970) with Zela Clark and Timothy Dalton for outstanding production.
