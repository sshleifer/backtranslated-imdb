This is a poorly made, bad remake of the classic Parineeta Bimaldy. The story is based on the book of the same name by Sarata Chandra and is a distortion of the original. Well, you can appreciate a certain degree of creativity, but not imaginary creativity. It affects the actions of all, and the whole movie is a hoax. The choice of the word from the father of Shekar in the abuse of Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and painful and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) slaps Lolita is completely out of place with the flow of the film and characters, quite sharp for the senses, and it could be easily avoided. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is completely unsuitable for a film and a cheap trick to attract viewers. When creative work is not true to the original and destroys its spirit, the work falls apart. The song "piyu bole" is quite ok. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this film is the scene where Saif protects himself and rebel against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves praise. For these indicators, this film deserves 3 stars. The song and dance of Rekha smells like fiction, and it is put on. The song is melodic, but I remember that I heard it somewhere before, and if I'm not mistaken, the melody seems to have been plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, we agreed that times have changed from that time to the present. But then this film does not even reflect modernity. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers are increasingly obsessed with NRI and capturing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films ultimately do not belong to India or to any other part of the world.
