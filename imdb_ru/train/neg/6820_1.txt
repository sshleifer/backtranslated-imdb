This stupid, implausible story is redeemed only by the opening scene, in which a hard-boiled police detective utters several almost audible lines confirming our greatest fears: he is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved if the director had abandoned A. Martinezâ€™s dazzling stellar power in favor of this sadly anonymous actor, who briefly filled the screen. The fact that a nameless hacker from the street can save such a film about water is no less likely than a villain who committed a murder by throwing stones at the quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is short; his promise is huge. Perhaps this obscure fan will devote more time to us on the screen if the sequel of this reckless movie ever appears.
