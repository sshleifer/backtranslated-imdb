(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actor" (and I freely use this term), which I have been trying to watch for over a year. I finally reached the end, and now I would like that I did not put a lot of effort. <br /> <br /> In order to save two hours of your life, I will tell you that he is a conspiracy of a guy who has the ability to put a long blade out of his hand and returns home to see his mother. Everything gets terrible after being beaten by an old girlfriend's mafia guy. He takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home. The guy, the mafia's mother, sends his people to get revenge, and the police also start looking for him. <br /> <br /> About this very little is said. in fact, nothing is given to explain (for example, why they are closing the identity of a friend in a shelter) and the action, for the most part, completely off-screen. In fact, the film consists of a guy who looks like Adrien Brody, looks tense and does not say anything, killing people (behind the scenes, most of the action takes place behind the scenes). It looks good, well played, and if there was any reason for what was going on, it could be a good movie. Hell, I would have liked some kind of real character development or background story (all we know is that the guy was chosen in childhood). The film passes most of two hours, and it seems that its six. If they were not going to tell us anything, they could at least speed up the pace, so it seemed that he was moving too fast. No, instead we get the hero on the boat. The hero is on the bus, the hero is walking, the hero looks alarmed. Hero with a girl. It really annoyed me, because I think it could be a good movie if they just did something or someone actually said something meaningful, except to give instructions to “get this guy.” <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 It's about four hours (all my attempts to see this), I will never come back. Only for those who want to see a thoughtful Russian action movie with a very small amount of action.
