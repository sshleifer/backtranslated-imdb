The progression of the plot is enough to “tie” and create curiosity about the result. Ultimately, however, the feeling remains that the producers of the film have forgotten to end this. If the intention was to create an eternal circle (sometimes it is done in the Twilight zone), it would be too careless to take it as a positive effort.
