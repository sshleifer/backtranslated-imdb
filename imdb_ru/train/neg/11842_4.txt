Kirsten Dunst is terribly overpriced as an actress. You can always say that she just "plays." I like izzard though. The plot is terribly boring. The viewer has no real connections with the characters, never knowing whom to actually sympathize with or even care about. A slow, boring movie, with a bit of laughter, but not very funny. The plot is not attractive or tense at least. You can see every turn of the plot at a distance of a mile. What should be this movie? Comedy? Drama? What's the difference? You will not be by the end of this movie.
