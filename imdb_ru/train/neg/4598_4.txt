The wife of a theater producer in London hopes to improve relations with the American singer and dancer, who played the main role in her husband’s last show, with a familiar American girl who makes her living in fashion in public circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already met on her own, with a girl who thinks that the guy is actually the producer of the show, married her friend (the fact that he does not wear a wedding ring should have prevented any misunderstandings!). The Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical was eventually dragged to the ground by the idiotic script of Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott, who is full of teenage behavior. Aster and Rogers do not just "meet the cute ones" - they meet ridiculously (he dances in the form of a crane, like a madman in a hotel room above her, and she complains). The audience in 1935 probably didn’t care how the two got together - as long as they did, and happily. Today, the central characters seem to have no motivation to find themselves in each other’s arms: he lays flowers to her (after telling his friend that he wants to remain "insane" in the love department), and she brushes him off, Nothing small dance could not cure! This charming couple is as deliberately unreal as the situation in London and Venice, but we see it simply because the leaders are Fred and Ginger. This is a fantasy for the have-nots ... those who do not mind a stupid conspiracy. Musical moments destroy the monotony of the far-fetched scenario, but they cannot surpass the surrounding stupidity. ** from ****
