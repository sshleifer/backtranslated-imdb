This show is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Horrible game, terrible effects, terrible letter, you understand my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood, it is amazing. Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. With the same success it could be called "Mr. Bland's New Adventures". <br /> <br /> Someone told me that if you have an imagination, you will like this show. This is a terrible approach to the show. Such visual tools should ignite your imagination, you do not need to force your imagination to do something good. It would be like an episode of the Simpsons, where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda film, and he starts talking about who killed whom or something else. "If the film is boring, I just make up my own story." <br /> <br /> In conclusion: an absolute human waste.
