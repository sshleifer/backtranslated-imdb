This film has let me down a lot. it was a great concept that was destroyed by a terrible scenario. The story simply did not flow and was fragmented at best. There were so many elements in this story that were not explained or made to act without any real thoughts. elements such as a love story could be expanded a little more, and you need to write better about guns. all that grew up, you need more about the training that he received, and less to stand. everybody likes the good story “the little guy overcomes,” and this showed a promise, but there should be no scripting errors. Despite the fact that in the final battle he had some pyrotechnics, he was dull due to the lack of choreography. it made for insanely boring hours <br /> <br /> it could be so good :(
