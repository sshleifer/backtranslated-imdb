Actress Patty Duke has written an insightful, funny, rude book about her career as an actress, her crazy love life, her insane depressive episodes and suicide attempts that have almost abandoned her. From this rich material that can be extracted (and Patty plays himself in the last act), you might think that a director like Gilbert Cates can put it all together in a film, but Call Me Anna is the dull shadow of the Duke’s autobiography. For those who have not read the book, a sketchy story (jumping forward in time) does not carry away, we are never allowed to navigate what is happening, and production seems backward due to low budget. The actors are wrong, and the value of the Herzog itself finally appearing does not pay off - at the moment the fake reality of the film is so thick that Patty cannot impart stability to the script. It seems that the producers were sincere enough (and prone to consciousness) to anxiously direct the film to the Duke’s final diagnosis and mental freedom, but they missed a lot of the dramatic possibilities in the process.
