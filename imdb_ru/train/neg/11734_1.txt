Tasteless. I can't even reasonably write about the movie. I laughed the whole movie. It should not have been funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he is doing. It seems his story is written without any knowledge of Iowa's culture and the problems of methamphetamine. I know that Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his film even more mysterious to me. Why do the two main characters have accents? It makes no sense. Acting was mediocre at best, and sometimes difficult to watch. Gracious violence and sex filled the film. I assume that violence and sex should have made the film poignant, but it seemed incredible and offensive. The ending of the film is so terribly bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the scandals with disbelief. When I left the theater, everyone who left was laughing with me. The end of the film was supposed to cause tears, but he did the exact opposite. Do not waste your time on this terrible film, unless you want to see the ignorant, well-fed, overworked, clich√©.
