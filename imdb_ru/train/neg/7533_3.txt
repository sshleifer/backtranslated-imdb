The film had some nice aspects. Perhaps too much for my taste. It seemed to me that the writer / director was desperately trying to make us feel the inner conflict of ALL of his characters. Not once, several times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is a television job, not a movie. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen, and I enjoyed the performance of Sasha Horler as a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt that Justin Clark’s performance was weak. Her reaction to things was forced, as if the director was trying to voice the themes of the film through the expressions of her main character. I also can’t believe that the director can turn the wonderful Daniel Farinacci into an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I can't figure out which choice of pop music is superimposed on whole sequences. This is a lazy device, especially where pop music comes from nowhere diagonally and / or where the lyrics of the song seem embarrassingly serious. <br /> <br /> However, the film has a fresh quality that causes Australian heat and a local relationship with originality. It creates an atmosphere of warmth and sun. Especially with the use of wonderful animated episodes that save the film from complete mediocrity, filling it with passion and charm of manual work. <br /> <br /> I’m curious why dialogue seems so overwhelmed. "Who knows if there is a god?" Like some guy who sits there in the sky and tells us what to do ”or something like that. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments was that a friend was returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife, “I quit smoking.” <br /> <br /> Advertising against smoking? TAC advertising with a taste of animation? I had to leave the cinema at the 50-minute mark - that was too much.
