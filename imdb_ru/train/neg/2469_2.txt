I suppose if you like the endless dialogue that does not convey the story, and the vivid effects of the camera, such as the scene transitions in the _Angel_ television show, you will like the movie. To me? Everything I wanted was a good, difficult little story, and it was not there. The move was almost backwards, the plot points were buried under a sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of fear, tension or NOTHING. <br /> <br /> This is a goon? Is it Wendigo? No, this is an operator at speed. It's not scary. It does not generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you are frightened by MTV. Like those reviewers who came before me, I also noticed that at the end the film caused a mocking laugh of the public. <br /> <br /> Horrible movie.
