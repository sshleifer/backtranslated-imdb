David Mamet is a very interesting and very unequal director. His first film “House of Games” was the one I liked the most, and he presented a series of films with characters whose views on life change as they get into difficult situations, and so does the viewer’s viewpoint. <br /> Same as Murder, which the title is trying to draw the viewer's attention to the usual crime drama. The main characters are two policemen, one Jew and one Irish who deal with racially charged territory. The murder of the old Jewish shop owner, who turns out to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli independence war, evokes Jewish identity in the mind and heart of a Jewish detective story. <br /> <br /> These were the disadvantages of the film are more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is the opera, and how the detective story ultimately leads to a final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is clever, like in Mameth, but disappointing in terms of human emotionality. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong results, but the shortcomings of the story are too obvious to be easily compensated.
