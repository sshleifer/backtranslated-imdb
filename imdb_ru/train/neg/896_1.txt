This movie is terrible. Not insulting, but extremely predictable. The film tells about the life of the family of a small town in the mid 60s. The father, the principal, is experiencing a midlife crisis. Get to know a pretty teacher from a big city who is starting to challenge the minds of her students with the help of some thought-provoking things, for example, think for yourself. The director does not agree with her teaching, but she is beautiful. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder, girlfriend Tara Frederick) is tired of living in a small town and wants to live. She receives bad advice, communicates with bad guys, and, obviously, in her school they did not teach family planning. Outrageous! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro worked mainly on television, this film plays like a more adult version of a special extra-curricular program or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.
