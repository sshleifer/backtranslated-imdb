I did not know whether to laugh or cry over this distortion of Canadian history, especially at the disservice of the history of the Mounted Police in the Yukon. <br /> <br /> I’ll leave it to Pierre Burton, noted historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the final history of the gold rush Klondike, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899, to express his displeasure with this by a stupid film: <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​an unbridled border, conquered by individual heroes armed with six guns, was continued in “Far Country,” another story about a cowboy from the American West - this time in Wyoming - driving a flock beef cattle in the golden country. The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibility, but the real discrepancy is the main assumption on which the plot unfolds. that during the gold rush in the whole of the Canadian Yukon there was only one mounted police officer, and that he could not cope with lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the border of the Yukon with their cattle, the customs booth is empty. <br /> <br /> “Where is the constable?” asks Brennan. <br /> <br /> "Up on Pelly" River. Problems with chilkats, someone answers. He has a very hard job, this constable. He patrols about ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he does not return home two or three months at a time. <br /> <br /> The historical truth is that the Yukon territory during the gold rush was closest to the police state that British North America had ever seen. The North-West Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in significant quantities long before the Klondike strike. They controlled every path in the Yukon and did not tolerate folly. They collected customs duties, often over the screams of newcomers, locally passed arbitrary laws on river navigation and returned people back if they did not have enough supplies or they simply looked bad. In this Canadian way, they set moral laws for the community. In Dawson, the law of the Day of the Lord was strictly enforced; it was a crime punishable by a fine on Sunday to cut wood; and plump young women were arrested for what the police with a stern face called "risky performance in the theater", as a rule, nothing more than an impressive dance on stage in too outspoken pantyhose. <br /> <br /> In such a community, the belt was unthinkable. One infamous bad man from Tombstone, who was trying to pack a weapon in his hip, was personally disarmed by a young constable, who had just kicked him out of the saloon for a monstrous crime involving loud conversations. The bad man left as a lamb, but he protested when the policeman, finding that he had a gun, told him to hand it over. “No one has taken the gun from me yet,” said the American. “Well, I take it back,” the constable said softly and did it without further resistance. In Dawson, so many revolvers were confiscated that they were sold at auction by the police for just a dollar and bought as souvenirs for storing a mantel. <br /> <br /> In 1898, in the big year of the crush, was it not a serious crime ?? not to mention the murder ?? in dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless city, ruled by Soapi Smith, a confidant of Denver, was remarkable. But in “The Far Country”, Dawson is seen as a community without any law, what kind of character is soap Smith from Skagway ?? His name is Gannon in the picture ?? can easily control. (In real life, one of the people of Smith, who was trying to cross the border, had all his equipment confiscated and was again shot directly by a sergeant of the mounted police). <br /> <br /> {in the movie the lonely muni says} “Yes, I am the law. I represent the law in the territory of the Yukon. About fifty thousand square miles of it. " <br /> <br /> “Then why are you no longer there?” <br /> <br /> “Because yesterday it was a wilderness. We didn’t expect you to flow in by the thousands. Now that you're here, we protect you. " <br /> <br /> “When?” <br /> <br /> “A post will be created here in Dawson in early May.” <br /> <br /> “What happens in the period from May to May? Will you be here to keep order? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. "<br /> <br />" And what about the rest of the time? "<br /> <br /> “Choose a good person for yourself. Swear it in. Let it act as a marshal ??” <br /> <br /> The film “Mount” goes off and no longer appears in the picture. Its an amazing offer ?? that the American city marshal, full of tin stars, will be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence ?? accepted Naturally, they want to make Jimmy Stewart a marshal; He is clearly coming from the side. But Stewart plays the role of a loner, who looks after the number one, and therefore the other person is chosen to be shot. And he does. Others are shooting. Even Walter Brennan is shot. Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must finish the whole shooting with his own shooting. He pins the tin star, and he and the bully Gannon explode at each other in the inevitable western climax. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows about the Canadian north, this bald retelling of the story goes through a rational conviction. <br /> <br /> ??
