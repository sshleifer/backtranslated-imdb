I watched the whole movie, in which they recognized the participation of William Hert, Natasha McElhon and Desiree Nosbush. I'm glad I had no idea about the presence of Peter Weller. At the end of the film, I said "WHAT IS Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr. Weller for outstanding performance. Weller played a major role, and his game was such that I did not even recognize him. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot was bad, the writing was bad, and the performances, except Nosbusch and Weller, were inappropriate. The scenery and setting was interesting, and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of a possible 10.
