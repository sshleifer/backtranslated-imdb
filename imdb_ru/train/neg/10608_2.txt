I don’t think any Van Damme movie will ever beat Universal Soldier, but you will never know. This film was good, but not as good as the 1st. VD returns Luke and must fight again. He tries 2b funny here, but it could be worth a grin. VD has a child from Ellie W. this time, it’s good that he showed them photo 2. Goldberg was cool, he makes his famous move - he forgot what it was called because I don’t watch the fight-sludge. VD & Goldberg had some good fights. It was the final, as 1st, but just not so good. VD is doing everything in his career, as always - HELICOPTER KICK. Although the final was supposed to be longer. In any case, it is worth a look, but it will never surpass the original.
