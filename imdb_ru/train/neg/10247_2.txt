This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, it's terrible. Christopher Lee is good, but he is unlikely in this, the only good part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the name. “The End of the World” is a really bad film, I stopped watching it towards the end, it was so bad, only for hard-working bi-film fans who had the sense to hold out on this vomiting.
