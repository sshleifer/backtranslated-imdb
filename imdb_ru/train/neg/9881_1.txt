Bo Derek's debut film went unnoticed for eight years ?? and it should have stayed that way! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director, is he actually Ed Wood of an erotic movie ?? not that this was particularly obvious, considering that Bo (atypically sporty dark hair) was only 16 years old when the film was made! John also wrote and photographed it; Does the latter lead to some decent footage of the Greek island settlement, against which the story is set? but the plot is childish and the dialogue is brutal! <br /> <br /> The character played by the protagonist Peter Hooten was raised in the Bo family: they grew up like a brother and sister, but now that they have become adolescents, they find that they are attracted to each other (but As I said don't expect any sexy fireworks!). However, the worst thing about it is the fact that all the main characters have an obsession throughout the film, which is not only stupid in itself, but also annoying in their tireless life ?? Huten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and continues to expect the appearance of a cruise liner (which, of course, happens in the final); Is Derek still crazy ?? she is eager to own a big antique bathroom !! For reference, the couple gets married at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The mayor of the city and the photographer Lothario, who wants to make a model from Bo (and who naturally incurs the wrath of the jealous Guten) also participate in non-events. From time to time, without any good reason, we even turn to excerpts from the display of old Hollywood classic films in an open-air cinema, in which a whole city gathers (among the named names is the ENEMY OF THE SOCIETY [1931])! At the end of the day, while Ba’s naivety for some time is undeniably charming, it is not enough to compensate for the film’s overwhelming haze and amateurism.
