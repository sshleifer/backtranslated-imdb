I remember how I loved this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I saw. It was an ultra-high-tech for its time. It can repel enemy fire, do all kinds of acrobatics in the air and destroy almost everything in its path. Now I come back and watch it today and wonder how lousy this show really is. The caste members are hardly convincing, there are many funny moments, and the battle scenes are incredibly fake. And almost every end has the same combat crap of a helicopter with the apparent re-use of low-quality grainy video. Many plots seem to date from the era of the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has basically the same theme as the Knight Rider, except that a helicopter is used instead of a helicopter as a means of fighting crime. After watching a few episodes, I felt very bored. I, however, love the theme music.
