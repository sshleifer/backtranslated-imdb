I remember watching this film in '86 when it first came out, and what a horrible film. The acting was terrible, the plot was so fragile that he had to or should have broken off with a breath of wind. I think it put me to sleep more than once, and I'm not tired of what I remember. Please avoid at all costs, better still remove all the teeth without anesthesia, because it would be more exciting. It is a pity that I could not give him a zero or a negative result. I wish I did not waste my money on getting it from the video store, and all I can say is that the tape he was on was still brand new, which is not surprising because was so bad. If I remember correctly, I sat and watched it with the girl with whom I really wanted to go out, and the fact that she was sitting next to me was still not enough to keep me from falling asleep, that's how bad this film is.
