It was supposed to be one of the most terrible fighters in the entire history and saved only 2 matches. Hard match between Edge and Mick Fowley, as well as Vince McMahon vs. Sean Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete flushing, and, frankly, I almost fell asleep, it was so inept that the box match didnâ€™t have the worthy appearance of The Undertaker, and the match between Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke If you really a big fan of WWE and missed the early days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you will probably like it. But I found that this Restlemania left much to be desired.
