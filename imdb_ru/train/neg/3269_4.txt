If it were not for actress Meryl Streep, who, as always, is noticeable, I would have avoided this film, because it has the outdated quality of Cinema of the Week. But it’s worth seeing if you remember a few highlights: how the couple maintains control over the media and how they are treated. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the problem lies in the reliability of various. Australians are different from “us” (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically face them with “weirdness” regarding them. The couple involved is religious (different from most of the culture) and Adventists (another) in this. Thus, their way of life and way of thinking are suspected from the very beginning. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so we are again confronted with questions about weirdness. The real story, therefore, is how society (and the world) treats different, those with different accents, different beliefs, than us, and how we treat what they say as a suspect. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to hear the phrase "Dingo took my child!" without laughter and there are humorous messages, unfortunately, throughout the network about it. But over the years that followed the story and the film, it was discovered (as you will find in a search on the net) that dingos are being pursued by much larger children. Studies conducted by dingo experts have shown that not only is it possible, but most likely that the child was taken dingo (perhaps as a pair), skillfully removed from clothing and eaten within a few minutes without a trace. <br /> <br /> However, the question remains as to why people defended the dingo, when it was established that they endanger children and not kill the dingo to save children, why, because the expression (expression) of a woman so cold she is considered guilty and on and on. <br /> <br /> Frequently asked questions, with or without film.
