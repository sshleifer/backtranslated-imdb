Two old men sit on a bench in the park. I really have no problems with this scene - the only problem is that this is not the scene, but the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, movies have no lower notion than this. They also do not become more boring than this, but this is even worse, because these two old men are chalk and cheese. One of them is Nat Moyer, a Yiddish communist, and the other is Midge Carter, the former gold gloves champion, also black. Let me see, a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench get along well. Well, I think that this is possible, although unlikely, but if such an innocent script is in this film, why play along with the Jewish stereotype? Why make them loud tribalistic scammers who give oaths in Hebrew? It is a bit ironic that the Jews, who were seen at the beginning of the film, are precisely those Jews who were seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> In addition to stereotypes, the problem with “I AM NOT A RAPAPTOR” is that it is. ”It is written for a completely different film than a film, based on a stage play and shows. Walter Mattau moans his role as Nat, while this commentator has almost slept the entire movie.
