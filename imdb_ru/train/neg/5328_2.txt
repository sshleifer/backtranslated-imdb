Susan Zaydelman seems to have made a decent career, having gained several top-quality points. Of course, I am glad that she recovered from this film, which seems to have its fans. I am not one of them. <br /> <br /> I have seen a better game in high school than in Smithereens. In a story like this, young Susan Berman is involved, who is ambitious to penetrate the world of music and is ready to do anything to get there. She even rejects the sincere successes of the young artist, who lives in his van at the East River by Brad Rein. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rain plays the worst role in the film, actually one of the worst acting work I've seen in a long time. It is not surprising that he did not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> I’ll say that Seidelman looks at the camera well, shooting familiar places in the East Village, where they mostly made the film. But her work with her live performers was not appropriate. I'm not sure that she had so much raw material to work with him. <br /> <br /> Look quickly and you’ll see very young Christopher Nota before “Law Enforcement and Sex in the City” as a street vendor. <br /> If you like punk rock, you can listen to the soundtrack. I will stick to Bing Crosby.
