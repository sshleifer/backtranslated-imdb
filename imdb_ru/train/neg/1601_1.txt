The stereotypical set of slasher films is far from the intended entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zayn Busby, and in fact the entire cast is completely wasted. Lame jokes abound, and each highlight is well wired. Deaf liners go at a fast pace, and almost every one of them falls down like crushed grapes. Musical numbers only contribute to boredom, which begins and lasts for the entire film. Another disadvantage is the claustrophobic situation entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid this and find one of the really funny "Lampoon" movies such as "Golddiggers National Lampoon" - MERK
