This is the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few films. It is issued as a feature film, but it is really a piece of garbage. This one redeeming quality is a beautiful tango dance, but this cannot compensate for the disgustingly obvious tribute to Sally Potter to herself. The plot of this film is missing, and I guarantee that you will begin to laugh until the end. Especially where she starts to sing. It is absolutely unreal.
