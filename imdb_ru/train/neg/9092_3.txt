Freon Freleng's “Speed ​​Gonzalez” was the second cartoon to feature the title character after “Cat's Tails for Two” by Robert McKimson. In this cartoon, Speedy was an ugly little creature with a big golden tooth, but after its second appearance the famous design has already been adopted. Despite the fact that Speedy looked much more beautiful, he never developed as a character. A big hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not make a classic character, and that’s almost all that Spidy ever had for him. However, the cheeky little mouse turned out to be extremely popular and starred in many shorts, including some of the truly terrible films of the last days of the studio. While these early Speedy shorts are better than the later atrocities in which he was often (rather strangely) paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable fun, usually based on a similar chase formula. In this episode of the same name, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from a local factory that is protected by cat Sylvester. Although he adds extra weight to the stellar turn in the cartoon, the role of Sylvester here can be just as easily performed by any other universal cartoon cat. His personality is undermined by the fact that he was forced to predict. undemanding role of pursuer. This has always been a problem in Tweety cartoons, but Speedy becomes an even more stupid opponent because of his hideous audacity and blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester will be forced to appear next to Speedy for many years. Despite this, following a fairly simple formula and demonstrating the minimum amount of laughter, Speedy Gonzalez won an Oscar, and a well-deserved star was born.
