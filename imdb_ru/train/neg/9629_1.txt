Fortunately, I saw it for free and would like it to be better than it was, but these are really the same things that film studios seem to impose on us over the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple of opposites - and yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If this storyline doesn’t take you by surprise and captures you, the film also doesn’t work. <Br /> <br /> a lot of jokes and jokes. In the middle of the film, I began to realize that Ben Stiller wasn’t really that funny, but he was trying very hard. And Jennifer Aniston is really not so beautiful, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman must have paid a considerable amount of money for participating in this regular film, I expected more from them. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that I saw it after seeing American Splendor, which is a really funny and original film - and I compared these two in my head, and found that I wanted so that the filmmakers would have to watch these two films closely - perhaps this would give them some meaning, and <br /> <br /> they would start making better films with unknowns, and not with this formula thing that is best plays on airplanes.
