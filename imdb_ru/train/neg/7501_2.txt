I went to this film, expecting a brief film concerning the influence that Son Sam had on society. I did not expect that Spike Lee would force me to feed on garbage because of racial tensions, the mafia or the inability of an ordinary citizen to make a choice under pressure from peers. Lee expressed an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> An entire film could be more effective if it were in a 90-minute format with more focus and fewer tangential scenes. <br /> <br /> Don don’t even rent a video if you don’t like Spike Lee; in this case, the theater is worth it. This is not an escapist film.
