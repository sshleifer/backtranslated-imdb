This is an attempt by both author Edgar Rice Burroughs and directors to make the Arabic Tarzan of the Apes. But in this film, filmed in the desert, there is not a single magnificent gift in Burroughs' more successful adventure in the jungle. The focus is on the love between handsome English nobleman John Hall (as “El Lion” Chatham) and exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (as “princess” Yulila), where revenge coincides with their desire to merge. The discovery says that, although the guilty behavior is unworthy, the boy's mother is alive, but she never enters the picture. Unfortunately, the “Lion Man” has deteriorated, and it looks like there are no frames in it. <br /> <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ John Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
