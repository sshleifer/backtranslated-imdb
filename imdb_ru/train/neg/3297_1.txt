Why make a show that millions of us watched and loved, like children, and joke about it? They ask why Hollywood does not earn the money he used before. Because they produce garbage and pay the actors huge amounts of money to become garbage collectors, and ask us to pay 10 dollars to see their garbage. The TV show was the way it was, good people in bad situations, when the good guys from IL come out on top. This is not Gone with the Wind, but it was fun. This film is rubbish! Hollywood can't think of anything original, so they take something good and spoil it for $$$$. I only hope that this film will be 10 times cheaper than it. The only ones who can have fun with this shit are the guys who should be led by General Lee. The audience is a victim. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t see it; instead watch TV show replays. They still hold 20 years later.
