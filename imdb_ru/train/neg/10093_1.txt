I can't believe the blockbuster is wearing this movie. It was so bad. I was completely fooled by the art of the box. DO NOT THINK !! It is not worth your time, I promise you. I do not know whether there have been positive reviews for this film or what it is. I am so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box doesn’t even fit! The girl who does voodoo on her is a stripper. In the synopsis on the back, she is 17 years old. they want to watch it!? These positive reviews were supposed to be just a joke. If someone really liked this film, then I lost all faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> And don’t even start telling the story compared to the title. Or because the whole film was shot in two places, or that the cops didn't even have a real uniform. than me in general, "Who cares about police uniforms!" Compared to the rest of the film, they were found on the form. <br /> <br /> This film insults the genre of zombies and all his fans.
