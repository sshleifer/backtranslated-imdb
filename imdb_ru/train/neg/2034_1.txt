Very bad indeed. How is such a bad movie? I kept on waiting for some kind of storyline, interesting camera work, or at least some unwarranted nudity, but I didn't get anything. I just looked at the Cabin Fever and thought it was a train wreck (with the exception of nudity and pancakes), but it looks ingenious compared to this tree. The best screenwriter in the world could not have saved this rotten pile of stinky poop. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could happen to this “movie” is that it ended. I have a headache, I just think about this movie and try to write something. Ugh! I am glad that I paid only $ 5 for this, and it will soon be at the dump.
