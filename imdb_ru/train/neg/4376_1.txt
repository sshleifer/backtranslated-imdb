Well, the plot, wait, you understand me, there is no really noticeable plot, only a series of optically fogged sex scenes, connected together by scenes of photographers filming lovely ladies (sometimes a combination of two). Then the demon comes around the killings. men rape and kill women and rebel poetic about the meaning of life. In addition to the idiotic special effects, bad acting and a strange philosophy, you get what you expect from a movie with that title. I think it should be someone's cup of tea, but not mine, since I still have to watch a good movie directed by Kazuo Gaira, Komizu. <br /> <br /> More info on DVD: interview with director Kazuo Comizou, part 1 (Part 2 is on the Entrails of Beautiful Woman DVD); and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> My rating: F
