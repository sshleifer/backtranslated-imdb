First of all, what good is a movie? What a beautiful actress? exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh during the game (I would do if I were in their situation)? I dont know. The plot is simple: a Catholic priest engaged in abstract painting is trying to find out who (another abstract artist) killed his younger brother, a male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...) I'm afraid there is nothing to learn or to allow think about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of the “profiler” (series) with replacement of actors and incredible coincidences (uncle is a policeman who, a girl who lives in the house of another victim, can give birth to a child from a priest, etc., etc.).
