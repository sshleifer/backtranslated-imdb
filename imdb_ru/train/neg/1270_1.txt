Herkulis Poirot is, in general, a well-known “hero” whom we know well from books and films. This film or this story does not work, and I felt that this was not Agatha’s mistake. The cast is bad, the actors are too exaggerated and make stupid gestures, the costumes are so clean and neat that everyone (even Arab clothes) looks fake, and for a serious viewer who thinks twice that this film can be viewed instead of a comedy of a mysterious drama. The actor playing Herkulis Poirot does a good job, but nothing fantastic. The scenes, as before, are perfect and look fake. The story is not very charming, although the mystery of murder, but who cares about the death of a crazy and angry blonde woman over 45 years old in the desert of Iraq ?! "Victim" is not pleasant.
