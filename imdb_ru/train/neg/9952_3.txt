Just wrote to a friend who is in film school about this film. Something that should be avoided when making a film - the characters chatter meaningless, frazzled, confused monologues on the screen, which are ultimately banal and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barriers are so excessive that they actually draw attention to the film, designed as a film, and effectively neutralize this intention. Is this a bad game or a script, or both? <br /> <br /> The main character is also incredible for social realism - he eagerly consumes canonical English literature and the Bible, when he is hung over or hangover, and is capable of producing such deeply second-year monologues while intoxicated? And how is such an unattractive, unwashed, and verbally poisonous character able to put most of the women with whom he meets within a few minutes after meeting them? (I had to applaud when one chick finally threw him outside, despite his moan and self-pity). <br /> <br /> The viewer is confronted with pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus, and the Book of Revelation. The impending doom of humanity in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in a creepy biblical manner, is presented to a character who is so cleverly exposed in his role as a keeper of empty space. <br /> <br /> This film is rewritten and excessive - melodrama, clumsily imbued with a pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of humanity, life, etc. It is commonplace, overloaded and tiring. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English movies with content similar to this movie. Nil by Mouth is an excellent, much more interesting excursion in the lives of people in a similar social environment. The same for "In the battle zone". And although the comparison is not even justified, look at something from Peter Greenaway, who is much more clever at handling dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.
