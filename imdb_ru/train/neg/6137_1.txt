Phew What can be said about Gimcat, what else is not? It is nothing but pure galarity from beginning to end. If you want a movie that makes you laugh on the floor, this is the perfect movie for you. From the combo in the wild Cabot style of mullet / sweater to Parmistan (and these are four billion different ninjas), everything in this film smells like crap. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Kluz, the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in Bruce Lee's The Game of Death, he again demonstrates his complete lack of directorial talent. A few other people you probably don’t recognize will also appear for your enjoyment, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, although you won’t remember them or take care of them after the movie ends. <br /> <br / Allegedly based on a book called Awful Game, in which, if I could find at least some trace of its existence, I would be interested to read it to see where this thing went wrong . Instead, the book is obviously a figment of the imagination of Himca. Probably, Cluse came up with something to sell his unfortunate idea. <br /> <br /> Pick it up and Yakmalla for yourself. This is easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that says a lot.
