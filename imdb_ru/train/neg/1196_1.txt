Like in the movie with Amy, Posey and Rachel, is NOTHING ANYTHING? Believe it or not, Home Rabbit made it better and funnier. I hope that the leaders had a good holiday and they got some money - this film confuses them all. It's a cliché from start to finish. Cliches can work well with the script or, at least, with the idea. This film only uses clichés for clichés, not ideas or scripts. He uses pre-existing characters of actresses, and does not develop characters. Bad, sad and rubbish. Now I, apparently, need ten lines of text for comment. Indeed? What for? As an IT manager, this is another example of careless coding.
