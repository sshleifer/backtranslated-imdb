After a quasi-gothic, fully fruity music video, the film begins with the vocalist Cassidy kills herself. In an ideal world that would be this, and the end credits would roll. We do not live in this world. The soulless band members decide to go to some clown in order to connect with her dead essence. When I say clown, I mean a real clown. He tells them that they will all die from the ghost of Cassidy (the spirit belongs to Dora, one of the partners in the group). We didnâ€™t care, since all the characters are boring, dull and extremely awful acting. Written by Adam Hackbart (an unbelievable last name if ever there was), and directed by Corbin Timbruk (who, after the Watchman and Tower of Blood, MUST know that he continues to do shit for life), this film is a constant battle between the incompetence of the film and the viewer's to be awake Not enough blood to calm the hounds, and not enough nudity to satisfy the perverts. In fact, in this film there is absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely everyone. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway becomes topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on demand
