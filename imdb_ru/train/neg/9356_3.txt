Before her untimely death, Marilyn Miller shot only three films - “Amazing Sally” (1929), “The Comedy of Her Majesty's Love” (1931) and this little thing - “Sunny” (1930). She is rather poor both as an early walkie-talkie and as an attempt at a musical — although she has four dance numbers, she sings only two songs (WHO? AND ONE PERSON A ONE). The rest of the score, including the spontaneous title melody, is discarded, although we can hear the last one in the background scoring. Miller here looks overweight and amateurish - without star quality. Even her dance is stupid. The film is written very badly, full of boring and unfunny jokes and stupid situations. If you are interested in Miller as a performer, by all means, check him out, but for general entertainment, stay away.
