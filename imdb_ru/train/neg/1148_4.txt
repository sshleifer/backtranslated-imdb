Pedantic, overly long production, which is trying to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It starts quite promisingly, with still relevant research on the explosion of the plane, but the melodrama with the participation of James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles only interferes (Miles had a habit of playing cool wives under duress, and her tattered nerves arrive here right on the schedule). Dear director Mervyn Leroy led this adaptation of Don Whitehead’s book, but despite his talent, the picture doesn’t make much of an impression. As a partner of Stuart, Murray Hamilton considers himself the best performer, but most of the dialogue is ridiculous, and the stubborn tempo makes the film seem twice as long as it is. * 1/2 of ****
