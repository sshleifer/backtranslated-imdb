European Vacation (National Lampoon European Vacation) is the weakest of the Vacation films (the first and third best of the films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return to the role of Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they are given a weaker scenario with a very poor dialogue. It makes pacing suffer, and the jokes are not funny at all. To be more specific, what really makes this film suffer is the fact that “jokes”, like them, are simply inserted together in the cobblestone script), instead of serving as a central plot, like the other 3 release films. Oh, well, they can't beat them all. 4 out of 10
