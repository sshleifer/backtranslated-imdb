I think I'm late for a party. I just saw this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I did not know that it exists, and was completely ready to watch the 1963 film version when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I played Albert for a long time, and I think about putting on an amateur production of the show, because I remembered that it was a lot of fun. I was not impressed with this new version. It just wasn't enough fun. It was not colorful. He lacked the abundance of youth. The lighting was bad. It seemed no one mentioned this fact. This is not a capricious musical, it is bright and successful. The decision about the lighting was a bad creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye, Birdie is a farce, a comedy of mistakes. I do not feel this in this version. The lighting was terrible, and it dulled the general characteristics. The dance numbers also seemed anemic. We have music videos today. At the very least, dance numbers had to compare with some of the best, or like some of the best on Broadway. It seemed that the choreographer was asleep at the wheel. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that all the actors were highly talented, there were some really bad actors. Vanessa Williams is not a Latina, and with so many talented Latin singers, it would be better to play one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is an African American, sweet and talented, but poor cast. Jason Alexander's efforts were astounding, he always does smart work, but he just wasnâ€™t Albert. It was mistakenly accepted, and I think that this is obvious to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is not scenic. There must be a transfer from one carrier to another. The abundance and the flash of the stage musical must be transferred to the cinema. It makes no sense to be faithful to the stage scenario when it is removed. The spirit, the essence of production must be disclosed. For me, the production of the film Bye Bye Birdy in 1963 was bright and lively, while the production of 1995 was as gloomy as the lighting, and as dim as the dance numbers. This turned out to be an unsuccessful waste of the efforts of many truly talented people.
