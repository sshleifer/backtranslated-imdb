This movie is just not worth your time. His reliance on the mystic New Age is only his semi-interesting distraction. The plot is repeated countless times. <br /> <br /> I was even asked to spend time to add a comment when I noticed that some were trying to maintain the reputation of this nonsense. Their motivation and objectivity are dubious, as they encourage you to look not at the flaws of cinema, but at its well-meaning message of the consciousness of the New Era. <br /> <br /> Would it be good for twenty to thirty evangelical Christians, or are Islamic fundamentalists pouring positive ratings on films / television that support their views? Despite the poor quality of production or lack of truth in any of its alleged historical grounds? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the followers will come right behind me to say interesting things about this film, despite the truth.
