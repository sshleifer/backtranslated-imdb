What an empty and not brilliant performance of the classic novel. I would very much like people to stop messing with the classics when they clearly have no idea about the real intention or essence of the original. This version is no different. I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version is much worse, though, since casting Juliette-Buns, like Katie, should be the worst casting solution EVER ... anyway, go back to this version. It seeks to make history relevant in contemporary settings and in musical style. He succeeds in both, but in high art it is nothing. Maybe a clumsy view on a rainy day ... The direction was average, and editing was deplorable. Worse than old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a great turn as Hindley and is in fact one of Britainâ€™s lost talents. The role of Heath was performed with great charm and faith, and I think the casting is the strength of this project. Although a more talented director could better use his opportunities. It is clear that he was the director of employment and did not instill the project with the passion he deserved.
