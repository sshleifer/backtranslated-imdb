This mess is so bad that it cannot even be considered as horror. <br /> <br /> In this film, Debbie Rochon's talent is completely wasted. She is not even a villain. The rest of the actors look like porn imitators and the plot is so lame I won't even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip to the captions to hear the upcoming TwoMarlowe band perform â€œBetter Than Sex" - this is just a disco song of the 80s. A good tempo song about Gambleing & Sex. More interesting than Bleed ". Let's say this: when you have equipment for copying video, but you decide to record only a song at the end of a movie, you really have an" BAD "movie.
