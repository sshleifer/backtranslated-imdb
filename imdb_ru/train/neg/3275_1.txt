DON'T LOOK THIS FILM IF YOU LOVED THE CLASSIC SUCH AS ROTATED, JOHN SCHNEIDER, KATHRIN BACH, SORRELL BEECH, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYL, SONNY SCHROYER AND BEN JONES! THIS FILM HORRELY REMAINS YOU! First of all, this film begins with the fact that Bo and Luke play the moonshine of Jesse. Bo and Luke will never do this in a real series! This film depicts unimaginable characters doing things that would never happen on the show. In the series, Uncle Jessie was honest and law-abiding. In this film, he is a criminal who makes moonshine and smokes weed with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if it were an extension added to the Dukes of the Reunion of Hazzard! and with the dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW CAN UNT JESS GET A LUNAR AMOUNT WHEN HE DIED TO THE HEADS OF HAZZARD IN THE HOLLY FILM? AND AS A GREAT HOGG ALIVE, WHEN HE DIED BEFORE A REVIUS FILM IN 1997! FILM AND ROSKO RAN HAZZARD? VERY MUCHIC THAT THESE CHARACTERS HAVE COME TO RETURN TO LIFE WHEN THEY ARE DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good film, they should have returned James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach, as they did in 1997 and 2000, and made a film for the whole family with live original characters who they made the show what it was and is still compared to this disgusting, dishonored film! If you want to watch good movies with the dukes, buy the original series or go to walmart.com and buy a DVD-set of 2, including Reunion and The Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! Both of them are filmed in the original line-up and are family friendly! Do not waste your time on a movie that is not worth the CD on which it is written!
