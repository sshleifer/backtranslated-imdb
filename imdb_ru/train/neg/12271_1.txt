Screenwriter Lisa Lutz began writing the script at the age of 21 in 1991. <br /> <br /> Is she even in business? If someone gave her another chance after this shit, she claims to be the “Lucky Person” award. This film sucks, does not end ... It never ceases to amaze me what turns into a movie ... and the fact they forced this writer to postpone it for a while? Seriously? I can write better than this in a dream. <br /> <br /> OK, how many lines do I need to type? I do not understand this at all. I guess I'm new. I guess I do not understand why there should be a limit to what someone has to say ... or a quota? Seriously, I don't care if you have a one-word sentence ... or even one word of answer. I mean, come on? <br /> <br /> Thank you ... is that enough, finally? <br /> <br /> This movie is useless.
