I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers. Even the DVD cover looked good. As soon as I started watching him, I thought, like others: “My God, what is it.” There were some moments that were a bit creepy, but then the mood was spoiled by silly music. Rock and Opera were during what was supposed to be tense. It immediately destroyed it for me, and I shook my head, thinking, damn it, I spent the money on rent again and was deceived by the cover. Nothing contradicted the music itself, it was just in the wrong parts of the film. Whoever edits the film, he has no idea what they are doing. There was lightning on the cover, implying that they were caught in a storm at sea. It would be more interesting, but it did not happen. The game was not the worst I've ever seen, considering that they are all unknown, and this is obviously their first film. Another reason why I was disappointed was that the plot did not make sense. In the beginning, 2 men saw all the teenagers get into the Boat, then at the end there was supposedly only 1 girl, and the rest were either her imaginary friends or ghosts, I'm not sure because it was very badly depicted. WhyteFox, who wrote a comment here, argues that this is a true story. He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says that there is a haunted boat in the area where this film was shot. It was not mentioned in this film that this is a true story. I have never come across anything of the kind personally, but I don’t say that this is impossible. I think if someone is interested in renting this film, do it at your own risk. If you like amateur horror films for students, you might like it.
