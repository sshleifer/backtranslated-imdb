I rated Basic Instinct 2 highly, but this film received less than 4 points. This film received only 4 from me, but 7.3 out of more than 600 people. I see no reason why they like this film so much. <br /> <br /> This film is boring because it hardly leaves these rooms in this ruined big house. And in this film only 5 people. It is almost two hours, which is completely unnecessary. Many of the dialogues are slow and meaningless. The tone of the film is also dark blue, which depresses viewing. The film can be reduced to several sentences. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of “Three Times” by director Hou Xiao Xianyang, that one is just as boring, the dialogues are equally equally boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching this movie after the first story ended. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks passion or excitement.
