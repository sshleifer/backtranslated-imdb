The Dream Child of 1989 is the fifth film in the (as a rule, overvalued) TV series Nightmare, and after this time, the series became rubbish. The only good films in the series were the original 1984 Wes Craven and the third installment of the 1987 Dream Warriors. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part, in which the former terrible crazy Freddy Krueger began to irritate him with constant idiotic jokes. In this fifth recording of the series, one can hardly recommend anything, other than (admittedly magnificent) visual effects and one eerie scene, memories of how Freddy Krueger appeared. The rest of the film consists mainly of our clawed maniacs, turning into jokers, screaming stupid unidirectional lines, and the old formula of a group of teenage donkeys who are desperately trying to avoid falling asleep because the good old Freddy is waiting for them in his dreams. Lisa Wilcox returned in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting nonsense, such as the super-dull "creepy" children's rhyme, was added for no other reason than to have some kind of excuse for creating this redundant and boring sequel. In short: no originality, just the decline of the old formula and the overload of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is associated with great visual effects, and especially to highlight the difference with the horrible next sequel to Freddy's Dead, which is terribly incredible. If you are not the hardcore enthusiast of Freddy Krueger, “Dream Child” should be avoided, and even if it is, it is likely to disappoint.
