Major Payne is a major film that turns life into hell for its small group of boys in the marines. This film really cannot offer a lot of interesting things, but there are some funny moments in it that are worth seeing. Do not expect this to be an unforgettable film, however. Just expect to make fun of the film at the expense of other people. The standoff between Major Payne and the chubby guy was hilarious, and this is really all I remember about the film, with the exception of boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, this is not a very good movie, and it's best to watch it on a rainy day, when you need some laughter.
