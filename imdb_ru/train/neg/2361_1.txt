This movie is easily the worst of the series. Although New Line may just keep track of sales, they all know that the only reason this made more money than the previous one was related to its 3D ending. This is not to say that 3-D was good because it was 3D from the 50s with red and blue lenses (anaglyph.) It was just a fact that people wanted to see how it would look. In addition, this film was so poorly made! Bad script, bad characters, bad game, worse direction. This film is trying to push the camp factor almost to be like the episode of "Looney Tunes". <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for horror viewers, because it's trite and not scary, and not funny or funny for comedy crowds. Just a mess with some really bad cameos who are still trying to play this whole thing as a camp, and this is not what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember most of us who were fans of this series just prayed for it to end at this stage because of how bad it became. This is one of the films that helped remove the horror of popularity and instill the belief that viewers really want to laugh at some stupid comedy than to see a good and scary horror film.
