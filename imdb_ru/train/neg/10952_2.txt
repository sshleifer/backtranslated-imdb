I hate that this film has absolutely no creative input. I know that they are moving towards realism, but, to be honest, I just donâ€™t want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will live. Tell me an interesting story, and we'll talk. I can deal with low production costs, damn it, I'm addicted to low production costs, but at least I'm working on some good ideas. The direction goes only to take a video camera and walk a little, but obviously I have to dig it, because it makes things much more realistic. Hitchcock said that drama is, in fact, life with carved dull pieces. I can only conclude that this is not a drama, not a single shot. We see Rosetta going to some place, Rosetta working in a bakery, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosette dragging her bags along, Rosetta going home, Rosetta walking somewhere ... it's just not that interesting. There is no deeper meaning. I was so bored that I began to look for some thoughts about life in this film, but this is just plain realism, the most overvalued quality in business. I guess I should love this, but come on, there's nothing there.
