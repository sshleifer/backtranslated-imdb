The film opens with a long single shot of the aisles in a factory crowded with workers. You might think what we did with the planet. Hope we will see other similar things. <br /> <br /> This is very rare. When you do not look at the horribly shot corner of the narratorâ€™s narration in the lecture hall, you observe how he sets up his camera to take pictures in different places. It would be nice if he chose areas that are more relevant to his subject, but he does not. So, you will hear some more narration, see how several shots pass, and see how he sets up his camera. Why not use the camera to take pictures to show more landscapes? It really kills the sense of rhythm and regards the guy as a vain dash. <br /> <br /> I could read tips on how someone sets up their camera, rewind the entire movie forward and spend much less time.
