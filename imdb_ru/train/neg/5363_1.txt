I did not think that this film was worth anything bad script, bad acting, with the exception of Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid conspiracy, stupid husband and unjust divorce. If you have never seen this film before, do not even worry, it is not worth it. The only thing that was good about it was that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's husband is an obsessive smart lawyer who won a lot of cases and even dismissed the killers by deception. He thinks he is so smart, but in fact he is just crazy. Her best friend has an affair with a husband who betrays her. Sweet girl Yes, she is a real peach, no. She doesn't have a day at the beach either.
