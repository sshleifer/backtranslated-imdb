Although this was done for television production, there is absolutely no excuse for the end results of the final product. This film had a budget, and it had a casting department, so if you are going to make a film about the real life story and actually put the “real story” in the title, shouldn't you make an effort to try to catch some realism? First, this film is ridiculously filmed. These actors participate in daytime television series or in these ridiculous films on Lifetime, and not in real gangster / criminal history. Everything about them, from their appearance to their manners, only the cries of the generation of the 90s-shopping mall-alt-rock listeners. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and insulting, and again it sounds too 90th. I don't think the real Clyde Barrow ever uttered the words, “I'm leaving here.” As if a bunch of New Kids on the Block fans got together and decided to make a really cool flick about Bonnie and Clyde, well, you know, that would be just awesome and cool. Well, this sticker is not even rated on the Rad and Rockin scale. Everything that can be wrong with any film is wrong here, from casting and acting to editing and music. Every thing is fundamentally wrong ... and it infuriates that the parties responsible for this beastly turkey had the courage to insert a "true story" in the headline. This, of course, is not a true story, but, even worse, it is not even entertainment, like a thoughtless click of popcorn, which is adopted on its own terms. As I said in my headline, it’s just awful, without words, at every conceivable level. Believe me or look at your own risk.
