I was interested in the name and description of Big Rig while participating in the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. However, I could not wait to get out of the seat as soon as the Big Rig ended. Big Rig is comprised of several big rig drivers who intend to deliver cargo across the United States. All the characters are wonderful people, but the filmmakers never delved into their complexity as people. Instead, the story wriggles just like the cards in the movie are meant to guide, but never do. At best, we got lost. We - the audience - ultimately go nowhere and, like the direction of storytelling, we find ourselves somewhere, but without direction, location or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? how did we get here? The narration is sloppy, and the directors' intention to “humanize” a group of people whom they consider “missing” and “invisible” seems unconsciously and irritably condescending. The problem here is the perspective of the directors, not the truck drivers. The directors make their naive assumptions about truckers, and then simply edit the film to confirm these assumptions. In general, there is no tension in the story, the film is too long (there should have been a 15-minute sketch), the big question “So what” was never answered, and the whole film is one transparent propaganda that nothing else does enlightened ”(according to the directors) the outside world about large falsifiers.
