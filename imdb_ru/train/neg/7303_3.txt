"Cabin Fever" is the first feature film by director Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein co-wrote the script from Roth's story. This is a zombie movie that owes much to George Romero and his earlier "living dead", as well as the Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to mention Sam Rami's "Evil Dead". There is nothing original here, and the story is not convincing. Acting is about the same as in this genre, just the story failed. We have already watched this movie a lot before and said that, having achieved commercial, if not artistic success in this film, Roth decided that he was the director, and performed with a terribly cruel, mean spirit, meaningless (albeit much more ambitious) shitty Hostel .Roth I had to quit smoking while he was behind. Cabin Fever is not a very good film, but compared to a hostel it is a work of art. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) will convince this guy that filmmaking is the wrong career choice. Cabin fever, weak 3/10 due to the fact that it is not so bad a little like a hostel.
