One thing that came to my mind after seeing this nonsense is that I will never get the time I used to look at it again. If you want Stacy Keach and Michael Dorn to try to earn what was supposed to be then, then the down payments in the holiday home stay in touch. The wooden game, the bad special effects, the only comedic highlight was at a time when our alien hero was in a female form, and it ended as soon as she did the obligatory naked sex scene in the b-film within 30 minutes after the film began. The opportunity to make something that could be a decent movie disappears at the moment when Nicole Eggbert puts an alien in a bar for 30 seconds, while the police, the military and Joe do not believe that a woman drinks coffee, does not use it. Pen handle and wears four jumpers at the same time. She must be from another planet. Just where I would like to be when this film was.
