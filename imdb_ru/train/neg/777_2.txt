I cannot believe that such evasive, hurray-patriotic material is being presented to Americans as material for an artistic home. At the very beginning, from such bright lines as “we want to make sure that they play for the right team” and manipulative frames and lighting, the separation of love shows that this is a real person. The crude manner in which Irish Catholics are portrayed as hegemonic, and Protestants as peaceful and oppressed, reflects the history as badly as the early American westerns, which depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of this story is distorted by stereotypes and frank condemnation of the Irish Catholics in this story; corruption recognized by the filmmakers themselves! Sadly, people today still think they can win morally by making a film that is so easily recognized by its obvious intentions, so far from the attempt at art. This film does not make any sense in any legitimate movie theater or library.
