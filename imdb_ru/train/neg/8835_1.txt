Before I watched this movie, I read a review saying that this movie could be one of the best ever !? ha ha scene behind the scene tension grows well ... from annoying characters in this movie. From a little girl talking nonsense and trying to drown a little boy, to an assassin just running without any notice (and who was that guy on the beach talking to a little boy! Without an answer in this film. moving in one direction and then not going anywhere, but in a new direction ... and so on ... <br /> <br /> The game is great, but the letter is terrible. Each character in each scene says or does something incredible, unrealistic, and the reactions of other actors / characters are just weird. There are no problem solutions throughout the film, which makes it confusing and, ultimately, a big waste of time.
