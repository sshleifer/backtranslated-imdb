I went to see him in the hope of some good old-fashioned Alice Entertainment. As soon as I realized that I would not get it, I watched it for a fairly well-made film (in terms of filming, and yes .. that's all). Besides the good quality of the film, given that I watched grainy films all day, there was nothing good about this film. <br /> <br /> He killed 42. Why did Tweedly Dee and Doom play Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, Who can answer this question for me? Who can answer something horrible about this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I agree with the one who said that it was just a big long joke for the staff. It seemed that. <br /> <br /> Poor Mr. Carroll. I am very sorry that someone did this with his wonderful stories.
