I watched some pretty bad movies in the past, but what the hell did they think about when they made this movie. Did the film crew turn into a zombie when they had the idea to do it, because you must be crazy to find some pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a fan of most genres and enjoy Shoot at them, but the fusion of crazy scenes from the game just made it funny and unattractive. <br /> <br /> As many have already said, there were almost no scenarios, and the action was weak. I will not waste my time on his description. <br /> <br /> Anyone who rates this movie above 4 should be part of a production company or Sega, otherwise they have a very distorted entertainment concept. <Br /> <br /> I must say, I was more annoyed by the video store, which raised this thumbs up, which led me to rent. Thank God, I had a second film to restore my faith in the movie. <br /> <br /> The comic guy would be right if he said "The worst movie in history"!
