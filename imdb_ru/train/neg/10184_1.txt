For months I heard about this little movie, and now I have seen it. I find it cute, cute, how many young directors make films, where they combine other people's creative ideas to make their own premise of a single movie joke. Wars, Swingblade, any of the millions of Blair parodies of the Witches come to mind. If all these directors want is a step in the door of Hollywood, then they are doing the right thing, and they should support it, because combining the outlines of the plot is how Hollywood makes films. How many times have you heard the phrase "This is the Animal House meets Back to the Future"; "Wall Street meets a dead poet's society"; or "Shakespeare in Love Meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant original and bold, unsafe and predictable.
