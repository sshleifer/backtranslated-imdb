Nada was the most inadequate continuation of Les NOces Rouges, which, in retrospect, now appears as the last good film of the golden era of Chabrol (1967-1973). “Nada” is the first real attempt by Shabrol in a completely political film. his previous work, Les Noces Rouges, also had political elements, but it was rather a psychological thriller with an ordinary view of society in the French provinces. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassadors, hostage taking, a lot of blood, not Chabrol. field.G non-uniform cast gives the film a coup d'état: only Duchaussoy, who has already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel to zero. Viviane Romance, one of the actresses Duvivier ("La Belle Equipe" "Panique"), wasted as Madame (Gabrielle). Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are terrible. <br /> <br /> With Nada, this is the second period of fruitless inspiration for Chabrol. This will be “Violetta Nozieres” before he was again at the top of his game.
