This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I am not kidding. the next time this happens, I will constantly bump my head into the wall. I would be much nicer to sit in the emergency room, trying to explain to the doctor why my brain was swollen than trying to go through this film again. <br /> <br /> I hope that black and more stylish will never work together on the Project again bad. They are both good comedians, so I was shocked, it was so embarrassing. <br /> <br /> if they had to do it again, Iâ€™m sure they decide not to. the people who faced the money must have lost a ton. not really - because the special effects (all 2) were terrible.
