The revolution is a terrible film, I don’t care if you are a history teacher, a news writer, a fan of Al Pacino, this film can’t earn a legitimate "10". <br /> <br /> Key Point of View on the conspiracy - Tom Dobb (Al), trying to get money from the note he received for radical patriots taking his boat. Everything revolves around this note. Tom's son enters the army to catch up, forcing Tom to join the army too, they go on an adventure trying to leave the army, after years the war is over and they can finally turn in a note for their boat, End. <br /> <br /> He had several battle scenes, and at best they were rather mediocre. Transitions between scenes were used "five months later" and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle. A love story is a joke, and the film as a whole is just hard to follow. So save your “Notes” and watch the Patriot.
