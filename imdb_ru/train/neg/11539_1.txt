This is the biggest load I've seen in a long time. The last time I hated the movie so much was when I watched “28 Days Later” and “Magnolia”. There is absolutely no point in this film except seeing some really sick and perverted sex / rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relaxing on the side of the road, and each sentence in the dialogue should use the word “F” at least a couple of times in it. This is a very cheap acting game and a very low budget. In the end, my friend and I turned off the film in about half an hour. We tried to give him a chance, but nothing could save this goat. DO NOT WATCH IT !!!
