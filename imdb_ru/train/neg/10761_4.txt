This film was a mess. This was the worst editing I've ever seen. It was almost like at the end of the scene, when the writer wanted to go to a commercial, and the director added a second black screen to fulfill the authors dream. <br /> <br /> Under the dirty guidance and installation was a glimpse of something good. Good idea, irresistible spark. But somewhere it all went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story of a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is hard to bite is Richard Greco as a priest. Well, this part does not require him to be a good priest, and he succeeds quite well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy bad guy. He always plays the crazy bad guy. Very ho ho. <br /> <br /> Oh, the thought struck me that maybe this whole agitated, terrible montage and disconnected plot tried to add to the confusion the character had (Grieco). And just to prove that it was invented, they rolled back loans to the reverse words. Not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
