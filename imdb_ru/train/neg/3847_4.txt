Helen has a lot of questions and nothing good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play mothers from a pair of Leopold and Loeb, like murderers who move from the Midwest to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, star of Jahn Harlow, obsessed with the stars, opens a dance studio for children, and Winters - her pianist. Soon Winters (like Helen) starts to pop. It all goes very slowly, and although there are moments of real eeriness (unpleasant phone calls, a visit to Timofey Kino from Vino), the film is devoid of any real horror. Nevertheless, it is still worthy entertainment. The active divs are fine, and the production values ​​are amazing. The musical score of David Raskin, the cinematography of Lucien Ballard and the costumes nominated for the Oscars made a huge contribution. With this, PLACE IN THE SUN and Lolita, to her credit, does anyone do crazy just like Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, the master in this kind of exploitation is not exactly A-Cinema. In addition to Carey, the support team includes Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorhead (as evangelist like Aimee Semple, MacPherson), Yvette Vickers and Michael McLiamour (Irish Orson Welles) as Hamilton Starr, aptly named Hammy.
