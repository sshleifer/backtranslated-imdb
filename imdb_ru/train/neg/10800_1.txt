What was the point of this movie? What was the plot? I dont know. Shaq cannot act, people do not know how to govern, and I am Kazaam! Jin, who knocks? Come on. Perhaps Eminem or Linkin Park will be in such a film. I remember, I watched it just to kill time. It really did not interest me. I just remember thinking: “Who put Shaka in this movie ???” The whole story also seemed silly. It made no sense. I believe that the unrealized moral of this film is that anything can be found in the ghetto, and anything can happen. I can't comment much more because this movie is so awful that it doesn't cost anything to comment. I would like this movie to disappear.
