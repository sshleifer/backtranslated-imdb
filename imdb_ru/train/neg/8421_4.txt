It's funny that I have to reconsider this film, but here I am. <br /> <br /> I check it, because quite recently I had the opportunity to witness the revival of RS Sheriff's The End of the Journey performance on stage in New York, at the Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as David Grindley's masterful tutorial. <br /> <br /> I left the Theater destroyed. I am not exaggerating, I was stunned. After almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic description of the life of a soldier in the trenches of the Somme (I guess) during World War I, animatedly animated by all participants, I left the theater with shakes. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, I'm not easily shocked, nor am I too sensitive. I myself am a theater actor and director, so I know that the buttons are pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotional and psychological. <br /> <br /> But what I just witnessed so much came true that I had a chill in my spine when I left. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions came to life when I watched the movie "Aces High", based on this play and even adapted for the screen, in collaboration with RC The sheriff himself, shortly before his death. <br /> <br /> Screen adaptation takes place in the skies over France. So the claustrophobic atmosphere disappeared to begin with. <br /> <br /> The only plus of the film is the air battle scenes, which look obsolete in their special effects compared to today's standards, but are still very effective in the flight tactics adopted on the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, Erich Maria Remarque made several screen versions of the film “Everything is quiet on the Western Front,” which takes place in the trenches, not in the sky, but it was a “German” vision of things, if you wanted to be picky in such things. <br /> <br /> “The End of the Road” is just the other side of the coin, and it would turn into a great movie if it were left alone and untouched. <br /> <br /> The transfer to DVD leaves much to be desired, although in widescreen mode, adapted for 16: 9 television screens, the quality of the film itself is the same as that of a movie theater. No more, no less. Various defects have been found in it, such as small scratches and dots, although otherwise the copy is clean. <br /> <br /> If you want to have another World War I film in your collection, especially for those who love and love watching air battles among old-timers, then this is the picture for you. But I would prefer as an alternative to “von Richthofen and Brown,” although this is also a film filled with inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who love good play and drama, I would leave this one out. Buy a play. Look at the play, if you have a chance to get a decent revival near you, but do not approach this potential adaptation. <br /> <br /> This is an anti-war film, but the weakest I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The presence of such actors as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gilgud is just a bluff, as they are seen as very weak and very Short roles in a cameo throughout the film. <br /> <br /> McDowell, very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, play very poorly, not because of a lack of skills, but because of a lack and a solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps in it, and, as already mentioned, it reaches for the dubious end. It is doubtful, because in the original play none of those whom we recognize and sympathize with, remain alive. They are all killed in a fatal and useless mission. In the film, they all die, with the exception of Malcolm McDowell, who somehow manages to survive the next day, being the commander of the wing of the unfortunate group, just to get three more pilots who will fly and die for another lost case. <br /> <br /> The end of the play leaves a bare stage in complete darkness. You just hear the roar of cannons, the roar of machine guns and grenades throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, complete peace and silence. The curtain rises. Shine. And here they are. Lined up, standing straight and stiff. Obedient corpses ... <br /> <br /> Much more interesting and shocking than the final "Aces High", which also drags the hair. <br /> <br /> You decide. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had the money and the contacts for this, I would take the play and develop it as it was intended. Adding some action scene in the field, just to visualize the "external" horror and slaughter going on in the "dirty fields of France" around the people involved, but then, just strictly concentrating on what is happening, in this tiny "shack" on the edge of sanity and peace ... <br /> <br /> Want such a movie? <br /> <br /> Then ask for it. <br /> <br /> This is not the case.
