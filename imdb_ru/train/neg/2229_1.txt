Maybe it's not fair, because I only did it halfway through the movie. One of the few films that I really could not watch because of lameness. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, and the whole film is simply unreal and foolish. For example, during a Coca-Cola deal, colas are simply kept in a briefcase - I am not an expert, but I think that people usually put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect whenever they strike (this is the same “crisp” sound), and they use toy guns with duplicated sound effects. <br /> <br /> Worst movie of all.
