Do not watch this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective viewing, my friends and I estimated that each of us lost 5% of our brain during its course. The only person to create it who was not clinically insane was the decorator. <br /> <br /> Most films leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Now I understand that instead of disgust, this film has aroused deep hatred in me. I really, really hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this film should not be taken seriously. If it were not taken seriously. But it is so. The plot is a heated version of the Blade Runner Universe mixed with cheap rubber suits so common in bad dinosaur films. The dialogue is not only childish and senseless, but often literally painful. Whoopi Goldberg doesn’t even try, but George Newburn, like Theodore Rex’s voice, like nails on the soul. And whether it’s Juliet Landois with her again on a British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as a frantic commissar, you immerse yourself in an ever-increasing sense of mistrust and frustration. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film only to someone who wants to see the depths of stupidity in which humanity can fall.
