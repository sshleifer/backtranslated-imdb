I can't believe it, IMDb really has all the TV shows known to man! I have not seen this show for over 20 years. I remember only two episodes, and I hardly remember them. I remember that Tony may not have been included from the very beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is the one in which everyone tries to get Tony to join, but he rejects them, but usually at the end of the show he becomes a member of Power House, where everyone applauds. <br /> <br /> Another one I remember is the one where Lolo, for some reason, pretends to be dead (along with the funeral and the bereaved). I don't remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those shows in which I convinced myself that I must have come up with it, because no one else heard about it.
