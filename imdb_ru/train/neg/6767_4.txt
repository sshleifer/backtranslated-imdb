I can watch this movie once, but I doubt that I can get through the second time. Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. Matt Dillon's fun (think of Mary) and the resurgence of Michael Keaton's more serious acting. This is not a funny joke, in which there was a “Love Mistake”, but it is watchable. One of my major flaws in the film was that Herbie turned into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was bored with the effect of the headlights the second time out of 30 or so times when they were used, and the bend of the front wing caused the same reaction in me. Look at it with your little ones, that is, with “one-to-one brackets”, and don’t expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
