Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties, he tried his hand at cinema. But this incredible stuff ended his acting career once and for all. It also put an end to the acting career of Dutch actress Nada van Nee, who continued to be a football wife, TV host and program maker. I actually saw it in the (almost empty) theater, because I was a fan of Koen Wouters, Clouseau. I'm so sorry I spent the money on it. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story, and it turns out poorly in all possible ways. Some people think it's so bad, it's funny. I am not one of them. I just found it an incredible waste of time and money.
