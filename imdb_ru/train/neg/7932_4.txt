Oh dear! What a disappointment. I’ve watched old westerns on British television for decades, and I didn’t know about it until yesterday’s show — most of the other westerns in Scott appear every few years or so, and they are usually worth watching again. <br /> Rich colors and outdoor scenery were good, but that is all I can say about this film. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made. Several times I wanted to turn it off, and in the end I did something half, something that I would hardly ever do. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed unusually bold in the charm of the girls, his twins were annoyed, and the Mexican is also a gangster, boy. And I feel that the army uniform was 20 years old or so too modern, not that it bothered the producers of many other westerns. <br /> <br /> It may have improved in the second half, but I could not wait and see.
