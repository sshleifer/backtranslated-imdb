This movie is weird. Simply put, it's “damn weird.” I could give you a brief plot or some thorough analysis, but I would consider it a waste of your time. All you need to know about this film is two young sisters, one incestuous connection, murder, posthumous injury and one truly disturbing passion. At the end of the film, you feel that you have to go and take a shower to wash the dirt off of yourself, but not like after “Pulp Fiction” or “Fight Club”. It’s as if you were a teenager (or being a high school student, I’m still a teenager myself) and just did something that you A: want you not to do that, and B: I hope that the good Lord of Heaven and Earth, that your parents never learn about. And nobody likes that. I suggest that instead of defiling your mind and watching a piece of meaningless cinematic dirt, just waste your time on something less awful and watch “Kazaam” (yes, I would prefer to watch “Kazaam” than “Murderous virgins”, read what you want in it).
