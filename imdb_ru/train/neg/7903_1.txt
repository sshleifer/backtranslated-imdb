I think I’ve watched this movie, but don’t quote me, because maybe I fell asleep while watching it, because it didn’t quite “capture my excitement and imagination.” At least, I know that I looked enough to know that I will not see again soon. Or ever. <br /> <br /> God, talk about the lame ... Really lame. Absolutely lame. It's not even like the six year old. It basically did not have a significant dramatic impact. Shish. Nada Just shlok turned into garbage. Comedy? Was this supposed to be a comedy? I could have fooled me, uh-uh ... Now, if the aliens were insatiablely carnivorous, like in the movie Critters, we could make human characters do something deeper than being overly smugly cute ... for example, shouting, shouting and running for your life, not being eaten, so that the story could be something more exciting than watching dried paint. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about watching this one. It is not worth the effort. You may find something more interesting to do. How to watch how the paint dries. Or fall asleep.
