Having entered this film, you know that in this film there are six laboratory technicians in a sealed laboratory with an invisible maniac. So immediately you guess who will live and who will die. The survivors in the end turn out to be exactly as you expect them, so there is no reason to turn the plot. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if this is a B-film or a film that just happens in a lab with a fascinating story, William Devein plays a role: the instantaneous status of a B-film. <br /> <br /> The film promises to be at the beginning. In the laboratory, we are introduced to the invisible gorilla, which is becoming increasingly brutal. Oooh, foreboding. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. The same when they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are a pair of naked breasts, a truly disgusting dirty joke and inappropriate enough curses to give this movie an R rating that he really doesn’t need. <br /> <br /> For the thriller, there really were no surprises, except when Shu turns to MacGyver in the freezer, which is more like “Baaaaaaaaaaa”? OK, there is one surprise. That's when Kane (Bacon) for the last time returns to the elevator shaft. It was unexpected, but only because you are screaming on TV: “Noooo! You are already dead! The end of the film! Speaking of screaming on TV, that's all I've been doing for the last 25 minutes or so. “Put on your f # @% glasses!” Instead of wearing their infrared glasses so they can see him, they try all the other tricks in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> At the end of the story really lost it. But the special effects were good; this is the only reason i put 2/10.
