I watched this, hoping to find something that I did not know about the most notorious person in modern history and could not help but think that the story was rewritten in "Hitler: the rebellion of evil." Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to shoot her fan. Hitler came with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Roma. Sorry for asking, but didn't the authors confuse Adolf Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE? This is bad enough, but I was really offended by the fact that there are no pieces of historical context in this mini-series. Germany lost the First World War, and the Allied powers forced Germany to pay a high price for it. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone — someone — to regain their pride, and that is why they turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the 1920s, caused by the Allied powers, seems to be completely absent, therefore HITLER: RISING OF EVIL cannot be taken seriously as a historical document, and I did not even mention that Himmler and Goering are noticeable By their absence <br /> <br /> In the mini-series there is one positive point - this is Robert Carlyle in the title role. Well, some of his manners are wrong, and his voice is too loud (records in the archive show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice), but Carlisle is a charismatic actor, and he manages to convey Hitler's own charisma on the screen. The comments of the British press that Carlisle looks more like a synth from Sparks than Adolf Hitler are unfounded, and he gives one of the best interpretations of Hitler. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance of Robert Carlisle, but I hated everything else about this mini-series and wondered why it was done on the ground in the first place. There is nothing to recommend this to serious history fans.
