This film is a blatant robbery of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner, written by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> Details of the film shown in IMDb confirm the authenticity of the author, but I did it. I do not see this at the beginning of the film, only the credit at the end of the word, “proposed by Silas Marner’s book.” Give? It was nothing more than the complete abduction of all the essential elements of this story: <br /> <br /> All his money was stolen from the offended and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely. One night, the child goes to his door, and her mother lies on the street, dying. A man takes her and brings her up until one day a local squire (or a rich politician here) demands to adopt a child. He was the father of a child during an illegal affair many years ago. Then comes the battle for who should have custody of the child. <br /> <br /> In this and in all other aspects of the film, the story is exactly the same. Only in one I can find the difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy, but perhaps that would have undermined Mr. Martin’s acting ability too much. In addition, his hair is painted in a decoction of carrot juice (it is possible that he looked younger, but in fact he looks more like a clown)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes that this unusual comedian cannot resist entering into a story that has nothing to do with it, but only diminishes the depth of the story. For example, when a child cries in the courthouse, declaring that she can be happy only with the person who gave birth to her all these years. About this in the film tells the girl who uses a decongestant for the nose to the nose to make her cry! <br /> <br /> I’m surprised that legality and honesty in the film industry make it possible to create such a film. If I were a confidant of George Eliot, I would insist on compensation. If I were Steve Martin, I would send a profit to this estate or to the poor. At least it should be called Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin. Or better still delete from the archive! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope that you - completely reject it and see Silas Marner. Or read a book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of this in the 1980s.
