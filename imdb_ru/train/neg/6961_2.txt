I completely agree with another comment that someone should make Lily the tiger "How are you" with this film. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the worst French films I've seen in a long time (actually with Brotherwood “Wolves”, 2 horrible films in a too short amount of time). <br /> <br /> It's really sad, because the cast is really interesting, and the original idea is funny. In particular, Antoine Dekon and Jean Rochefort, who are among my favorites, were bitterly disappointed that they had been compromised in such a bad film. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is pretty bad, as usual, which proves that a beautiful face. Famous parents can invite you to the movies, but they don't necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you want to laugh, instead watch Alain Chabat or some good historical piece full of fun, such as LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
