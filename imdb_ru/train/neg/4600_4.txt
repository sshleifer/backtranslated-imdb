I read all these reviews here about how this is such a good movie. God, this film was predictable and rather boring. Acting was below average most of the time, especially McKenna. I have not seen a more pitiful attempt to make someone "cool" in the film. Oh, man, this movie was a disappointment. I also read somewhere that this could be a cult classic. I know that there are followers of the director, but this film was just an ordinary piece of film. <br /> <br /> The script was unsuccessful, for the most part the acting was unsuccessful, this film was unsuccessful. <Br /> <br /> Oh, and pray for the guy who was in greeting. He looks very bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this film was probably the guy from Office Space, and he was in this film for only about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
