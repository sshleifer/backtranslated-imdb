This thing is terrible. Ben Affleck's character is self-centered and joyfully sadistic - a sadistic fanatic. And he is a romantic hero! His cartoon character does not change from start to finish, but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were a socialist, I would not be shy, but I am not a socialist. <br /> We, the capitalists, occasionally love little Christmas magic. This is not a magic. I do not know what is this. It's just awful. And this is a terrible waste of talent. O'Hara hysterically laughed me since the late 70s. Gandolfini Applegate. These people have been underestimated. If Ben were out of the equation, these people could come up with something excellent.
