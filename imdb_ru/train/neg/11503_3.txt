Quentin Crisp once said that when things show up too beautifully, this is a romantic. When things seem unbearably dark, they are realistic. And when something gets ironic treatment, they are in place. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second category. This director obviously did his best to make a Spanish film like "Ken Loach", not being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters who lift Loach films from just "depression." Los Lunes al Sol, only this, only depressing. Things are surreal gloomy. The final moments of the characters' sufferings culminate at the same moment, and, if the dark story is not enough, Aranoa erases the story with a visually gray and dirty color palette. The films were ridiculously overpriced in Goyas. A film that demonstrates empathy for weaker citizens in society, in this case unemployed port workers, does not automatically lead to a good film, although I would be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This film only makes me not interested in their fate. In Spain, the 21st century, the unemployed do not live as beggars, and public transport has decent toilets, and it is difficult to find a bar with so few professional players and so little happiness that can be found in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously has no idea about the working class of Spain and does not render him any assistance. The claim is the only conclusion I can make. The scene where men watch a football game for free has been directly copied from a film that is much more “realistic” regarding the subject of “poverty traps,” namely, “Pure Belt”, which is more attractive, humorous, and yet sad.
