Anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will leave in 40 minutes in disgust, like my wife and I. Ignorant masses can be entertained by arguments about giving up hands and absurd "conclusions" made (even without trying a logical reason) from real science. I am offended by such nonsense, presented under the guise of "science." I can only conclude that the authors took a book on quantum physics, did not understand a word of it, then watched the Matrix about a thousand times and began to write this film. <br /> <br /> For example, the Washington Criminal Experiment was conducted by the Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief search will show the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
