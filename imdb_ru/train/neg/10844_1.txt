Unfortunately, this is not “the best British film ever since Hellraiser”, although the cover of the DVD claims that it was me who bought it. This, however, is a tribute to many of the great horrors of old films from the most famous Amicus stable. <br /> <br /> The Cradle ... filmed on a mini DVD, which, although we all know, has more of a television feel than a movie, can be done much better. Each scene, set and frame looks as if they are lit in the same way (standard key, fill, back setting), which only increases the cheapness of the finished fragment. Frankly, the blood content is ridiculous. From the first shots, where we see a man's head torn apart from foamed rubber, right down to tasteless cheap hammers, the effects of creatures and the terrible CG, there was nothing that could impress me. <br /> <br /> The action is disgusting, from the almost comatose detective to the gnome Broom through Dani Filt, the least persuasive bad horror movie guy I've ever seen. Each of the substrings is more formal than the previous one, and every day everything gets worse and worse. Look for “Mental Asylum” - a Georgian semi-detached house with a bad cg sign on the street and the most bizarre (and not very good) cell I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It took me four attempts to get to the end of the film, without distracting from my attention (no, I was running) at any available opportunity. I did find that I was gathering dust at some point during the film. <br /> <br /> This, however, marked one of Emily Booth’s last known breast appearances, which, I think, one (well, two) things go for it. But as soon as it gets out of control, everything gets downhill. <br /> <br /> I heard people say good words about Alex Chandon, and I would love to believe them, but on that basis I can hardly believe it. If you want to worthily pay respect to Amikus, avoid this and instead Go to the Gentlemen League Christmas Special. <br /> <br /> Currently battling Blair the Witch 2: The Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I have. ever seen.
