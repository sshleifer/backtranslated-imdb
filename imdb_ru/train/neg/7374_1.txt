This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst movie that Stephen Seagal has ever made. And it says a lot. Do not be deceived by the rating, it is too good. This abomination was not even worthy of a 0/10 assessment if such a thing existed. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no plot. <br /> <br /> - The worst fighting scenes, and there are not so many of them. <br /> <br /> - Seagal does not do anything, including fights, conversations (much dubbing) and so on. As always. <br /> <br /> - Sigal is fat, lazy, and he doesn't care about this movie. Something that is very obvious all over <br /> <br /> Take all the other junk movies for DTV that Seagal did, multiply them by each other, multiply it by a thousand billion, and all the evil that you then win â€œT even describe 1% of this absolute crap.
