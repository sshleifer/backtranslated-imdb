This film is not very good. Boring and not much blood for a horror movie. The plot just flows along with not many events. And I think the vampire woman was so stupid. She had many chances to kill vampire hunters, as it shows that she has light, like reflexes. But whenever she has one of them, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder it went straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> CONCLUDING VERDICT: Not as good as the first vampire movie. You are SAKER, if you spend your time on it.
