I know that some films (I mean: European films), which are very bad films, are considered by some “critics” to be a great movie just because they are non-American. I saw an IMDB score of 8.1 for this film and noticed the fact that it was selected for some major festivals. Do not let this fool you! If you're not one of those people who like stunning movies like these, and later call it great art, skip it! The film contains one funny scene after another (a similar Italian film that pops up in my head, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE movie (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not only boring, like some other films with strange praise, but also that they play almost like in a camp. I mean, let's face it, the game is terrible (I mean: the level of the soap opera), the story has no surprise (it was done endless times before, connecting several storylines: SHORT MAGNOLIA, PLAYING ON THE HEART, only much better), there is not a single realistic character in it (some real wanderer who noticed a merry daughter looking like a zombie), and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> As if this is not enough, the film is 135 min. (count!) for a long time, and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality. After the film with such a funny bad dialogue and scenes that made the public at the preview show laugh at such incompetence, well ... This is an insult to the movie, and only gets high marks because it happens in "other" language in this case Spanish . Strange world in which we live ... 3/10
