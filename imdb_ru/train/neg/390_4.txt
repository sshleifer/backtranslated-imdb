I loved the student for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now from season 5? (or is it 6?) things just get too tedious. <br /> <br /> I used to like the show, but it became Donald Trump's own ego festival. Let it be his company in which you will work, but come on! Some things say that “you are fired” is simply insulting. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I would not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or the like. Just a show is unrealistic, and the way he handles makes me squirm. Good fun? YES, but tedious, because the stab in the back becomes so tedious .. this is not teamwork, not personal, it's just business. watch your back
