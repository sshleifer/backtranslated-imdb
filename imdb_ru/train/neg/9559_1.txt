I will try to use words to describe it on .... <br /> <br /> I saw an original that is good in its own way, but then I should have been wary of continuing. <br /> <br /> And I was “scared” when I raised this one, but now that I saw it, I must say that it is even worse than I thought. Why these films still get paid still makes me think. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they are not so good, but I must say that some make the heads turn, it's just awful. But what can an actor do with such a scenario? He is trying to be a copy of the original only this time, when the places have changed, any form of history has disappeared, and any attempt to actually invent something that has not been done before has failed. In a vain attempt to update it, they are trying to make it exciting, using the whole “big brother” theme, but it’s worn out long ago and offers nothing but filler for a start. and the end. An attempt was made to save the film, making a bunch of links to the original 83rd year, but in the end it turned out to be just funny, and sometimes a little sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing, and I mean nothing, do ... go see or play Frisbee ... from the DVD ... on your own. It will offer you as much pleasure .. I promise
