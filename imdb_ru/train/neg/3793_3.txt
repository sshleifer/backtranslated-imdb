The Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. It is not much like the original story of E.TA. Hoffman, on which it is based. <br /> <br /> In ballet, the story ends in the second half, when Clara (or Marie in this version) goes to the Kingdom. Sweets to watch a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There are an infinite number of stage productions that interpret history in different ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the weak ballet libretto. <br /> <br /> The Balanchine version does not really make any sense in drama or history (despite the fact that there is a lot of drama and mystery in the beautiful music of the First Act of Tchaikovsky). The result is a completely forgotten Christmas party in the first half, where almost nothing happens, and where even the dances (not only in them) are not particularly remembered. <br /> <br /> The pantomime, especially the acting one, especially Drosselmeyer, who on the scene may seem bearable, just looks stupid for a large screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not so much better when we get to the Kingdom of sweets (Act II on stage version). Although there are several choreographic moments, most choreography is soft and boring. This, of course, not vintage Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely considered the master of abstract dance, but I always felt that he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets. Watching this version of The Nutcracker only confirmed this point.
