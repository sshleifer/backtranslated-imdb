The only reason I did not get this score is because Sibrel really shows that he is skilled in the technical aspects of making a film. This is a technically clever movie. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, this is a film based on lies and distortions that are fairly easy to disprove. Most of the documentary film is dedicated to the promotion of space programs, and not the promotion of facts. And Sibrel’s “irrefutable evidence” that the landings were rigged is easy to disprove if you know something about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching this, but if you do, watch it on Google Video for free. Don't let Bart Sibrel capitalize on your curiosity.
