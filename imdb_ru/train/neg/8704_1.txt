In general, I like movies about dinosaurs, but this is just nonsense. There is no script, no dialogue, no actors. And the brave Colonel Rance, who is trying to show that he has a strong and curved mouth, resembles the twin brother of the stupid Proctor from the police academy. So it was a waste of time (fortunately, not a waste of money, as I saw the movie on TV). And I really can't understand the 7 people who rated this sh * t 10. They must have been joking. My advice, if you see this headline, run from it!
