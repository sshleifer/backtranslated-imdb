I wanted to watch this film because of Eliza Dushku, but it’s only a smaller part, and her character is not very pleasant. Nevertheless, the main character played by Melissa Sagemiller is very beautiful and it is pleasant to watch her during the entire film. It really is nothing but a showcase for her appearance and talent. She does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself, at first glance, is rather meaningless. After a car accident, some friends may be dead, but continue to live in past lives while all kinds of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys chase them, but we never know who they are (they may have been in a different car, but of course we don’t hear anything about why they chase them). The final scenes seem especially ambitious, but I can't get anything connected from this. The initial scene, where the bad guys (who wear weird masks) cut the blonde's wrist and collect some of her blood, are never explained or tracked. Unless the bad guys have to represent the surgeons who are trying to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) out of the dead ... but no, it looks like it doesn't work. Bad guys are just bad guys; they really just ruin a story that might otherwise be interesting. In the supernatural tale of death, love and sacrifice, who the hell do you need the bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
