Alone in the dark - Uwe Boll hit the Hollywood goal after hitting the House of the Dead in the face. <br /> <br /> If something proves how big master manipulator Ball is. After ousting Artisan due to the failure of House of Dead, it can be assumed that usually the trustworthy Lion's Gate Films films released AITD only by contract after the acquisition of Artisan assets. Because AITD is an even more vivid example of the complete lack of ability for consistent film production, demonstration of the plot and just bad theft from other films, because it had to look cool, not because it fit into the frame of the film. <br /> <br /> But then the thing is, isn't it? Ball is not trying to make a coherent movie, because he is not trying to direct Alone in the Dark. He is just trying to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, for example, House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and other 3 or 4 projects that are “announced” or are in the “before” stage. production ". <br /> <br /> These are not films for directing, but investment portfolios. Each of them rushed into production on the pretext that the Boll tax law and its investors could be closed within the next 2-3 years. the more bomb projects he can produce during this time, the more money he and his investors can receive. Why make a good movie if a bad movie still makes you mint? As a result, there are films like the horror One in the Dark. <br / > <br /> "Alone in the Dark", like all his other films, are growing the cynical exploitation of the current Hollywood trend of lazy filmmaking. <br /> <br /> And if you support Boll, calling him a misunderstanding, or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, making this person a cult figure, you just make it easier for him to find investors, but give him notoriety. <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/ showthread.php? s = & threadid = 21699 As a retreat, just don’t ask me how he collects the cast lists. If the actors are not involved in the investment scam, then this mystery has yet to be revealed.
