Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this, however, is not one of them. Ah, one more crime of Brad Sykes. The game is disgusting, with the exception of Amy Smith, who shows some promises. The “Direction” camera needs serious processing. And no longer need to "hold the camera and run" tricks; it just doesn't work. Special effects are devoid of imagination, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you are going to rip off the ear, please do not let us see the real ear of the actor under the blood. The scenery is soft and boring (the same as Mr. Sykes of other enterprises), and the music is a mixture of cheap porn motel and really bad guitar metal (see scenery comments). <br /> <br /> Did I mention the absence of any real plot or character development? Obviously, the screenwriter did not. <br /> <br /> Whoever financed this guy ... please stop. I have seen some of his other "home movies" (which I won't connect), and they are just as bad. As a rule, the “director” will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur director, but anyone can be a cracker. <br /> <br /> Definitely, not even a movie about popcorn ... of course, chewing popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. <Br /> <br /> Reward: the worst military push-ups in the film.
