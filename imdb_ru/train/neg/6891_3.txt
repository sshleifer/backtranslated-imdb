It starts very well, a good introduction and creation for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same form as the protagonist of American Pies and Loser without the support of the cast or an innovative storyline, thanks to which the films about cakes have become a commercial success. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest - Heder's game was pretty bad. Keaton, Daniels, and Faris did everything possible, but they didnâ€™t have a significant plot or script to cling to their teeth. The film simply unfolds without any tempo or a clear logical storyline, justifying its length. <br /> <br /> The ending is approximately predictable as they come in - so predictably, I ticked the spoilers box for this line. <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid at all costs, if in fact you have nothing more to do / listen to or watch, and even then you will feel that the producers have deceived you for the one and a half hours of your life.
