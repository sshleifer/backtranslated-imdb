This self-proclaimed “very talented artist” easily shot the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotions, consistency, rhythm, skills, humor ... it repeats the same situation over and over again. This shows the lack of character development. It does not even show any violent and / or sexual content, and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer genre. So it's not good to show it in film schools as an example of “what not to do” in the first film. <br /> <br /> By the way, where the hell is “talent”? there are scenes shot almost equally; There are scenes in which there are two or more master-frames, and it is very terrible to see an action without a cause jumping from one master-frame to another. The camera almost never moves, as if “a very talented artist” was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. Actors playing the main roles behave like amateurs, and the cast is hardly believable. There are more holes in the script than plots (if any) ... <br /> <br /> A really depressing film and a talented director.
