I saw this movie in New York. I was waiting for the bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was raining, and did not want to wait in the port. So I crossed the street and saw the worst movie in my life. It was so bad that I decided to stay and watch the whole movie, since I have not seen anything so bad. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I stayed only because I could not believe it .........
