I see that someone was already thinking about a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after I watched this movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no plot. Aside from the sex scenes that bordered on child pornography (which I feel could have been cut out or presented more impressively in nature rather than graphically, I would liken this film to a recipe that was torn in half. It’s like being with your hands on a list of ingredients, without specifying how to assemble them into a finished product. From the very beginning there was a lack of character development and plot development ... unfortunately, many times in this monotonous drift we were teased with pieces of the plot, and we think "Ahhh ... well ... finally we will know something about WHY this scene is happening ... or ... WHO is this character ... or maybe we will finally find out and appreciate this character more ... or understand and participate more in this intersymbolistic relationship ... and so on. "But there is no such luck! On the contrary, many times I felt a desire to just turn it off several times, but I stuck it out when the carrots were hanging, only to find that any mini-plot is within the limits of whatever mini-plot and that poorly presented) was just a ploy. Why I stayed with this to the end remains a mystery, except that the IFC usually has the best choice, and they gave it 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). The point is not that the characters are unattractive to some degree, or that you cannot identify with them or their humanity at all ... it can just be much better if you put in a little more effort. I noticed that it was filmed in Santa Cruz, and I wondered if it was someone else’s film school project. I would like to give this review better, but, frankly, it was a disappointing and disappointing waste of an hour and a half.
