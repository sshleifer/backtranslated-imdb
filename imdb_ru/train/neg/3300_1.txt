Quite typical of Swedish films of this type. It is strange that the acting was too bad, these actors usually give a good show. Casting was poorly done, it made you expect something (I won’t tell you what). The main character was terrible ... I do not know where they found her. In any case, stay away from this and see instead “Den Tredje Vågen”, this is Swedish action at its best.
