Pittsburgh Secrets, based on the novel by Michael Chabon, tells about the young son of the infamous gangster who spends his last teenage summer, hanging around with two friends. This is 1983, and young Art Bechstein (John Foster) is at a crossroads. Fully opposing the lifestyle of his father, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually invented through painful attempts to create a beautiful cinematic model in the hip style, the whole film feels like a director - whose previous Dodgeball effort was funny, if only commercial, is desperately looking for independent authority, combining aspects of other indie films, but powdering it with stars such as Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like many of the star premieres at Sundance this year, it seemed like it was a secret project sponsored by the studio that helped the director earn some indie credibility points - he failed in that respect and as a film in itself.
