You know that the movie will not go well when John Carradine tells (a.k.a. reads the script and an overview of the plot) through the funeral procession of his character, only 5 minutes before the film begins. The narrative is the last will and testament of his character. He stipulates that his property will be divided between his 4 children and servants. Children should be divided equal to 136 million dollars, but if someone dies, then this share is distributed among the rest. If all the children die, it will be divided between the servants. To be eligible, they must live in a family estate for a week. It looks like a typical reality show plot. <br /> <br /> There is little overtones regarding the character of Dinov. This is a strong and very dysfunctional family, but the real problem begins with the drowning of this dog. From John Carradineâ€™s introductory dubbing, you expect this film to lead to a game of Machiavellian cats and mice with an unexpected ending. <br /> <br /> This journey is painfully slow and meaningless. We rush after a few minutes watching people who are sitting idle, playing billiards, throwing darts, abusing a shot through the aquarium, dramatic conversations between men in silk ties, constant quarrels, inappropriate circus music, strange memories reminiscent of German expressionism, aesthetics of horror 4th grade and a bunch of dramatic replay. All this inevitably leads to an expected and disappointing ending. You will be happy that you are still alive, but the pain may be too much to be alone. Share your children, share. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
