This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen, everything about him is weak and inconsistent. Acting is absurd, costumes even worse, and the story does not exist. This sword and the poverty line adventure film is intended to reflect some of the successes that Beastmaster and Conan used, but it does not give us any reason to follow them. The main character is cool and boring, he cannot even fight the sword, and the sword is from the 16th century. All sequences of actions are so slow and unreal, not to mention the castle and the terribly outdated music that plays whenever they ride a horse. Don't even think about this shit.
