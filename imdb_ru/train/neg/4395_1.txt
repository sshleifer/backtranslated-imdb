December festive events, such as the original Frosty, should be richly produced with quality music and a useful, but carefree storyline. They must have the touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. In fact, they should look, sound and feel ... well, "special", and they should have a decent and appropriate subtext of the December holidays. <br /> <br /> So when I saw the Legend of the Frosty Snowman lists on TV, I made my children (6 and 8) pump it up, telling them the story of the original Frosty and passionately told me how I enjoyed it in childhood. While my wife and children were sitting on the couch to watch the film, the expectations were high, but after 10 minutes my children yawned, and my wife and I “looked at each other” and rolled our eyes. After 35 minutes, my children actually asked to go to bed - I suppose they were tired of insensitive expressions and meaningless, detached segments. I was really embarrassed by their (and my) disappointment with this film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Legend of the Frosty Snowman looks more like a bad episode of “Honestly Weird Parents”, which turned into an episode with worse than usual Sponge Bob than a classic festive movie. Don't get me wrong ... these shows are good, and I like them just like the next guy, but when I watch “Fairly Weird Parents” or “Sponge Bob,” my low expectations (for mediocre, not in color, without subtext, mind-boggling episodes) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We selected some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better choice than the awkwardly bad legend of a frosty snowman.
