Well, the image of stereotypical "Indians" in this story is simply WRONG. I agree that Elvis looks good here, but yes, his skin color really changes during the film. I thought, well, ... he was never so tanned in real life. This is the most obvious brown “Indian” makeup I have ever seen. It's just as bad as the “Indians” from F-Troop and the old Hollywood Westerns played by Jewish and Italian American actors, not real Native Americans! <br /> <br /> This film is a normal, but usually unfortunate story and mediocre song, as in all later Elvis films. He just did it because Colonel Parker tied him up with long-term movie contacts to squeeze as much money from Elvis as possible! I keep thinking “thank God” that Elvis stopped making films forever shortly after the release of this film. It's cool to see the characters of actors Joan Blondell, Katie Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this film, though. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's “Indian” cosmetics are absolutely terrible. This is the worst of all for sure. What did the filmmakers think? Did Mr. Meredith do it just for the money or what? Although I love some Elvis films. For example: “Love me dearly”, “Prison Rock”, “Viva Las Vegas”. I can even watch his film with future TV stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, “Change of Habit,” in which Elvis plays a doctor from the city. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Elvis made some good films, but the mediocre and bad ones are overwhelmed by decent and good ones. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you, thank you very much!
