I did not think it was possible, but I found the film worse than Body Melt. This movie is really very bad! And even worse, this is another Australian film ... <br /> <br /> Filmed on what looks like VHS, and with the horrible 80s rock soundtrack, it just keeps getting worse and worse, it's hard to believe seeing how bad everything starts (a man with skin hanging upside down in a room with a white tomato sauce, was spraying someone?). <br /> <br /> And why are their accents constantly changing? From bad New York to narrow English, and then pure Australian! And this happens with all the actors! <br /> <br /> This film also claims to have won some kind of film festival on the cover (I think it was a film festival in Utah). This should be a lie, because no one in their right mind would prescribe it for anything (perhaps Golden Raspberry, but I think it's too bad for that). <br /> <br /> C'mon guys! This movie should be number 1 on the bottom 100! It should be ten times worse than those films that are already there. <br /> <br /> Well done the creators of this film, because there is a reason not to watch movies ..... 0/10
