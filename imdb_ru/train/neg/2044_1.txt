This movie is bad. I do not mean "bad" as in; “Oh, the script was bad” or; “The acting in this scene was bad” ..... I mean bad because someone must be held criminally responsible for imposing this rampant pile of floating dirt on the unsuspecting public. I will not even ennoble him with an explanation (of the plot ??), if I can refer to it like this. I can only recall one other case during about 40 years of watching movies, which I found to pour my spleen into a movie. I mean, in the end, no one is going to make a bad movie on purpose, is it? Well yes. Apparently, they do ... and the writer / director Ulli Lommel is guilty. But the worst thing is that Blockbusters actually rent it to their customers! Be advised. Leave that shit where it belongs. Stuck on the shelf, gathering dust.
