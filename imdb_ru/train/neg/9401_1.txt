In this extremely low-budget (I have seen home movies shot with better production value) Australian robbers "The Burning" and "Friday 13th", the group plans to shoot a music video while in the houseboat. They are being pursued by a serial killer who was burned years ago. This film is even declared "the worst Australian film ever made" in its DVD promotional material. This is only a selling point! Full and complete trash in all significant ways. Maybe a few laughs here and there for bad movie lovers, but it still made me want to burn my retinas. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: quick flashes of subtle tiny boobs in a lame shower br / <br /> My rating: F
