<br /> <br /> The main question I ask about this film is this: how do you shoot the musical “Cole Porter” and use only 3 of its 15 songs! Merman and Lahr played leading roles on Broadway, here they were replaced by the weaker red Skelton and Lucille Ball. Changes in the plot abound, and the fun is lost. <br /> <br /> Skip.
