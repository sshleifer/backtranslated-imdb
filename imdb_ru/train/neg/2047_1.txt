I don’t want to splurge here, but ... this is the worst “movie” I've ever seen. Worse Avengers. Incompetent direction, fragmented writing and terrible play are the only permanent elements in everything. Filmed on a very cheap video, similar to a school project, but without emotion. Lighting often looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than that of a single microphone in the camera, but everything else in this thing is just awful. The plot moves in strange directions without any reason or later resolution, the technical elements are clearly absurd, and the editing looks worse than the draft. It's not even bad enough to be funny. This is just bad. By the way, the packaging is intentionally misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.
