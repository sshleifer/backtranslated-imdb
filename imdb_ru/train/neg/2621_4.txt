I would not bring a child under 8 to see it. With puppies dangling from buildings, squirming in dangerous cars, and listening to Cruella's dreadful laugh, to name a few events, for a young child too much anxiety. <br /> <br /> Live action gives a more ominous feeling than the animated version, and there are quite a few disturbing moments, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that can excite and frighten the Children. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know what Disney people were thinking, but neither history nor the game was at their usual level. Puppies are cute, but this film is spotted at best.
