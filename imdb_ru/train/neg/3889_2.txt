I always wanted to see it, because I love raw horror films, and with that title I was sure that “Incredible Melting Man” would be very funny. <br /> <br /> This really isn't true. I mean, the acting was funny bad, the script contained some classic bad lines, and the special effects looked like someone sneezed all over the lead actor, so I had to love it. Unfortunately, between these highlights is very difficult. I decided to watch the second half of the film, making a tax return. That's how boring this movie is. <br /> <br /> However, if you like bad movies, you will like the dramatic release of Fat Nurse and the star game of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to a poor man, he must utter surprisingly inept lines with a straight face — for example, a conversation he leads with his wife to track down the guy’s MM: <br /> <br /> “I’ll find him with a Geiger counter . "Is he radioactive?" "Just a little." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot makes Dr. Ted wander around trying to find a super-powerful killing machine for a zombie armed only with what looks like a mini-Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately, his plan failed when he discovered a large number of jokes on the tree. "Oh God, it's his ear!" Says Dr. Ted to the audience. I am so glad that he clarified everything. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie sounds quite fun. It would be if it were only 10 minutes, but unfortunately it goes on and on and Incredible P The avid Dude just hangs about making a sticky mess when he should have eaten more people, in my opinion. I think if you were really stoned, you would have liked it, there simply wouldn’t be pop-tarts in film time, because the lead actor really looks like the one at the end.
