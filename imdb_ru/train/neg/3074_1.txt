Even for cocaine, permeated by the 1980s, that's a pity. I do not understand why someone would like to spend celluloid, time, effort, money and brain cells of the audience to make such nonsense. If you're going to make a comedy, make it funny. If you want to remove trash, keep it with you. If you are going to let it out in a joke like this: NOT !!! I mean, it was a joke, right? Someone please tell me that it was a joke. You are welcome.
