What kind? Jamie Fox should be funny? Does he really believe that he is funny? Well, it is ridiculous to watch his confidence that he is funny. A person has no identity ... I mean, you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he tries his best to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that he does it badly, unevenly, and the result is some parts in which he somewhat resembles Denzel, with these machoes ** This is an attitude, and then suddenly turns into Martin Lawrence, a funny and clumsy comedian. To all this, there is no personal contact, I mean that he does not contribute to the person he is trying to sell, and I am sure that he has nothing to say personally. In fact, he is personally Mr. Dumb. <br /> <br /> I really hoped for Hollywood, and the black community in America would find someone better to start a superstar, like Don Cheadle, but perhaps pathetic Jamie better represents a generation that remixes to the old.
