No words can describe my complete hatred for this terrifying performance of the BTK's killer. Evaluation of this film is one of ten compliments is truly a disastrous excuse for the film. From the beginning to the end there was not one raisin. It was all terribly connected; scenario, action, plot, lighting, direction, action, factual information, action, and these are just some of them. A number of scenes are literally laughing, out loud, ridiculous, because it all connects together. This review may seem like an unfair and brutal attack on a low-budget film, but itâ€™s not. The mere thought of the film that I just saw makes my blood boil. How this film got production rights, I will never know. I am almost tempted to actually recommend the BTK, because it really stands out in how pitiful and terrible it is. I can honestly say that for all my years of filming this is the MOST GOOD. MOVIE. EVER. I spent more than an hour of my life on this useless trash and would happily jump off the nearest building in advance if I knew what was waiting for me. Zero out of ten.
