Wow, what a great premise for a movie: set it around a filmmaker with a writer's block who decides to take tango lessons. Hey, and what else is the best idea that the main role is given to a director who is interested in tango. Damn it, I would like to have this talent for genius. Yes, I am sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that this type of zero potential for making money on films is made. Come on, if you're not a fan of mad tango (I admit that they exist, judging by the comments) or a stubborn member of the fan club Sally Potter (?) There is nothing in this movie that would make you rush to the cinema to see it. Even if you are into tango, most of the film is occupied with meaningless scenes, such as home repairs or a wheelchair user walking along the road. <br /> <br /> LESSON OVERVIEW is soon, where the script writer from Scotland failed and sits sarcastic but very entertaining reviews of the films he saw. Choking with shock when Theo Robertson puts the shoe in the latest Hollywood blockbusters, crying with sympathy when he receives another letter of refusal from the film company, feels lust when he takes a bath and rubs the soap on his well elastic body. LESSON REVIEW will soon come to the cinema next to you if someone is stupid enough to finance a movie <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter is not related to Harry Potter
