It really should be worthy of an “O” rating or even a negative score. I watched this show for ages, and the show skipped a shark around series 7. This episode, however, is proof that the show skipped a shark. He writes lazy, absurd, smug and not even worthy of garbage, like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It’s quite possible to be funny and still be fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, Mummy, Graf Monte Cristo are all “funny” movies that cannot be taken seriously. However, there is such a thing as funny, as in "This is the worst thing I've ever seen." And indeed, this is the worst Stargate episode I've ever seen. This is terrible, and it comes from someone with a stargate in her basement. <br /> <br /> Makes me want to sell all my stargate details, very seriously.
