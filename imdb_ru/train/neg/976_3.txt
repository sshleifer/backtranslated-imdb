I, as a rule, are more inclined towards impartiality regarding coma than many, but it was just not a good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparisons with the British original - I did not see it, and I will not doubt it. This is largely due to the winding plot, the lack of chemistry between the characters and the terrible performance / character from his intended male hero (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon goes on screen in the clothes and hairstyle of a 15-year-old child, and she acts ten years younger. You see, he has to be a teacher, and, of course, it’s well known that school districts around the world like to hire people less mature than the children they intend to teach. The character is so agitated and irrational that I doubt any actor could make him likeable, but old reliable personalities such as John Cusack or Adam Sandler could do it. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor an actor, but seems to think that he is both. Never for the whole movie would you believe Fallon in his role, or believe that these two can or will be together. Toward the end of the film there is a scene where Barrymore (who, as usual, was a cutie, but could not carry this alone - it’s hard to have a single person’s romance), Fallon says that it's all over, too much has happened, and she moves on. And instead of getting upset about the scene or apologizing for Fallon, you actively encourage her — finally, she does what she should have done a few months ago. But, of course, the conspiracy mechanics will not allow this to be the end (the end that could actually make a statement out of this mess), and instead we see how a rational career woman throws it all to pursue after this childish idiot and encourages his delusions. This, of course, meant being sticky and satisfying, but in fact it made me more disgusting than anything else.
