I found this film rather strange. From the very beginning, I was very fond of this film, and now, with a little thought, I can pinpoint the reason. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him in tatters (I think Zentropa is one of the best films ever made) doesn’t fit here, and although I can't imagine who would be better, I’m sure that someone could easily take his place and make this film work. Everything else is in order, except for the blows in the weak comedy (the joke “Meeting with Parents”, filmmakers!) Not needed, and I really like Richard E. Grant as a British major. It only suffers from one thing ... Jean-Marc.
