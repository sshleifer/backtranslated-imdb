I signed up only to make this comment (which largely overlaps with some of those already here). The game is worse than at a low level, it lays out generally accepted stereotypes, has some of the worst manifestations of tasteless female objectification (all without a brain), and has some of the most stupid lines known to man. <br /> <br /> including, but not limited to, “everything is fine, let's see what these guys can do.” I should also mention that when they show an accident involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for innocent people and start hating the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black characters that just rubs people wrong. He may or may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow this kind of character research. Do you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This film makes you hate the bad guys and not capture the audience. <br /> <br /> Even the machines cannot make up for this randomness of the film. That Enzo, who broke the Griffin, perfectly describes this film. It just sucks.
