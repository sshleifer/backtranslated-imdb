This is a pretty good cast, but the film has nothing to do with the original Italian comedy Big Madonna Street. Anyone who is looking for an exciting caper movie should visit the original. William Macy is perhaps one of our greatest living actors, but here he will be of little use. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I am a little sorry for his attempts to fill the shoes. You can also try to imitate Bogart or the young De Niro. The artistic direction is rich and textured, but nothing brings into history, the extra pieces that they add to the story seem completely unnecessary, and the things they select are missing. Even the beginning, as they do, seems strange and doesn’t surprise the original. Sam Rockwell has his strange and ingenious charm, while Luis Guzmán has this strange charisma, but part of the love story in the film seems just awkward and flat. It is a pity that no one understood how to make this film the way it was made, but again, it’s too bad that we live in a culture where we feel that we need to remake amazing things and not just learn how to enjoy the originals .
