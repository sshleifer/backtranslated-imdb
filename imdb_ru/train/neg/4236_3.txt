Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and a little modern psycho-billy, then watch live shows is the only thing worth seeing. This film has tons of group cameos, along with President Troma Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-main role, and a lot of stupid death scenes. Looks like it might be good, right? Well, deaths continue to arrive, and repeatedly for many different groups of Warp Tour and fans at the event. Some of the deaths begin stylishly, but then they are recycled again and again, right up to full repetition. Almost all die from the fact that they have a broken head or intestines torn out of the stomach. The blood looks like it was from Andreas Sznaas’s Zombie 90: Extreme Epidemic; it is “branched blood”, but now this film is actually decent and gives humor - something that is terribly lacking in this film. Of course, the film was made by Doug Sakmann from Troma, he has a lot of budget potential, and he is trying ... but too much. In this film, everything is too funny, and it discourages him. Everything is trying to be too comical and stupid, using deliberate bad behavior, excessive use of senseless deaths and doing the same thing ... again and again. This is basically “Malva: Zombie-Kicker,” “Chairman of the Board,” or any film you shot with friends: this is funny for those who did it, and that’s all. <br /> <br /> Excellent Potential, great idea, great use of effects - but it’s the same thing ... again and again: the band is playing, the band is dying, the fans are dying. Everybody dies, blood splashes everywhere, the process repeats. <br /> <br /> The question in such films, which are mostly “bad slaps”, are they trying their hardest or not at all?
