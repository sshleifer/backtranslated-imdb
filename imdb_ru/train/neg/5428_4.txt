Another film “Priyadarshan / Vohra”, another film that was watched for TP and not for real desire, the only reason I watched this film was the fact that there were no regular customers in this film (Akshay Paresh and many others ), but, of course, I I had low expectations from this film. <br /> <br /> I was pleased with the casting as a whole, with the exception of Rajpala Yadav, who was annoying again without any restrictions, but nonetheless he caused some laughter, but those were the usual farce original jokes, this whole movie is like a game of dhol, I mean, for a loud noise, some kind of talent is hardly needed, or even a bit strange to hit a dhol, isn't it? It is only those who can tolerate various blows in a good consistent manner, over a long period of time, that are considered great. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to another instrument, Dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variations and it can be enjoyable for a while while the monkey is dancing (hmmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it is not a tool that will entertain you for long or even make you dance like Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This film was like playing dhol and dumra, sometimes dhol played sometimes dumra, sometimes together, but mostly Dumru was played alone and the monkey danced. And, like any 24-year-old, sooner rather than later, I got bored. <br /> <br /> In the film there are several good moments of Dhol (good), but after a while all I heard is annoying Dumra (first funny, then tolerant, then annoying). ), the big regular parts really guarantee that this film is basically good for a few funny clips on "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you haven't watched it, watch it on Filmy, it goes in the evenings and is really quite funny)). <br /> <br /> This film had its moments, the actors did a great job, except for Rajpal Yadav (who can play, although I saw him in Maine Mary Patney ??), which is more annoying than entertaining, I said it many times and i will say it again. I really think that Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a great career ahead, especially in multi-star comedies. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really funny, such as failed attempts to impress the father-girl, crazy people trying to get the girl and get her away from each other. <br /> <br /> But after it was completed, there was an attempt to turn this film into a much larger one with the added mystery, which means that after the girl was in the film, the next 45-60 minutes became more agonizing, the culmination was "SO BAD ALMOST A GOOD CATEGORY", I mean, they were thinking that if you needed a tense ending, at least try to make it taste good. <br /> <br /> The movie is also extremely predictable, there is hardly any scene you cannot predict and you will not break into a spontaneous burst of laughter here it looks more like you see how it approaches and almost starts laughing before the gag . <br /> <br /> The film follows a gradual decline in all films, except for a strange blow, down or up, and then quickly falls down once they make friends with a girl. <br /> <br /> Most of the really bad scenes were nearing the end, one movie trying to be something more than just the comedy of the mill, also many jokes were very very OLD AND INTERIOR REPEAT, THE LAST 10-15 WERE SPECIALLY WRONG AND COMPLETELY SO FILM. <br /> <br /> I didn’t find Tanushri Datta the way she was supposed to play, and her acting talent raises serious doubts, especially because of her unattractive appearance, if you can't be HOT and can't understand how long you can to survive. <br /> <br /> Technically, this film was weak, with a constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> Songs other than the title track were also not good, when the songs played in the 2nd half, I felt a collective sigh of the audience. <br /> <br /> In all the films that are just ordinary, simply because of the cast and very low level. waiting <br /> <br /> Avoiding this would not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if you need to watch it, watch it on TV for free, or a very cheap matinee, or something is necessary, if you pay for the full multiplex rate, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> - a lot of bad jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, the last 45 minutes and the last 15 minutes ESPECIALLY, bad from a technical point of view, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s trying to be more than Tanusri Datta, and not the usual cast (I am happy for that). <br /> <br /> + There are some good scenes in the beginning, the title track, good acting and cast, except for RY. <br /> Only 4.5 / 10 (I try to be objective here, I don’t like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushri Datta, and this film met my very low expectations, so I give him the advantage of all doubts, on the absolute expression of this the film was no more than 4)
