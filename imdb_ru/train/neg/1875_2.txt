First, I really loved Henry the Fool, which puts me in a very small group of moviegoers. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this film was a complete parody. Watching Hartley and the actors talk about the movie in an extra movie full of pride and senseless analogies with Star Wars made me dizzy. It was the hype on the part of producers (HDNET), implemented to the maximum. A real example of the emperor and his new clothes. Basically, I feel that Hal spoiled Henry Foole forever. I do not think that I will ever be able to see it again in a pure, innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember, Hal, you can fool some people from time to time ... etc. today, if all he did was throwing senseless trash. Unfortunately, this is a pure example of a lesson taught in the film “ADAPTATION”. The story should be exciting and active, or its box office hopes are really unclear. Never mind a decent story. For actors, it was like trying to play in a straitjacket. <br /> <br /> Hartley, it seems to me, is tasteless. With drum drums go around the dialogue. There was one Apple Soundtrack cycle that I recognized, and it made me smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought: oh, they are just trying to attract a new audience. But this is a really funny trip. I would love to spoil this movie for you, but it was done. It is rotten. Stupid franchise is dead. Long live Henry the Fool.
