When I watched this movie, I thought that everything would be fine at any moment ... I was wrong. The real best part of this movie was when it was all over. Total waste of 92 minutes. Aside from seriousness, the best part was when Wendigo finally appeared, which was at the end, and you couldn't even see him so good. And the tail was really stupid. There were too many sections in the film where you thought something was going to happen, but it was a disappointment. Worst of all, there was more talk about Wendigo than about Wendigo. To make the creature so bad, you couldnâ€™t say it for this film.
