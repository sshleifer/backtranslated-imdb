This is incredible because on many levels he manages to be terrible. The script, the play of actors, the direction and the choice of actors are terrible. Costumes, scenery and pseudo-medieval language are also terrible. In a strange way, I really liked this film when I realized that it would not be good. It seems a shame that people spend so much time and effort on creating something so poor, when in fact they could do something pretty decent from the room (although not very believable!), But instead we treat nauseous and stupid Tale of dragons and knights, which lacks the charm, which can be found in other such fantastic films. Hopefully the Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Theulis's haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!
