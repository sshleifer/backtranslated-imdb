This film was a blow to me. I suppose that little girls should strive to be nothing more than swimsuit models, home craftsmen or mistresses, since this seems to be all that they will ever depict. It is really sad to see that the work and the life of an artist are so unfairly misinterpreted. Inevitably (or perhaps should have been expected), the whole character of Artemisia and all that she stands for was reduced to the standard Hollywood, female character; a miserable, physically immaculate, helpless little creature, showing no character trait that actually gave her the place in history that was disfigured here. It was even sadder to see that a significant part of the audience was too poorly educated in the area to understand the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality. To portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist, someone whom she actually accused of rape, even when under torture, just pisses me off. If the director had nothing more substantial to say, she would have to refrain from substantiating her story on a real person.
