A slasher movie made in the early 80s has a curse, and anyone who tries to end it turns out to be dead. Over the years, a group of filmmakers attempted to complete the film by also resurrecting films with a deadly curse. A great idea for a movie, but unfortunately, Cut is just another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia did not have a better world record when it comes to horror. Razorback (1984), like Holwing III (1987), was half American film. As for our passion for comedic horror, the “Body Melt” (1993) is best left forgotten. The problem with “Cut” is that the creators are trying to create a smart horror satire in the style of “Scream” (1996), but they have no idea about the genre or what makes it work. And although it sounds strange, I say this about a slasher film, but “Cut” really lacks any “heart”. Of course, he follows the basic “rules” established by “Shout”, but he does not want to play with the formula, instead he uses a cardboard copy of an earlier version. <br /> <br /> The killer, Skarman, is probably one of the most boring and charismatic villains in the history of horror films. His endless barrage of embarrassing, lame one-liners would be a porn dialogue, it seems like Shakespeare. The actors never seem to be fully involved and look as if they are just waiting for the end of filming so that they can receive their payment checks. And the sensation of the film seems to be that he consciously tries not to be creepy; more like an episode of "Neighbors" or "Heart broken." By the way, those attempts to style MTV, hyper-cinema during the "research" sequence just look inconclusive, outdated and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> If Australia ever has a chance to make horror again (which I hope we are still doing) maybe we should take a sheet from Mad Max (1979). Instead of trying to copy the USA, we should try our own genre.
