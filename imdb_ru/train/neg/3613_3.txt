This is a bad movie, but I have to give it to the lead actress in this ... Francine Forbes. She seemed to act the least, and I personally thought she was pretty sweet. It is a pity that she appears only in one other film in the database. In addition, the film is filled with ridiculous blood and fake scenes of death. People are hit, and they are DRAINED like 2 gallons of blood! But if you like to watch bad horror movies, I highly recommend this one.
