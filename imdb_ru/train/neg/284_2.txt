I only took it today at the store for 99 cents just today, and I still think I was frustrated. “Dream to Believe” is a rather boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama, and $ 1 is too expensive for that. This film is probably known only by two things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It is directed by Paul Lynch, a man who also made Promo Night. Now for the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who was badly injured in a car accident that also cost her father’s life. Thus, an accident prevents her from participating in gymnastic tournaments, she is often chosen during classes, and in the end she meets some wild child named Tommy (played by Keanu). Robin, when not in training, works part-time with his mother and a half-sister in a laundry room owned by her stepfather. In the end she is chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> In general, only Keanu and a few memorable melodies of the 80s - that's what keeps me from giving this 1 star, and this is also not one of the worst films ever, but it is still far from good. The DVD itself also does not receive any medals, since it seems to be obtained from the old VHS and closer to the end, the sound is not synchronized, and when the end credits are almost gone, it turns black, although the sound can still be heard. So this can probably be referred to as a bootleg. The DVD design also does not make sense, since it has what seems like recent photographs of Keanu and Olivia, and the background has nothing to do with the film, since it is also not in the film itself, so the cover is clearly photographed. In any case, avoid at all costs if you are not a fanatic Keanu. I probably won't get attached to this anymore. I'm probably going to give it to The Cinema Snob, which, by the way, is a great YT critic. Hey, if any of you have any shitty movies they don’t want to see anymore, feel free to donate to his show to go on.
