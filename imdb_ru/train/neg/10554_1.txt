Avant-garde nightmarish, extremely low-budget "film", which has delusions of grandeur. Hard to sit. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Wow, a great revelation. I had no idea that it was wrong before viewing it. Yes, it is sarcasm. DO NOT watch this “movie” if you are offended by a naked male or female face. Do not look if you are a little squeamish. DON'T LOOK if you care about acting. If you think, just do not watch this period. <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Additional information on DVD: film making, premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersok, deleted scenes, footage from the film, director's comment, 2 versions of the teaser trailer , The Azoic music video and classroom video experiment
