So it came to this. Fast, expensive cars that only the top 1% will ever drive Girls who pose next to them in gearbox magazines. Second level actors and nameless. Cheap advertising performances of people from a niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the trash Hollywood has to offer. Do not get me wrong; I love the hot-eyed senseless thriller just like the next guy. But please, will the collective Braintrust, which highlights these things, stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty “Woooooosaaaaaah”, then rewind twenty-five years ago and remember what made movies enjoyable once? Then actually make some films like this again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the whole explosion of pop culture that he has enjoyed in the past five years is simply ridiculous. All and their mother believe that now their Maverick (not that half of them even get this link). Some executives said, “Hey, from which demographic do you want to catch $ 9.50?” “I know, sir. Market 18-35 ". "Well, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "A brilliant idea, sir." Result? The film, which I saw hundreds of times late at night on Spike TV, and most often with the participation of Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I'm not a snob. Excessive feature films, such as The English Patient, do not float in my boat, but regular films that should not have been shot directly on DVD also bother me. Only teenage engines will get their engines as a result of this, and I think that those who are at the top of their IQ range will see it for what it is: a dump.
