This film could be an interesting study of the characters and could give some idea of ​​its subject, but the real problem of this film is that there is nothing like it in it. It gives no understanding or solution to the problem. This is just an image of an “old” male sex addict and the problems he poses for his daily normal life and family. Why do you watch this? It's all so pointless and pointless. <br /> <br /> It also does not help that the main character is some kind of wrinkled man over 50 years old. It will be difficult for you to identify yourself - and sympathize with him. He just looks like a dirty old playboy who constantly hunts for a woman and sex. He has all kinds of sexual intercourse about 3 times a day with different women, and not only with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> He also doesn’t have a bad visual style, although it all seems a bit forced. But, nevertheless, it all looks better than most other direct-viewing movies. Who knows, if the directors were given the best material for the work, the film would have deserved better faith. <br /> <br /> At times, the story really causes ridicule. There are indeed some meaningless plot lines that are often more ridiculous than they obviously should have been. I speak, for example, of the whole storyline of Ordell. The situation worsens when the film begins to end. In addition, the whole story of the story, going back and forth between the events that occurred and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist, seems a bit cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But for bad movies, this is just not one of them. In fact, this is no better and no worse than any other random movie with a similar video. <br /> <br /> However, it seems strange and surprising that they managed to play Nastasya Kinsky and Ed Begley Jr. in such a simple little insignificant production like this. I think they really desperately needed work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
