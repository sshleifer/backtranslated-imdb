To be honest, I did not watch all the original “howl”, but the scenes I saw showed that the first howl was a great movie. so great to have done seven terrible sequels. they started with "Howl II: your sister was a werewolf." I got this film on VHS from my uncle, when he was handing out a bunch of old films that he bought when Atari was brand new. I just watched it last night and it wasn’t quite BAD, it was just weird. I mean that with Sybil Dunning in three directions with her two werenew minions was just inappropriate and rather alarming (but rather hot), Christopher Lee is going to strike dead Karen as if she was a vampire, etc. this film was actually a bit of a hodgepodge of Dracula and Lost Boys ... except for the werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (played by Dracula himself) was talking about werewolves was pretty much ripped off from any other movie vampires (cola) in heart, garlic, night creature should die at night, and the ruler of TRANSLATIONS is living in TRANSLATION). not much for acting, but the worst of it came from Annie Macinroy. I swear, at some point in the movie, I found that I was rooting for werewolves to snatch her throat, because there was always something to say in that damned throat. In any case, the plot is pretty stupid and cliché, so there’s no point in telling you, you can just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, what really makes me sick in this film is the fact that this is the ONLY film from all seven sequels that are in any way connected to the original (not counting Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the film). the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so don't watch this movie. there is no real horror, almost no werewolves, and just terrible special fools. 3/10
