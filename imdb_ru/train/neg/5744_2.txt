This movie was just awful. It was so bad that I registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I am an expert on horror movies. I watched "Redneck Zombies", "House of Psychotic Women", "Massacre of Bachelorette II" and many others. I know my castle. And I know that this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Three-quarters of the film is made up of frightened people running from one side of the screen to the other. When they do not run, they spew non-quit lines devoid of emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls apart. There were so many low angle shakes; I figured Leif Jonker had a 3-foot tripod. He used what I call the “Leif Maneuver” several million times, that is, he reduced the scale of an object of interest as an amateur. Apparently, the film crew could not get up early enough to shoot the sunrise, so they shot the sunset ... and played it in reverse order. With such a lazy direction, you are actually impressed with the final bloody scene. The only thing you can understand is that the last five minutes were shot before the first eighty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want to get a good (bad) horror movie, rent a Riki-Oh or the basic "The Living Dead." If you are a schlock lover and are looking for an ordeal, try Darkness. <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie - <br /> <br /> Vampire: Time to die!
