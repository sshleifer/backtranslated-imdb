The film begins with an intriguing scene, three people drinking and talking in a bar. They all make up some outrageous stories. As the film unfolds, it turns out that the most outrageous story is true. However, in addition to this, the film is not very interesting, except for the scene in the bar and the scene where the main secret is revealed. This revelation happens in almost half the time in the film, and, frankly, there is little to see. The rest of the time the director lives in a Russian village forgotten by God, full of wretched and creepy old women. Of course, these are exciting and slightly shocking images, but their admiration continues for too long, sacrificing any possible plot or character development. I found this film as another example of creating lousy or lazy films, where instead of trying to make an interesting story, the filmmakers concentrate on strangely exciting images and tell some almost unrelated stories (for example, the story of a meat trader) to leave the viewer to find all the odds and ends. At first glance, he has an artsy appearance, but in this particular case it is nothing but a lack of talent.
