Nicholas Roag? He shot the classic supernatural thriller DON'T LOOK NOW, is he? It is strange that the aforementioned film was broadcast on BBC television on the weekend, which this evening showed the screening of the film “Cold Sky”, which was never favored. <br /> <br /> You see that it is impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DOO`T LOOK NOW, since they both have the same director and the same structure, and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought that they had there is also the same conspiracy, with the exception of a dead husband, was replaced instead of a dead child, in fact, I thought about this film revolving around a heartbroken widow who sees her late husband running around Venice in red anorak. This does not happen, but approximately one third of the way during the work, there is a huge plot twist, and, despite the fact that it is a significant plot twist, it is not explained at any depth. In fact, very little is explained in the film "Cold Sky", which destroys the film. <br /> <br /> People mentioned rather low Cold Sky performance, and it’s impossible not to notice them. If I had not changed, I would have thought that this is TVM, because it was created for television, right down to the white capital letters in the title. Roeg also tries to introduce art-house claims through conversational thought processes, but again this does not help the film at all. It is impossible not to feel that Rug should have made all his efforts to plot the turns, which are absolutely flat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Low cost of production, selfless direction and really strange background and screenplay make a bad movie
