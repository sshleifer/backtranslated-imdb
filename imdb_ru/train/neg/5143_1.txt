Even if 99.99% of the people who watched this movie are Brazilians, I will follow the English language, since it is the language of this site. <br /> <br /> This film is a part of the cr * r. I have seen the worst acting skills for a long time. Children are terrible. Especially the boy. It was the first time I saw someone with a smaller facial expression than that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and with one voice, like a five-year-old child reading in front of a class. How can someone so bad be the main actor in a movie? The storyline is so superficial that my daughter could cope better (she is 3 years old). It is so simple that you can write in a napkin and tell in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> Someone has three options for watching this movie: 1) you are a teenager; 2) Globoâ€™s stupidity is so brainwashed that you think that everything that has the Globo seal is simply amazing; 3) you have serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! Shame on the Brazilian movie scene.
