I watched the movie and was shocked, to say the least, that the film could not communicate with me as an audience. Language shame street loafers. <br /> <br /> Story; a father who does not force a single son to marry seems far-fetched. <br /> <br /> The idea that a grandmother would ask her grandson to make a mess with the enemy would only attract the attention of the demented. <br /> <br /> ... and I waited for the whole movie to laugh and laugh I did it by my own stupidity, after spending three hours to convince myself that the movie was not even worth the first look. <br /> <br /> Hope this will save YOUR time!
