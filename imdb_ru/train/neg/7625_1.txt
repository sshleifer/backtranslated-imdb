This is your only warning about the spoiler. What a sad state of our cinema when such unprofessional garbage is considered “Oscar-worthy”. <br /> <br /> I divide the material into three levels. The first is a theater scene. Here the viewer stands still, and the strength rests on the actor’s presentation and, most importantly, on the writer's strength. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter, because he or she knows the ways of words better. Top playwrights know how to create images that a barren scene cannot show. <br /> <br /> The second level is a movie. In this environment a weaker writer may be used, but the viewer does not sit in one place all the time. With film, context can take on the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing. In addition, the film can manipulate everyday elements, such as sound and color, in almost surrealistic ways. <br /> <br /> The last level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated on paper, and then re-imagined by the reader. The novel may contain much more details than is possible for a film studio. <br /> <br /> That is why adaptation can go up, but never fall. Novelizations are never better than a base film (see “Ten Cents for a Dozen” at your local bookstore), whereas a film cannot convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Movies can rarely be turned into plays, and plays can always be turned into movies. <br /> <br /> With regard to the “Last Picture Show,” it fails. This is a film that has to stand on the stage, because the director is too stupid to shoot something right. The characters speak the same way and act the same way, it is useless. Add to this a disgusting soundtrack, and you will have a completely unusable movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this in high school drama lessons with about 20 other fans. The teacher was amazed at how sad the film was. The sad thing is that such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is cheerful. If it were in color, powerless scenes, a pool party, and an old prostitute would be recognized as a great comedy. See what Lucas did with American Graffiti a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American secondary education system should start teaching about the film, and not try to teach with the movie. Two visually powerful dark films: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Rely on them, not on this. This is the “Last” I want to see. 1 of 5
