I was not very impressed with Dante’s proposal for the first season in “Returning Home”; it was not a scary story, but rather a clever political statement with the undead. The Screwfly situation is the story of a virus that struck the world, which replaces men's sexual attraction with killer tendencies towards women. The episode begins well with a short film explaining how scientists killed a fly. Then there is a short scene in which a man is arrested when the bodies of women are found in his house. I suppose it should show the beginning of the flash, but it is unclear because it has never been revised. The episode continues for some time, introducing the characters blah blah blah. It seems cool and mysterious, but the episode gets worse and worse as it moves forward to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
