For a while I watched Phat Beach on cable, and I liked it. Fat man is the best character since he seems to be a good guy. The rest of the characters are just different stereotypes of boys and boys. I like to watch these low-budget films that capture a period of time, because they are almost like a documentary about relationships and the quirks of the year. Phat Beach is also fun because the low-budget kids in this movie are especially homely girls. Most of the low-budget films have the quality of “local babe,” and you can say that the babes in this film were local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging on their bikinis that it was funny to see how the “young people” went crazy over what was in fact some kind of truly oversupply, with a lot of mileage. There were also cuties. This is the beauty of these low-budget shit movies. You will see a lot of dogs and real cuties! I checked some of them on IMDb, and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Very bad. It would be interesting if someone managed to make the book “Where they are now” about all the pretty girls who appeared in the history of cinema and then never return. What happened?? There are probably almost one or two young men in almost every film who seem to expect a lot from them, and yet years later, when you see the film again on TV, you are surprised: “what happened to X?” Anyway , this film is mostly blowing, but it has some funny moments.
