As soon as I began to see the posters and hear the talk about this film, I was immediately excited. The matrix was incredible, and I couldn't wait to see the second one, especially after I started watching trailers for it in other films. However, when I saw this, I left the theater very disappointed, like many other viewers in the theater with me. Although the action scenes in the film, as always, were amazing, there were too few of them. It seemed that in the first film there were constant fights, and in the second - a much more (and very unfortunate) preaching point of view. Summing up the story, it was not so much that it was not expected. Cars were digging in the direction of Zion with the intention of destroying it (this is not a spoiler, everyone saw it in advertising). The dialogue of the film was absolutely terrible. If you are not an expert in psychology, you most likely will not understand much of what is said in the film, and therefore you will not care. It became a kind of romantic film featuring events in the life and relationship of Neo and the Trinity. Agent Smith, despite being as bad as in the first film, seemed all religious and preaching. I personally do not need to hear about it or pay money to listen to it. The film was a serious waste of my time, and I don't think I can watch the first one anymore. The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues of almost every character made me quickly lose interest in the film, and a small number of good battle scenes pushed me to the edge, and the end of the film pushed me right away. Which movie ends up being "Prisoner"? How original is the people. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers need to burn midnight oil to come up with it. In conclusion, the film was bad and thatâ€™s it.
