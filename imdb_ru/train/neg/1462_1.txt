It may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite the fact that Mikshelt argues, this film is not even nearly historically accurate. It starts badly, and then everything goes down. We have Hitler's father, who scolds his own failure at the "fact" that he married his niece! They were actually cousins. Hitler’s mother, Clara, called her father, Alois, “uncle” because Alois was adopted and raised by Clara’s grandfather and raised as his son when he really was his nephew. Alois was much older than Clara and therefore in childhood she had a habit of calling Alois "uncle". <br /> <br /> The scene in the trenches, where Hitler mocks his companions and decides to put it on his dog - it's just a shame and insult to the intelligence of all viewers. We see Hitler stalking a dog through a trench, when he catches up with the poor thing, he continues to beat her for disobeying him. In the distance, we see and hear how his colleagues continue to mock and punish the cowardly little man, but then the shell hits directly to his pursuers, and every last one, as we are told, is killed on the spot. How, then, if Hitler was the only person who survived on the scene, did this story of cruelty and cowardice become famous? Did Hitler himself get around with "boasting"? - I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Further, Hitler intimidates and intimidates a poor, tired and war-tired Jewish officer to give him an Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer was a pawnshop before fighting for the Fatherland, and thoughtfully took with him some promised medals from his shop, because I am sure that the Iron Crosses were not handed out, as shown in this comic farce. <br /> <br /> There are all the grotesque clichés, not least the soothing and hypnotic impact of Wagner’s music on the little man. If only producers kept Ian Kershaw on the side. Then they might find that Franz Legar’s “Merry Widow” is more likely to launch the Führer’s boat than any Flying Dutchman from Richard Wagner’s cannon! <br /> <br /> Hitler could have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people, but how can he be forgiven for his terrible taste in music? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I would do this for hours. <br /> <br /> Miss.
