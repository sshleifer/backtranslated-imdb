Do you know those movies that hit the movie? You were stuck there in the best place in the house, in the center of the row in your special sweet spot, which you swapped three times before you got just the right place - and after about 13 hours you still found yourself there uncomfortable and itchy, thinking: " When the hell will this movie ever end? ‚Äù(You know this feeling - think about AI and the Village). <br /> <br /> Well, Visitor Q offers a strange version of this feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes, wondering when it would start! It is endless! So "Artie" it hurts. This is the first film about Miik Takashi that I watched. Apparently, he makes dozens of films, and if they are all as pretentious as I think it will be the last. <br /> <br /> I am not against pretentious work. David Lynch is one of the top 10 directors for me, but visitor Q is a stripped-down, cheap and nasty pretentious w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you already understood - I hated it.
