In a college dorm, a guy killed by someone with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dory Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later, she had a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence), and she was going to have a spring break with Hank and four other crazy friends in a BIG, beautiful condo in Florida. Naturally, the killer pops up (for no reason) and starts killing again. <br /> <br /> A lousy thriller-slasher is an example from a tutorial on how NOT to make a low-budget horror movie. For a start, the big parts of this film are the ENDLESS filler of these six idiots who video themselves, “have fun” (more fun than the public), get drunk, act silly, etc. I'm not saying that a horror movie needs nudity, but ANYTHING to revive it would help. None of the deaths are actually shown (you hear them), just a little bloody and no blood. There is one REAL disgusting - but this is not to the end. <br /> <br /> With a few exceptions, acting sucks. Dory Barton is terrible as the main woman, and Tom Jay Jones is lousy like Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad, and he is terrible. Lawrence is really very good - beautiful and clumsy, and he has all this shit. And Jeff Conavey appears in a small role, doing a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of logical mistakes - after they realize that they have killed a friend, two girls carelessly talk about sex; Bastogne's reaction to killing a friend is pretty funny, and WHAT is happening with Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Boring, stupid, no blood, no nudity - skip this.
