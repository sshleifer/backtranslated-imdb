I first watched Cold Case after it was shown on Danish television for about a year. When he appeared on television, he nearly drowned in four or five other American crime shows that were shown around the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it, and I was bored to death. Non-standard actors with complacent faces and morals were a pain from behind. The whole premise that a group of researchers was given so much money to uncover murders committed 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor, as they only have 50-60 minutes to tell a story, which means they get a breakthrough at the very last moment to resolve the matter and restore justice to the surviving members. families if they are still alive. This, combined with the "personal" problems and relations of investigators, which should have time, leaves the show completely cloudless. <br /> <br /> I put it on a 2-star rating because of the music at the end, which is actually the only reason to watch it ... which you, of course, will not do, because it is TOO weak reason for watching this shit.
