Good try and good ideas (redemption of a prostitute, people helping each other, ...), but a bad result ... The director obviously tried to imitate his French counterpart Tran Anh Hun, recreating the atmosphere that Vietnam is supposed to portray ... The only problem is that Vietnam was long gone, and when the “Scent of Green Papaya” was of historical origin ... tried to design such an atmosphere (muffled sounds and a slow pace of life). ..) nowadays leaves a fake feeling. In addition, it quickly creates a feeling of boredom, and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang, because it was there that Harvey Keitel, the former marine in the film, probably was during the war ... But in South Vietnam no one or very few people speak with the clip "Northern Accent", which is shown by the actors ... Seriously strange even for a poor Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful (not a disease for people of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write complex Vietnamese poems, ... even more doubtful ... <br /> <br />
