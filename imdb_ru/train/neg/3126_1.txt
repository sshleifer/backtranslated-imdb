Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked it like football. Unfortunately, this did not make a goal. The historical story of the giants is good, but pour the eerie milk, and you get a giant wheel of cheese. I say, take this reel wheel and slide off a cliff. I couldn't even watch the whole movie. It says a lot, because I rarely leave any movie. I always like to give them a last minute chance of salvation. It’s impossible to redeem something so bad. Well, at least the acting was good .... NOT! <br /> <br /> The only thing that “falls” in this film is the rating. 1/10 and plunging into negative numbers!
