"Sir" John Gilgud must have become marasmus to make a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films, which, I believe, is considered "art", but not to deceive ..... it is garbage. Stick to the “art” that you can admire in the frame, because films that are marked as such are usually incomprehensible fakes like this. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Gigood tells Shakespeare's “Storm” while the camera turns away to naked people. one of them is a small child urinating in the pool. Wow, this is reckless material and real "art", isn't it? This is just one example. Much of the story does not make sense, it is impossible to follow it, and therefore liberal critics are afraid to say that they “do not understand,” so they appreciate it to save their fake egos. Do you want Shakespeare? Read his books.
