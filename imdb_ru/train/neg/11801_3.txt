As a big fan of the original film, it’s hard to watch this show. Bright decor of the decorations and brightly lit decorations deprive any style of this remake. Mood never happens. Instead, it has the look of many seventies television films. Crenna is not a bad choice, like Walter Neff, but his quick wardrobe and “chic” apartment don't match the mood of the original or make him an interesting character. He does his best to make it work, but Samantha Egger is a really bad choice. California's English accent and appearance can't keep a candle under Barbara Stanwick's velvety voice and sex appeal. Lee J. Cobb struggles to model Burton Case, but even his performance is just rude, with no style. <br /> <br /> It feels like it was a television movie, and again reminds me of what a wonderful movie it still remains.
