Probably the worst Bollywood film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> No storyline. Very little character development. <br /> <br /> Full of silly and senseless humor. The whole film was chaotic and without direction. There was no right end of the story. The airport was filmed at the mall. <br /> <br /> The same story is chewed over and over again until you want to say: “Please just continue!” Even the song and dance were meaningless and poorly posed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is that there were hot bodies around ... but then most Bollywood films have the same thing these days. <br /> <br /> By the way, I am not of Indian origin <br /> <br /> 2/10
