I have no idea what this was shot for, but you can definitely say that they did not have a budget. A bad game, horrible cinematography, a flimsy plot and some decent special effects don't make a good movie. WWF-style cinematography makes you cry ... where's the tripod ?! Cinematographers set their sights on high, but missed strongly.
