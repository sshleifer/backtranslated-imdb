The film is boring, characters and scripts are unreal, incredible, fun action. This film is a big mess. It seems that when action music sounds, the most impressive trick is launched. Either Mr. McGregor interrupted his voice, or Stephen sang too much, and that changed his voice. In this film, too many dialogues and extremely bad acts on behalf of each. The film is an excellent therapy for sleep. The fight is ridiculous. The effect of changing the shape of the eyes on evil designer women addicts was decent. The main villain was a joke, and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation, he simply threw out random scenes, such as (spoiler) “CTX (its designer medicine) will be in the water supply”, which is never mentioned in the conclusion or even not mentioned again in the film. This film is highly recommended to go through.
