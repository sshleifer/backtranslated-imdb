I was shocked by Tigryland's incredibly incredible plot. It was a liberal fantasy about what the military should be. The dialogue was hard to swallow with the silly things that his senior officers allowed the hero of Colin Farrell to get along with. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking: “Hey, there is a reason why the training camp is heavy. I must prepare the soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit. There is no place for daring relationships and people who will not follow orders. ”I rooted for Bozz to get his ass kicked because he was such a danger to his brethren. because he was more concerned about people's feelings than what was necessary to protect his unit. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br />
