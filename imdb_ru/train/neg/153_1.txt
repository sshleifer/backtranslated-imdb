“Spielberg likes the smell of the senses in the morning. But feelings due to honesty narration? No one should love this. ” - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> Purple color occurs in the deep south in the early 1900s and tells the story of Seli and Nettie, two African-American sisters. The film begins with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic refuge that quickly collapses from the appearance of the stepfather. Is that a motive ?? innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The film then begins a series of short episodes. It turned out that her stepfather had infiltrated Sealy twice, her stepfather had given birth in a dirty barn, took her newborn baby and forced her to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, a cruel moron who repeatedly raped her, forcing her to cook, clean and care for her children. <br /> <br /> Little time is spent on all these horrible scenes on the screen, and instead they are surrounded by moments of pixie-dust filming, a cumbersome symphonic score, an inappropriate comedy and an over-abundant filming work. The cumulative effect is similar to the merger of the Disney cartoon and the rape film, which evokes a harsh aesthetic, due to which Stanley Kubrick noticed that “Color Purple” made him so nauseous that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes? He lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> The film often says “racism”, “sexism” and “black culture”, but it’s not. Alice Walker, the author of the novel on which the film is based, claims to be bisexual, but in reality she is a secretive lesbian. Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of women's liberation and self-discovery, in which men are portrayed as cruel cattle that put women at a dead end. According to Walker, the only way out of this labyrinth is to unite women in a kind of lesbian utopia, celebrating black sisterhood and women's independence. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's film reverses Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythology. This is a film in which the saving power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of people. The film, in which Albert finds himself in various absurd situations, inserting moments of irrelevant comedy, so that he looks like an awkward fool. The film, in which all the characters come from racist minstrel shows, which included depraved men (always shining with devilish smiles and a toothy smile), stereotypical fat mommies, jazz bands and gospel choirs. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which black people, like children, readily and joyfully accept their social conditions. The film, in which black people are overly sexual, carnal sensualists, in which cruel passions dominate. The film, in which poverty and class problems are completely invisible (Albert lives in a huge house), and blacks are completely inept. This is not the Old South, this is the Old South, as it comes from Gone with the Wind, MGM Muscals, Songs of the South, Warner Cartoons, Allyluha! And banned Disney films. In other words, it is the south seen by a child who grew up on the television of the 50s. This is all so caricature, so racist in the sense that it reduces these people to one-dimensional ethnic stereotypes that the black writer Ishmael Reed famously compared him to the Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a typical Spielberg manner, the film ends with the healing of family ties. This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes further when every character in history reconciles with his kind. <br /> <br /> Aside from the Hater Walker's letter to the blacks and Spielberg’s strange black life cartoons, we are shown nothing of the black community. We have only vague ideas about how each of these characters makes a living, and we do not know how they interact with other people in their community. Instead, Spielberg's camera jumps up, fighting desperately for our attention (one of Seli’s kitchen tricks looks like it belongs to Home Alone), every emotion is over, the director never stops to just watch something or allow a little life just pass by. Combine this with ridiculously "white" music by Quincy Jones, and you will have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an enraged feminist series filmed by a white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith, performed by a black man trying to imitate John. Williams <br /> <br /> The lack of white characters is also problematic. Think about it: the men in this film are not depicted as being rude to each other, nor do they dominate women, because their brutally racist society, which reduces their masculinity. No, they are cruel by nature. And women who are quietly suffering, like Sely, or rebellious and hard, like her sister, persist and survive only because men are too stupid to destroy them. The best film would not focus solely on the oppression of women, as happens among the oppressed; rather, it would show that it was violence in society that led to domestic violence, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the same tasks as their male counterparts (although they still perform traditional female roles) and that African-American domestic violence is mainly due to economic factors, women cannot support themselves and their children alone. <br /> <br /> And so there is a hidden ideology in working here. Later in the film, one character tells another that, because he did not respect his wife, she was severely beaten and imprisoned with whites. The implication is that blacks must return to their African roots in order to regain their dignity, and that their fault is that whites unfairly crush them. those. respect each other in your poor minority, and you will not encounter the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Inability to withstand sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequences loaded with extraneous visual pizaz, inappropriate comic businesses, vibrant musical remarks and wildly untwisted emotionality all contribute to rendering. ”Color Purple "worthless.
