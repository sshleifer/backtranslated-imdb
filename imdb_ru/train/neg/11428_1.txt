Oh, my God ... THE MOST ARTIST, EVER, I EVER KNOWED - this is the main thought that came to my mind right after watching a movie. And I really don't understand anyone with the opposite myth. Although, perhaps, the idea was good, but the effect is pitiful. Especially I mean the role of H. Graham. What was it??? In my opinion, this has destroyed all the positive intentions of manufacturers. The character was played in an irritated and annoying manner. Every time she appears, it reminds you that you are watching a movie and destroying the spirit of the moment, and then the whole movie, because more often you see her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create emotion. HORRIBLE, do not waste your time.
