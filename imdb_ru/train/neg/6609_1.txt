I cannot say that Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever created because I have not seen every Bollywood film, but my imagination tells me that this may well be. <br /> <br /> This film seems like an artistic suicide attempt on behalf of the director, and I, for example, believe that he successfully coped with his mission. Not a single actor from outside this film would venture to share with him the same bill for all the humiliations that this film should carry with it. <br /> <br /> But let's not blame only the director, there is a cinematographer who looks like he is rehearsing for an amateur filmmaker of the year award. There is too dramatic an estimate that hopes to take you to the next scene. The illuminator, who must have kept a cigarette in one hand and a light bulb on a pole in the other, and hoped that the flame that burned a cigarette would add much-needed light to each scene. And, of course, the actors! Some of them are not newcomers, otherwise everything can be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag was combined to promote a new beginning and dimension to reinterpret India's favorite film of all time, “Sholay”. We should not forget that these actors were not forced to participate in this film, they are the best and willing participants of something that, let's face it, surely would have high and impatient expectations of the public ??? Thus, the question arises, with the exception of Amitabha (for now), did other actors really believe that their performances even tried to improve the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and did he believe that people would remember his dialogue in this absurd film filth? Do not be stupid, of course, he did not, it was a demonstration to the public of how much money negotiations, therefore, can make the actors go. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that all the people involved are satisfied that it’s really a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film that pollutes everyone’s mind when they watch the original.
