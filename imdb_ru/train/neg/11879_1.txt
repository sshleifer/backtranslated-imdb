My wife and I rented this film because some people drew parallels between it and Office Space. Blockbuster and IMDB even offered this option as “also recommended” if you liked Office Space. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen Office space, probably 15 or 20 times. I like it. This is probably one of my 10 favorite films. Witty, humorous, with characteristic characters that remind me of people I have worked with for many years. "Tunnel Haiku" is similar to the "office space" in that both films. This is where the similarity ends. We sat, probably the first 50 minutes of HT, giving them the advantage of doubt, hoping not, * praying * that it would get better. This is not true. We couldn't take it anymore and stopped recording. Thank God it was a free rental. I would be offended if we actually paid for it. We should receive compensation for what we had to go through. Now, since we have not seen the end, perhaps he miraculously gets together and saves himself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The haiku tunnel is so bad that it's hard to believe that it has ever been created. The film is SO unfunny, it hurts. Just write damn letters already !!! The premise of asinin. Jokes awful We got to the scene "the printer does not work" and had to stop. We couldn't take it anymore. This film is an AD for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Office Space ...... don't waste your time on this shit. 0/10
