This movie is fun, not in a good way. The fights are terribly badly done, although sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking bones, and even this happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it a shock movie. A shootout means that the hero can go out into the open field, where 10 people shoot him from an ultrasound, take a gun, start shooting back and not get injured. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the guy wakes up, loses his memory, starts to fight, because this is what he is good at. Five years later, memories come back, revenge blablabla. <br /> <br /> Not worth your money, not worth your time, if you are not drunk and not bored.
