Scary film. If there is one Turkish film that you should avoid in 2006, it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. In addition to a couple of cheap laughs, this film gives nothing, nada, zilch, zero. Dialogue is cheap, and sexual cliches are everywhere. The director should watch more movies before trying to shoot their own. Red-haired women show examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning not to act, this is a great example of bad behavior. The only good thing I can say about the film is to wait, wait, nothing good I can say about it. I must have really disliked writing so much about it. Jeez!
