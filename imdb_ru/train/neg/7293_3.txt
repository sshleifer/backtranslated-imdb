Aaron Spelling produced it for Western television, which becomes a terrible plot for a seventy-three minute film. It looks like an unsuccessful pilot of the series. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Clint Walker is US Marshal Dave Harmon, who arrives in Yuma, Arizona, in time to kill one of the brothers of the local cattle who are on the trail. <br /> <br /> Walker sends another brother to jail. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican child who sleeps in prison. One night, Andres sleeps when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the remaining brother to the street and kill him, chaining the murder to Walker. Not suitable for your first twenty four hours at work. Walker visits a local army fort and annoys the chain commander. The wide wig hears about the death of his brothers and travels back to the city to calm his chains. The local indigenous people, whom the army quickly changes in their beef, also fall into the chain zone. With all these ranked chains, Walker still manages to attract the local hotel owner. The army guy involved in the murder turns out to be dead, a local livestock buyer is involved, the Indians speak a lot hesitantly, and the culmination is an unlikely confrontation, as Walker must prove to the city that the villain buyer had the boss of someone we suspected was too useful . <br /> <br /> There is a half-story about the death of the Walker family at the hands of the army raiders, and I think it would be the power of the show if it were raised. Instead, the film ends abruptly, and I continued to wait for scenes from the next week's exciting episode. Due to the fading of non-existent commercial interruptions, this ends everything, and its history does not stand up to scrutiny. <br /> <br /> Walker is handsome, rude and has a deeper voice than a well. The rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television films. Most of the action is rather lame, and the violence is cool. The first brother killed gets a midtorso shotgun and falls without scratching it. I didn’t expect that “Reservoir Dogs”, but this is not the film that should be used to teach children the evil of weapons! Speaking of children, the Mexican child very quickly moves from "nice" to "irritation, causing aneurysm." <br /> <br /> If you don’t like westerns, then you don’t like Hume. If you like westerns, then you still don't like Hume. I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is not rated, but contains physical violence and violence with the use of firearms. <br /> <br />
