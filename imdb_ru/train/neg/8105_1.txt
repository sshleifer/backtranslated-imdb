Severely, yes, but I call them the way I see them. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the end of the 80s, and it was truly one of the most horrendous, boring films I’ve ever forced myself to watch. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinematography is beautiful. Czech settings are really awesome. The political situation is tempting, but unlike similar “historically established” stories (for example, “Doctor Zhivago” (see)), This could not make the policy of a relevant story or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to make even the "erotic" scenes slow and slow. I'm all for the sake of the novel, but this film was so boring that I began to hope that the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my suffering. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I read the book, the story would have a little more meaning. However, life is too short to spend more time on it.
