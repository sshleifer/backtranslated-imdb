I'm glad to see that most other people here think too little about this movie. He has some big names in the cast, but that's all. There is nothing more to recommend, in addition to gaze at several pretty women, which you can do in a thousand films. <br /> <br /> Only unattractive, self-centered, smoking in chains, “fashionable” characters all national film critics seem to like .... and most of the public can not stand. <br /> <br /> Accents in Oklahoma are so bogus that the southern racist stereotypes right from liberal Hollywood 101 are ridiculous, and the story is depressing.
