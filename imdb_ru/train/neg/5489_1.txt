The story is similar to the alien: the alien runs on the ground and tries to return home. Being on our planet, he will create friendly relations with people. <br /> <br /> But, unlike ET, which exudes drama, comedy, poetry, this film is just funny. This is really a clean play “Disney”: its main audience is children, and the film is more visual than in the message. <br /> <br /> So you will find some funny scenes (the first observation of the city is a “space” wandering toaster) and casting experiments with special references to “Doc”, which is rejuvenated by the character “Mac Fly”, and Hurley, who seems , open to ridicule. <br /> <br /> Ice on the cake: Danny Elfman deserved the main title, and, like any other great composer, you recognize his “voice” before he was credited.
