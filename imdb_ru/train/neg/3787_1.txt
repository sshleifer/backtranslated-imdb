I must be the only guy in America who didn’t like this movie. I think it’s just not my style or something, I just don’t see what is so exciting about it, it was * hardly interesting, not to mention one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. <br /> <br /> This is about a guy who came out of nothing and became a drug lord. A fairly simple way to describe the entire movie, and this is exactly what I feel about the entire movie. Contrary to what many people think, simply because a film about mafia / drug trafficking / criminal gangs does not automatically make it great, do not forget about good storytelling.
