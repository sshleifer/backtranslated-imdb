I so much want to put this piece of GARBAGE to zero, unfortunately, it is not there, so I had to give it 1, just to warn you about how stupidly awful this impostor from a famous cartoon! The characters look as if they were painted by preschoolers, no, wait, I saw preschoolers achieve more! I prefer Misadventures of Flapjack to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I probably say what others have said, in two words: Disrupt! Remember that episode of Dexter Lab when they were racing on a kart across a volcano? Yes, Mr. Fellows even profited from this idea and failed! They even ripped off Shadow Lugia in the episode that parody Pokemon! (He even profited from this franchise!) This character is a cheap robber of Mandark from Dexter's lab! Mr. Fellows should be held accountable for breaking the law for this piece of shit! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like the Johnny test (RIP-OFF), you just lie to yourself. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this robbery tries to dishonor your screen!
