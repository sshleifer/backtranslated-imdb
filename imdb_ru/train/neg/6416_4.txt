SOME SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> Why do people, when they are disoriented, sick or scared at the club, cut through the middle of a crowded dance floor on the way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in their right mind will hide under the bed when someone breaks into their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a stranger’s door, and when they respond IMMEDIATELY, you open the door, come in, shout a few greetings, and then start looking at their things? <br /> <br /> If someone who you just discovered was a murderer who was stalking you, what would you do? Quietly sneaking and hiding under a wooden platform or among metal tools? Run, of course, calmly, to the old barn or another decrepit structure? <br /> <br /> I could talk about almost any thriller that came out in the last few years, but since this is the “Return” page, obviously, I'm talking about “The Return”. I saw it for free, because I work in a movie theater and am going to show all the “scary” movies. I thought it was tolerable ... except for worn cliches. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really grayish and looks like "Eh?" through most of the movie. The details of the plot slowly unfold as the film progresses, and this is almost enough to make it interesting, except that there was not enough explanation as it progressed, and so I was almost lost to the last 2/3 of it. <Br /> <br /> If you are a devoted fan of thrillers, you should look at least once. If there is nothing better in the theater, and you really want to watch a movie, I think it is worth the morning ticket. If you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie, and you can't wait ... wait.
