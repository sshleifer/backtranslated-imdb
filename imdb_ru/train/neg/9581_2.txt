This is the only thing I can say positively about this film. Cleveland is a star, I was there and never saw a city look so good. Beautiful river and cityscapes. <br /> <br /> This film is moving so fast that they hope that you will not notice the lack of relevance in the real world. People run and shoot weapons without any consequences. For example, there was a shootout in the house of character Rob Lowe - two cars were stolen, and yet the police did not appear there much later in the film. Murder for hire never looked so implausible. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this film should be on the receiving side of one of the many meaningless bullets. Many of the actors in this film are much better than this one. I check the date of the film to make sure that it was not written during the strike of the writers, but alas, it is not. This film currently revolves on Universal’s HD channel - if you don’t want to drool over Low, there’s no reason to watch it.
