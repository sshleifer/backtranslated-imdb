In this unforgettable little thing, 40-year-old Norma Shearer plays a tremulous little girl from Monte Carlo who finds herself in a fight between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the failure of this film in a dull, talkative script or directed by George Cukore, who seems never to be interested in reviving the overall comatose state of the film. Mostly, however, this is the fault of the Shearer herself, who desperately wanted to continue playing the “young” roles until she could get away with it. By negligence, this makes her “Cardboard Lover” a strange monument to the aging woman’s vanity.
