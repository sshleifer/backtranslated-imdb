Today I wrote this review in a rage by Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has created films based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 has changed everything. This has changed our perception of security. This has changed our understanding of the evil of man and mankind. Most important and destructive, it changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I canâ€™t help but stress how badly repulsed, disappointed and angry I am in the careless, blatant ignorance of Hollywood, seeking to make a profitable profit. from death and destruction. This film and others like it will surely cause controversial reviews among viewers and critics; will certainly be supported by the mainstream press. Hollywood fell to a new low. Even below the base bastards who have committed the most barbaric acts of cruelty and unrelenting cruelty. Uwe Boll is behind all this. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they neglect the memories of the families of the victims? How dare they scoff at the lives of brave men and women who risked their lives to save those who were trapped in doomed towers on that fateful day of shame?!?!? How dare they try to make fun and at the same time benefit from the national tragedy in the mist of a mournful and tired world after 911?!?!?! How ... dare ... they? <br /> <br /> To those who have the desire to even think about seeing this morally horrific parody, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Remember this day and ask yourself if you really are a normal and moral person. Remember that day, ask yourself whether this film is a disgrace and dishonor of the lives lost that day. Remember this day of protest of loved ones families. Remember that day the deaths of people on these two plans. Remember the further slaughter he caused after the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect the memories of the lives lost in the 911 year without seeing this film at all.
