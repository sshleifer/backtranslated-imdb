Radar People from the Moon - a fairly typical fare of the 1950s. The special effects are pretty cheap, lunar rovers, obviously, excess World War II jeeps with painted plywood over them and the like. The game is only so-so. It inspires the imagination of the children to whom I believe it was directed. By today's standards, it's boring, cheap, and bad. In the first 9 episodes of natural disasters, there is also a huge amount of video.
