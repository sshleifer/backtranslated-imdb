I have never been to Paris, but after watching "Paris, Je t'aime" I'm going crazy to visit this city! I have been to New York several times, and I love the city and its districts. I kind of expected that this film would be touched by me, and I want to jump on the plane and fly there at once, but, oh, a miracle, I regret the time and money spent. There are no love stories between people or man and the city. There are a lot of non-working meetings and relationships or people who know each other, and it just does not work well. Perhaps this reflects the characteristic feature of the city, where, as they say, thousands of people live on their own. Can't you find love in New York?
