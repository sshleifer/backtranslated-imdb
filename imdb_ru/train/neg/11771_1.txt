This was shown at the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, although for reasons that would be better left to the authorities, which will be. It seems that a lot has been done due to the fact that this is the first film in Thai, filmed with the participation of Thai actors and film crew, but filmed by a director from the West. No need to worry, honestly, since this film is boring, boring, boring. Why hint at something, why hide an idea in secret, why subtly evoke a feeling, when you can discard the point of view with horrible voices, obvious shots and contrived scenes Spurrier clumsily produces endless clichés. No hints, no assumptions, all on the screen, no need to use our imagination. I wonder when the “scary” bit comes? No, you do not want to, because the soundtrack will become more and more frightening, rising to an ominous crescendo. Hell, I write words to describe how bad it is. Interesting, real or imaginary demon? Why taxing yourself is really a snake, and yes, she does bite her crotch, and blood splatters everywhere. This is a strange, difficult film for several reasons. It should be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the shaking is marked and obvious. This may be a brutal attack on the more severe side of Thailand, but the director behaves indecently, relish when it comes to showing barely pubescent teenagers. Maybe it was the Westerner himself who took away her virginity, who sowed the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe it was all just pants. Dull, tasteless, repetitive, hackneyed - all candidates for the best description, but boring seems most appropriate and honest. All of this has been seen before, perhaps better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or a flash. Sorry. Thumbs down on every score. Really terrible
