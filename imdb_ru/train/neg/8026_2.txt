It makes you wonder how this show is still on the air. There was one couple who stayed together, married and has children, but all the others broke up. What is the point to continue this? The show can be interesting in the beginning. You see how all the girls faint because of one man, which almost everyone likes instantly. It's like in real life! Girls start to take sides, quarrel with each other and show their true “I” (or we think so). But one person remains to decide whom to choose, in his opinion, he will be able to marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What is true love? How can you fall in love with someone when you have to choose them? This show is incredible. You thought dating online was bad, but people had to go on TV to find love? This is not real. How can a girl be with a man when he meets with several others, communicating with them? None of these questions have an answer, and finally, when the show is over, you know that there will be no happy ending in the future. As far as we know, everything is written in the script.
