Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I looked into my little Comcastic box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. He says that the director has a cult following in the description. Funny how that doesn't warn me not to watch this movie. I could use this tip. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is similar to Troll 2 in the sense that it is completely incorrectly named. He has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) in common with zombies, and everything happens in one city. This film revolves around a scammer who acts as badly as possible (he should try to suck so much), while he arrests women for nonsense and then kills them. Yeah, he's a serial cop killer. Not only is this film wrong, thinking that this is a film about zombies, it is also completely mistaken in its facts about serial killers. Serial killers like to kill, they live for it, and they put up with it. This guy knocks out women and injects them poison. He does not even have sex with a corpse and does not dismember him. Talk about boring! In the end, one of the colossal five women he kills got Voodoo protection, and for no apparent reason, all five come to life and go to kill this guy. They were all buried or thrown into the ocean, but you wonâ€™t find out if they buy sharp, clean clothes that they all wear. Women then act very badly and take revenge. Oh yeah. <br /> <br /> This movie was crap in all categories. Shit, shit essay, trashy sets and trashy makeup effects. Women do not look like zombies, unless you find really dark makeup around the eyes a de facto definition of what a zombie does. They can all talk, behave, think and behave quite humanly. The blood is weak compared even with many PG-13 films, and naked is not far off. You see a glimpse of the chest in the opening sequence ... Then exactly the same breasts later! Go figure it out. I guess only one actress was ready to go topless for this trite. The police station is so poorly designed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse in which they are obviously being removed. You can see pipes, poor lighting, excessively rare settings, and even if you are not blind, you can see that the director is failing. Stay away, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
