This is a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Well, for people a good realistic film is good. For me, this is not the case. Life is also predictable, bad, nasty, banal, sometimes meaningless. Perhaps this is why people say that this film is real. <br /> <br /> Too many common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are doomed and damned, whatever you do, you will end up shooting or someone will be shot; Do not let children play with weapons; this can be dangerous. and then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> I haven’t seen such a bad movie before. Perhaps that is why I never noticed how important photography itself is in cinema. In this, every scene shot in the afternoon, on the street, is clearly and annoyingly blue. They did not even want to correct the color balance. Oh! At the moment I have “rated” more than 300 films in this database, and this (3/10) is my lowest figure ever.
