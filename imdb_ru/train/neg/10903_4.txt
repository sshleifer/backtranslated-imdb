Rob Schneider is a famous comedian because of his movements, face masks, and “not human” speeches. This time he is a beast. Marvin is a loser who is trying to become a hero, and one day no one answers the call of the person being attacked, so Marvin must take this case and save the assailant. But on the way to the crime scene, he falls by car and suffers serious damage. He does not remember what is happening, and the next ordinary day his life is not the same when he finds out that he has animal instincts. Of course, we have a woman that our main character is trying to achieve, but his attempts are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. Negative is fate if I could use this metaphor. Marvin must figure out how to become a normal person again. By the way - his animal instincts help him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so-so. The film is so unreal that at some moments it becomes stupid, but this is one of those films that, as I wrote above, is called meaningless fun. So watch him in the monkey style of Rob Schneider, but this is definitely not one of the best comedies or the best movie in which Schneider appears. He is a great comedian, but this is not his best movie.
