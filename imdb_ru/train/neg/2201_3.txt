Horror / fantasy, which is interesting, as it is ridiculous. F / X is pretty good ... for what you manage to see. Created for a television thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant, albeit erroneous scientist who intervenes in stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with a hammerhead shark. The horrific results give rise to one damn killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to test a new brilliant experiment. Of course, after laughing and locking in fear ... Coombs' creation, by the way, his own son, merged with the hammerhead, is released to track down one by one of his father's colleagues. Revenge is not always helpful. Also starring: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
