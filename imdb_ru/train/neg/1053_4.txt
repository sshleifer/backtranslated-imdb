A bizarre look at the tale of Cinderella. Terribly bad scenario, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent evil stepmother. <br /> <br /> Visually amazing in some parts, but that's all. Period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Go ahead until you see something interesting, and save yourself all the 90 minutes of idleness. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story, I suggest “Ever After: Cinderella Story” or “Glass Slipper”.
