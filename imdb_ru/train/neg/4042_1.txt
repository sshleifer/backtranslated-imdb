It is a pleasure to watch this film, but it’s like watching a really bad experimental theater. The plot (if any) does not make any sense. But it is very "artistic." Many shots of half-dressed actors fighting and looking into each other’s eyes. Many skillful shots through the windows and with people from the frame. He mumbles and people roam wistfully. Protracted close-ups of faces and bodies. By the time the three of you get on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY at the screen. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be a father-son relationship, but you just want two of them to just fuck each other and end this. If you always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any cash shots, your desire was granted.
