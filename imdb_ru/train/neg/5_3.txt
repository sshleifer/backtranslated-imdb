I basically flipped through the movie, but that was enough to see the plot. To tell you the truth, I was bored, and in some places it did not make sense. The only reason I watched this movie was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He is so hot, but in this film his hair was strange. But still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot is not so bad, but what really turned me over was the fact that they swear like every sentence. Is it really so difficult to express your anger without uttering the word “F” every time? The kingdom was annoying, and the whole thing screaming, trembling from the camera thing caused me a headache. <br /> <br /> Overall, although the plot was fine. I found the film dull and dramatic. That's why I only do the scenes with CHACE. LOL In any case, renting is not worth it, unless you are a dedicated fan of a particular actor like me. Oh yes, the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT !!! But CHASE BEST !!
