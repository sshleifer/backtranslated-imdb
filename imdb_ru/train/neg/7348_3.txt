I was very disappointed with this movie. The first Waters film I saw was Serial Mom, and I liked it. Then I saw Pecker and I liked it. Then I watched Polyester and really hated it. The only thing I liked about this movie is DIVINE. She / he is damn talented. I was really surprised. In general, I would not recommend this movie ...
