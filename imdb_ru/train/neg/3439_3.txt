***** probably minor spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can not say that I liked it, but I can not say that I did not ... this is very strange. There are bad things in it, such as, for example, a shark, which appeared out of nowhere with the worst CGI that you can imagine, if I were the director, I would definitely cut out this part, make me stop watching the rest of the movie. For some people, it will be boring, because he lacks action, sometimes he feels at home ... Take, for example, the scene in which one of his friends died, and what do they do next time, what? no, I'm not crying ... scary stories telling each other ... * sighs * (right after crying about the lost) <br /> <br /> Another nonsense was when they were talking in a boat that they liked "hundreds" of candles on the table in front of them ... some rag curtains (old rags covering the windows) and sofas / sofas surround the boat ... I thought it was stupid to use candles but not think about the surroundings, except alone in the open sea ... <br /> <br /> Well, some scary scenes that they did well, I liked some s. Sometimes horror works better when it’s hidden, when it’s hidden behind something, instead of showing it, so this film does it well, maybe because its budget is small, I don’t know, but it works great for me! You will feel tense if you forget some holes like the ones I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much of this! but if you like any movie, watch this movie, have patience and try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry for my rude English) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
