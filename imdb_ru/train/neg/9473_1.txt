As a veteran of many, many pretentious French films, I thought I had taken the worst that the industry could offer and was able to digest anything. But not this. It is senseless, ruthless, cruel, unpleasant, senseless ... The film has nothing to offer, and this is random hatred and aggression, dressed in pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
