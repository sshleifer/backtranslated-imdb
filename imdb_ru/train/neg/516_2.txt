Have you ever noticed how in his later films Burt Reynolds’s laugh sounds like a squeal of brakes? <br /> <br /> He must have hung out too often with Hal Needham. <br /> <br /> And, apparently, Ace’s Stroker is too much. <br /> <br /> Can you believe it was based on a book? I couldn’t, but it was So, and probably not a bestseller, I bet. <br /> <br /> Bert is another good old man in the NASCAR chain who links Beatty as a magnate with fried chicken with designs in his team. Anderson talks about his love interests, and Kuts makes an impression of his 100th Homer Pyle as a loyal mechanic / Lags best friend. <br /> <br /> Many here are friends with Bert or Hal. Others must have needed to work Those. And even real NASCAR drivers take part in the action and hope that they will have more talents than those who have SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As for laughter, Bubba Smith (before the Police Academy ") Gets them as Beattie's chauffeur. And Petersen, in full Elvira mode, gets many grateful looks as a lady who really wants to get to know Lags. REAL GOOD. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Bert spent so much time and effort in a movie like "Stroker Ace", where it doesn't matter whether he is tired of acting or not. They did not bother to write a character for him, why play? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for Petersen and for outs at the end. Now they are funny.
