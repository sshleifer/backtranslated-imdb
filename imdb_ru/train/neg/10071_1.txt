I saw this movie at the premiere of the Sundance 09 movie. <br /> <br /> Since “American Beauty” is a film that has something to say, I had hopes for “The Towel.” Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of the countless films I have seen at almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towel is the only Sundance film I have ever wanted to leave early. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the Towel is so obvious that it comes from a collection of “provocative” concepts relating to cultural stereotypes, and not from an organic human drama. The script comes from the eponymous novel by Alicia Erian. Edith Wharton's famous quote comes to mind: I never knew a novel that would be good enough to be good, despite the fact that it was adapted to the political views of the author. This observation is especially destructive for The Towel, because its political views are so stale and simplistic. If there ever was a time when the white male villains of Towelhead, indulgent images of black people, ironic treatment of foreign cultures, etc. were fresh, this is long gone. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost everyone appreciates this film badly and exposes the small and manipulative tissues on which it is based. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem to be more fooled. Reading the reviews on this and similar sites, you often come up with an excellent degree: "stunning", "breathtaking", "deep", "shocking" ... I am ashamed to read them, but it is not. Surprise me. Indeed, I have met many people who seem to consider any book or film dedicated to racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues to be deeply touching, thought-provoking, full of deep insight. If you are such a person, by all means, rent a Towelhead and be touched by it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely switch to this one.
