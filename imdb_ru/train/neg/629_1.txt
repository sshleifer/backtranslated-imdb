I desperately want to give this film 10 ... I really do. Some films, especially horror films, are so budgetary that they are good. A wise stuffed ninja who can use corn cobs as a deadly weapon ... definitely fits this budget for shine. The depth of the film is definitely his strong point, and his twists and turns, which he realizes, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, really set in motion an eerie ... ninja ... puberty ... until a thirty-year student ... drawings ... wise jokes ... a scarecrow of a son in the center of attention like a creepy horror icon of the year. All I can really say is: “Can you dig it up” and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you like this funny horror. <br /> <br /> (WHAT, HELL, THEY HAVE SMOKED!? ')
