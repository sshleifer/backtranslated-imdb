I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan really made an effort in his game. Everything else in this film is extremely amateur. Everything related to the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only does the director have to rethink his career for life, but maybe she should watch a few films. Since Dominic Monaghan is a very trustworthy actor, placing him in a film of this magnitude makes him look terrible. Whoever the "actor" who played Jack's best friend, he never had to stand in front of the camera. I didnâ€™t expect much from such a small film, but maybe you need to spend a little more time and effort on the characters and their surroundings. Do not waste your time and money on this film (like me), you will be very disappointed.
