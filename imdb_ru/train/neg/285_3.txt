This is not really about gymnastics; swap training montages, and it might as well be archery, or microbiology, or a falsification tournament. Instead, like all the other Rocky / Flashdance derivatives that flooded the market of the 80s, it’s about overcoming adversity with the help of the do-it-yourself principle, making all social / personal realities irrelevant to your loneliness - with love interest standing on side, of course. Ronald Reagan top down, in short; so, as part of the movie, it all depends on the details. Some of the actors are bizarre enough to liven up the events - especially the love interest you have as none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves warming up for Ted; The hateful girlfriend, heroine Olivia D'Abo, and the half-sister with big hair are more interesting than the sick mother or her completely inert German bitches / teammates, one of whom seems to be made of porcelain. This is my instinct to be shocked by the black guys from the comics, but on the other hand, at least they are in the film. But D'Abo doesn’t quite convince with his awkwardness, and in the absence of any other narrative focus, the lack of interest in gymnastics itself really matters; everything around is just fussing about, and the result of a big tournament is not only predetermined, but everything is performed by an obvious double.
