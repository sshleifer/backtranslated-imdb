I saw this film the other day in the classroom of film schools, and before that I had not seen the film Almodovar, but I expected it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a meaningless film, in which only a couple of laughter and two hours of pure boredom mixed up. “High Heels” is just a collection of random scenes that could work in individual films, but together they don’t make up any meaningful whole at all. <br /> <br /> Or so I thought. Then, the next day, my film teacher taught the entire lesson, explaining all the hidden little details of the film, such as a mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers against a transvestite scene, is a kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation developed under the rule of the fascists . Apparently, the whole film is full of ingenious visual tricks and similar links. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? This is still a bad movie. To make a good film you need more than depth and complexity - you still need to give the audience a reason to keep focusing, something to interest the viewer enough to actually take care of all the subtle tricks. High heels give us strange, unusual characters, but keep them in everyday situations, reworked from other films, and Almodovar does not seem to use them to attach any importance. What is the meaning, for example, of the unexpected revelation of Hitchcock that occurs at the end of the film? Why is it even there? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is one funny scene related to the news broadcast. And that's all, this is the only interesting point. The rest of the film is just meaningless cinematic links and visual cues, which obviously exist only to show us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But regardless of what my film professor says, you need more than just self-indulgence in order for a film to be good.
